The effects of the number of revolutions (N = 1–5 turns), applied pressure (2.5–10 GPa), and temperature (298–473 K) on densification and structural changes were investigated. The consolidated glassy disks showed an excellent hardness of ~5.2 GPa although a mechanical softening effect along with fragmentation in the center of HPT disks occurred at N > 3 by a couple of branching cracks. The HPT process at higher applied pressures improved the bulk density and inter-particulate bonding, resulting in higher hardness. Increasing the temperature of HPT processing enhanced the densification and deep drawability of the consolidated metallic glass. Although the HPT process did not change the crystallization temperature of the metallic glass powders, it increased the crystallization enthalpy, suggesting the free volume increase and inhibition of a significant nanocrystallization during the HPT process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3abranching 3abulk density 3acopper 3acrystallization 3aenthalpy 3aglass 3ahardness 3anickel 3apowders 3atemperature 3atitanium 3azirconium1 aJoo, S.-H.1 aLee, J.

These bacteria cause yield loss during cultivation and storage, and can be transmitted to the next generations through seed tubers. The prevalence of Pectobacterium atrosepticum has decreased over the last 20 years in Europe in favour of Dickeya solani and P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense. Twenty-six diploid interspecific Solanum hybrids, previously selected for tuber resistance to P. atrosepticum, were screened for resistance to a highly aggressive D. solani strain in terms of tuber and blackleg reaction. The bacterial strain used for inoculation was characterised by a relatively high optimal growth temperature in vitro, ranging from 33 to 35 °C. Twenty-four diploid clones did not differ in terms of tuber reaction to inoculation with this strain of bacteria in comparison with the clone USA 249, which is the somatic hybrid of S. brevidens (+) S. tuberosum with proven resistance to Pectobacterium. Seventeen clones performed significantly better in terms of blackleg resistance than the resistant potato cultivar Glada. Eleven of the selected diploids produced unreduced gametes, which allows their use in improving the resistance of tetraploid potatoes to diseases caused by bacteria of both Pectobacterium and Dickeya.  aPublisher supplied data  a56cMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development 3aDickeya solani 3aPectobacterium carotovorum 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3apotatoes 3aresearch 3atemperature 3atetraploidy 3aEurope1 aWasilewicz-Flis, Iwona1 aMańkowski, Dariusz0 tPotato research.g2021 Sept., v. 64, no. 3 p.375-385dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl47412x0014-30657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-020-09482-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171300001600268500001900284520121200303592002801515650002401543650003001567650001101597650001301608650002901621650001101650650001701661650001101678650002201689650001401711650001001725650002501735650001801760651001001778653001401788653001101802653001801813653002001831700002101851700002401872773011001896856008502006852000902091655001202100IND60693152520221122145642.0200505e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069315252DNAL7 a10.1080/17583004.2017.13629462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaveenkumar, J.10aBiomass and carbon stocks of a tropical dry forest of the Javadi Hills, Eastern Ghats, India  ap. 351-361.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarbon stocks of woody vegetation were assessed in a tropical dry forest of the Javadi Hills at three elevations (high-elevation forest, HEF; mid-elevation forest, MEF; and low-elevation forest, LEF) by laying 15 square plots of 0.25 ha each. All of the adult trees (≥ 30 cm girth at breast height (GBH)), juvenile trees (≥ 10 to < 30 cm GBH) and lianas (≥ 3 cm girth at 1.37 m from the rooting point) were enumerated and woody biomass was assessed by the non-harvest method. The total tree (juvenile + adult tree) aboveground biomass ranged from 99 to 216 Mg/ha. The liana aboveground biomass ranged from 3.6 to 9.3 Mg/ha. The woody vegetation in the present study sites stocked 53 to 116 Mg/ha of carbon. Adult trees accounted for a maximum share of 94% of woody carbon while lianas and juvenile trees contributed to just 6%. The carbon stock of adult trees and lianas increased with increasing altitude whereas juveniles showed a reverse trend, which could be due to anthropogenic pressures. Human disturbance and cattle grazing should be minimized in the studied tropical dry forest ecosystem to conserve its vanishing natural resources and also to enhance carbon accumulation for the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aadministrative management 3aadults 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3acattle 3aforest ecosystems 3ajuveniles 3atrees 3atropical dry forests 3awoody biomass 3aIndia 0aDiversity 0alianas 0aEastern Ghats 0atropical forest1 aArunkumar, K.

This study examined how macrophage, the primary immune cell type engaging microbes, responded to GO treatment. We uncovered that incubation of macrophage cell RAW264.7 with GO elicited autophagy in a concentration-dependent manner, as evidenced by the appearance of autophagic vacuoles and activation of autophagic marker proteins. Such GO-induced autophagy was observed in various cell lines and in macrophage treated with GO of different sizes. Strikingly, GO treatment of macrophage provoked the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cascades and triggered ensuing cytokine responses. Molecular analysis identified that TLR4 and TLR9 and their downstream signaling mediators MyD88, TRAF6 and NF-κB played pivotal roles in the GO-induced inflammatory responses. By silencing individual genes in the signaling pathway, we further unveiled that the GO-induced autophagy was modulated by TLR4, TLR9 and was dependent on downstream adaptor proteins MyD88, TRIF and TRAF6. Altogether, we demonstrated that GO treatment of cells simultaneously triggers autophagy and TLR4/TLR9-regulated inflammatory responses, and the autophagy was at least partly regulated by the TLRs pathway. This study thus suggests a mechanism by which cells respond to nanomaterials and underscores the importance of future safety evaluation of nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aToll-like receptor 9 3aautophagy 3acytokines 3agenes 3agraphene 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amicroorganisms 3ananomaterials 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3avacuoles1 aYang, Hong-Jie1 aLu, Chia-Hsin1 aChao, Yu-Chan1 aHwang, Shiaw-Min1 aChen, Chiu-Ling1 aLo, Kai-Wei1 aSung, Li-Yu1 aLuo, Wen-Yi1 aTuan, Hsing-Yu1 aHu, Yu-Chen0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Sept., v. 33, no. 27 p.6559-6569dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03750naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245013300177520167900310592002801989650001302017650003102030650001902061650002502080650002202105650001302127650001702140650001302157650001002170650001102180650001302191650002002204650001202224650002002236650001802256650002302274650001802297650002302315650001102338650001402349650000902363650001502372650005302387650004102440650002502481653001202506653003902518653001402557653001202571653001802583653001302601700008002614700002402694700003002718700002502748700007902773700006402852773009302916856008203009852000903091655001203100IND60686614620221116154430.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068661462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiranda, Carolline Santos10aPPAR-α activation counters brown adipose tissue whitening: a comparative study between high-fat– and high-fructose–fed mice  aTo examine the effects of a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-α) agonist treatment on interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) whitening, focusing on thermogenic, lipolysis, and lipid oxidation markers in mice fed a high-fat or high-fructose diet.Fifty animals were randomly assigned to receive a control diet (C, 10% lipids as energy), high-fat diet (HF, 50% lipids as energy), or high-fructose diet (HFRU, 50% fructose as energy) for 12 wk. Each group was redivided to begin the 5-wk treatment, totaling five experimental groups: C, HF, HF-a, HFRU, and HFRU-a. The drug was mixed with diet at the dose of 3.5 mg/kg body mass.HF group was the heaviest group, and the HF and HFRU groups had glucose intolerance. PPAR-α activation alleviated these metabolic constraints. HF and HFRU groups had negative vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) immunostaining, but only the HF group had a pattern of lipid droplet accumulation that resembled the white adipose tissue, characterizing the whitening phenomenon. Whitening in the HF group was accompanied by decreased expression of genes related to thermogenesis, β-oxidation, and antiinflammatory effects. All of them were augmented by the PPAR-α activation in HF-a and HFRU-a groups, countering the whitening in the HF-a group. Treated groups also had a lower respiratory exchange ratio than untreated groups, suggesting that lipids were used as fuel for the enhanced thermogenesis.The PPAR-α agonist countered iBAT whitening by inducing the thermogenic pathway and reducing the lipid droplet size, in addition to enhanced VEGF-A expression, adrenergic stimulus, and lipolysis in HF-fed mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abeta oxidation 3abrown adipose tissue 3acomparative study 3acounters 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3adrugs 3aenergy 3afructose 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aheat production 3ahigh fat diet 3ahigh fructose diet 3alipid content 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3alipolysis 3amice 3aoverweight 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3avascular endothelial growth factor A 3awhite adipose tissue 0aPPAR-α 0aInterscapular brown adipose tissue 0aWhitening 0aObesity 0aThermogenesis 0aFructose1 aMandarim-de-Lacerda, Carlos Alberto,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4134-79781 aSilva-Veiga, Flavia1 aMartins, Fabiane Ferreira1 aRachid, Tamiris Lima1 aMandarim-De-Lacerda, Carlos Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4134-79781 aSouza-Mello, Vanessa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2510-95690 tNutrition.g2020 Oct., v. 78 p.110791-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245019500171300001400366520201600380592002802396650002502424650001702449650001402466650000902480650001502489650001402504650001302518650002502531650002902556650004402585653003002629653002302659653000902682653004802691653002202739653002602761700005802787700002702845773011202872856008402984852000903068655001203077IND60599229720221120205428.0180702e20141024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059922972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2014.08.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAstefanei, Alina10aAnalysis of C60-fullerene derivatives and pristine fullerenes in environmental samples by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–atmospheric pressure photoionization-mass spectrometry  ap. 61-71.  aIn this work, a method is proposed for the simultaneous analysis of several pristine fullerenes (C60, C70, C76, C78, and C84) and three C60-fullerene derivatives (N-methyl fulleropyrrolidine, [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid butyl ester) in environmental samples. The method involves the use of ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry (UHPLC–APPI-MS) and allowed the chromatographic separation in less than 4.5min. The product ions from tandem mass spectrometry studies of fullerene derivatives were characterized and the most abundant one (m/z 720), corresponding to [C60]⁻, was selected for quantitation. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM at 0.7m/z FWHM) by acquiring two transitions using both isotopic cluster ions [M]⁻ and [M+1]⁻ as precursor ions was proposed for quantitation and confirmation purposes. For pristine fullerenes, highly selective selected ion monitoring (H-SIM) acquisition mode by monitoring the isotopic cluster ions [M]⁻ and [M+1]⁻ was used. Pressurized solvent extraction conditions were optimized in order to improve recoveries of the studied fullerene compounds from sediment samples. Values up to 87–92% for C60-fullerene derivatives and lower but still acceptable, 70–80%, for pristine fullerenes were obtained. Method limits of quantitation (MLOQs) ranging from 1.5pgL⁻¹ to 5.5ngL⁻¹ in water samples and from 0.1ngkg⁻¹ to 523ngkg⁻¹ in sediments were obtained with good precision (relative standard deviations always lower than 13%). The applicability of the developed method was evaluated by analyzing several environmental samples such as sediments and pond water and the detected levels for C60-fullerene derivatives were of 0.1–2.7ngkg⁻¹ and 1.5–8.5pgL⁻¹, respectively. C60 and C70 were the only pristine fullerenes detected in the analyzed samples (0.1–7.2ngkg⁻¹ in sediments and 9–330pgL⁻¹ in water pond samples).  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3abutyric acid 3afullerene 3aions 3amonitoring 3asediments 3asolvents 3astatistical analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aC60-fullerene derivatives 0aPristine fullerene 0aAPPI 0aUltrahigh performance liquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aEnvironmental samples1 aNuñez, Oscar,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5850-89721 aGalceran, Maria Teresa0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Oct. 24, v. 1365 p.61-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.08.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245010100211300001600312520113200328592002801460650002101488650002701509650001801536650002001554650001601574650001601590650001601606650002001622650004201642650001701684650001801701650002901719650001601748650001901764650001601783650000901799650001301808650001601821650001501837700003001852700002301882700001501905700001901920700002901939700001901968700002601987773008902013856008202102990002302184852000902207655001202216IND60092876220221121221003.0141103e20120803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009287622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2012.04.0242doi7 aPMC34132002pmcid7 a228629452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesterterp, Marit10aRegulation of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Mobilization by Cholesterol Efflux Pathways  ap. 195-206.  aIntact cholesterol homeostasis helps to maintain hematopoietic stem and multipotential progenitor cell (HSPC) quiescence. Mice with defects in cholesterol efflux pathways due to deficiencies of the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 displayed a dramatic increase in HSPC mobilization and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Increased extramedullary hematopoiesis was associated with elevated serum levels of G-CSF due to generation of IL-23 by splenic macrophages and dendritic cells. This favored hematopoietic lineage decisions toward granulocytes rather than macrophages in the bone marrow leading to impaired support for osteoblasts and decreased Cxcl12/SDF-1 production by mesenchymal progenitors. Greater HSPC mobilization and extramedullary hematopoiesis were reversed by raising HDL levels in Abca1⁻/⁻Abcg1⁻/⁻ and Apoe⁻/⁻ mice or in a mouse model of myeloproliferative neoplasm mediated by Flt3-ITD mutation. Our data identify a role of cholesterol efflux pathways in the control of HSPC mobilization. This may translate into therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis and hematologic malignancies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanimal models 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3abone marrow 3acholesterol 3adendritic cells 3agranulocyte colony-stimulating factor 3agranulocytes 3ahematopoiesis 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahomeostasis 3ainterleukin-23 3amacrophages 3amice 3amutation 3aosteoblasts 3astem cells1 aGourion-Arsiquaud, Samuel1 aMurphy, Andrew J.1 aShih, Alan1 aCremers, Serge1 aLevine, Rossq(Ross L.),1 aTall, Alan R.,1 aYvan-Charvet, Laurent0 tCell stem cell.g2012 Aug. 3, v. 11, no. 2 p.195-206dElsevier Inc.x1934-59097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2012.04.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011800161300002000279520141000299592002801709650001501737650001001752650001701762650002101779650001901800650002101819650001301840650001401853650002101867653003501888653002101923653003201944653003301976653001902009700001602028700001502044700005602059700001702115700001302132700001302145700001702158700005302175700001502228773014202243856007802385852000902463655001202472IND60642721120221119022418.0190508e20190417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064272112DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b025972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wansu10aFacial Control Intramolecular Charge Transfer of Quinoid Conjugated Polymers for Efficient in Vivo NIR-II Imaging  ap. 16311-16319.  aLow-band gap conjugated polymers with donor–acceptor (D–A) structures have emerged as second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence probes for biological imaging. However, how to control the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) to maintain the low band gap and improve the NIR-II fluorescence intensity is an urgent issue. Here, the quinoid polymers have been developed to effectively regulate the ICT for brighter NIR-II fluorescence signals. Thiophene repeat chain units of different lengths (T, 2T, and 3T) were utilized to link with electron-withdrawing ester-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) to alter the density of the electron-withdrawing side groups for controlling the ICT. By increasing the thiophene chain length from TT-T to TT-3T, the density of the electron-withdrawing groups decreased and the ICT was weakened. In the case of NIR absorption and NIR-II emission, weakened ICT leads to brighter NIR-II fluorescence. After the preparation of the water-soluble quinoid polymer probes (CPs), TT-3T CPs with weak ICT exhibited the brightest NIR-II fluorescent signals among the three quinoid polymer probes. Several NIR-II biomedical imaging applications, including in vivo cell tracking, blood vascular system images, and lymphatic drainage mapping, show that the TT-3T CP-based nanoprobe had excellent characteristics of long-term stability and high NIR-II spatial resolutions in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ablood 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3alymphatic system 3apolymers 3athiophene 3awater solubility 0aintramolecular charge transfer 0aquinoid polymers 0aelectron-withdrawing groups 0aenhanced NIR-II fluorescence 0aNIR-II Imaging1 aHuang, Ting1 aLi, Jiewei1 aSun, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7412-51541 aWang, Yufeng1 aShi, Wei1 aHan, Wei1 aWang, Wenjun1 aFan, Quli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9387-01651 aHuang, Wei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 17, v. 11, no. 18 p.16311-16319dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b025973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010400177300001600281520137300297592002801670650002901698650001701727650001301744650001001757650001401767650002501781650002301806650002101829650001001850650001401860650001601874650000901890650001301899650001501912650001201927650001101939700002001950773008901970856008502059852000902144655001202153IND60112447820221118042435.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011244782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUbonrat Siripatrawan,10aActive film from chitosan incorporating green tea extract for shelf life extension of pork sausages  ap. 102-108.  aChitosan film incorporating green tea extract (CGT-film) was used as active packaging for shelf life extension of pork sausages. The physical, chemical, microbiological, and sensory qualities of pork sausages wrapped with CGT-film were compared with those wrapped with chitosan-alone film (C-film) and those without chitosan film wrapping (control). Changes in the qualities of pork sausages including color, texture, lipid oxidation with respect to thiobarbituric value (TBA), and microbiological qualities including total plate counts, yeasts and molds, and lactic acid bacteria were determined throughout the storage at 4°C. The sensory qualities including odor, color, slime formation, and overall acceptability were evaluated using Quantitative Descriptive Analysis. It was found that samples wrapped with CGT-film showed lower changes in color, texture, TBA value, microbial growth, and sensory characteristics than those wrapped with C-film and control, respectively. Successful inhibition of lipid oxidation and microbial growth in the refrigerated pork sausages was possible with chitosan film incorporating green tea extract. The results suggested that incorporation of green tea extract into chitosan film could enhance the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the film and thus maintained the qualities and prolonged the shelf life of the sausages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3achitosan 3acolor 3agreen tea 3alactic acid bacteria 3alipid peroxidation 3amicrobial growth 3aodors 3apackaging 3aplate count 3apork 3asausages 3ashelf life 3atexture 3ayeasts1 aNoipha, Suparat0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2012 May, v. 27, no. 1 p.102-108dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245011700178300001800295520084900313592002801162650001301190650003001203650001101233650001901244650001201263650001301275650001601288653001201304653001301316653001001329653003101339653001301370700002201383773013201405856008501537852000901622655001201631IND60745770420221119081323.0210727e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074577042DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2020.18099092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhajeh-Khalili, Farzad12aA novel wearable wideband antenna for application in wireless medical communication systems with jeans substrate  ap. 1266-1272.  aIn this paper, a novel wearable wideband antenna for application in wireless medical communication systems (0.9–6 GHz) is designed.

With the help of the proposed method, the bandwidth has been increased by about 3 GHz in comparison with the conventional one. The antenna dimensions are 60 × 48 × 0.8 mm³ or 0.72 × 0.57 × 0.009 λg ³ where λg is the guided wavelength at 2.4 GHz.

The present study focuses on the aggregation mechanism used by the necrophagous larvae of Lucilia sericata Meigen, the common green bottle fly. The ability of single larva to detect and follow a signal (trail) created by conspecifics is investigated initially. A circular ring is drawn in a Petri dish where 20 starved larvae have crawled for a period of 30 min. A naïve (test) larva is then placed in the dish and video‐tracked. Naïve larvae are able to detect the boundaries of the larvae‐crawled area and stay preferentially within this conspecific‐marked zone. In a second step, the orientation of larvae by scanning, a dedicated, ground‐signal detection behaviour of dipteran larvae, is analyzed. Four experimental conditions are tested: control, presence of food, conspecifics, and food + conspecifics. When conspecifics have been previously present in a given area, the scanning behaviour by naïve larvae in this area decreases (both in number and frequency of scans). Accordingly, scanning by necrophagous larvae of L. sericata should be considered not only as locomotion behaviour, but also as a potential way to detect signals from conspecifics for the purpose of aggregation. The chemical composition of the attractant(s), the behavioural effects (attraction or retention) and the implication of larval signalling in the aggregation process are new fields to explore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLucilia sericata 3achemical composition 3aenzymes 3ainsect larvae 3alocomotion 3aparasites 3apredators 3atemperature1 aBetremieux, Cécile1 aHédouin, Valéry1 aCharabidzé, Damien0 tPhysiological entomology.g2015 Dec., v. 40, no. 4 p.317-324dThe Royal Entomological Societyx0307-69627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phen.121173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245014300157300002000300520134000320592002801660650002101688650003101709650002901740650002601769650001301795650002501808650001501833650001701848650001701865650001401882650001701896650001401913650004801927650001101975650001401986650001702000650001402017653002402031653001302055653003402068653001702102653001202119700001702131700001802148700005502166773014202221856007802363852000902441655001202450IND60642721220221119022103.0190508e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064272122DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b026432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qi10aAmino Acid-Modified Conjugated Oligomer Self-Assembly Hydrogel for Efficient Capture and Specific Killing of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria  ap. 16320-16327.  aBacterial infection is one of main causes that threaten global human health. Especially, antibiotic-resistant bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) lead to high mortality rate and more expensive treatment cost. Here, a novel amino-acid-modified conjugated oligomer OTE-d-Phe was synthesized by modifying the side chain of conjugated oligo(thiophene ethynylene) with d-phenylalanine. By mixing 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-l-phenylalanin (Fmoc-l-Phe) with OTE-d-Phe, a new and biocompatible low-molecular weight hydrogel (HG-2) was prepared through self-assembly. In solution, HG-2 can effectively capture bacteria spontaneously, such as Escherichia coli and MRSA. Most importantly, the hydrogel has specific and strong antibacterial activity against MRSA over methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and E. coli. Interestingly, when the hydrogel was put on a model surface, a piece of cloth, it also is able to selectively kill MRSA with low cell cytotoxicity. The antibacterial mechanism was investigated, and it demonstrated that the HG-2 interacts with and physically breaks the cell wall and membrane, which leads to MRSA death. Therefore, this new conjugated oligomer-based hydrogel provides promising applications in disinfection and therapy of MRSA in hospital and in community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acell walls 3acytotoxicity 3adisinfection 3ahospitals 3ahuman health 3ahydrogels 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amodels 3amortality 3atherapeutics 3athiophene 0aconjugated oligomer 0ahydrogel 0aantibiotic-resistant bacteria 0aantibacteria 0acapture1 aZhao, Yantao1 aLu, Zhuanning1 aTang, Yanli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9979-68080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 11, no. 18 p.16320-16327dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b026433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012300178300001600301500001900317520143000336592002801766650001101794650001901805650001101824650001701835653002101852653002201873653002801895653001801923653002901941700001801970700001601988773011002004856008502114852000902199655001202208IND60693152820221122220243.0200505e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069315282DNAL7 a10.1080/17583004.2017.13865332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazhar, Muhammad Usman10aCritical success factors for embedding carbon management in organizations: lessons from the UK higher education sector  ap. 379-392.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganizations are under increasing pressure from governments and stakeholders to reduce carbon emissions from their business operations for climate change mitigation. Universities are not exempt from this challenge and are operating in a complex external environment, not least responding to the UK government's Climate Change Act 2008 (80% carbon reductions by 2050 as per 1990 baseline). In 2012–2013, the UK Higher Education (HE) sector consumed 7.9 billion kWh of energy and produced 2.3 million tonnes of carbon emissions. This indicates the scale of the challenge and carbon management is central to reduce carbon emissions. However, effective processes for implementing and embedding carbon management in organizations in general, and universities in particular, have yet to be realized. This paper explores the critical success factors (CSFs) for embedding carbon management in universities and, more widely, in organizations. This exploratory study adopted a mixed-methods approach including the content analysis of universities' carbon management plans alongside semi-structured interviews in the UK HE sector. The paper identifies six key factors for successfully embedding carbon management that are pertinent not just for the HE sector, but to organizations broadly: senior management leadership; funding and resources; stakeholder engagement; planning; governance and management; and evaluation and reporting.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3astakeholders 0aCarbon emissions 0acarbon management 0ahigher education sector 0aorganizations 0acritical success factors1 aBull, Richard1 aLemon, Mark0 tCarbon management.g2017 Nov. 2, v. 8, no. 5-6 p.379-392dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2218x1758-30127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2017.13865333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015100175300001600326520173200342592002802074650001302102650001502115650001202130650001502142650001202157650005302169650001102222650001102233650002002244650001002264650002302274650002202297650002602319650001702345650003702362650001402399650003102413653005302444653001602497653002502513653001202538700002002550700002102570773011402591856008402705852000902789655001202798IND60599229920221120183405.0180702e20141017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059922992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2014.08.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeggler, Benedikt A.10aAdvanced scripting for the automated profiling of two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry data from combustion aerosol  ap. 241-248.  aMultidimensional gas chromatography is an appropriate tool for the non-targeted and comprehensive characterisation of complex samples generated from combustion processes. Particulate matter (PM) emission is composed of a large number of compounds, including condensed semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). However, the complex amount of information gained from such comprehensive techniques is associated with difficult and time-consuming data analysis. Because of this obstacle, two-dimensional gas chromatography still receives relatively little use in aerosol science [1–4]. To remedy this problem, advanced scripting algorithms based on knowledge-based rules (KBRs) were developed in-house and applied to GCxGC-TOFMS data. Previously reported KBRs and newer findings were considered for the development of these algorithms. The novelty of the presented advanced scripting tools is a notably selective search criterion for data screening, which is primarily based on fragmentation patterns and the presence of specific fragments. Combined with “classical” approaches based on retention times, a fast, accurate and automated data evaluation method was developed, which was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for type 1 and type 2 errors. The method's applicability was further tested for PM filter samples obtained from ship fuel combustion. Major substance classes, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), alkanes, benzenes, esters and ethers, can be targeted. This approach allows the classification of approximately 75% of the peaks of interest within real PM samples. Various conditions of combustion, such as fuel composition and engine load, could be clearly characterised and differentiated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3aalkanes 3aautomation 3abenzene 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3aesters 3aethers 3afuel combustion 3afuels 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3ascreening 3avolatile organic compounds 0aComprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography 0aData mining 0aShip fuel combustion 0aAerosol1 aGröger, Thomas1 aZimmermann, Ralf0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Oct. 17, v. 1364 p.241-248dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.08.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010600162520175400268592002802022650001802050650001402068650001802082650002002100650001002120650001002130650001102140650003002151650001102181650001402192650001002206650002302216650001502239650001402254650002302268650003202291650002302323650001802346650001702364650001402381650001402395653002802409653001902437653001902456653001802475653001402493700001602507700001602523700001802539700001802557700001802575700001502593700001802608700005402626700001202680773009302692856008202785852000902867655001202876IND60686615220221116154720.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068661522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeb, Falak10aTime-restricted feeding is associated with changes in human gut microbiota related to nutrient intake  aObjectives: Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a dietary therapeutic remedy for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. Gut microbiota may influence the host metabolism and nutritional status of individuals. Given the significance of TRF and gut microbiota in metabolic diseases, the aim of this study was to explore the association between TRF and gut microbiota in healthy individuals, which is not clearly elucidated.Methods: Thirty healthy men (18–30 y of age) were divided in to two groups (TRF: n = 15 and non-TRF: n = 15). The TRF group was instructed to not consume any food for 16 h/d. Two-day food diary was used for dietary data collection. Stool samples were collected from both groups after 25 d of TRF or non-TRF. Gut microbiota profile was analyzed and quantified by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Results: Cluster analysis revealed that Prevotlla_9, Faecalibacterium, and Dialister were the most abundant species in TRF, whereas Prevotell_7, Alloprevotella, and Prevotella_2 were less abundant in the non-TRF group. At the genus level, gut microbiota of the TRF group was significantly changed compared with that of the non-TRF group. Moreover, bar plot analysis revealed that Bacteroidetes was the most abundant phylum in TRF group, followed by Firmicutes. Heat map correlation showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin D were positively correlated with Firmicutes, whereas iodine, vitamin E, magnesium, and carbohydrate intake were negative correlated with microbial richness.Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that TRF is associated with microbial composition and relative abundance. TRF intervention might increase microbial abundance, thereby influencing the host metabolism and nutritional status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aDialister 3acarbohydrates 3adata collection 3afeces 3agenes 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aiodine 3amagnesium 3amales 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolism 3anutrients 3anutritional status 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arestricted feeding 3aribosomal RNA 3atherapeutics 3avitamin D 3avitamin E 0aTime-restricted feeding 0aDietary intake 0aGut microbiota 0aBacteroidetes 0aVitamin D1 aWu, Xiaoyue1 aChen, Lijun1 aFatima, Sadia1 aIjaz-ul-Haq, 1 aChen, Aochang1 aXu, Chuyue1 aJianglei, Ren1 aFeng, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7686-27131 aLi, Min0 tNutrition.g2020 Oct., v. 78 p.110797-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010200167300001800269520109700287592002801384650001501412650001201427650002201439650001301461650002001474650001301494653002501507653003001532653002101562653003901583700001601622700001601638773013201654856008501786852000901871655001201880IND60745770520221119081547.0210727e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074577052DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2020.18099182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huang10aFabric defect detection under complex illumination based on an improved recurrent attention model  ap. 1273-1279.  aTo solve the problem of fabric defect detection under complex illumination conditions, the Recurrent Attention Model (RAM) which is insensitive to illumination and noise differences has been introduced. However, the policy gradient algorithm in the RAM has some problems, such as the difficulty of convergence and the inefficiency of the algorithm due to the shortcomings of round updating. In this paper, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient- Recurrent Attention Model (DDPG-RAM) algorithm is proposed to solve the problems of policy gradient algorithm. Although the decoupling of the reinforcement learning task and classification task will lead to the inconsistency of the data, the gradient variance will be smaller, and the convergence speed and stability will be accelerated. Experiment results show that fabric defects can be detected by the proposed DDPG-RAM algorithm under complex illumination conditions. Compared with RAM and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the accuracy of the decoupled algorithm is 95.24%, and the convergence speed is 50% faster than that of the RAM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3afabrics 3aissues and policy 3alighting 3aneural networks 3avariance 0aComplex illumination 0arecurrent attention model 0adefect detection 0adeep deterministic policy gradient1 aDuan, Fajie1 aZhou, Weiti0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2021 Aug. 3, v. 112, no. 8 p.1273-1279dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2020.18099183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245011900201300001600320520122000336592002801556650001601584650001801600650001401618650002301632650002601655650001101681650001501692650001301707650001301720650000901733650001701742700001501759700002201774700001901796773011401815856008201929852000902011655001202020IND60748166320221118041521.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074816632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-020-09486-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGryń, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6743-135610aLatent Infection by Clavibacter sepedonicus and Correlation with Ring Rot Symptoms Development in Potato Cultivars  ap. 459-468.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the response of potato cultivars to Clavibacter sepedonicus (Cs) infection in a field experiment. The research focused on the infection in a latent form as it is a risk for unnoticed spread. A total of 18 cultivars were tested in the years 2013–2016. Symptoms of the disease were observed on the leaves during growth and in tubers after harvest and after storage. The infection incidence was determined by microscopic observation of leaf and tuber samples stained by the IFAS method. A diverse response of potato cultivars to Cs infection was found. The lowest number of asymptomatic infected plants was found in cultivars ‘Vineta’, ‘Bila’ and ‘Irga’. As for cultivar ‘Stasia’, the entire tuber yield was latently infected by Cs. A low or medium concentration of Cs cells in leaves did not change significantly or increased depending on the potato cultivar. A higher incidence of tubers with disease symptoms was found after the storage period. In eight of the cultivars tested, the level of tuber infection by Cs confirmed microscopically after harvest was significantly correlated with the occurrence of disease symptoms in tubers after the storage period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClavibacter 3acarrier state 3acultivars 3adisease occurrence 3afield experimentation 3aleaves 3amicroscopy 3apotatoes 3aresearch 3arisk 3astorage time1 aFranke, K.1 aNowakowski, M.

Continuous administration of the Juvenile Hormone (JH) in artificial diet is highly effective with respect to stimulating testes growth and mating behaviour. Female reproductive diapause can be induced under standard rearing conditions, although optimum reproductive maturity of males is achieved at 15 °C. Treatment of males with a JH analogue accelerates testes development up to the stage of spermiogenesis (the bundling of spermatozoa) but does not promote the formation of cysts with mature sperm. Treatment with 20‐hydroxyecdysone has no influence on diapause termination and testes function. These results suggest that male reproductive maturation in G. atrocyanea is independent of JH, and moderate temperatures may induce an unknown factor that is responsible for the maturation of sperm cysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastrophysa 3aartificial diets 3adiapause 3aecdysis 3aecdysterone 3afemales 3ajuvenile hormones 3amales 3amating behavior 3arearing 3asexual maturity 3aspermatozoa 3aspermiogenesis 3atemperature 3atestes1 aIshiguro, Shinichi1 aAn, Ying1 aKadosawa, Tomohiro1 aSuzuki, Kōichi,0 tPhysiological entomology.g2015 Dec., v. 40, no. 4 p.277-283dThe Royal Entomological Societyx0307-69627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phen.121123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007600170300001600246520106200262592002801324650001001352650000901362650001201371650002301383650001801406650002301424650001101447650001701458650002101475650001601496700001601512700002101528773008901549856008501638852000901723655001201732IND60112448020221118041001.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011244802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByun, Youngjae10aActive warm-water fish gelatin film containing oxygen scavenging system  ap. 250-255.  aAn oxygen scavenging system (OSS), composed of oxygen scavenging nanoparticles and iron chloride (II), was incorporated into warm-water fish gelatin film. Surface morphology, cross sectional images, and mechanical, barrier, and optical properties of the oxygen scavenging fish gelatin (OSFG) film were compared to those of the unmodified fish gelatin (UMFG) film. Results indicated that the OSS was well incorporated into the OSFG film structure. The OSFG film had rough film surface, increased water vapor and oxygen permeability, and decreased tensile strength due to the incorporation and agglomerations of the OSS. The incorporation of the OSS also caused color and haze alterations to the OSFG film. In addition, the oxygen scavenging capability of the OSFG film was investigated. The initial oxygen content (%) in the cup headspace, 20.90%, was decreased to 4.56% after 50 days of storage. The OSFG film had good oxygen scavenging capacity, 1969.08 cc O₂/m²/mil, and moisture was used as the activator to trigger the oxygen scavenging reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3afish 3agelatin 3aheadspace analysis 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3atensile strength 3awater vapor1 aBae, Ho Jae1 aWhiteside, Scott0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2012 May, v. 27, no. 1 p.250-255dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007500171300001200246520084800258592002801106650001301134650002201147650001701169650001201186650001201198650001001210650002901220650001901249650002101268773011601289856008201405852000901487655001201496IND60621018220221121012812.0181114e194308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062101822DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517543013010012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWickliffe Rose, H.10aResearch and the Patent SystembPart II.—Patents and the Corporation  ap. 2-8.  aTo stimulate research and development was the primary purpose for which the patent law was enacted.

Soot particles are sourced from a candle burning in a chamber, and the tests involve 1.5 h of continuous loading of particles at three different flow rates: 4.5, 8.15 and 9.55 l/min. The fractional efficiency, morphology and pressure drop of both clean and loaded filters are studied using a scanning mobility particle sizer, scanning electron microscope and differential pressure gauge. Both filters have relatively similar levels of efficiency 93% for particle size (100–400 nm) at the lowest flow rate. At higher flow rates, the re-entrainment process effects the filtration efficiency of both filters. At the higher flow rate of 8.15 l/min, the filter with a higher solid volume fraction and thickness shows a higher pressure drop and an efficiency level of 95%. Increasing the flow rate to 9.55 l/min helps to pass the particles with diameters larger than 100 nm through two filters. This phenomenon decreases the fractional efficiency of both filters during the loading time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aburning 3afilters 3afiltration 3aparticle size 3aquartz 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asoot1 aAmini, A.1 aSoltani Goharrizi, A.1 aRainey, T.1 aMorawska, L.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2018 May, v. 15, no. 5 p.1039-1048dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-017-1457-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013500164300001600299520101000315592002801325650001601353650001001369650001301379650001101392650000901403650001201412650001401424650002001438650003301458700001401491700001601505700001301521700001401534700001501548700001601563700001301579700001301592700001801605700001601623773008901639856008201728990002301810852000901833655001201842IND60092876520221121183346.0141103e20120803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009287652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2012.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiao, Yarui10aPax3/7BP Is a Pax7- and Pax3-Binding Protein that Regulates the Proliferation of Muscle Precursor Cells by an Epigenetic Mechanism  ap. 231-241.  aIn mouse skeletal muscles, Pax7 uniquely marks muscle satellite cells and plays some important yet unknown functions at the perinatal stage. To elucidate its in vivo functions, we initiated a yeast two-hybrid screening to look for Pax7-interacting proteins and identified a previously uncharacterized Pax7- and Pax3-binding protein (Pax3/7BP). Pax3/7BP is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein, enriched in Pax7+ muscle precursor cells (MPCs), and serves as an indispensable adaptor for Pax7 to recruit the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase (HMT) complex by bridging Pax7 and Wdr5. Knockdown of Pax3/7BP abolished the Pax3/7-associated H3K4 HMT activity and inhibited the proliferation of Pax7+ MPCs from young mice both in culture and in vivo. Id3 and Cdc20 were direct target genes of Pax7 and Pax3/7BP involved in the proliferation of Pax7+ MPCs. Collectively, our work establishes Pax3/7BP as an essential adaptor linking Pax3/7 with the H3K4 HMT to regulate the proliferation of MPCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahistones 3alysine 3amice 3amuscles 3ascreening 3askeletal muscle 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aGuo, Xing1 aLi, Yanfeng1 aSun, Kun1 aLu, Leina1 aJiang, Lei1 aFu, Xinrong1 aZhu, Han1 aSun, Hao1 aWang, Huating1 aWu, Zhenguo0 tCell stem cell.g2012 Aug. 3, v. 11, no. 2 p.231-241dElsevier Inc.x1934-59097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2012.05.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013500209300001600344520139200360592002801752596005101780650001901831650002401850650001701874650001601891650001301907650001501920650001701935650001301952650001601965650001001981650001001991651001202001700001902013700002002032773011402052856008202166852000902248655001202257IND60748166520221118041559.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074816652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-020-09485-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolot, Jean-Louis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7724-703410aAssessment of Treatments to Control the Spread of PVY in Seed Potato Crops: Results Obtained in Belgium Through a Multi-Year Trial  ap. 435-458.  aThe aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of several treatments to control the spread of PVY (Potato virus Y) in seed potato crops. Field trials were conducted over a number of years in the Ardenne region of Belgium. Chemical treatments, including sprays of mineral oil, insecticide and a mix of them, were tested along with other treatments such as vegetal oil, plant slurries and Siliforce®. Agronomic treatments such as straw mulching and early vine killing were also evaluated. Trials using the same experimental design were conducted for 6 years but with different protection strategies each year. The key lessons emerging from this research are the following: (i) the use of mineral oil is an efficient way to protect seed potato crops against the spread of PVY, although the protection is incomplete; (ii) insecticides do not work (especially those of the pyrethroid group), although systemic insecticides provide added protection if mixed with mineral oil when activity of winged aphids is high; (iii) vegetal oil (rapeseed oil) protects the crop but at a lower level than mineral oil; (iv) slurries and Siliforce® do not provide control of PVY; (v) early killing of potato vines reduces PVY incidence in seed tuber lots; (vi) straw mulching increases the protection level in crops treated with mineral oil and may reduce the number of mineral oil sprays required.  aPublisher supplied data  aNonecCentre wallon de Recherches agronomiques 3aPotato virus Y 3aexperimental design 3ainsecticides 3amineral oil 3apotatoes 3apyrethrins 3arapeseed oil 3aresearch 3aseed tubers 3astraw 3avines 3aBelgium1 aSeutin, Hugues1 aDeveux, Liliane0 tPotato research.g2021 Sept., v. 64, no. 3 p.435-458dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl47412x0014-30657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-020-09485-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013100166300001600297520161700313592002801930650001501958650001601973650002401989650002602013650001902039650002002058650001702078650002302095650001002118650002202128650001302150650002802163653001502191653001302206653001302219653001802232653001502250700001902265700001602284700002102300700001902321700001802340700002002358700001502378700002102393700001502414700001402429773010402443856008702547852000902634655001202643IND60582913120221119105322.0180904e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058291312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAslan, L.10aExperimental and theoretical investigations of the kinetics and mechanism of the Cl + 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone reaction  ap. 315-326.  aThe reaction of 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone (4H4M2P) with Cl atoms was studied for the first time experimentally and theoretically. Relative kinetic measurements were carried out at room temperature and 1 bar of synthetic air/N2 in two different environmental chambers: a 300 L Teflon bag and a 16 L borosilicate glass cell. Reactants, reference compounds and products were monitored either by IR absorption or by GC-FID. Theoretical calculations were performed using the density functional theory method at BH&HLYP level of theory for twelve hydrogen abstraction pathways. The individual rate coefficients for the most favorable H-abstraction pathways were calculated by canonical variational theory using small curvature tunneling method at 298 K. An average experimental rate coefficient of (7.4 ± 0.6) × 10⁻¹¹ cm³ molecule⁻¹ s⁻¹ was obtained at 298 K, in good agreement with the theoretical rate coefficient. The branching ratios for each reaction channel were evaluated theoretically from the individual rate coefficients of the identified channels. The H-atom abstracted on the –CH2 group appeared to be the dominant channel with a small barrier height. Formaldehyde, acetic acid, HCl, CO2 and CO were identified by IR as the major primary products. The obtained results are presented and discussed in terms of structure-reactivity relationships. A mechanism is suggested for the formation of the observed products. The atmospheric implications of the studied reaction are presented and more particularly, the lifetime of 4H4M2P towards Cl atoms is evaluated to be about 3 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetic acid 3aambient temperature 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aformaldehyde 3agas chromatography 3aglass 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 0aOxygenated 0aLifetime 0aChlorine 0aHydroxyketone 0aDFT method1 aPriya, A.

This work focused on physicochemical characteristics and PSP performances of the polymeric aggregations. The physicochemical characteristics of polymeric aggregations, including critical aggregation concentration (CAC), zeta potential, hydrodynamic diameter, and micropolarity were determined. Experimental results showed that polymeric aggregations had much lower CAC, which decreased the usage of copolymer in EKC, weakened ionic strength and shortened analysis time. The monomer molar ratio of the copolymer was a key factor for physicochemical characteristics and PSP performances of the polymeric aggregations. With the increase of the hydrophobic monomer molar ratio, CAC, micropolarity and dimension of polymeric aggregation decreased significantly while zeta potentials were similar. Correspondingly, separation window enlarged and methylene selectivity evaluated with six kinds of n-alkylphenone homologous series enhanced. Linear solvation energy relationships (LSER) analysis found that hydrophobic interaction is the most important interaction between analytes and polymeric PSPs. Compared with SDS micelle, polymeric aggregations owned more types of interactions, such as stronger hydrogen bonding and relative larger dipole interaction, which provided a bigger adjustment room to improve PSP selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3acomposite polymers 3aenergy 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic strength 3amicelles 3azeta potential 0aRandom copolymer aggregation 0aPseudostationary phase 0aMicrostructure 0aMonomer molar ratio 0aMethylene selectivity 0aLinear solvation energy relationships1 aZhuo, Xiaolu1 aXu, Xiaojin1 aCao, Yuhua1 aCao, Guangqun0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Oct. 24, v. 1365 p.219-225dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.08.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010900168300001500277520138600292592002801678650001401706650001301720650001401733650001101747650000901758650002801767650001301795650001501808651001101823653002701834653002701861653001901888653002601907700002001933700001801953700001801971700002001989773010502009856008602114852000902200655001202209IND60570130520221116151808.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057013052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Pao-Shan10aComparison of random forests and support vector machine for real-time radar-derived rainfall forecasting  ap. 92-104.  aThis study aims to compare two machine learning techniques, random forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), for real-time radar-derived rainfall forecasting. The real-time radar-derived rainfall forecasting models use the present grid-based radar-derived rainfall as the output variable and use antecedent grid-based radar-derived rainfall, grid position (longitude and latitude) and elevation as the input variables to forecast 1- to 3-h ahead rainfalls for all grids in a catchment. Grid-based radar-derived rainfalls of six typhoon events during 2012–2015 in three reservoir catchments of Taiwan are collected for model training and verifying. Two kinds of forecasting models are constructed and compared, which are single-mode forecasting model (SMFM) and multiple-mode forecasting model (MMFM) based on RF and SVM. The SMFM uses the same model for 1- to 3-h ahead rainfall forecasting; the MMFM uses three different models for 1- to 3-h ahead forecasting. According to forecasting performances, it reveals that the SMFMs give better performances than MMFMs and both SVM-based and RF-based SMFMs show satisfactory performances for 1-h ahead forecasting. However, for 2- and 3-h ahead forecasting, it is found that the RF-based SMFM underestimates the observed radar-derived rainfalls in most cases and the SVM-based SMFM can give better performances than RF-based SMFM.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrology 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amodels 3arain 3asupport vector machines 3atyphoons 3awatersheds 3aTaiwan 0aRadar-derived rainfall 0aSupport vector machine 0aRandom forests 0aReal-time forecasting1 aYang, Tao-Chang1 aChen, Szu-Yin1 aKuo, Chen-Min1 aTseng, Hung-Wei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Sept., v. 552 p.92-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245013300177300001400310520152600324592002801850650001801878650001901896650002501915650002501940650003101965650001701996650002702013650001602040650002002056650001602076650001902092650001902111650001702130650002102147650002202168650001802190650001602208650002002224650002302244650001002267650001402277650001002291650002002301650002102321650000902342650001702351653001402368653002102382653001702403653001702420653002002437700002302457700002202480700001902502700001702521700002402538700002202562700002102584700002402605700001902629773010502648856008102753852000902834655001202843IND60599349520221118220239.0180702e20140627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059934952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2014.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasram, Mohamed Montassar10aAntioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of N-acetylcysteine against malathion-induced liver damages and immunotoxicity in rats  ap. 50-58.  aOccupational exposure to organophosphate pesticides is becoming a common and increasingly alarming world-wide phenomenon. The present study is designed to investigate the preventive effect of N-acetylcysteine on malathion-induced hepatic injury and inflammation in rats.Adult male Wistar rats of body weight 200–230g were used for the study. Malathion (200mg/kg b.w./day) was administered to rats by oral intubation and N-acetylcysteine (2g/l) in drinking water for 28days. Rats were sacrificed on the 28th day, 2h after the last administration. Markers of liver injury (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and lactate desyhdogenase), inflammation (leukocyte counts, myeloperoxidase, immunophenotyping of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and interferon-γ expression) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione and antioxidant status) were assessed.Malathion induced an increase in activities of hepatocellular enzymes in plasma, lipid peroxidation index, CD3⁺/CD4⁺ and CD3⁺/CD4⁺ percent and pro-inflammatory cytokines, when decreased antioxidant status in liver was noted. When malathion-treated rats were compared to NAC supplemented rats, leukocytosis, T cell count and IL-1β, IL-6, INF-γ expression were reduced. Furthermore, NAC restored liver enzyme activities and oxidative stress markers.Malathion induces hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress and liver inflammation. N-acetylcysteine showed therapeutic effects against malathion toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aacetylcysteine 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3abody weight 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3ahepatotoxicity 3aimmunotoxicity 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alactic acid 3aleukocyte count 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amalathion 3amales 3amyeloperoxidase 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3atherapeutics 0aMalathion 0aN-acetylcysteine 0aInflammation 0aLiver injury 0aHepatosteatosis1 aLamine, Aicha Jrad1 aDhouib, Ines Bini1 aBouzid, Kahena1 aAnnabi, Alya1 aBelhadjhmida, Nadia1 aAhmed, Malika Ben1 aEl Fazaa, Saloua1 aAbdelmoula, Jaouida1 aGharbi, Najoua0 tLife sciences.g2014 June 27, v. 107, no. 1-2 p.50-58dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2014.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245007500167300001600242520097200258592002801230650001301258650001301271650002601284650002001310650001701330650001601347651001801363651001401381653002701395653001701422653002101439653005501460653002401515653001201539653000801551653000901559653000801568653000801576653000801584653000701592700001601599700005901615773010401674856008701778852000901865655001201874IND60582913220221119105549.0180904e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058291322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.07.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuev, V.V.14aThe role of the Mt. Merapi eruption in the 2011 Arctic ozone depletion  ap. 327-333.  aOne of the strongest ozone depletion events in the Arctic stratosphere was observed in March 2011 due to the strengthening of the polar vortex in February 2011. Earlier, in November 2010, the eruption of Mt. Merapi volcano (Java, Indonesia) with a maximum plume altitude of 18.3 km was recorded. The effect of aerosol heating in the tropical lower stratosphere after the Mt. Merapi eruption on the Arctic polar vortex strengthening in winter–spring 2011 is examined. Based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis temperature data, we show that significant aerosol heating in the lower tropical stratosphere was observed in February–March 2011 and could lead to an increase in the stratospheric equator-to-pole temperature gradient resulting in an enhanced Arctic polar vortex. We also analyze the correlation between large tropical volcanic eruptions occurring in autumn–winter periods and Arctic ozone depletion events observed in the following winter–spring periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aozone depletion 3astratosphere 3atemperature 3aArctic region 3aIndonesia 0aArctic ozone depletion 0aPolar vortex 0aTropical heating 0aStratospheric equator-to-pole temperature gradient 0aMt.

The sintering temperature was found to have a significant effect on electrical properties of the grain boundary medium. A brick-layer model-based analysis of the experimental data of grain boundary medium was carried out for the estimation of proportion ratio between grain dimension and grain boundary thickness. Impedance spectra, obtained by 4-electrode method, were also examined by numerically calculating the probability density function of distribution of relaxation times of charge carriers. The latter method revealed time domain behavior of the system, which allowed more accurate evaluation of the most probable relaxation times. GDC10 samples, sintered at 1400 and 1500 °C, showed a particular relaxation behavior of charge carriers in grain boundary medium. Two distinct peaks of the imaginary impedance (both associated to grain boundary) were detected, which suggest that grain boundary medium in these specimens may consist of two phases with different electrical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprobability 3acerium 3aceramics 3atemperature 3agadolinium 0aimpedance1 aKežionis, Algimantas1 aŠalkus, Tomas1 aOrliukas, Antanas Feliksas0 tJournal of materials science.g2015 Apr., v. 50, no. 8 p.3246-3251dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-8892-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245012500199300001800324520163300342592002801975650002302003650001602026650000802042650001902050650001802069650001302087650000902100650002102109650001002130650002502140650001702165650001302182650001102195650001402206650002102220650001702241650001402258650003402272650001202306650001102318650000902329650001202338650001602350651001002366700002102376700001602397773016202413856008202575852000902657655001202666IND60593687120221119145200.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059368712DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-017-1461-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, S.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9665-877910aDust particles characterization and innate resistance for Thevetia peruviana in different land-use pattern of urban area  ap. 1061-1072.  aThe present work is an attempt to investigate pollution effect on an ornamental tree species Thevetia peruviana (Pers.) K. Schum. The study was conducted in various green spaces of institutional, industrial, residential and near traffic site representing as different status of air pollution concentration depending on land-use type. The resistance index calculated for selected species had mean value of 14.57 ± 0.41 observed at study sites. The dust deposition was found in range of 5.14–7.74 mg cm⁻² on foliar surface of 12 cm². The examination of leaf structure with scanning electron microscope showed presence of airborne dust particles in coarse and fine sizes with higher deposition found in industrial and residential sites. The epicuticular wax layer on upper surface of foliar was found eroded at industrial and traffic regions. The equivalent diameter of particles was observed to range from 0.45 to 12.71 µm in Poisson distributional pattern. The density of number concentration of dust particles was observed 1411 and 3703 in institutional and industrial area deposited on 0.22 mm² of foliar surface. The elemental distribution on leaves of Thevetia peruviana has revealed a mixture of carbonaceous and soil matrix elements such as C, O, Al, Na, Si, K and Mg observed in proportion of X-rays counts per second. The whole experiment gave a positive indication for plant species as a tolerant bio-indicator of air pollutants in Delhi. The diverse flora present in city provides an opportunity for reducing harmful concentration of PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅ and improving quality of air for human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThevetia peruviana 3aX-radiation 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aaluminum 3adust 3aepicuticular wax 3aflora 3agreen infrastructure 3ahuman health 3aland use 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3aornamental trees 3aparticulates 3apotassium 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asilicon 3asodium 3asoil 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3aIndia1 aBhattacharya, P.1 aGupta, N.C.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2018 May, v. 15, no. 5 p.1061-1072dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-017-1461-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010600168300001800274520092400292592002801216650002001244650001401264650001301278650001101291650002001302650001801322653002801340653003201368653001801400653003801418653002801456700002401484700001901508773013201527856008501659852000901744655001201753IND60745771020221119081605.0210727e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074577102DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2020.18134092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTola, Sourav10aImproved detection of woven fabric defect by optimized and adoptive cylindrical band-reject filtering  ap. 1304-1315.  aFor assuring the quality of woven fabric, use of machine vision system in the weaving industry has become an essential demand. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting defects on woven homogeneous/inhomogeneous fabrics by generating 3D fabric image containing information of the entire range of inhomogeneity of the fabric class, followed by the designing of a fabric class specific optimized 3D cylindrical band-reject filter and defect specific energy threshold value. The method was validated on 10 types of fabric defects taken place on 582 defective and 79 non defective fabric images from TILDA database. Detection success rate of 97.5%, false positive rate of 1.8%, recall value of 96.77% and precision of 98.17% was achieved during detection of defects by this method. The method showed promising results during detection of defects from Salt & Pepper and Gaussian noise corrupted fabric images.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer vision 3adatabases 3aindustry 3apepper 3aspecific energy 3awoven fabrics 0aFabric defect detection 0a3D Fourier transform (3DFT) 0aKL divergence 0aparticle swarm optimization (PSO) 0adeep auto encoder (DAE)1 aChandra, Jayanta K.1 aSarkar, Gautam0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2021 Aug. 3, v. 112, no. 8 p.1304-1315dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2020.18134093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013000168300001600298520140500314592002801719650001501747650001301762650002601775650002901801650001901830650001401849650001601863650001201879650002301891650001101914650001101925650000901936650000901945650002301954650002501977650001802002651001002020653001202030653001402042653002102056653001202077700002002089773010402109856008702213852000902300655001202309IND60582913520221119105126.0180904e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058291352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.07.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavitha M.,10aSCIAMACHY observed changes in the column mixing ratio of methane over the Indian region and a comparison with global scenario  ap. 454-466.  aThe trends in the column averaged mixing ratio of methane (XCH4) over the Indian region during 2003–2009 periods were studied using the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) observations. Considering the sensor degradation, the trends were analyzed for 2003 to 2005 and 2006 to 2009 separately. Over India, the trend in XCH4 varied from 5.2 to 7.6 ppb per year after 2005, exhibiting a 2–4 fold increase compared to 2003–2005. While the increase over Northern parts of India is attributed to increasing CH4 emissions from rice cultivation and livestock population, those over Southern regions are due to increased oil and gas mining activities. A comparison of these trends with those over most of the hotspot regions over the globe revealed that those regions exhibited higher growth rates of XCH4 compared to Indian regions during 2006–2009. The seasonal patterns of XCH4 and near-surface CH4 at selected global network stations were also examined in detail. This analysis revealed hemispheric difference and varying seasonal patterns suggesting the inhomogeneous vertical distribution of CH4. The observed differences in the seasonal patterns of near-surface CH4 and XCH4 suggest that the surface emissions need not replicate at higher altitudes due to long-range transport, the boundary layer meteorology and lifetime of CH4 in the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric chemistry 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aimage analysis 3alivestock 3ameteorology 3amethane 3amethane production 3amining 3amixing 3aoils 3arice 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial distribution 3aspectrometers 3aIndia 0aMethane 0aSCIAMACHY 0aSeasonal pattern 0aAnomaly1 aNair, Prabha R.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Oct., v. 166 p.454-466dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.07.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010500163300001300268520151700281592002801798650002501826650002101851650002601872650002701898650001601925650002101941650001001962650002001972650001501992650004302007650001802050650002402068650002102092650005202113650001602165650000902181650001602190650001002206650000902216650001202225653002402237653001802261653001102279653003002290653004502320653001902365653000702384653000702391653000702398653000702405653000902412653000702421653000802428653000602436653000902442653000702451653000702458653000802465653000802473653000802481653000802489653000702497700001502504700001202519700001502531700001802546700001202564700001502576700001402591700001502605700001702620700001502637700001602652773012102668856008502789852000902874655001202883IND60682419020221120194702.0200330e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068241902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yue10aOsPDR2 mediates the regulation on the development response and maintenance of Pi homeostasis in rice  ap. 1-10.  aInorganic orthophosphate (Pi), a major form of essential macronutrient phosphorus (P), is available in rhizosphere for acquisition and assimilation by plants. However, the limited availability of Pi in soils affects the growth and development of plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Phosphate Deficiency Response2 (AtPDR2), interacts genetically with Low Phosphate Root1 (AtLPR1) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a key role in the inhibition of primary root growth (PRG) during Pi deficiency. However, the role of OsPDR2, the homolog of AtPDR2, either in roots response to Pi deficiency and/or in growth and development has not been elucidated as yet. Therefore, qRT-PCR was employed to determine the spatiotemporal effects and the availability of Pi on the expression of OsPDR2. OsPDR2 showed variable levels of relative expression pattern in vegetative and/or reproductive tissues analyzed at different stages of growth and development (5–17 weeks). Transient expression analysis revealed its subcellular localization to the ER. Further, the reverse genetics approach was employed for determining the function of OsPDR2 by generating RNAi lines (Ri2, Ri9, and Ri18). The study revealed significant inhibitory effects of RNAi-mediated suppression of OsPDR2 on the development of root, male reproductive traits, and yield. Moreover, ³²P isotope labeling and split-root experiments under different Pi regime with RNAi lines revealed the function of OsPDR2 in regulating homeostasis of Pi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA interference 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agrowth and development 3ahomeostasis 3aisotope labeling 3amales 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aradionuclides 3areproductive traits 3areverse genetics 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3arice 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asoil 3atissues 0aRice (Oryza sativa) 0aPi deficiency 0aOsPDR2 0aRNAi-mediated suppression 0aMorphophysiological and molecular traits 0aPi homeostasis 0aAR 0aCu 0aER 0aEZ 0aLPR1 0aMZ 0aMIA 0aP 0aPDR2 0aPi 0aPI 0aPRG 0aPRL 0aPSR 0aRSA 0aWT1 aJain, Ajay1 aAi, Hao1 aLiu, Xiuli1 aWang, Xiaowen1 aHu, Zhi1 aSun, Yafei1 aHu, Siwen1 aShen, Xing1 aLan, Xiaoxia1 aXu, Guohua1 aSun, Shubin0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 Apr., v. 149 p.1-10dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245005000162300002000212520131300232592002801545650002001573650003001593650001501623650001701638650001301655650001201668650001401680700002101694700005801715700006201773700005601835700006201891773013801953856008002091852000902171655001202180IND60749445520221120131749.0210903e20210819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074944552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c036062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Jiren10aInitial Steps in CH₄ Pyrolysis on Cu and Ni  ap. 18665-18672.  aMethane pyrolysis on solid catalysts begins with C–H bond dissociation. In the formation of solid carbon, the initial C–C bond formation is thought to occur on/in the surface of most transition-metal catalysts and not in the gas phase. This has been shown to be true for Ni surfaces. In CH₄–D₂ exchange reactions on polycrystalline Ni, CD₄ is the major product observed, which is consistent with surface-mediated dehydrogenation. However, on Cu surfaces, CH₃D is the dominant exchange product observed, suggesting that deep dehydrogenation is unfavorable. Further, in a methane flow cell reactor, the carbon density and crystal size of the graphene formed from pyrolysis on Cu surfaces depend on the distance downstream in the flow field, whereas no such dependence is observed for Ni. Density functional theory calculations support an entropically favorable pathway, whereby on Cu after dissociative chemisorption of methane, the surface adsorbed CH₃° desorbs rather than undergoing further dehydrogenation; on Ni, complete dehydrogenation is favorable. Reactive methyl radicals from Cu surfaces would participate in gas-phase pyrolysis upon desorption, forming the initial C–C bond in the gas phase with subsequent re-adsorption and surface modification of gas-phase generated oligomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adehydrogenation 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3adissociation 3agraphene 3amethane 3apyrolysis1 aTarazkar, Maryam1 aPalmer, Clarke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7878-83181 aGordon, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0123-96491 aMetiu, Horia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3134-44931 aMcFarland, Eric W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7242-509X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 19, v. 125, no. 34 p.18665-18672dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c036063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245008200165300001800247520146300265592002801728650004401756650002201800650001501822650001201837650002201849650001901871650002501890650001501915650001601930650003001946650002101976650001301997650001202010650001802022650001102040650001802051650001802069650001502087650002002102650001902122650001602141700002302157700001802180773013302198856008202331852000902413655001202422IND60538408620180425000000.0160815e20160504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053840862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b003782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGönen, Mehmet10aBoric Acid Production from Colemanite Together with ex Situ CO2 Sequestration  ap. 5116-5124.  aIn this work, boric acid (H₃BO₃) production from the mineral colemanite (Ca₂B₆O₁₁·5H₂O) with carbon dioxide (CO₂) sequestration is investigated. CO₂, a known greenhouse gas, is used as a raw material in the leaching of boric acid from colemanite, and the residual calcium is converted into the thermodynamically stable carbonate form. Experiments are carried out in a high pressure stainless steel reactor equipped with stirring and ultrasonic mixing. The solid/liquid ratio is kept at 0.1 g/mL considering the solubility of boric acid extracted, and two different particle sizes (45 and 75 μm) of colemanite are tested. Reactions were carried out for different reaction times and at 40–70 °C and at 4–12 MPa. Characterization of the products by FTIR, XRD, and TGA confirmed that boric acid is extracted from colemanite and CO₂ is converted into calcium carbonate. The conversion favorably increases with the addition of CO₂ pressure up to 8 MPa. The use of 20–25 kHz ultrasound in this heterogeneous reaction increased the extraction efficiency from approximately 70% to 90% due to enhanced mass transfer. CO₂ storage capacity of colemanite is measured as 0.17 as compared to the theoretical value of 0.21 kg CO₂/kg mineral. The utilization of CO₂ in boric acid production can sequester a significant amount of CO₂ while improving the environmental performance as compared to traditional sulfuric acid-based processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aboric acid 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acolemanite 3aengineering 3aenvironmental performance 3agreenhouse gases 3aleaching 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amixing 3aparticle size 3araw materials 3asolubility 3astainless steel 3athermodynamics 3aultrasonics1 aNyankson, Emmanuel1 aGupta, Ram B.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 May 04, v. 55, no. 17 p.5116-5124dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b003783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01644naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245005400164300001400218520058700232592002800819650002500847650004300872650001100915650004400926650002100970650001500991700001801006700001501024700002001039700001601059700001801075773010701093856008501200852000901285655001201294IND60086972920221119054132.0141102e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008697292DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(13)60014-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Li,12aA new carotane sesquiterpene from Walsura robusta  ap. 84-86.  aAIM: To study the chemical constituents from the leaves of Walsura robusta.

However, almost efficient 2D RP pero-SCs are prepared by the hot-casting or anti-solvent assisted spin-coating method, which greatly limits their applications. Herein, a multifunctional strategy through introducing a novel organic salt, benzimidazolium iodide (BnI), as a spacer and KI as an additive is reported to successfully fabricate a high-quality Bn-based 2D RP perovskite film in the hot-casting and anti-solvent free spin-coating method. The entire conjugated backbone of benzimidazolium is expected to enhance charge carrier transport within the 2D RP perovskite film. And KI can lead to a preferred orientation and less defects in the 2D RP perovskite film. Then, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.12% is obtained, which is the highest performance for 2D RP perovskite devices without the hot-casting or anti-solvent method. The unsealed device maintains 92.1% of its original performance when kept in air (40–45% relative humidity) for 720 h and 87.9% of the initial performance after 528 h of heating at 85 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aiodides 3arelative humidity 0atwo-dimensional 0aperovskite solar cells 0acrystalline orientation 0astability 0aspin-coating1 aZhan, Yu1 aYang, Fu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7673-80261 aLi, Yaowen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7229-582X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 13, no. 51 p.61039-61046dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c171693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245013800177300001600315520156900331592002801900650002101928650003101949650001401980650001601994650001002010650002002020650003802040650001102078650001702089650000902106650001102115650001302126650002102139650001202160650000902172650001902181650002302200700002502223700002302248700002702271773011502298856005502413852000902468655001202477IND4510121220221120182958.0150730e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451012122DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02711.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThwin, Maung‐Maung10aFunctional site of endogenous phospholipase A2 inhibitor from python serum: Phospholipase A2 binding and anti‐inflammatory activity  ap. 719-727.  aThe functional site of ‘phospholipase A2 inhibitor from python’ (PIP) was predicted based on the hypothesis of proline brackets. Using different sources of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2s) as enzyme, and [3H]arachidonate‐labelled Escherichia coli as substrate, short synthetic peptides representing the proposed site were examined for their secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inhibitory␣activity. A decapeptide P‐PB.III proved to be the most potent of the tested peptides in inhibiting sPLA2 enzymatic activity in vitro, and exhibited striking anti‐inflammatory effects in␣vivo in a mouse paw oedema model. P‐PB.III inhibited the enzymatic activity of class I, II and III PLA2s, including that of human synovial fluid from arthritis patients. When tested by ELISA, biotinylated P‐PB.III interacted positively with various PLA2s, suggesting that the specific region of PIP corresponding to P‐PB.III, is likely to be involved in the PLA2–PLI interaction. The effect of P‐PB.III on the peritoneal inflammatory response after surgical trauma in rats was also examined. P‐PB.III effectively reduced the extent of postsurgical peritoneal adhesions as compared to controls. sPLA2 levels at seventh postoperative day in the peritoneal tissue of P‐PB.III‐treated rats were also significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in comparison to those of the untreated controls. The present results shed additional insight on the essential structural elements for PLA2 binding, and may be useful as a basis for the design of novel therapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarthritis 3ablood serum 3aedema 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3amice 3amodels 3apatients 3aphospholipase A2 3aproline 3arats 3asynovial fluid 3asynthetic peptides1 aSatish, Ramapatna L.1 aChan, Steven T.

So far, there has been no report of the quantification of the major components in SBT and their pharmacokinetics in humans. In this study, high performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry was used to determine the content of the major compounds in SBT and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of nine major constituents (berberine, epiberberine, coptisine, palmatine, jatrorrhizine, magnoflorine, berberrubine, corynoline and acetylcorynoline) following single and multiple oral administrations of SBT in healthy subjects. This study was an open-label and 2-period clinical trial. It was conducted in 12 Chinese healthy subjects. Each subject received a single dose in period 1 and multiple doses in period 2. Blood samples were collected and determined over 96 h. Subjects underwent safety assessments and were monitored for adverse events. There was no serious adverse event, death or withdrawal. Gender had a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the active alkaloids except for magnoflorine, berberrubine, corynoline and acetylcorynoline. Compared with the single dosing, the exposure of the alkaloids increased significantly except for berberrubine after multiple dosing. Single and multiple oral doses of SBT were safe in healthy Chinese subjects. The accumulation of the alkaloids to different extents was observed with repeated dosing except for berberrubine. This work provides useful information for clinical application in the treatment of OM, and a scientific basis for the study on the material foundation of the medicinal effectiveness of SBT and its mechanism of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aberberine 3ablood sampling 3aclinical trials 3adeath 3agender 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3asafety assessment 3aChina1 aWu, Yao1 aCheng, Minlu1 aGu, Pan1 aZheng, Lu1 aLiu, Yujie1 aMa, Pengcheng1 aDing, Li0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 27, v. 5, no. 123 p.101989-101998dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra18665j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014400163300001600307520181000323592002802133650001902161650002502180650001302205650002602218650001202244650000902256650001802265650001402283650001702297650001802314650003302332650001602365650001302381653002102394653000802415653002502423653001802448653001802466653001602484700001602500700001502516700001902531700001902550700001902569700001502588773011602603856008502719852000902804655001202813IND60619655420221119011629.0210114e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061965542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yue10aHigh-flux NaA zeolite pervaporation membranes dynamically synthesized on the alumina hollow fiber inner-surface in a continuous flow system  ap. 445-454.  aA continuous flow system that can make the process variable more stable was proposed to prepare NaA zeolite membranes on the inner-surface of alumina hollow fiber, in which the gel solution was recirculated and only preheated at the required section, thus avoiding the unnecessary depletion of the nutrients in the bulk. The influence of synthesis parameters including temperature, flow rate and time over the property of obtained membrane were investigated. The thickness and the morphology of the membranes were explored by SEM. Their separation performance for dehydration of ethanol/water mixture was tested in a pervaporation (PV) set-up with the feed flowing through the membranes’ lumen-side, which varied significantly when the feed flowed at different rates. The reason was inquired by studying the PV behavior at different operating conditions. It was found that the boundary layer resisted the heat transfer, leading to the lower temperature of PV at membrane surface than that of the feed, therefore, the intrinsic PV performance of the membrane could hardly be obtained when the feed flew at low rate. The optimal performance of 19.7 kg/m² h for the permeation flux and more than 80,000 for the separation factor was tested at the flow rate of 148 mL/min with 90 wt% ethanol/water solution at 348 K, yielding an unprecedented PV performance to our knowledge. The results revealed the high reproducibility and uniformity of the membranes prepared by continuous flow system, as well as that the zeolite membranes located on ceramic hollow fiber inner-surface possessed a competitive advantage of PV performance especially of the permeation flux, which have not been realized by the previous studies and may generalize to the other zeolite or metal-organic frameworks (MOF) membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aartificial membranes 3aceramics 3acoordination polymers 3aethanol 3agels 3aheat transfer 3anutrients 3apermeability 3apervaporation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3azeolites 0aZeolite membrane 0aNaA 0aCeramic hollow fiber 0aInner-surface 0aPervaporation 0aDehydration1 aLi, Yu-Xuan1 aWang, Ming1 aXu, Zhen-Liang1 aWei, Yong-Ming1 aShen, Bing-Jie1 aZhu, Ka-Ke0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 570-571 p.445-454dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245014300209300002000352520086600372592002801238650002101266650001401287650003001301650001601331650001301347650001301360650001301373650002301386700001401409700006501423700005801488773013801546856008001684852000901764655001201773IND60749445820221120152553.0210903e20210822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074944582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c039142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNematollahi, Parisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3083-681610aDFT and Microkinetic Comparison of Ru-Doped Porphyrin-like Graphene and Nanotubes toward Catalytic Formic Acid Decomposition and Formation  ap. 18673-18683.  aImmobilization of single metal atoms on a solid host opens numerous possibilities for catalyst designs. If that host is a two-dimensional sheet, sheet curvature becomes a design parameter potentially complementary to host and metal composition. Here, we use a combination of density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling to compare the mechanisms and kinetics of formic acid decomposition and formation, chosen for their relevance as a potential hydrogen storage medium, over single Ru atoms anchored to pyridinic nitrogen in a planar graphene flake (RuN₄-G) and curved carbon nanotube (RuN₄-CNT). Activation barriers are lowered and the predicted turnover frequencies are increased over RuN₄-CNT relative to RuN₄-G. The results highlight the potential of curvature control as a means to achieve high performance and robust catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3aformic acid 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen 3aphysical chemistry1 aMa, Hanyu1 aSchneider, William F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0664-21381 aNeyts, Erik C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3360-31960 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 22, v. 125, no. 34 p.18673-18683dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c039143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003300144245013800177300001800315500002000333520140700353592002801760650002601788650003001814650003501844650001301879650002201892650001301914650002601927650003901953650001301992650001202005650001302017650001602030700002602046700002102072700001802093700002502111773009902136856007802235852000902313655001202322IND60571673620221119011959.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057167362DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2016004642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez‐Hernández, Laura10aIn‐capillary approach to eliminate SDS interferences in antibody analysis by capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry  ap. 1044-1052.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCapillary electrophoresis is an important technique for the characterization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), especially in the pharmaceutical context. However, identification is difficult as upscaling and hyphenation of used methods directly to mass spectrometry is often not possible due to separation medium components that are incompatible with MS detection. Here a CE‐MS method for the analysis of mAbs is presented analyzing SDS‐complexed samples. To obtain narrow and intensive peaks of SDS‐treated antibodies, an in‐capillary strategy was developed based on the co‐injection of positively charged surfactants and methanol as organic solvent. For samples containing 0.2% (v/v) of SDS, recovered MS peak intensities up to 97 and 95% were achieved using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or benzalkonium chloride, respectively. Successful removal of SDS was shown in neutral coated capillaries but also in a capillary with a positively charged coating applying reversed polarity. The usefulness of this in‐capillary strategy was demonstrated also for other proteins and for antibodies dissolved in up to 10% v/v SDS solution, and in other SDS‐containing matrices, including the sieving matrix used in a standard CE‐SDS method and gel‐buffers applied in SDS‐PAGE methods. The developed CE‐MS approaches enable fast and reproducible characterization of SDS‐complexed antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzalkonium chloride 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acoatings 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3asieving 3asolvents 3asurfactants1 aMontealegre, Cristina1 aKiessig, Steffen1 aMoritz, Bernd1 aNeusüss, Christian,0 tElectrophoresis.g2017 Apr., v. 38, no. 7 p.1044-1052dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2016004643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245017100156300001800327500002000345520112000365592002801485650002201513650002001535650001801555650001601573650002801589650002201617650001201639650001801651650000901669650001101678650001901689650004301708650002101751650001301772650002101785651001001806700001901816773013201835856007301967852000902040655001202049IND60547823420221120232415.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054782342DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.76272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRitu, Mathur10aNutritional composition of Stevia rebaudiana, a sweet herb, and its hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic effect on patients with non‐insulin dependent diabetes mellitus  ap. 4231-4234.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes is rapidly rising all over the globe at an alarming rate. India shelters the highest number of diabetics and is thus known as the ‘Diabetes Capital of the World’. The chemical management of diabetes has side effects and hence the present study was undertaken to assess the hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic effect of Stevia rebaudiana in patients with type 2 diabetes, non‐insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Its nutritional composition and use as a sweetener substitute were also assessed. RESULTS: Chemical analysis of dried Stevia leaf powder revealed it to be a nutritious herb with a good iron and fibre content. Intervention trials in diabetics revealed that it significantly lowered fasting and post‐prandial blood glucose levels. The serum triglycerides and VLDL‐C levels were also significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Hence it can be said that Stevia can safely be used as an anti‐diabetic herb, as a sweetener substitute and may help to prevent cardiovascular diseases in patients with long‐standing diabetes. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aStevia rebaudiana 3aadverse effects 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acardiovascular diseases 3achemical analysis 3afasting 3afiber content 3airon 3aleaves 3alipemic effect 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrient content 3apatients 3atriacylglycerols 3aIndia1 aNandini, Johri0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 Sept., v. 96, no. 12 p.4231-4234dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.76273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245009500201300002200296506007600318520115000394592002801544506003701572650001301609650002801622650001601650650001601666650001701682650003001699650001601729650002801745650001101773650001301784700001101797700001601808700001801824700001801842773012701860856007401987852000902061655001202070IND60669400720221207081529.0190920e20151209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066940072DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra18673k2doi7 aPMC47922862pmcid7 a269894802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidoff, S.

The advent of three-dimensional cell cultures in addition to bioreactor type microfluidics has improved the situation. However, these technical advances cannot be easily combined due to practical limitations. Development of a vertical microfluidic cell printer overcomes this obstacle, providing the ability to more closely recapitulate complex cellular environments and responses. As a proof of concept, we investigated the adhesion of fibroblasts under flow on protein-coated surfaces using a novel vertical microfluidic print head to isolate and manipulate both mechanical and biological factors as a model of fibroblast behavior during the foreign body response following implant insertion. A low flow rate with larger microfluidic channels onto a serum-coated surface has been determined to allow the highest density of viable fibroblasts to attach to the surface. While these insights into fibroblast surface attachment may lead to better material designs, the methods developed herein will certainly be useful as a biomaterials testing platform.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3abiocompatible materials 3abioprinting 3abioreactors 3acell culture 3acellular microenvironment 3afibroblasts 3amicrofluidic technology 3amodels 3aprinters1 aAu, D.1 aGale, B.

The correlation between Chl‐a and wind speed is generally negative in areas with deep mixed layers and positive in areas with shallow mixed layers. These patterns are interpreted in terms of the main limiting factors that control phytoplankton growth, i.e., either nutrients that control phytoplankton biomass in areas with positive correlation between Chl‐a and wind speed or light that controls phytoplankton biomass in areas with negative correlation between Chl‐a and wind speed. More complex patterns are observed in the equatorial regions due to regional specificities in physical‐biological interactions.

In the zeolite coating process, silicone polymers are well suited as binding agents due to their unique and outstanding properties like thermal stability and water vapor permeability. In this work, selected silicone binders were used to prepare zeolite coatings which were characterized subsequently for their thermal and mechanical properties and pore accessibilities. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) and temperature-controlled diffuse reflection FT-IR spectroscopy (T-DRIFTS) were performed to assess the thermal stability. Cross-cut, bend, and impact tests were used to investigate the mechanical stability of the coatings. The accessibility of the zeolite pores in the coating was quantified by N₂ porosimetry. Superior coatings could be obtained using Silres MP50 Binder and Silixan’s W220, which had the least impact on the zeolite micropore volume while Silres REN 50 coatings showed the best mechanical stability and were very temperature stable at the same time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abinding agents 3acoatings 3aengineering 3amechanical properties 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3aporosity 3asilicone 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3awater vapor 3azeolites1 aHenninger, Stefan K.1 aHenning, Hans-Martin0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 May 04, v. 55, no. 17 p.4942-4947dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b005583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011700170300001600287520133800303592002801641650001401669650002501683650002301708650003301731650001201764650002301776650002201799650001901821650003101840650002501871650001901896650001301915650001501928650002001943650001901963650002001982653002602002653002502028653002202053653001902075653002002094700001802114700002102132700001702153700001602170700002002186773011202206856008502318852000902403655001202412IND60619655720221119011135.0181222e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061965572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.10.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ming-Yong10aPore size tailoring from ultrafiltration to nanofiltration with PVC-g-PDMA via rapid immersion thermal annealing  ap. 401-409.  aDifferent from the typical interfacial polymerization for nanofiltration membrane fabrication, we proposed a novel method to prepare charged nanofiltration membrane via rapid immersion thermal annealing process with the ultrafiltration membrane, which was prepared from the amphiphilic copolymer, poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PVC-g-PDMA) via non-solvent induced phase separation. The pore structures and chemical properties of the membranes, and annealing conditions including the media where the membrane was annealed, annealing temperature and time, were investigated in detail. It is found that the porous separation layer was collapsed to be a stable, defect-free, and smooth film as the dense separation layer of nanofiltration membrane when it was annealed in n-heptane above its glass transition temperature (Tg) for only 1 min while the pore size cutoff was tailored from 20 nm to 2 nm. Salt rejections were in the order of MgCl2 > NaCl > MgSO4 > Na2SO4 at neutral condition due to Donnan repulsion, indicating a typical positively charged nanofiltration membrane. Overall, this rapid immersion thermal annealing process provides a facile and effective strategy to tailor ultrafiltration membrane toward nanofiltration applications for amphiphilic copolymer based membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aartificial membranes 3acomposite polymers 3aglass transition temperature 3aheptane 3amagnesium chloride 3amagnesium sulfate 3ananofiltration 3aphysicochemical properties 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3aseparation 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3aultrafiltration 0aAmphiphilic copolymer 0aPoly(vinyl chloride) 0aThermal annealing 0aNanofiltration 0aUltrafiltration1 aFang, Li-Feng1 aSun, Chuang-Chao1 aLin, Chun-Er1 aZhu, Bao-Ku1 aChen, Jiang-Hua0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 572 p.401-409dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.10.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009300168300001600261520141500277592002801692650001101720650002001731650002901751650001901780653003701799653003301836653002101869653001701890653001901907700002401926700006201950700002402012700002102036700002202057700002302079700001802102700002202120773009802142856008502240852000902325655001202334IND60786222720221123002231.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078622272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Wencheng10aMachine-learning-assisted high-temperature reservoir thermal energy storage optimization  ap. 384-397.  aHigh-temperature reservoir thermal energy storage (HT-RTES) has the potential to become an indispensable component in achieving the goal of the net-zero carbon economy, given its capability to balance the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation. In this study, a machine-learning-assisted computational framework is presented to identify HT-RTES site with optimal performance metrics by combining physics-based simulation with stochastic hydrogeologic formation and thermal energy storage operation parameters, artificial neural network regression of the simulation data, and genetic algorithm-enabled multi-objective optimization. A doublet well configuration with a layered (aquitard-aquifer-aquitard) generic reservoir is simulated for cases of continuous operation and seasonal-cycle operation scenarios. Neural network-based surrogate models are developed for the two scenarios and applied to generate the Pareto fronts of the HT-RTES performance for four potential HT-RTES sites. The developed Pareto optimal solutions indicate the performance of HT-RTES is operation-scenario (i.e., fluid cycle) and reservoir-site dependent, and the performance metrics have competing effects for a given site and a given fluid cycle. The developed neural network models can be applied to identify suitable sites for HT-RTES, and the proposed framework sheds light on the design of resilient HT-RTES systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aneural networks 3arenewable energy sources 3athermal energy 0aReservoir thermal energy storage 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aMachine learning 0aPareto front 0aNeural network1 aAtkinson, Trevor A.1 aDoughty, Christine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9804-43321 aNeupane, Ghanashyam1 aSpycher, Nicolas1 aMcLing, Travis L.1 aDobson, Patrick F.1 aSmith, Robert1 aPodgorney, Robert0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Sept., v. 197 p.384-397dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03903naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245010300214300001400317506007600331520172100407592002802128506003702156650001702193650001102210650001702221650001602238650002002254650001602274650002102290650001702311650002302328650001802351650001202369650001602381650004102397650001202438650001802450650004002468650001002508650000802518650003002526650001902556650001202575650002102587650001002608651001802618653001002636653001302646653001402659653000702673653000702680653001002687653001102697653001002708653000802718653000702726653000702733653000702740653000902747653001002756653000802766653000902774653000802783700002102791700002002812700002002832700002402852700001502876773010002891856008502991852000903076655001203085IND60678451620221207073351.0200228e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067845162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2019.11.0122doi7 aPMC70979672pmcid7 a319586562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Tamimi, Alia MB10aHoney does not adversely impact blood lipids of adult men and women: a randomized cross-over trial  ap. 87-95.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConsumption of added sugars in the US is estimated to be approximately 1.5 times recommended levels and has been linked to increased risk for developing chronic diseases. We hypothesized that relative to sugar, honey would reduce energy intake and improve serum lipid profiles. To test this, we assessed the short-term (1-week) and relatively long-term (1-month) effects of honey versus sucrose on changes in dietary intake and serum lipid concentrations. Thirty-seven apparently healthy subjects (21 males; 16 females) aged 24–57 years (BMI = 17.6–37.2 kg/m²) completed two 4-week trials in a randomized, cross-over design separated by ≥4-week washout. During each trial, subjects consumed either clover honey or sucrose providing 1.2 g/kg/day of carbohydrate under free-living conditions with instructions to avoid changing their habitual food intake. Serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations were elevated (P < .05) after 1 week for both trials but only remained elevated (P < .05) at the 4-week time-point during sucrose consumption. The elevation after 1 week during the honey trial was concurrent with a transient increase (P < .05) in body weight. No effects on serum concentrations of insulin, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, or high density lipoprotein-cholesterol were detected for either trial. Subjects consumed significantly less energy (P < .05), carbohydrate (P < .005), sugars (P < .05), and saturated fat (P < .05) during the honey trial. These data suggest that honey may serve as a favorable substitute for sucrose with regard to reduced energy intake, carbohydrate and sugars, without negatively influencing serum lipid concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadded sugars 3aadults 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3abody weight 3achronic diseases 3aclover honey 3across-over studies 3aenergy intake 3afemales 3afood intake 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ainsulin 3alipid content 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amales 3amen 3anutrition risk assessment 3asaturated fats 3asucrose 3atriacylglycerols 3awomen 3aUnited States 0aHoney 0aFructose 0aSweetener 0aTG 0aTC 0aLDL-C 0aVLDL-C 0aHDL-C 0aCHO 0aKg 0aMg 0adL 0aSPSS 0aANOVA 0aSEM 0aSIRA 0aFOS1 aPetrisko, Mayumi1 aHong, Mee Young1 aRezende, Lauren1 aClayton, Zachary S.1 aKern, Mark0 tNutrition research.g2020 Feb., v. 74 p.87-95dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2019.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245012700172300001800299500002000317520138100337592002801718650002501746650001601771650002401787650001701811650001401828650001401842650002301856650001201879650002101891650001301912650001601925650002301941650002301964650001501987650001102002650001102013650001702024650001602041650003402057700003202091700003202123700003802155700002802193700002502221700002302246773013202269856007302401852000902474655001202483IND60547823620221120232401.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054782362DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.76382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeenatchisundaram, Sivarajan10aEffect of spice‐incorporated starch edible film wrapping on shelf life of white shrimps stored at different temperatures  ap. 4268-4275.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: White shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei) are a major aquaculture product in the world fishery market. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of clove‐ and cinnamon‐assimilated starch edible films on the shelf life of white shrimps in terms of maintaining their freshness and other organoleptic properties. Physical, chemical, microbial and sensory qualities of edible film‐wrapped white shrimps were studied until they reached their limit of acceptability during storage at different temperatures (10 and 4 °C). RESULTS: Shrimp samples wrapped with spice‐assimilated edible films showed lower bacterial counts. Shelf life extension of edible film‐wrapped white shrimps was estimated to be 14 and 12 days for storage at 10 and 4 °C respectively. Reduced lipid oxidation and release of nitrogen base compounds were noted for edible film‐wrapped shrimp samples. Good consumer acceptance was noted for edible film‐wrapped shrimp samples through sensory evaluation. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that spice‐fused edible films were effective in inhibiting the growth of microbial populations. Reductions in lipid oxidation and total volatile base nitrogen were also achieved through edible film wrapping of shrimps, which increased their consumer acceptance during sensory evaluation. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aaquaculture 3aconsumer acceptance 3aedible films 3afisheries 3afreshness 3alipid peroxidation 3amarkets 3amicrobial growth 3anitrogen 3aplate count 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3ashrimp 3astarch 3astorage time 3atemperature 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen1 aChandrasekar, Chandra Mohan1 aUdayasoorian, Lalitha Priya1 aKavindapadi Rajasekaran, Rakhavan1 aKesavan, Radha krishnan1 aSrinivasan, Babuskin1 aMuthusamy, Sukumar0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 Sept., v. 96, no. 12 p.4268-4275dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.76383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010300174300001600277520143500293536011201728592002801840596001501868596001701883650002401900650002001924650001001944650001301954650002101967650002201988650002902010653002202039653002502061653001902086653002102105653002902126653001902155653002202174653002502196653001502221700001802236700002202254700001902276700002702295700002202322700001702344773010502361856008602466852000902552655001202561IND60731048120221119100110.0211023e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073104812DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2020.18163362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGünzel, Christian10aBeyond Plug and Pray: Context Sensitivity and in silico Design of Artificial Neomycin Riboswitches  ap. 457-467.  aGene regulation in prokaryotes often depends on RNA elements such as riboswitches or RNA thermometers located in the 5′ untranslated region of mRNA. Rearrangements of the RNA structure in response, e.g., to the binding of small molecules or ions control translational initiation or premature termination of transcription and thus mRNA expression. Such structural responses are amenable to computational modelling, making it possible to rationally design synthetic riboswitches for a given aptamer. Starting from an artificial aptamer, we construct the first synthetic transcriptional riboswitches that respond to the antibiotic neomycin. We show that the switching behaviour in vivo critically depends not only on the sequence of the riboswitch itself, but also on its sequence context. We therefore developed in silico methods to predict the impact of the context, making it possible to adapt the design and to rescue non-functional riboswitches.

Small proteins (sub‐35 kDa) translocate very fast which could not be detected by normal patch‐clamp recording instrument due to low temporal resolution. We first introduce pressure into protein study and detection. The pressure‐derived force, combined with the voltage bias, makes very tiny protein (MW < 6.5 kDa) detection possible. Capture rate for Aprotinin is enhanced five times more than that in traditional voltage‐driven method by fine tuning of pressure and voltage. Temporal resolution of Aprotinin detection has improved by decreasing effective driving force. Moreover, we provide potential method to locate the equilibrium range for BSA movement in ionic solution by modulating driving pressure and retard voltage. Our study is of fundamental significance in nanopore research and provides unique platforms to study small proteins and other tiny biomolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrophoresis 3ananopores 3aproteins1 aHu, Rui1 aLi, Xiaoqing1 aTong, Xin1 aYu, Dapeng1 aZhao, Qing0 tElectrophoresis.g2017 Apr., v. 38, no. 8 p.1130-1138dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2016004103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015900165300001600324520134800340592002801688650002101716650002601737650002501763650001501788650003901803650002201842650001501864650002001879650001301899650003401912650001901946650001501965650002501980653002802005653002502033653004802058653004102106653002802147700001902175700001802194700001602212700001702228773011602245856008502361852000902446655001202455IND60619656020221119011935.0210114e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061965602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.10.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPing, Meng10aSurface modification of polyvinylidene fluoride membrane by atom-transfer radical-polymerization of quaternary ammonium compound for mitigating biofouling  ap. 286-293.  aFabrication of antibiofouling membrane is a vital but challenging task for the treatment of water and wastewater using membrane-based processes. In this work, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) were grafted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane via surface-initiated activators regenerated by electron transfer atom-transfer radical-polymerization (ARGET ATRP) method. Membrane surface characterization demonstrated that QAC was successfully grafted onto the PVDF membrane surface. The QAC-modified membrane (MQ) demonstrated prominent antimicrobial capability by destruction of cell integrity, with an inhibition rate ~98.3% of E. coli and ~98.5% of S. aureus, respectively. Batch filtration tests showed that MQ membrane had lower flux decline rate compared to control membrane (M0) under constant-pressure filtration. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis revealed that less total cells and more dead cells were present on MQ membrane compared to M0. The quantity of polysaccharides and proteins on MQ membrane was reduced as well. The grafted QAC on PVDF membrane also showed favorable stability during repeated fouling-cleaning tests. These results highlight that the ARGET ATRP method for grafting QAC onto polymeric membrane surface is a robust way to fabricate low-biofouling membrane for water and wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aartificial membranes 3abiofouling 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aelectron transfer 3afiltration 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3athermoplastics 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAntibiofouling membrane 0aWastewater treatment 0aActivators regenerated by electron transfer 0aAtom-transfer radical-polymerization 0aPolyvinylidene fluoride1 aZhang, Xingran1 aLiu, Mingxian1 aWu, Zhichao1 aWang, Zhiwei0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 570-571 p.286-293dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.10.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007500172520107300247592002801320650001401348650001301362650001501375650001101390650001101401650002701412650001401439650002601453650001101479650001501490650001501505653001501520653001501535653002301550653000801573700002301581700001901604700002001623700002201643700002001665700003101685773010601716856008701822852000901909655001201918IND60786223120221122184012.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078622312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Krishna10aProduction of biopolymers from food waste: Constrains and perspectives  aFood is an essential commodity for the survival of any form of life on earth. Yet generation of plethora of food waste has significantly elevated the global concern for food scarcity, human and environment deterioration. Also, increasing use of polymers derived from petroleum hydrocarbons has elevated the concerns towards the depletion of this non-renewable resource. In this review, the use of waste food for the production of bio-polymers and their associated challenges has been thoroughly investigated using scientometric analysis. Various categories of food waste including fruit, vegetable, and oily waste can be employed for the production of different biopolymers including polyhydroxyalkanoates, starch, cellulose, collagen and others. The advances in the production of biopolymers through chemical, microbial or enzymatic process that increases the acceptability of these biopolymers has been reviewed. The comprehensive compiled information may assist researchers for addressing and solving the issues pertaining to food wastage and fossil fuel depletion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acollagen 3afood waste 3afruits 3ahumans 3anonrenewable resources 3apetroleum 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3astarch 3atechnology 3avegetables 0aBiopolymer 0aFood waste 0aWaste valorization 0aPHA1 aVishvakarma, Reena1 aSharma, Poonam1 aSingh, Amarnath1 aKumar Gaur, Vivek1 aVarjani, Sunita1 aKumar Srivastava, Janmejai0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Oct., v. 361 p.127650-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009000162500002000252520147100272592002801743650002001771650001501791650002101806650001101827650001701838650001301855650000901868651001801877700001901895700002301914773012601937856007702063852000902140655001202149IND60781240120221118001312.0220626e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078124012DNAL7 a10.1029/2009JC0060142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamura, Hitoshi10aImpact of nonlinear energy transfer on the wave field in Pacific hindcast experiments  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe investigated the impact of nonlinear energy transfer (Sₙₗ) on wave fields by performing hindcast experiments for the Pacific Ocean. Specifically, we evaluated model performance using SRIAM, which was developed to accurately reproduce Sₙₗ with lower computational cost than more rigorous algorithms. The model results were compared to in situ wave parameters as well as results from another model employing the widely used discrete interaction approximation method (DIA). Comparison of the model results with buoy observations revealed a negligible difference between SRIAM and DIA for significant wave heights. However, the difference for the peak period was quite pronounced, especially around the tropical Pacific, where a persistent bias in peak frequency was improved by using SRIAM. This study also highlights the impact of source terms on spectral shape under a realistic model setting. Detailed analysis of spectral shape indicated that SRIAM can quantitatively capture the overshoot phenomena around the spectral peak during wave growth. In addition, Sₙₗ played a major role in maintaining the equilibrium range; it reacted to changes in the net external sources to cancel out the total source term. These results show that the magnitude of high‐frequency dissipation controls the spectral tail exponent and that the balanced net external source is responsible for the reproduction of the f⁻⁴ power law behavior in the equilibrium range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3ageophysics 3amodel validation 3amodels 3areproduction 3aresearch 3atail 3aPacific Ocean1 aWaseda, Takuji1 aMiyazawa, Yasumasa0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2010 Dec., v. 115, no.

The aim of red-listing sensu IUCN is to evaluate the risk of extinction of a species using a comparable, revisable, transparent and objective assessment method. The evaluation estimates the potential change in the species’ population size over time, aiming to infer extinction risk. Both extremely rare species and more common ones experiencing ongoing decline may be at risk of extinction. Red-listing is an assessment of conservation status, directing awareness and providing a scientific basis for management and decision-making. The IUCN criteria were originally designed for global assessments. However, they can be, and are, commonly applied at the national or regional level. This paper summarizes the basic aspects and usefulness of red-listing in a mycological context, and suggests methods for fungal red-listing that are applicable to most fungal groups, even with limited information on the species being considered. The suggested methods are based on the accumulated experience of national fungal red-listing throughout the world, coupled with recently published research on fungal diversity, distributions, and population biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aextinction 3afungi 3apopulation size 3arisk1 aMueller, Gregory M.0 tFungal ecology.g2011 Apr., v. 4, no. 2 p.147-162dElsevier Ltdx1754-50487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2010.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007700160300002000237520090100257592002801158650004401186650001801230650001701248650003801265650002001303650002601323650001101349650002201360650003301382650001301415650002201428650002101450650001601471700001801487700001601505700002001521700001701541700001601558773012301574856007401697852000901771655001201780IND60667343020221119223228.0190919e20150511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066734302DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra01241d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xiaozhong10aPolyacrylonitrile/lignin sulfonate blend fiber for low-cost carbon fiber  ap. 42259-42265.  aPolyacrylonitrile/lignin sulfonate (PAN/LS) blend fibers were spun via a wet spinning process. The fiber structure, mechanical properties and thermal stability of the precursor fibers were studied by FT-IR, SEM, tensile tester, and TG-DSC. Results indicated that there was no chemical crosslinking between PAN and LS during the process of wet spinning. PAN and LS had good compatibility in the blend fibers. LS could weaken the skin of the blend fibers and reduce the fiber structure defects. The increase of dope concentration could improve the fiber structure and mechanical properties. LS blending with PAN could reduce fiber weight loss in the thermal stabilization process, and most importantly the precursor fibers could be stabilized rapidly without fiber fusion.

The effects of synthesis and activation parameters on the availability of open Cu metal sites in the MOF were studied via measurements of crystallinity, textural properties, structural defects, and water desorption, as well as binary 1-hexene/hexane vapor breakthrough chracteristics. A reduced crystallization temperature and improved solvent exchange with methanol were found to lead to CuBTC adsorbents with higher olefin selectivity and capacity. In situ Fourier transform infrared and mass spectrometry measurements were used to quantify the structural defects and availability of open metal sites in the MOF as a function of the activation conditions. Based upon these measurements, we identify the relationships between the defects, activation conditions, open metal site availability, and consequent separation performance. Recommendations are made for appropriate activation and desorption conditions that improve olefin selectivity while maintaining total capacity. This investigation led to the identification of a functional CuBTC adsorbent with a selectivity of ∼5 for a 10%/90% 1-hexene/hexane liquid feed mixture at 50 °C, and also suggests a systematic methodology to determine operating conditions for MOF adsorbents with open metal sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adesorption 3aengineering 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3aolefin 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atexture 3avapors1 aFoo, Guo Shiou1 aRungta, Meha1 aSangar, Neeraj1 aSievers, Carsten1 aSholl, David S.,1 aNair, Sankar0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 May 04, v. 55, no. 17 p.5043-5053dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b007743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012000172520086300292592002801155650001701183650001101200650002001211650003201231650002601263650001501289650002101304653001101325653001301336653002501349653003301374653002401407700001801431700002101449700002601470700001701496773010601513856008701619852000901706655001201715IND60786223220221122215746.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078622322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Priyanka10aBarriers in biogas production from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste: A circular bioeconomy perspective  aBiogas-based circular bioeconomy can provide a long-term way out of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The barriers to biogas production are obstructing the growth of the biogas-based circular bioeconomy. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the barriers to biogas in developing countries for the wider implementation of biogastechnology. Twenty barriers are identified and categorized into technical, logistical, institutional, and social dimensions. The analytical hierarchy process is applied to rank the barriers. The result of barrier ranking shows that the lack of appropriate segregation facilities is the most crucial barrier, followed by waste characteristics variation, and inconsistent supply. This study will provide an outline for rational decision-making in the sustainable organic fraction of municipal waste management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomics 3abiogas 3adecision making 3agas production (biological) 3amunicipal solid waste 3atechnology 3awaste management 0aBiogas 0aBarriers 0aDeveloping Countries 0aAnalytical Hierarchy Process 0aCircular Bioeconomy1 aYadav, Sudeep1 aSingh, Dhananjay1 aShekher Giri, Balendu1 aMishra, P.K.0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Oct., v. 362 p.127671-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245012300194300001800317500002000335520129600355592002801651650002701679650001601706650002801722650001701750650002201767650002101789650002401810650001701834650001801851650000901869650002401878650001501902650002601917700001101943700002101954700002401975700005601999700006102055773015302116856007502269852000902344655001202353IND60769716320221120141940.0220310e20220330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076971632DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.115372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1270-386510aOral supplementation of sea cucumber and its hydrolysate mitigates ultraviolet A‐induced photoaging in hairless mice  ap. 1987-1994.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation promotes skin photoaging, which is clinically characterized by dryness, laxity, and wrinkling. Sea cucumber (Stichopus japonicus) (SC) is a marine organism with culinary and medicinal applications, especially in Asian countries. It is also a potential nutraceutical as it exhibits bioactive effects, such as antioxidant, antitumor, and anticancer activity. This study examined the effects of SC and its hydrolysate (SCH) on ultraviolet A (UVA) induced skin barrier function and wrinkle formation using hairless mice. RESULTS: Ultraviolet A significantly induced transepidermal water loss and wrinkle formation, which were significantly mitigated upon oral administration of SC and SCH. Sea cucumber also mitigated the UVA‐induced downregulation of epidermal natural moisturizing factors and the upregulation of Aqp3, Mmp13, Tnfa, and Il6 mRNA levels in the mouse skin. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that dietary SC and SCH exert anti‐photoaging effects by modulating filaggrin synthesis and desquamation in the epidermis and regulating the NF‐κB pathway in the skin. Our research indicates that SC and SCH have potential applications in nutricosmetics for photoaging. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aagriculture 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidants 3aaquatic organisms 3achronic exposure 3adietary supplements 3ahydrolysates 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3aoral administration 3aphotoaging 3aultraviolet radiation1 aLu, Yi1 aKurono, Masahiro1 aMatahira, Yoshiharu1 aManabe, Yuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5663-00741 aSugawara, Tatsuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1203-55210 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2022 Mar. 30, v. 102, no. 5 p.1987-1994dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.115373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245011300162300002000275520141800295592002801713650001501741650001401756650001201770650001401782650001401796650001501810650001501825650001701840650001601857700005401873700005101927773013801978856008002116852000902196655001202205IND60749446420221118005236.0210903e20210823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074944642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c045502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aPalladium Phosphide/Black Phosphorus Heterostructures with Enhanced Ethanol Oxidation Activity and Stability  ap. 18717-18724.  aElectrocatalytic performance for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) under alkaline conditions can be improved by the rational design of catalysts. Palladium phosphates have shown higher electrical conductivities and activity compared with Pd. Nevertheless, the synthesis of palladium phosphide is complex and requires a relatively high temperature. Here, we report a simple synthesis method of palladium phosphide/black phosphorus heterostructure (Pd₃P/BP) with enhanced EOR activity. BP is used instead of other phosphorus sources for several reasons: (i) BP has a lone pair of electrons, which easily coordinate with the metal atoms to form palladium phosphides. (ii) As a two-dimensional layered structure material, BP has a large specific surface area, which is beneficial for the dispersion of metal nanoparticles, and thus improves the utilization rate of catalysts owing to the expanded active sites. (iii) Phosphorus species (P⁰) might inhibit the adsorption of CO on the catalyst surface. (iv) BP has an excellent adsorption capacity to water molecules, thereby promoting the generation of OH groups and stripping of reaction intermediates, contributing to superior EOR activity and stability of Pd₃P/BP. The activity of Pd₃P/BP (7411.2 mA mgPd–¹) is about 9.1-fold higher than the commercial Pd/C (814.8 mA mgPd–¹) and significantly higher than that of Pd₃P + BP (3065.4 mA mgPd–¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3aethanol 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3aphosphides 3aphosphorus 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aWeng, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5813-60611 aXu, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3096-32170 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 23, v. 125, no. 34 p.18717-18724dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c045503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012100159300002000280520076400300592002801064650002201092650000901114650001301123650001301136650001601149700001901165700001801184700001801202700002401220700002301244700002201267700001801289773012501307856007401432852000901506655001201515IND60669401420221119223719.0190920e20151103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066940142DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra18690k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImoto, Hiroaki10aEffect of alkyl groups on emission properties of aggregation induced emission active N-alkyl arylaminomaleimide dyes  ap. 94344-94350.  aAggregation induced emission (AIE) active N-alkyl aminomaleimide dyes with various kinds of N-alkyl groups were synthesized in a one pot process.

Chain length, hydroxyl group and branching structure were important in the emission properties such as quantum yield and emission wavelength. Furthermore, it was found that one of the dyes showed mechanochromism; the green emission of crystal samples turned to blue emission after grinding. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the surrounding around the luminophore was dominant in the emission behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3adyes 3agrinding 3amoieties 3awavelengths1 aNohmi, Katsuya1 aKizaki, Kohei1 aWatase, Seiji1 aMatsukawa, Kimihiro1 aYamamoto, Shunsuke1 aMitsuishi, Masaya1 aNaka, Kensuke0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 03, v. 5, no. 114 p.94344-94350dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra18690k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015600164300001800320500002000338520141600358592002801774650001901802650002001821650001601841650002201857650002501879650001901904650001301923650003301936700002001969700002401989700002402013700002402037773009902061856007802160852000902238655001202247IND60571674420221119005145.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057167442DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2016005322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulsing, Chadin10aUse of peak sharpening effects to improve the separation of chiral compounds with molecularly imprinted porous polymer layer open‐tubular capillaries  ap. 1179-1187.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis investigation demonstrates the application of a new peak sharpening technique to improve the separation of difficult‐to‐resolve racemic mixtures in capillary electro‐chromatography. Molecularly imprinted porous layer open tubular (MIP‐PLOT) capillaries, prepared by a layer‐on‐layer polymerization approach with Z‐l‐Asp‐OH as the template, were selected to validate the approach. SEM revealed that the polymer film thickness can be varied by changes in both the polymer composition and the layer‐on‐layer regime. Capillaries made with methacrylic acid as the functional monomer could not separate the Z‐Asp‐OH racemate, due to weak interactions between the MIP‐PLOT material and the target analytes. In contrast, MIP‐PLOT capillaries prepared with 4‐vinylpyridine as the functional monomer resulted in increased ionic interactions with the target analytes. Separation of the enantiomers could be enhanced when a peak zone sharpening effect was exploited through the use of specific BGE compositions and by taking advantage of eigenpeak phenomena. In this manner, the position of a sharpening zone and the peak shape of the sample analytes could be fine‐tuned, so that when the sharpening zone and the target analyte co‐migrated the separation of the Z‐l‐Asp‐OH enantiomer from its d‐enantiomer in a racemic mixture could be achieved under overloading conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3aelectrophoresis 3aenantiomers 3afilms (materials) 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aYang, Yuanzhong1 aChowdhury, Jamil M.1 aBoysen, Reinhard I.1 aHearn, Milton T.

Yet, clinical evaluation of the first-generation nicotine vaccines did not meet expectations because only a subset of immunized subjects achieved effective serum antibody levels. Recent studies suggest that vaccine design affects B cell activation, and that the frequency of the hapten-specific B cell subsets contributes to vaccine efficacy against drugs of abuse. To extend this hypothesis to nicotine immunogens, we synthesized a novel hapten containing a carboxymethylureido group at the 2-position of the nicotine structure (2CMUNic) and compared its efficacy to the previously characterized 6CMUNic hapten. Haptens were conjugated to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein, and evaluated for efficacy against nicotine in mice using the clinically approved alum adjuvant. Using a novel fluorescent antigen-based magnetic enrichment strategy paired with multicolor flow cytometry analysis, polyclonal hapten-specific B cell subsets were measured in mice immunized with either 6CMUNic-KLH or 2CMUNic-KLH. The 6CMUNic-KLH showed significantly greater efficacy than 2CMUNic-KLH on nicotine distribution to serum and to the brain. The 6CMUNic-KLH elicited higher anti-nicotine serum antibody titers, and greater expansion of hapten-specific B cells than 2CMUNic-KLH. Within the splenic polyclonal B cell population, a higher number of hapten-specific IgMhigh and germinal centre B cells predicted greater vaccine efficacy against nicotine distribution. These early pre-clinical findings suggest that hapten structure affects activation of B cells, and that variations in the frequency of early-activated hapten-specific B cell subsets underlie individual differences in vaccine efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadjuvants 3aalum 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3abrain 3aflow cytometry 3ahaptens 3aillicit drugs 3akeyhole limpet hemocyanin 3amice 3anicotine 3avaccine development 3avaccines 0aAntigen-specific B cells 0aNicotine 0aAddiction 0aVaccines 0aBiomarkers1 aTucker, A.M.1 aRunyon, S.P.1 aCarroll, F.I.1 aPravetoni, M.0 tVaccine.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 33, no. 46 p.6332-6339dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245010000199300002000299520161000319592002801929650003001957650001101987650001001998650001702008650001102025650001702036700005702053700005302110700006902163773013802232856008002370852000902450655001202459IND60749446620220217000000.0210903e20210819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074944662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c046652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9018-776910aInfluence of Glass Composition on the Luminescence Mechanisms of CdSe Quantum-Dot-Doped Glasses  ap. 18916-18926.  aIn this work, we characterized the electronic structure of CdSe quantum dots embedded in a series of x Na₂O, (1–x) SiO₂ glass matrices (x = 0, 0.25, 0.33, and 0.5). We analyzed the impact of the glass matrix composition on both the atomic structure of the quantum dot (QD) and the QD/glass interface, as well as the luminescence mechanisms, using density functional theory calculations. The increase of Na₂O content in the glass matrices was found to promote the formation of Cd–O and Se–Na interfacial bonds and disrupt the Cd–Se bonds network. In particular, we show that the glass composition directly affects the nature of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO). According to the atomic structure, band gap distribution, and density of states calculation, we find that there is significant reconstruction of the QD and that the picture sometimes proposed of a “pristine quantum dot” surrounded by glass is not realistic. The introduction of CdSe QD significantly decreased the HOMO–LUMO gap of the glass compared to pristine glasses, and the interfacial bonds greatly contributed to the frontier orbitals without forming midgap states. We propose a new energy diagram, quite different from the traditional model, to explain the luminescence of CdSe quantum-dot-doped glasses, originating from the intrinsic emission of this hybrid system {QD + glass}. These results improve our understanding of the luminescence of CdSe quantum-dot-doped glasses, explaining the reason for the poor quantum efficiency and broad emission linewidth compared with their colloidal counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aglass 3aluminescence 3amodels 3aquantum dots1 aZhao, Xiujian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2517-26051 aLiu, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4324-64091 aCoudert, François-Xavier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5318-39100 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 19, v. 125, no. 34 p.18916-18926dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c046653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015500165520134600320592002801666650002501694650001301719650002501732650002001757650001101777650002601788650001601814650001301830650001201843650002901855650001601884650001001900650001601910653001301926653002301939653002201962653001101984700001701995700001902012700001602031700002502047700006002072700002202132773011202154856008202266852000902348655001202357IND60678452420221119023843.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067845242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1109942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuhibi, Salma10aLC-MS/MS methodology for simultaneous determination of patulin and citrinin in urine and plasma applied to a pilot study in colorectal cancer patients  aBiomarker-driven research has been proposed as a successful method to assess the exposure of individuals to xenobiotics, including mycotoxins, through estimation of their metabolites in biological fluids. A methodology to determine patulin (PAT) and citrinin (CIT) in human urine and plasma using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated in the present study. Selectivity/specificity, linearity, limit of detection and quantification, apparent recovery, intraday- and interday-precision and measurement uncertainty were investigated for validation purposes. Finally, the method was used to analyze human urine (n = 100) and plasma (n = 100) case-control samples, where 50 samples originated from colorectal cancer patients and 50 from age/sex-matched controls. This case-control study revealed that PAT was not detected in urine samples, however occurred in 25% of the analysed plasma samples with an average concentration of 11.62 ± 6.67 ng/mL in the positive samples. CIT was found in urine samples (74%) and plasma samples (36%) with average concentrations in the positive samples of 0.45 ± 0.24 ng/mL and 0.49 ± 0.2 ng/mL respectively. No statistically significant difference of PAT and CIT concentration among colorectal cancer and control patients (p > 0.05) was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase-control studies 3acitrinin 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3apatients 3apatulin 3atandem mass spectrometry 3auncertainty 3aurine 3axenobiotics 0aLC-MS/MS 0aMycotoxin exposure 0aColorectal cancer 0aPlasma1 aVidal, Arnau1 aMartins, Carla1 aGali, Ridha1 aHedhili, Abderrazzek1 aDe Saeger, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2160-72531 aDe Boevre, Marthe0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2020 Feb., v. 136 p.110994-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1109943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245009300175300001600268520133400284592002801618650001701646650002201663650001701685650001901702650001301721650001501734650001301749650002201762650001101784650001101795650002201806650001701828651002801845651001301873653001501886653001001901653001401911653002501925653002101950700001901971700002001990700002102010700001802031773014502049856009002194852000902284655001202293IND60522423920221117160919.0160602e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052242392DNAL7 a10.3161/15081109ACC2016.18.1.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaxinová, Edita10aForaging Strategy of Kuhl's Pipistrelle at the Northern Edge of the Species Distribution  ap. 215-222.  aRapid range expansion of Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) has been observed throughout Europe, and in addition to its natural habitats of temperate grasslands and agricultural areas, the species is common in city centres, where it roosts in human-made structures. It has been suggested that the flexibility of this species in regard to different human-induced changes, such as climate change and urbanization, is responsible for the apparent range shift. Although P. kuhlii exhibits one of the highest degrees of synanthropy among bat species in Europe, its ecology has thus far not been thoroughly studied. This study aims to describe its foraging and roosting selection in Central Europe (eastern Slovakia), where the northernmost maternity colony of P. kuhlii roosts in human settlements. Radio-tracking was conducted during the pre-parturition and post-lactation periods. We identified six artificial roosts within the study area that were interlinked, with bats switching between them. Ten individuals were used for modelling foraging-habitat utilization, which revealed that bats were highly selective. The only habitat type that bats clearly preferred, regardless of season, was an urban illuminated area close to a river. Only slight avoidance — of open areas — was observed during the pre-parturition period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPipistrellus 3aagricultural land 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aforaging 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ahuman settlements 3amodels 3arivers 3aroosting behavior 3aurbanization 3aCentral European region 3aSlovakia 0aChiroptera 0aurban 0atelemetry 0aprefabricated houses 0aforaging habitat1 aKipson, Marina1 aNaďo, Ladislav1 aHradická, Petra1 aUhrin, Marcel0 tActa chiropterologica.g2016 June, v. 18, no. 1 p.215-222dMuseum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of Sciencex1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F15081109ACC2016.18.1.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01198naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245004700169300001000216520045000226592002800676650001400704650001000718650001500728773011000743856008200853852000900935655001200944IND60681841020221122235806.0210216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068184102DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-019-9978-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarlikar, Geeta J10aPhase-separation in chromatin organization  ap. 5.  aThe organization of chromatin into different types of compact versus open states provides a means to fine tune gene regulation.

This study proposed a novel strategy to valorize food waste digestate into multifunctional hydrochar by recirculating the PW in the HCl-catalyzed HTC process. The produced multifunctional hydrochar could be utilized as a high-quality solid fuel with HHV of 27.9 MJ kg⁻¹ (hydrochar without PW recirculation) and a slow-release fertilizer by converting the complex Ca and P compounds from the food waste digestate into a Ca-P deposit (hydroxyapatite) with more than a 93 % P recovery rate (hydrochar with PW recirculation). Adding fresh HCl in the HTC PW recirculation system only displayed a marginal catalytic impact on the hydrochar properties after two cycles of recirculation. This study demonstrated the importance of inherent Ca in the feedstocks and the dual role of HCl in the HTC with PW recirculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood waste 3ahydrochars 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3ahydroxyapatite 3aslow-release fertilizers 3atechnology 0aAnaerobic digestate 0aFood waste hydrochar 0aSustainable bioenergy 0aWaste valorization 0aWastewater reuse1 aCao, Yang1 aXu, Zibo1 aYou, Siming1 aRuan, Roger1 aGao, Bin1 aWong, K.

In this study, nanocomposite membranes were prepared by synthesizing calcium oxalate (CaOx) nanoparticles in confined space of the layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembled polymer network through bio-inspired mineralization. The active layer was tightly coated on hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile substrate with thickness less than 200 nm. The CaOx nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the polymer matrix with diameter less than 50 nm. The hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite membranes was decreased due to the incorporation of CaOx nanoparticles. And the free volume properties were tuned by creating new polymer/filler interface. At precursor concentration of 1 mM, the permeation flux increased by 14% to 958 g/(m²h), the separation factor increased by 2.36 times to 1562 compared to the control membrane, and the membrane showed good operating stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acalcium oxalate 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3amineralization 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apermeability 3apervaporation 3apolyacrylonitrile 0aLayer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly 0aNanocomposite membranes 0aUltrathin membranes 0aBio-inspired mineralization 0aPervaporation dehydration1 aJiang, Zhongyi1 aLi, Changdong1 aHou, Lipeng1 aChen, Cheng1 aYang, Hao1 aPan, Fusheng1 aWu, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6600-44591 aZhang, Peng1 aCao, Xingzhong0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 570-571 p.44-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.09.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001800159245008600177300001600263500000900279500001500288520182300303592002802126650001902154650002302173650001502196650002102211650001602232650002402248650001602272650001702288650001102305650002402316650002602340650002002366650002102386650001202407650001202419650001302431650002002444650002002464651001502484653000902499700002002508700001702528700001702545773014802562852000902710856009602719655001202815IND2124180020221119184027.0191125e199701  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212418002DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100010019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaben, M.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of CRP and wheat-fallow (W-F) soils using soil biological and chemical parameters and C and N mineralization processes. The study was conducted on 20 CRP/W-F paired sites in eastern Washington, on Ritzville silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Calciorthidic Haploxerolls). Soils collected from the paired fields were analyzed for chemical and biological parameters that have been suggested as indicators of soil quality. Potential enzyme activities and soil N were higher in the CRP soil than the W-F soil. Although there were no significant differences in total organic carbon (TOC) or microbial biomass carbon (MBC) the C mineralization potentials and C pools were significantly different between the CRP and W-F soils. Soil biota measurements showed there was greater active bacterial biomass in the CRP soil but greater fungal-feeding nematodes, flagellates, and amoebae in the W-F soil. The C mineralization study suggests that there is a significant increase in the secondary C pool of the CRP soil, which may indicate a buildup of higher quality soil organic matter and the potential for higher enzyme levels. When grass or straw was added to each soil type, the W-F soil produced more CO₂ with either substrate than the CRP soil, indicating C limiting conditions in the W-F soil. Since it is unknown what constitutes good soil quality, these shifts in chemical and biological parameters may seem subtle. However, in general, trends in the data indicated that soil quality in the CRP was improved after 4 to 7 yr, compared with its previous management in W-F cropland.  aPublisher supplied data 3amineralization 3aagricultural soils 3asoil fauna 3anitrogen content 3aland policy 3asoil organic matter 3awheat soils 3asoil enzymes 3acarbon 3asoil microorganisms 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3asoil management 3asoil respiration 3asoil pH 3abiomass 3aland use 3aenzyme activity 3agrassland soils 0aWashington 0asoil1 aBezdicek, D.

A recent analysis of observational data from the subtropical North Atlantic, however, demonstrates that productivity in this region is not correlated with stratification on interannual time scales over the modern observational record, but is instead impacted by other dynamics that affect vertical mixing and nutrient supply. Herein, we examine data from the Hawaiian Ocean Time series program's Station ALOHA (A Long‐Term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment) in the subtropical North Pacific. We find that stratification and productivity are not strongly correlated at this location over the observational record. In contrast to the North Atlantic, the weakness of correlation observed at ALOHA may reflect the strongly stratified ecosystem of the eastern subtropical North Pacific and a lack of sufficiently strong interannual forcing in this region. Although basin‐wide climate processes (namely El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadel Oscillation) have previously been suggested to impact local stratification and vertical nutrient supply at ALOHA, we find no evidence of a strong or consistent linkage. Comparing local ecosystem variability to the recently identified North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, however, we observe a correlation with local subsurface productivity and salinity. The correlations have similar structure in both space (i.e., depth) and time and are possibly linked to dynamics associated with the formation and advection of water masses in the central gyre.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3abiological assessment 3aecosystems 3aeuphotic zone 3aobservational studies 3aprimary productivity 3aresearch 3asalinity 3atime series analysis1 aLozier, M.

In vivo measurements tested included electromyography (EMG) and acoustic analysis of the swallowing sound to investigate the dynamic changes of food texture during oral processing. As a model of foods for dysphagia patients, the gels were soft enough to be eaten by compression between the tongue and the hard palate without biting by the teeth. From EMG, no significant differences were found between elastic gels and plastic gels in the duration of oral processing and the EMG activity of the suprahyoid musculature when compared at equivalent hardness. The EMG activity of the suprahyoid musculature correlated well with the compression load of gels at 95% strain. From the acoustic analysis, the plastic gels required shorter time to transfer through the pharynx and were scored higher in sensory cohesiveness than the elastic gels. Results indicate that oral processing of soft gels requires equivalent EMG activity of the suprahyoid musculature when the gel hardness is the same. Also, the plastic gels flow through the pharynx as one coherent bolus with smaller variation of the flow speed. Texture of foods for dysphagia patients should be optimized in terms of viscoelasticity so that they can easily transform to swallowable bolus during oral processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustic properties 3acohesion 3adeglutition 3adysphagia 3aelectromyography 3afoods 3agels 3ahardness 3ahydrocolloids 3amodels 3apalate 3apatients 3apharynx 3aplastics 3ateeth 3atexture 3atongue 3aviscoelasticity1 aIshihara, Sayaka1 aNakauma, Makoto1 aKohyama, Kaoru1 aNishinari, Katsuyoshi0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2012 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.412-420dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011900163300001600282520146300298592002801761650002601789650001601815650000901831650001501840650000901855650001001864650001601874650001501890650001801905650000901923650001001932650002001942650001201962650002101974700001701995700001602012700001902028700001802047773008802065856008102153852000902234655001202243IND60121297720221116172448.0150223e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012129772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-014-2155-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Weimin10aSize-dependent feeding of omnivorous Nile tilapia in a macrophyte-dominated lake: implications for lake management  ap. 125-134.  aSome species or size classes of omnivorous/herbivorous fish in (sub) tropical lakes feed on periphyton and phytoplankton, potentially promoting growth of macrophytes via reduced shading. Others feed on macrophytes, thereby enhancing the risk of having a turbid phytoplankton-dominated system in shallow lakes. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an abundant species in many warm lakes, feed on periphyton, phytoplankton, and macrophytes depending on their size and may therefore have a size-dependent effect on lake ecosystems. We conducted a C–N stable isotope analysis on different size-classes of tilapia and their potential prey to determine their food sources in a tropical eutrophic shallow lake dominated by submerged macrophytes. The shares of the dominant macrophyte, Vallisneria natans, periphyton, and seston in the diet of fish averaged approx. 54, 26, and 20%, respectively. Large-bodied specimens fed mainly on macrophytes, while small-bodied specimens were more dependent on periphyton, seston, or detritus. The results were confirmed by subsequent stomach analysis. We conclude that small-sized tilapia promote macrophyte growth by removing periphyton and seston, whereas large-bodied individuals may restrict macrophyte development. Selective removal of large-bodied tilapia might, therefore, stimulate the development of submerged macrophytes and promote or maintain a clear water state in eutrophic shallow lakes with abundant tilapia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aVallisneria 3adiet 3aecosystems 3afish 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3aperiphyton 3aphytoplankton 3arisk 3ashade 3astable isotopes 3astomach 3awater management1 aNing, Jiajia1 aZhong, Ping1 aJeppesen, Erik1 aLiu, Zhengwen0 tHydrobiologia.g2015 May, v. 749, no. 1 p.125-134dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-2155-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245009900180300001600279520167200295592002801967650001501995650001602010650000902026650001202035650002302047650002502070650001202095650001402107650002502121650002802146650001002174650001902184650000702203650002402210650001402234650002602248650002102274650002102295650002102316650001002337650001702347651001302364700002602377700002102403773012302424856008202547852000902629655001202638IND60593683920221119145419.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059368392DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9884-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjousse Kanouo, BorisMerlain10aQuality of Biochars Made from Eucalyptus Tree Bark and Corncob Using a Pilot-Scale Retort Kiln  ap. 899-909.  aIn many developing countries, traditional earth-mound kilns are still the principal technology for biochar production. The present study focused on the production and characterization of two biochars from common agricultural and forestry residues in Cameroon: corncob and eucalyptus tree bark. A pilot-scale retort kiln, made from local material, was constructed for biochar production. Its production efficiency varied between 33 and 68%, compared to the 10–22% obtained with traditional biochar production systems. Both biochars exhibited good agronomic properties and fulfilled key quality criteria for soil carbon sequestration, as described by the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and the International Biochar Initiative (IBI). Organic carbon (Corg) > 50%, H/Corg < 0.7, and potential toxic elements far below environmental threshold values. Both biochars passed seed germination and worm inhibition toxicity tests. They were characterized by similar physical properties, apart from greater water absorption observed for corncob biochar (CCB). Chemical properties differed; CCB had higher buffer capacity, and was richer in soluble potassium (5473 ppm) and in graphitic like carbon (37.7%) compared to eucalyptus bark biochar (EB) (897 ppm and 24.9%). The latter was less alkaline (pH 8.1 vs. 9.3 for CCB), had more than twice its electrical conductivity (0.68 vs. 0.25 dS m⁻¹ for CCB) and ash content (10.1 vs. 5.3%); EB had higher sum of cations. Our results demonstrated that the constructed pyrolyser could be a current and feasible alternative to be used by farmers in Cameroon, to produce a quality biochar product from common residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aash content 3abark 3abiochar 3abuffering capacity 3acarbon sequestration 3acations 3acorn cobs 3adeveloping countries 3aelectrical conductivity 3akilns 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aphysical properties 3apotassium 3aproduction technology 3aseed germination 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity testing 3atrees 3awater uptake 3aCameroon1 aAllaire, SuzanneEdith1 aMunson, AlisonD.0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 June, v. 9, no. 6 p.899-909dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9884-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245011700188300001600305500001500321520093700336592002801273650002401301650002701325650002101352650004101373650001901414650003001433650003601463650001301499650002501512650002301537650001901560650001001579650001201589650002001601650005901621650001301680650001401693650006701707650002601774650001001800650004401810650002601854651001201880651002701892653001901919653002701938653002401965653001401989700002702003700001902030700002602049773013202075852000902207856008302216655001202299IND4440252820221118221711.0181016e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444025282DNAL7 a206222312pmid7 a10.1177/1040638710022004152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBangari, Dinesh S.10aGenotyping of Porcine Teschovirus from Nervous Tissue of Pigs with and without Polioencephalomyelitis in Indiana  ap. 594-597.  a2019-12-04  aPorcine teschovirus (PTV) was isolated in cell culture and/or demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction in samples of brain and/or spinal cord in pigs in Indiana during the 2002–2007 period. Testing was initiated on pigs originating from populations exhibiting nervous clinical disease and/or pigs with microscopic lesions in central nervous tissues, indicating viral encephalitis and/or myelitis. Virus was demonstrated in pigs with and without lesions as well as with and without nervous clinical disease. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5′-nontranslated region of the viral genome revealed that these isolates had low-level genetic heterogeneity but were homologous to porcine PTV serotype 1 (PTV-1). These findings indicate that low-to-moderate virulence strains of PTV with some homology to PTV-1 are endemic in many swineherds of Indiana and are associated with subclinical and clinical nervous disease in weaned pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine teschovirus 3acentral nervous system 3alesions (animal) 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aswine diseases 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acentral nervous system diseases 3agenotype 3anucleotide sequences 3amicrobial genetics 3aanimal tissues 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aBrainxvirology 2aEncephalomyelitisxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aGenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPicornaviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aSpinal Cordxvirology 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aTeschovirusxgenetics 3aIndiana 0aIndianaxepidemiology. 0aPicornaviridae 0apolioencephalomyelitis 0aPorcine enterovirus 0aisolation1 aPogranichniy, Roman M.1 aGillespie, Tom1 aStevenson, Gregory W.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 22, no. 4 p.594-597dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638710022004153Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01671naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008800171300001600259520068700275592002800962650001400990650001501004650002001019653001401039653001001053653002001063653001301083653001401096700001901110773012201129856008501251852000901336655001201345IND60745768020221119081330.0210727e20210216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074576802DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2021.19050972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoig-Alsina, A.14aThe leucografa species group of Megachile (Chrysosarus) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)  ap. 457-470.  aThe study contributes to the knowledge of the morphological diversity within the Chrysosarus lineage, one of the largest subgenera of Megachile in the Neotropics.

More than 90% of thyroid cancers comprise papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC). Although anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) accounts for less than 2% of thyroid cancer. But patients’ lifespan after diagnosis is about 6 months. Surgical interventions, radioactive iodine use, and chemotherapy are not sufficient in the treatment of ATC, so alternative therapies are needed. METHODS AND RESULTS: The WST-1 assay test was performed to evaluate the anti-proliferative effects of Valproic acid (VPA). Also, the effect of VPA on miRNAs affecting histone deacetylase was determined by Quantitative RT-PCR. In the SW1736 cell line, IC50 dose for VPA was found 1.6 mg/ml. In our study, the level of oncogenic genes expression in cells treated with VPA, including miR-184, miR-222-5p, miR-124-3p, and miR-328-3p, decreased. Also, the expression of tumor inhibitory genes including miR-323-5p, miR-182-5p, miR-138-5p, miR-217, miR-15a-5p, miR-29b-3p, miR-324-5p and miR-101-5p increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: VPA can ad-just countless gene expression patterns, including microRNAs (miRNAs), by targeting histone deacetylase (HDAC).

In the paper, the in-depth molecular mechanism by which DJ-1 protein regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of Ishikawa cells was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: DJ-1 knockdown and overexpressing Ishikawa stable cell lines were established by lentiviral transduction. The levels of DJ-1 and noncanonical NF-κB signaling key proteins were evaluated by Western blotting. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry were applied to analyze the cell viability and apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment was utilized to assess the DJ-1-Cezanne interaction. The results showed that DJ-1 overexpression conferred apoptosis resistance and high proliferation on Ishikawa cells, while DJ-1 knockdown in Ishikawa cells produced the opposite results. These findings again suggested that DJ-1 inhibits the apoptosis and promotes the proliferation of Ishikawa cells. More crucially, further data showed that the noncanonical NF-κB activation was required for the regulation of Ishikawa cell proliferation and apoptosis by DJ-1. Meanwhile, it was found that noncanonical NF-κB pathway may be activated by DJ-1 interacting with and negatively regulating Cezanne in Ishikawa cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this work revealed that DJ-1 associates with and negatively regulates Cezanne and consequently triggers the noncanonical NF-κB activation, thereby regulating Ishikawa cell proliferation and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data  a81760473cNatural Scientific Foundation of China  a20195498cScience and Technology Plan Project of the Health Commission of Jiangxi Province 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3afemale reproductive system 3aflow cytometry 3amolecular biology 3aprecipitin tests 3auterine neoplasms1 aLiu, Hao-Yue1 aZhao, Xiao-Yan1 aQiu, Le-Jia1 aZhou, Ting-Ting1 aWang, Xue-Ying1 aChen, He-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7652-50631 aXiao, Zhong-Qing0 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.6075-6083dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06614-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245013400189300001800323500001100341520118200352592002801534650002901562650001201591650001901603650002301622650001201645650002101657650002401678650002601702650001701728650001701745650002501762650002201787650001801809650001401827650001101841650000901852650003401861650001201895650001801907650002101925650004401946650005501990650002702045700002802072773012702100856008102227852000902308655001202317IND50067742020221120092055.0160903e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006774202DNAL7 a238244442pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-5063-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Eduardo V.10aCleanup of industrial effluents containing heavy metals: a new opportunity of valorising the biomass produced by brewing industry  ap. 6667-6675.  aReview  aHeavy metal pollution is a matter of concern in industrialised countries. Contrary to organic pollutants, heavy metals are not metabolically degraded. This fact has two main consequences: its bioremediation requires another strategy and heavy metals can be indefinitely recycled. Yeast cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are produced at high amounts as a by-product of brewing industry constituting a cheap raw material. In the present work, the possibility of valorising this type of biomass in the bioremediation of real industrial effluents containing heavy metals is reviewed. Given the auto-aggregation capacity (flocculation) of brewing yeast cells, a fast and off-cost yeast separation is achieved after the treatment of metal-laden effluent, which reduces the costs associated with the process. This is a critical issue when we are looking for an effective, eco-friendly, and low-cost technology. The possibility of the bioremediation of industrial effluents linked with the selective recovery of metals, in a strategy of simultaneous minimisation of environmental hazard of industrial wastes with financial benefits from reselling or recycling the metals, is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3abrewery byproducts 3abrewing 3abrewing industry 3adeveloped countries 3aenvironmental hazards 3aflocculation 3aheavy metals 3aindustrial effluents 3aindustrial wastes 3araw materials 3arecycling 3ayeasts 2aBeer 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aFood Industry 2aIndustrial Waste 2aMetals, Heavyxisolation & purification 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexisolation & purification 2aWastewaterxchemistry.1 aSoares, Helena M.

The present article is a review of smart grids/smart technologies in relation to Photovoltaic (PV) systems, storage, buildings and the environment. In the frame of PV/smart applications, factors such as promotion of building-integrated PV/smart-grid configurations and evaluation of the systems in different countries/markets play a pivotal role. Regarding storage, parameters such as recycling and non-interconnected territories are critical. Moreover, the development of smart grids/smart systems in the building sector is associated with zero-energy buildings, indoor-environment control, polygeneration, policy and so on. From an environmental point of view, the vast majority of the investigations discuss general environmental issues (CO₂ emissions; energy savings) and there is a lack of environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies based on multiple life-cycle impact assessment methods and environmental indicators. In light of the issues mentioned above, it can be seen that smart grids/smart systems pose many challenges: residential microgeneration, flexibility and active participation of the users, promotion of renewable energy systems (offshore wind power plants, building-integrated solar systems, etc.), energy transition and so on.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3asolar energy 3awind power 0aSmart grid 0aPhotovoltaic technology 0aStorage 0aBuilding 0aEnvironment 0aLife cycle assessment 0aBI 0aBIPV 0aBMS 0aCAES 0aCCHP 0aCED 0aDHC 0aDR 0aDRP 0aESOI 0aGHG 0aGWP 0aHVAC 0aIMPACT 2002+ 0aIoT 0aLCA 0aLCI 0aLCIA 0aLi-ion 0aLVRT 0aNaS 0aPbA 0aPHS 0aPV 0aReCiPe 0aRES 0aSCADA 0aVRB 0aZEB 0aZnBr1 aChemisana, D.1 aCristofari, C.0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Feb., v. 185 p.1376-1391dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03897naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009500172300001600267500001500283520220600298592002802504650001702532650001602549650001302565650003902578650002302617650001402640650002302654650001402677650001502691650001402706650001602720650002502736650002202761650002102783650001502804650001802819650001702837650001402854650000902868650000902877650001502886650001602901650002102917650001402938650002202952653003402974653001003008700002103018700002703039700002503066700002003091773009003111856008503201852000903286655001203295IND60112445620221118041101.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011244562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Madhav P.10aFormation of corn fiber gum–milk protein conjugates and their molecular characterization  ap. 326-333.  a2019-12-04  aCorn fiber arabinoxylan is hemicellulose B isolated from the fibrous portions (pericarp, tip cap, and endosperm cell wall fractions) of corn kernels and is commonly referred to as corn fiber gum (CFG). Our previous studies showed that CFG isolated from corn bran (a byproduct of corn dry milling) contains very little protein and is an inferior emulsifier for oil-in-water emulsion systems as compared to corn fiber gum isolated from corn fiber derived from the corn wet-milling process. The protein deficient CFG isolated from corn bran was covalently conjugated with byproducts of cheese processing, β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) and whey protein isolate (WPI) using an economical food-grade Maillard-type heating reaction for the purpose of increasing their commercialization potential as a food emulsifier and soluble nutritional additive in beverages. The formation of the CFG–protein conjugates has been confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). It has also been demonstrated that CFG–protein conjugates are capable of producing fine emulsions with better stability than either CFG or protein alone. The molecular characterization of CFG–protein conjugates was performed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) coupled to on-line multi-angle laser light scattering and viscometric detection. The analysis by HPSEC revealed that CFG–protein conjugates had higher weight-average molar mass (Mw, 340–359kDa) and polydispersity (Mw/Mₙ, 1.74) than the corresponding unconjugated CFG (Mw, 290kDa and Mw/Mₙ, 1.35). The z-average root-mean-square radius of gyration (Rgz) of CFG–protein conjugates was slightly higher (30.5–33.5nm) in comparison to CFG (29.5nm) but their weight-average-intrinsic viscosity (η) remained unchanged (about 1.32dLg⁻¹). The Mark–Houwink exponent “a” of conjugates (0.40) was lower than the unconjugated CFG (0.53) indicating the formation of a more compact structure after conjugation with protein. These findings should benefit the beverage industry, which can use this information to produce a high quality emulsifier from the low-value byproducts of corn dry milling and cheese processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acheesemaking 3adry milling 3apericarp 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3agel chromatography 3aemulsions 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abeverages 3acell walls 3aviscosity 3aemulsifiers 3awhey protein isolate 3abeverage industry 3amolecular weight 3aviscometry 3ahemicellulose 3aarabinoxylan 3acorn bran 3aheat 3acorn 3abyproducts 3awet milling 3alight scattering 3aendosperm 3acommercialization 0asize exclusion chromatography 0aseeds1 aStrahan, Gary D.1 aMukhopadhyay, Sudarsan1 aHotchkiss, Arland T.1 aHicks, Kevin B.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2012 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.326-333dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245014000175300001800315520164200333592002801975650001302003650001102016650001402027650002102041650001902062650001302081650001102094650001402105650001902119650002102138650000902159650001902168650001502187650001302202650001102215650002002226700002202246700002402268700002302292773008802315856009002403852000902493655001202502IND60090440920221121031217.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009044092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaeri, Morteza10aElectrochemical control of cell death by reduction-induced intrinsic apoptosis and oxidation-induced necrosis on CoCrMo alloy in vitro  ap. 6295-6304.  aElectrochemical voltage shifts in metallic biomedical implants occur in-vivo due to a number of processes including mechanically assisted corrosion. These excursions may compromise the biocompatibility of metallic implants. Voltages can also be controlled to modulate cell function and fate. The in vitro effect of static voltages on the behavior of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts cultured on CoCrMo alloy (ASTM-1537) was studied to determine the range of cell viability and mode of cell death beyond the viable range. Cell viability and morphology, changes in actin cytoskeleton, adhesion complexes and nucleus, and mode of cell death (necrosis, or intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis) were characterized at different voltages ranging from −1000 to +500 mV (Ag/AgCl). Moreover, electrochemical currents and metal ion concentrations at each voltage were measured and related to the observed responses. Results show that cathodic and anodic voltages outside the voltage viability range (−400 < V < +500) lead to primarily intrinsic apoptotic and necrotic cell death, respectively. Cell death is associated with cathodic current densities of 0.1 μA cm⁻² and anodic current densities of 10 μA cm⁻². Significant increase in metallic ions (Co, Cr, Ni, Mo) was seen at +500 mV, and −1000 mV (Cr only) compared to open circuit potential. The number and total projected area of adhesion complexes was also lower on the polarized alloy (p < 0.05). These results show that reduction reactions on CoCrMo alloys leads to apoptosis of cells on the surface and may be a relevant mode of cell death for metallic implants in-vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalloys 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatibility 3acell viability 3achromium 3acobalt 3acorrosion 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aions 3amicrofilaments 3amolybdenum 3anecrosis 3anickel 3asilver chloride1 aWӧllert, Torsten1 aLangford, George M.1 aGilbert, Jeremy L.0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Sept., v. 33, no. 27 p.6295-6304dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009400166300001600260500001900276520130200295592002801597650003001625650001101655650001901666650001901685650002701704650002101731650002701752650001101779650001301790650000901803650001001812651001001822653001801832653001701850653002301867653003101890700001701921700002001938700002701958773010801985856008502093852000902178655001202187IND60693150720221122120934.0200505e20170304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069315072DNAL7 a10.1080/17583004.2017.13064062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarg, Amit10aCO₂ emission in India: trends and management at sectoral, sub-regional and plant levels  ap. 111-123.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe paper estimates the Indian carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions over the last two decades at sectoral and sub-regional levels to identify hotspots of CO₂ emissions, providing possible insights for focused carbon mitigation efforts pan-India. The CO₂ emissions are also estimated at the level of 1151 large point sources to identify hotspots for mitigation and also to demonstrate future possibilities for CO₂ storage in nearby geological sinks. India's CO₂ emission grew at around 5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between the years 1990 and 2013. From the 1897 Mt of CO₂ emission electricity generation, transport and iron & steel industry contributed 48%, 11.6% and 7.9% respectively. Districts of Kachchh, Sonbhadra and Korba were the largest CO₂ emitters, mainly due to the location of coal-based mega power projects. The district-level emissions estimates show a flattening of the distribution curve of CO₂ emissions over the years, indicating that more districts are now crowding up the higher emission space, partly driven by income effects. Our estimate of CO₂ emission intensity of the Indian economy shows 11% decoupling of growth of emissions and gross domestic product during 2005–2013, 2005 being the base year for India under the Paris climate change agreement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aelectricity generation 3aemissions factor 3agross domestic product 3aincome 3aindustry 3airon 3asteel 3aIndia 0aCO2 emissions 0aLPS emission 0aemission intensity 0acarbon capture and storage1 aShukla, P.R.1 aKankal, Bhushan1 aMahapatra, Diptiranjan0 tCarbon management.g2017 Mar. 4, v. 8, no. 2 p.111-123dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2218x1758-30127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2017.13064063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011400166300001800280520209800298592002802396650002602424650001102450650001402461650001002475650002202485650001302507650003002520650001802550650001002568650002002578650001302598650001402611650001302625651001302638700001702651700001802668700001902686700002102705700006302726773012402789856008302913852000902996655001203005IND60748164220221118041359.0211101e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074816422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-021-06631-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahzad, Asim10aMolecular detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 in sheep, goats, cows and buffaloes  ap. 6113-6121.  aBACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) are important foodborne pathogens that causing serious public health consequences worldwide. The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence ratio and to identify the zoonotic potential of E. coli O157 isolates in slaughtered adult sheep, goats, cows and buffaloes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 400 Recto-anal samples were collected from two targeted sites Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Among them, 200 samples were collected from the slaughterhouse of Rawalpindi included sheep (n = 75) and goats (n = 125). While, 200 samples were collected from the slaughterhouse of Islamabad included cows (n = 120) and buffalos (n = 80). All samples were initially processed in buffered peptone water and then amplified by conventional PCR. Samples positive for E. coli O157 were then streaked onto SMAC media plates. From each positive sample, six different Sorbitol fermented pink-colored colonies were isolated and analyzed again via conventional PCR to confirm the presence of rfbE O157 gene. Isolates positive for rfbE O157 gene were then further analyzed by multiplex PCR for the presence of STEC other virulent genes (sxt1, stx2, eae and ehlyA) simultaneously. RESULTS: Of 400 RAJ samples only 2 (0.5%) showed positive results for E. coli O157 gene, included sheep 1/75 (1.33%) and buffalo 1/80 (1.25%). However, goats (n = 125) and cows (n = 120) found negative for E. coli O157. Only 2 isolates from each positive sample of sheep (1/6) and buffalo (1/6) harbored rfbE O157 genes, while five isolates could not. The rfbE O157 isolate (01) of sheep sample did not carry any of STEC genes, while the rfbE O157 isolate (01) of buffalo sample carried sxt1, stx2, eae and ehlyA genes simultaneously. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that healthy adult sheep and buffalo are possibly essential carriers of STEC O157. However, rfbE O157 isolate of buffalo RAJ sample carried 4 STEC virulent genes, hence considered an important source of STEC infection to humans and environment which should need to devise proper control systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aadults 3abuffaloes 3agenes 3amolecular biology 3apeptones 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3asorbitol 3avirulence 3azoonoses 3aPakistan1 aUllah, Fahim1 aIrshad, Hamid1 aAhmed, Shehzad1 aShakeela, Qismat1 aMian, Abrar Hussain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7337-54150 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.6113-6121dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06631-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245010000177300001800277520158800295592002801883650001401911650002001925650001901945650001001964650002001974650000901994650002002003650001202023650001002035650001302045650001302058650001702071650001402088650001102102700001102113700001402124700001402138700001902152700001702171700002002188773008802208856009002296852000902386655001202395IND60090441120221121083344.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009044112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiao-Dong10aSize-dependent radiosensitization of PEG-coated gold nanoparticles for cancer radiation therapy  ap. 6408-6419.  aGold nanoparticles have been conceived as a radiosensitizer in cancer radiation therapy, but one of the important questions for primary drug screening is what size of gold nanoparticles can optimally enhance radiation effects. Herein, we perform in vitro and in vivo radiosensitization studies of 4.8, 12.1, 27.3, and 46.6 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles. In vitro results show that all sizes of the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can cause a significant decrease in cancer cell survival after gamma radiation. 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have dispersive distributions in the cells and stronger sensitization effects than 4.8 and 46.6 nm particles by both cell apoptosis and necrosis. Further, in vivo results also show all sizes of the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can significantly decrease tumor volume and weight after 5 Gy radiations, and 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have greater sensitization effects than 4.8 and 46.6 nm particles, which can lead to almost complete disappearance of the tumor. In vivo biodistribution confirms that 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles are accumulated in the tumor with high concentrations. The pathology, immune response, and blood biochemistry indicate that the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have not caused spleen and kidney damages, but give rise to liver damage and gold accumulation. It can be concluded that 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles show high radiosensitivity, and these results have an important indication for possible radiotherapy and drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablood chemistry 3acell viability 3adrugs 3agamma radiation 3agold 3aimmune response 3akidneys 3aliver 3ananogold 3anecrosis 3aradiotherapy 3ascreening 3aspleen1 aWu, Di1 aShen, Xiu1 aChen, Jie1 aSun, Yuan-Ming1 aLiu, Pei-Xun1 aLiang, Xing-Jie0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Sept., v. 33, no. 27 p.6408-6419dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010500163300001800268520136300286592002801649650001801677650001501695650001501710650002201725650002401747650001401771650002401785650001501809650004201824650002601866650001901892650001101911650000701922650001901929650002101948650002501969700001501994700001702009700001602026700001402042700001602056700001902072700001602091773012502107856008202232852000902314655001202323IND60593684520221119145553.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059368452DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9834-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Jiayu10aSolid-State Co-digestion of NaOH-Pretreated Corn Straw and Chicken Manure Under Mesophilic Condition  ap. 1027-1035.  aSolid-state anaerobic digestion is an attractive way to convert corn straw and chicken manure into bioenergy. This study investigated the performance of solid-state co-digestion of NaOH-pretreated corn straw and chicken manure at mixing ratios of 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1 under mesophilic (37 °C) condition. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the microbial diversity and community structure. Results showed that synergistic effect was found when corn straw and chicken manure was mixed at 3:1, regardless pretreat or not. However, NaOH pretreatment showed no benefit for co-digestion of corn straw and chicken manure. The analysis of pH, total ammonia–nitrogen, total alkalinity, and volatile fatty acid also proved that NaOH pretreatment worked against the co-digestion. Through the analysis by high-throughput sequencing, the major microorganisms in co-digestion process were found to be Euryarchaeota, Bacteroidete, and Firmicutes. Co-digestion of corn straw and chicken manure could improve the microbial richness, while NaOH pretreatment worked against it. These results suggested that NaOH pretreatment was inappropriate for co-digestion of corn straw and chicken manure at 37 °C, while co-digestion was behaved like a good way to change the microbial community structure and improve anaerobic digestion efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuryarchaeota 3aFirmicutes 3aalkalinity 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioenergy 3acommunity structure 3acorn straw 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3amixing 3apH 3apoultry manure 3asodium hydroxide 3avolatile fatty acids1 aLi Yeqing,1 aZhang, Enlan1 aZhang, Jiyu1 aWang, Wen1 aHe, Yanfeng1 aLiu, Guangqing1 aChen, Chang0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 June, v. 9, no. 6 p.1027-1035dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9834-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007300148245016100221520136400382592002801746650004301774650001801817650001101835650002901846650001801875650002701893650001701920650001901937650001201956650000901968650001601977650001501993650001402008650001402022653001402036653002902050653000802079653001902087700001902106700002402125700002002149700002502169700002202194700002602216773012102242856008302363852000902446655001202455IND60773611520221119142237.0220509e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077361152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcdf.2022.1003212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoghadam, Behnam Esmaeilnejad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6539-991910aBarley β-glucan for conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) production by Bifidobacterium animalis subsp.

Lactis BB12 was investigated in organic and conventional milk in the presence of barley derived β-glucan. Fatty acid profile, acidification profile, cell enumeration and lactose content were determined for fermented conventional and organic milk, before and after 30 h fermentation in 30 °C. Viscometery and sensory evaluations were also performed. The results showed higher counts of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis BB12, and viscosity in organic milk. Also, organic fermented milk offered higher CLA as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids values and a lower level of saturated fatty acids in comparison to conventional fermented milk. Cis-9, trans-11 CLA, trans-10, cis-12 CLA and polyunsaturated fatty acids values, bacterial count and viscosity in organic milk containing β-glucan were 28%, 39%, 33%, one log CFU/mL and 59% higher than the samples without β-glucan, respectively. Although these results were obtained for conventional milk, the variation percentage in the organic milk was significantly more than the conventional milk. In addition, the total lactose content in organic and conventional milk containing β-glucan was 19% and 12% lower than the samples without prebiotic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aacidification 3abarley 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adietary fiber 3afatty acid composition 3afermentation 3afermented milk 3alactose 3amilk 3aplate count 3aprebiotics 3aviability 3aviscosity 0aβ-glucan 0aBifidobacterium animalis 0aCLA 0aFermented milk1 aHasebi, Zohreh1 aSeyfzadeh, Somayyeh1 aTalebi, Vahideh1 aKeivaninahr, Fatemeh1 aFouladi, Masoumeh1 aMokarram, Reza Rezaei0 tBioactive carbohydrates and dietary fibre.g2022 Nov., v. 28 p.100321-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21611x2212-61987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcdf.2022.1003213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006700167300001600234520094000250592002801190650002001218650003601238650002201274650001601296650001601312650001701328650001701345650001801362653002801380653003601408653001701444653001601461653001801477653001801495653001501513653001701528653002601545653002101571653001801592700002301610773010501633856008101738852000901819655001201828IND60599347420221118215153.0180702e20141124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059934742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2014.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Mey, Jo G.R.10aEnd O' The Line Revisited: Moving on from nitric oxide to CGRP  ap. 120-128.  aWhen endothelin-1(ET-1) was discovered it was hailed as the prototypical endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF). However, over the years little evidence emerged convincingly demonstrating that the peptide actually contributes to moment-to-moment changes in vascular tone elicited by endothelial cells. This has been attributed to the profound inhibitory effect of nitric oxide (NO) on both the production (by the endothelium) and the action (on vascular smooth muscle) of ET-1. Hence, the peptide is likely to initiate acute changes in vascular diameter only under extreme conditions of endothelial dysfunction when the NO bioavailability is considerably reduced if not absent. The present essay discusses whether or not this concept should be revised, in particular in view of the potent inhibitory effect exerted by calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) released from sensorimotor nerves on vasoconstrictor responses to ET-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acalcitonin gene-related peptide 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelins 3aendothelium 3anerve tissue 3anitric oxide 3asmooth muscle 0aArterial blood pressure 0aCalcitonin gene related peptide 0aEndothelin-1 0aEndothelium 0aETA receptors 0aETB receptors 0aExocytosis 0aNitric oxide 0aNitric oxide synthase 0aOxidative stress 0aVascular tone1 aVanhoutte, Paul M.0 tLife sciences.g2014 Nov. 24, v. 118, no. 2 p.120-128dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2014.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245013200161300001600293520212400309592002802433650001502461650002302476650001002499650001102509650001402520650001902534650001302553650002202566650001602588650001702604651002002621700001902641700002002660700002302680700002002703700002402723700002402747773011702771856007302888852000902961655001202970IND60479012220221122163204.0160116e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047901222DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.126192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaru, Barnabas H.12aA novel phylogenetic regionalization of phytogeographical zones of southern Africa reveals their hidden evolutionary affinities  ap. 155-166.  aAIM: Although existing bioregional classification schemes often consider the compositional affinities within regional biotas, they do not typically incorporate phylogenetic information explicitly. Because phylogeny captures information on the evolutionary history of taxa, it provides a powerful tool for delineating biogeographical boundaries and for establishing relationships among them. Here, we present the first vegetation delineation of the woody flora of southern Africa based upon evolutionary relationships. LOCATION: Southern Africa. METHODS: We used a published time‐calibrated phylogenetic tree for 1400 woody plant species along with their geographical distributions and a metric of phylogenetic beta diversity to generate a phylogenetic delineation of the woody vegetation of southern Africa. We then explored environmental correlates of phylogenetic turnover between them, and the evolutionary distinctiveness of the taxa within them. RESULTS: We identified 15 phylogenetically distinct biogeographical units, here referred to as phyloregions. The largest phyloregion broadly overlaps with Savanna vegetation, while the phyloregion overlapping with the south‐western portion of the Fynbos biome is the most evolutionarily distinct. Potential evapotranspiration and mean annual temperature differ significantly among phyloregions and correlate with patterns of phylogenetic beta diversity between them. Our phylogeny‐based delimitation of southern Africa's woody vegetation broadly matches currently recognized phytogeographical classifications, but also highlights parts of the Namib Karoo and Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park as distinct, but previously under‐recognized biogeographical units. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provides new insights into the structure and phylogenetic relationships among the woody flora of southern Africa. We show that evolutionary affinities differentiate phyloregions closely resembling existing vegetation classifications, yet also identify ‘cryptic’ phyloregions that are as evolutionarily distinct as some of the recognized African vegetation types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3aflora 3afynbos 3aphylogeny 3aphytogeography 3asavannas 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3awoody plants 3aSouthern Africa1 aBank, Michelle1 aMaurin, Olivier1 aYessoufou, Kowiyou1 aSchaefer, Hanno1 aSlingsby, Jasper A.1 aDavies, T.

Regarding the toxicity and the persistence in the environment, the phenol is surpassed by its chlorinated derivatives, such as 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). In this study we demonstrated that potato pulp may be used for the decontamination of 2,4-DCP solutions in a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction. Due to its peroxidase activity, potato pulp displayed a very high potential for 2,4-DCP removal, with the reaction’s efficiency reaching 98% under optimal conditions. The peroxidase activity towards 2,4-DCP was maintained over a wide temperature and pH range, and characterized by relatively low H₂O₂ demand, with respect to other peroxidase-based systems of 2,4-DCP removal. The toxicity of the post-reaction solutions was compared to the toxicity of the unreacted 2,4-DCP solutions using phytotest and the MTT test. The results of both tests proved that the 2,4-DCP toxicity was effectively alleviated if the pollutant was depleted from solution in the course of the incubation with potato pulp and H₂O₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3adecontamination 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindustry 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aphenol 3apollutants 3apotato pulp 3astarch 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awastewater1 aTreder, Krzysztof1 aTwarużek, Magdalena,1 aGrajewski, Jan1 aTretyn, Andrzej1 aTyburski, Jarosław0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 June, v. 9, no. 6 p.1061-1071dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9863-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01257naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245004200212300001200254520037100266592002800637650002500665650002500690650001500715650002600730773008500756856008200841990002300923852000900946655001200955IND60092874520221120214911.0141103e20120706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009287452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2012.06.0012doi7 aPMC35538532pmcid7 a227702342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Amander T.10aPluripotency Takes Off without Blimp1  ap. 1-2.  aIn this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Bao et al. demonstrate that Blimp1, which is required for primordial germ cell (PGC) specification, is dispensable for the derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), and reprogramming.

In this study, we determined whether S. sarmentosum Bunge Extract (SSBE) has anti-fibrotic effects on renal tissues.We investigated the effects of SSBE on aristolochic acid (AA)-induced injury to renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) in vitro and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal fibrosis in vivo by evaluating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Furthermore, we examined the expression levels of TGF-β1 and its receptor.In cultured RTECs (NRK-52E), AA promoted renal EMT and ECM accumulation by up-regulating the expression of mesenchymal markers and ECM components and by down-regulating the expression of epithelial markers. In addition, AA induced an imbalance between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 and enhanced expression of TGF-β1 and its receptor. SSBE treatment significantly inhibited AA-induced TGF-β1 expression and prevented the induction of EMT and deposition of ECM. In the UUO rats, tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis were obviously increased. SSBE administration protected renal function, as indicated by reduced serum creatinine levels, and alleviated renal interstitial fibrosis. These anti-fibrotic effects were associated with a reduction in TGF-β1 expression and inhibition of EMT and ECM accumulation.These findings suggest that SSBE may have therapeutic potential for fibrotic kidney diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aSedum sarmentosum 3aantineoplastic activity 3aaristolochic acids 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aextracellular matrix 3afibrosis 3akidney diseases 3arats 3arenal function 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aSedum sarmentosum Bunge 0aEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 0aMatrix accumulation 0aTransforming growth factor-β1 0aRenal fibrosis1 aLu, Hong1 aZhang, Ge1 aWu, Cunzao1 aLin, Chengcheng1 aLiang, Yong1 aChen, Bicheng0 tLife sciences.g2014 June 06, v. 105, no. 1-2 p.22-30dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2014.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245007300188300001600261520060600277592002800883650002200911650001200933650001700945650002400962650001600986650001201002650001701014650001501031650001001046650001601056650002401072650002201096650001901118650001201137650004001149650000901189650005201198650001101250650003301261650005901294650002701353653001501380653001501395653002901410653001601439700002401455700002501479700002001504700002201524773013201546852000901678856008301687655001201770IND4440254020221118221609.0181016e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444025402DNAL7 a206222432pmid7 a10.1177/1040638710022004272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlivier, Alicia K.10aIdiopathic Eosinophilic Meningoencephalomyelitis in a Rottweiler Dog  ap. 646-648.  aA 6-month-old, female, intact Rottweiler dog was presented to the Iowa State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for a progressive history of abnormal behavior and generalized ataxia.

The main aim of this study was to determine the plant and animal contributions to black rat diet in a pristine misty laurel forest area on La Palma (Canary Islands). Our working hypothesis was that this rat equally consumes plants and animals (fully omnivorous animal) wherever it is introduced, including pristine habitats. A total of 483 droppings collected from the terrain were first morphologically examined using a stereomicroscope, which showed high plant consumption (presence in 92.4% of droppings), followed by invertebrates (46.0%) and vertebrates (31.2%). DNA-based analyses revealed even higher proportions of plants (97%) and invertebrates (79%), while fine-scale sequence searches (DNA barcoding) in the GenBank (BLAST tool) provided a preliminary identification of 44 plants and 12 invertebrate taxa. To gain more in-depth insight into plant identification, we built up a local DNA reference collection (58 species), improving accuracy (30 species confirmed) compared to GenBank searches (25 species). Contingency analyses (chi-square and G-test) only showed significant differences in droppings between plant sequences and toxic plant presence. This study confirms that the black rat is here an omnivorous animal but with a strong plant diet component, including an intriguingly high number of toxic plants. Interestingly, despite rodents chewing on fruits and usually crushing seeds, 66 intact Rubus seeds (Rosaceae) were found in 15 droppings (3.1%). All these results suggest that black rats consume any plant types, including fruits and seeds that can be locally dispersed such as native brambles.  aThis research was partially financed by the ‘Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad (Spain)’, project CGL2015-67865-P.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2015-67865-P 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aRattus rattus 3aRubus 3adiet 3aforests 3aintroduced species 3ainvertebrates 3alandscapes 3anatural history 3aomnivores 3aplant identification 3apoisonous plants 3arats 3aspecies identification 3atoxicity 0aCanary Islands 0aDNA barcode 0afaecal analysis 0amacroscopic item analysis 0atoxic plants 0aseed dispersal1 aMedina, Félix M.,1 aNogales, Manuel1 aVargas, Pablo0 tJournal of natural history.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 55, no. 9-10 p.629-648dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12296x1464-52627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2021.19154003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245015700160300002000317520148900337592002801826650000901854650002501863650001701888650001601905650001401921650000901935650001201944650001701956650001901973650001601992653002802008653002502036653001602061653002002077653002502097700005802122773014202180856007802322852000902400655001202409IND60642719720221120165630.0190508e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064271972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b019892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bowen10aHighly Stretchable and Transparent Double-Network Hydrogel Ionic Conductors as Flexible Thermal–Mechanical Dual Sensors and Electroluminescent Devices  ap. 16765-16775.  aThe latest generation flexible devices feature materials that are conductive, highly stretchable, and transparent to meet the requirements of a reliable performance. However, the existing conductors are mostly electronic conductors, which cannot satisfy these high-performance challenges. A robust hydrogel ionic conductor was rapidly fabricated with a facile one-pot approach by employing bioinspired agar with a physically cross-linked network, polyacrylamide (PAM) with a photoinitiated cross-linked network under appropriate UV intensity, and Li⁺ as conductive ions. The resulting Li⁺/agar/PAM ionic double-network hydrogels could be fabricated into various shapes through injection. The unique ionic hydrogel showed a remarkable stretchability with over 1600% extension, high tension/compression strength (0.22 MPa/3.5 MPa), and toughness (2.2 MJ/m³). Furthermore, it was demonstrated to possess dual sensory capabilities through the combination of both temperature and mechanical deformation. This hydrogel ionic conductor exhibited high stretching sensitivity with a gauge factor of 1.8 at strain 1100% and bending sensitivity in a broad angle range of 30–150°, respectively. Such highly optical transparency and elasticity endow the hydrogel-phosphor composites with promising luminescent properties. The multifunctional ionic hydrogel can be used as soft conductors for application in flexible devices such as ionic skin for wearable sensors and luminescence display.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3acompression strength 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3ahydrogels 3aions 3alithium 3aluminescence 3apolyacrylamide 3atemperature 0alithium ionic conductor 0astretchable electric 0aflexibility 0ahydrogel sensor 0amultiple sensibility1 aYuan, Weizhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5981-93660 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 11, no. 18 p.16765-16775dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b019893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016400165520114300329592002801472650002901500650001701529650002101546650001301567650001901580650001501599650001801614650002501632650001501657650002101672650002201693653002701715653002301742653002101765653002201786653002701808700001801835700001801853700001201871700001301883700001701896700001101913700001801924773010901942856008302051852000902134655001202143IND60773611720221119142253.0220517e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077361172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Chaoyi10aChlorogenic acid-loaded sandwich-structured nanofibrous film developed by solution blow spinning: Characterization, release behavior and antimicrobial activity  aIn this work, solution blow spinning (SBS) was used to rapidly develop a sandwich-structured nanofibrous film with an outer layer of polyurethane (PU) nanofibers and an inner layer of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanofibers with chlorogenic acid (CGA) loading. Scanning electronic microscopy images showed that there were clear boundaries between the inner and outer layers. The hydrogen bonds that formed between the two layers enhanced the thermal stability. Compared to the CGA-loaded film, the sandwich structure increased the elongation at break and tensile strength from 3.01 ± 0.97% to 201.34 ± 9.63% and 0.0120 ± 0.0002 MPa to 0.1569 ± 0.0117 MPa, respectively, and the PU layer endowed the sandwich-structured film with hydrophobic surfaces. Furthermore, the sandwich structure shifted the burst release of the CGA-loaded film to a long-term sustained release within 144 h. In addition, the sandwich-structured film retained the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of CGA. These results indicated that the sandwich-structured nanofibrous film developed by SBS possesses potential applications in food packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3achlorogenic acid 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3ananofibers 3apolyurethanes 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3ashelf life 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 0aSolution blow spinning 0aSandwich structure 0aChlorogenic acid 0aLong-term release 0aAntimicrobial activity1 aYang, Zhichao1 aRao, Jingshan1 aWu, Jue1 aSun, Cui1 aSun, Chongde1 aWu, Di1 aChen, Kunsong0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2022 June, v. 32 p.100854-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245006900174300001800243520110900261592002801370650001501398650002001413650001501433650001701448650001901465650001301484650002301497650001901520650002001539700001601559700001601575700001801591700001701609700003101626700002001657700001701677773008801694856009001782852000901872655001201881IND60090441320221121063139.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009044132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Won Jun10aDual optical biosensors for imaging microRNA-1 during myogenesis  ap. 6430-6437.  aDual optical microRNA (miRNA) imaging systems, bioluminescent reporter gene (a signal-off mechanism)- or fluorescent molecular beacon (MB) (a signal-on mechanism)-based miRNA imaging system, have individually allowed us to sense miRNA biogenesis in a noninvasive and iterative manner. Both of these imaging systems have shortcomings with respect to image quality. Therefore, we designed a dual optical imaging systems by simultaneous imaging of a miRNA-1 reporter gene (CMV/Gluc/3xPT_miR-1) and miRNA-1 MB in a single cell to overcome these limitations and used it to visualize miRNA-1, a highly expressed miRNA in cardiac and skeletal muscle. During myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells, the bioluminescence intensity from CMV/Gluc/3xPT_miR-1 revealed a miRNA-1-dependent gradual decrease and the fluorescence intensity from miR-1 MB demonstrated a miRNA-1-dependent gradual increase both in vitro and in vivo. The dual miRNA-1 imaging systems, which provides the complementary imaging information about miRNA biogenesis, could be useful to sense miRNA expression during various biologic processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3abioluminescence 3abiosensors 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3amicroRNA 3amuscle development 3areporter genes 3askeletal muscle1 aCho, Ye Lim1 aChae, Ju Ri1 aLee, Jong Doo1 aAli, Bahy A.1 aAl-Khedhairy, Abdulaziz A.1 aLee, Chang Hyun1 aKim, Soonhag0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Sept., v. 33, no. 27 p.6430-6437dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245004200185300001600227520153100243592002801774650001601802650000901818650002001827650001701847650000901864650001901873650002001892650001201912650001601924653002001940653000901960653001101969653001201980653001101992700002302003700002202026700002002048700001902068700002602087773012702113856008202240852000902322655001202331IND60517498120221120182606.0190803e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051749812DNAL7 a260880522pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150016152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Colette10aWeight concerns among adolescent boys  ap. 456-462.  aTo investigate weight concerns among adolescent boys and relationships with health indicators and family factors. Analysis of the 2010 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey of 10–17-year-olds. Schools in the Republic of Ireland. Among 6187 boys, 25·1 % reported a desire to lose weight (weight ‘loss’ concern) and 7·7 % reported a desire to gain weight (weight ‘gain’ concern). Both types of weight concerns were associated with poor self-rated health, life satisfaction and happiness, and with more frequent emotional and physical symptoms. Family factors were associated with boys’ weight concerns. In adjusted analyses, the risk of weight ‘loss’ concerns decreased with daily family breakfasts (OR=0·80; 95 % CI 0·66, 0·97). The risk of weight ‘gain’ concerns decreased with frequent family evening meals (OR=0·77; 95 % CI 0·60, 0·99). Ease of communication with mother was associated with a decreased risk of weight ‘loss’ and weight ‘gain’ concerns among boys (OR=0·74; 95 % CI 0·60, 0·90 and OR=0·61; 95 % CI 0·44, 0·82, respectively). An open father–son relationship and having a father present in the home decreased the risk of weight ‘loss’ concerns (OR=0·69; 95 % CI 0·57, 0·82 and OR=0·81; 95 % CI 0·67, 0·98, respectively). Body weight concerns were reported by a sizeable minority of boys and were associated with negative health outcomes. The findings support the need to promote frequent family meals and facilitate open communication in families.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aboys 3ahealth behavior 3ameals (menu) 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aschool children 3asurveys 3aweight gain 0aWeight concerns 0aBoys 0aFamily 0aDieting 0aHealth1 aFitzgerald, Amanda1 aSentenac, Mariane1 aGakewski, Jakub1 aMolcho, Michal1 aNic Gabhainn, Saoirse0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 19, no. 3 p.456-462dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150016153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245014300178300001600321520171500337592002802052650002002080650001202100650002602112650001302138650001502151653008802166653001802254653004102272653001002313653001602323700002102339700002402360700002302384773010402407856008502511852000902596655001202605IND60609255020221119205642.0181207e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060925502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBräscher, Anne-Kathrin10aAre media reports able to cause somatic symptoms attributed to WiFi radiation? An experimental test of the negative expectation hypothesis  ap. 265-271.  aPeople suffering from idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) experience numerous non-specific symptoms that they attribute to EMF. The cause of this condition remains vague and evidence shows that psychological rather than bioelectromagnetic mechanisms are at work. We hypothesized a role of media reports in the etiology of IEI-EMF and investigated how somatosensory perception is affected. 65 healthy participants were instructed that EMF exposure can lead to enhanced somatosensory perception. Participants were randomly assigned to watch either a television report on adverse health effects of EMF or a neutral report. During the following experiment, participants rated stimulus intensities of tactile (electric) stimuli while being exposed to a sham WiFi signal in 50% of the trials. Sham WiFi exposure led to increased intensity ratings of tactile stimuli in the WiFi film group, especially in participants with higher levels of somatosensory amplification. Participants of the WiFi group reported more anxiety concerning WiFi exposure than the Control group and tended to perceive themselves as being more sensitive to EMF after the experiment compared to before. Sensational media reports can facilitate enhanced perception of tactile stimuli in healthy participants. People tending to perceive bodily symptoms as intense, disturbing, and noxious seem most vulnerable. Receiving sensational media reports might sensitize people to develop a nocebo effect and thereby contribute to the development of IEI-EMF. By promoting catastrophizing thoughts and increasing symptom-focused attention, perception might more readily be enhanced and misattributed to EMF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanxiety 3aelectromagnetic field 3aetiology 3atelevision 0aIdiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) 0aNocebo effect 0aMedically unexplained symptoms (MUS) 0aMedia 0aExpectation1 aRaymaekers, Koen1 aVan den Bergh, Omer1 aWitthöft, Michael0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 July, v. 156 p.265-271dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300001800280520150100298592002801799650002501827650001501852650001301867650002201880650001201902650001901914650001301933650001001946650001401956650001101970650001301981650001501994650002102009650001102030650002002041700001502061700002102076700001802097700001602115773014602131856008102277852000902358655001202367IND60572346820221117223757.0170717e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057234682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-8499-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Yu-Peng10aPhosphate and ammonium adsorption of the modified biochar based on Phragmites australis after phytoremediation  ap. 8326-8335.  aTo effectively remove N and P from eutrophic water, the Phragmites australis after phytoremediation was harvested for preparation of modified biochar. The MgCl₂-modified biochar (MPB) was successfully synthesized at 600 °C under N₂ circumstance. The physiochemical characteristics, the adsorption capacity for N and P in the simulated solution, and their adsorption mechanism of MPB were then determined, followed by the treatment of eutrophic water of Tai lake and its inflow river from agricultural source. The results demonstrated that the MPB presented high adsorption capacity to both simulated NH₄-N and PO₄-P with the maximum adsorption capacity exceeding 30 and 100 mg g⁻¹, respectively. The entire ammonium adsorption process could be described by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model whereas the phosphate adsorption process could be divided into three phases, as described by both intra-particle diffusion model and the pseudo-first-order kinetic. It was further found that the dominant mechanism for ammonium adsorption was Mg²⁺ exchange instead of functional groups and surface areas and the Mg-P precipitation was the main mechanism for phosphate adsorption. The MPB also showed high removal ratio of practical TP which reached nearly 90% for both the water in Tai lake and its agricultural source.

As a paddy matures, numerous fertilizers are needed, especially in the rainy seasons; the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in rainfall runoff from farmland is much higher than at other times, and this poses a great threat to water bodies and is the main reason for water eutrophication, especially in high concentration drainages. To date, most studies regarding the characteristics of pollutants in rainfall runoff have mainly been concentrated on urban runoff and watershed runoff; therefore, it is particularly important to investigate the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in rainfall runoff from paddy fields. To study the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss and whether the first flush effect exists, continuous monitoring of the rainfall runoff process of six rainfall events was conducted in 2013, of which four rainfall events during storm, high, middle, and low intensity rainfalls were analyzed, and runoff and quality parameters, such as suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH₄ ⁺-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO₃ ⁻-N), total phosphorus (TP), and phosphate (PO₄ ³⁻-P), were analyzed to determine the relationship between runoff and water quality. The paddy field is located north of Wuxi Lake Basin along the Hejia River upstream in Zhoutie town, Yixing city. An analysis of the load distribution during rainfall runoff was conducted. Event mean concentration (EMC) was used to evaluate the pollution situation of the paddy field’s rainfall runoff. A curve of the dimensionless normalized cumulative load (L) vs. normalized cumulative flow (F) (L-F curve), the probability of the mass first flush (MFFn), and the pollutants carried by the initial 25% of runoff (FF₂₅) were used to analyze the first flush effect of the paddy field runoff, and different contaminants show different results: the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus fluctuate and follow a similar trend as runoff changes, NO₃ ⁻-N concentration is lower in the early part of runoff and higher in the later, and TP mainly occurs in the particle state in storm runoff and mainly in the dissolved state when the rainfall intensity is smaller. Nitrogen and phosphorus losses from paddy fields are closely related to the average rainfall intensity and the max rainfall intensity, and the runoff loss of nitrogen and phosphorus is more severe when the rainfall intensity is large. Based on an analysis of multiple methodologies, TN and NH₄ ⁺-N show a certain degree of a first flush effect, whereas the first flush effect of TP is not obvious. The first flush effect of SS is obvious in larger intensity rainfall and shows a slight secondary flush effect in smaller rainfall events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural runoff 3aammonium nitrogen 3aeutrophication 3afertilizers 3alakes 3amonitoring 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3apaddies 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3aprobability 3arain 3arain intensity 3arivers 3astorms 3astormwater 3asurface water 3aurban runoff 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aChina1 aWang, Xiaoling1 aQiao, Bin1 aLi, Jiansheng1 aTu, Jiamin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Mar., v. 24, no. 9 p.8336-8351dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8470-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014600167300001400313520123400327592002801561650003101589650002501620650001901645650001001664650001101674650001101685650001501696650001301711650001701724653000701741653001001748653001001758653000801768653000901776653001401785653001001799653000801809653000801817653000801825653000801833653000801841653000801849653001701857653002601874653001101900653002601911653002901937653002401966700002001990700002402010773009302034856008302127852000902210655001202219IND60530145420221119152206.0180830e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053014542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSridhar, Settu10aComparative analyses of the proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human genomes: Identification of potential tuberculosis drug targets  ap. 69-74.  aTuberculosis, one of the major infectious diseases affecting human beings is caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Increased resistance to known drugs commonly used for the treatment of tuberculosis has created an urgent need to identify new targets for validation and to develop drugs. In this study, we have used various bioinformatics tools, to compare the protein sequences from twenty-three M. tuberculosis genome strains along with the known human protein sequences, in order to identify the ‘conserved’ M. tuberculosis proteins absent in human. Further, based on the analysis of protein interaction networks, we selected one-hundred and forty proteins that were predicted as potential M. tuberculosis drug targets and prioritized according to the ranking of ‘clusters’ of interacting proteins. Comparison of the predicted 140TB targets with literature indicated that 46 of them were previously reported, thereby increasing the confidence in our predictions of the remaining 94 targets too. The analyses of the structures and functions corresponding to the predicted potential TB drug targets indicated a diverse range of proteins that included ten ‘druggable’ targets with some of the known drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aamino acid sequences 3abioinformatics 3adrugs 3agenome 3ahumans 3aprediction 3aproteins 3atuberculosis 0aTB 0aMDRTB 0aXDRTB 0aIPW 0aNCBI 0aPSI-BLAST 0aMCODE 0aPDB 0aPMP 0aATP 0aADP 0aDNA 0aMCE 0aTuberculosis 0aComputational biology 0aHumans 0aCommunicable diseases 0aProtein interaction maps 0aAmino acid sequence1 aDash, Pallabini1 aGuruprasad, Kunchur0 tGene.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 579, no. 1 p.69-74dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016300165300001800328520131500346592002801661596007201689650001201761650002701773650002001800650002601820650002101846650000901867650001701876650001001893650001001903650001701913650000901930650001101939650002601950650002201976650001701998650002902015650003002044700001602074700001502090700001802105700001802123700002002141700001902161700001602180700001702196773014502213856008302358852000902441655001202450IND60682492020221121133711.0200324e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068249202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-10290-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Qianghua10aIdentification of the natural product paeonol derived from peony bark as an inhibitor of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium type III secretion system  ap. 1673-1682.  aSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is an important zoonotic pathogen in public health and food safety. The type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) is a sophisticated molecular machine that facilitates active invasion, intracellular replication, and host inflammation. Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, new therapeutic strategies that target the Salmonella T3SS have received considerable attention. In this study, paeonol was identified as an inhibitor of the S. Typhimurium T3SS. Paeonol significantly blocked the translocation of SipA into host cells and suppressed the expression of effector proteins without affecting bacterial growth in the effective concentration range. Additionally, S. Typhimurium-mediated cell injury and invasion levels were significantly reduced after treatment with paeonol, without cytotoxicity. Most importantly, the comprehensive protective effect of paeonol was confirmed in an S. Typhimurium mouse infection model. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that paeonol inhibits the expression of effector proteins by reducing the transcription level of the SPI-1 regulatory pathway gene hilA. This work provides proof that paeonol could be used as a potential drug to treat infections caused by Salmonella.  aPublisher supplied data  a31620103918; 31860714cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPaeonia 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aanimal diseases 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial growth 3abark 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3agenes 3ainflammation 3amice 3amodels 3apathogenicity islands 3aprotective effect 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atype III secretion system1 aLi, Shufang1 aWei, Hanlu1 aWen, Zhongmei1 aWang, Yanling1 aTang, Tianzhong1 aWang, Jianfeng1 aXia, Lining1 aDeng, Xuming0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 4 p.1673-1682dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10290-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245009500180300001600275520116000291592002801451650001201479650003001491650002001521650001301541650001001554650001001564650001101574650001401585650001401599650001401613650003001627650001801657650000901675651001001684700001601694700001201710700001301722700001701735700001701752700001801769700001901787773009701806856008101903852000901984655001201993IND60120149420221123011706.0150131e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012014942DNAL7 a255636132pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-014-4290-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tao10aPrevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in captive lesser panda (Ailurus fulgens) in China  ap. 773-776.  aCryptosporidium is a global epidemic parasite and one of the most important intestinal pathogens causing diarrhea in animals and humans. Despite extensive research on this parasite group, little is known about rates of Cryptosporidium infection in lesser pandas. In this study, we use molecular diagnostic tools to detect Cryptosporidium infections and identify Cryptosporidium species in the lesser panda. Using a PCR approach, we sequenced the 18S rRNA gene in fecal samples collected from 110 captive lesser pandas held throughout China (approximately one third of the captive population). We determined Cryptosporidium species via a BLAST comparison of our sequences against those of published Cryptosporidium sequences available in GenBank and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. We report that captive lesser pandas were infected with a single Cryptosporidium species, Cryptosporidium andersoni, at a prevalence of 6.36 % (7/110). The present investigation revealed the existence of C. andersoni infection in captive lesser panda and suggested that proper control measures should be taken carefully to protect the welfare of zoo workers and visitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAilurus 3aCryptosporidium andersoni 3acontrol methods 3adiarrhea 3afeces 3agenes 3ahumans 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3azoos 3aChina1 aChen, Zuqin1 aYu, Hua1 aXie, Yue1 aGu, Xiaobing1 aLai, Weiming1 aPeng, Xuerong1 aYang, Guangyou0 tParasitology research.g2015 Feb., v. 114, no. 2 p.773-776dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-4290-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245008900199300002000288520128200308592002801590650002401618650002801642650001301670650001501683650002301698650001701721650001301738650002001751650002201771650001101793650002201804650000901826650002201835650002201857650001101879650001301890650001701903650001101920653002101931653002401952653002301976653001501999653003002014700006102044700006102105700007102166700005802237700006202295700006302357773014202420856007902562852000902641655001202650IND60707337920201112000000.0200902e20200721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070733792DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c096302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaba, Kamal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8405-035X10aFused Metalloporphyrin Thin Film with Tunable Porosity via Chemical Vapor Deposition  ap. 37732-37740.  aPorous and highly conjugated multiply fused porphyrin thin films are prepared from a fast and single-step chemical vapor deposition approach. While the solution-based coupling of porphyrins is usually undertaken at room temperature, the gas phase reaction of nickel(II) 5,15-(diphenyl)porphyrin and iron(III) chloride (FeCl₃) is investigated for temperatures as high as 200 °C. Helium ion and atomic force microscopy, supported by weight and thickness measurements, shows a drastic decrease of the fused porphyrin thin film’s density accompanied by the formation of a mesoporous morphology upon increase of the reaction temperature. The increase of the film’s porosity is attributed to formation of a greater amount of HCl (originated from both the oxidative coupling and chlorination reactions) and the release of gaseous FeCl₃ byproducts, i.e., Cl₂, at higher deposition temperatures. In addition, high resolution mass spectrometry reveals that increase of the reaction temperature promotes a higher degree of conjugation of the fused porphyrins chains, which ensures that high electronic conductivities are maintained along with high porosity. The method reported herein could enable the engineering of fused porphyrin thin films in sensing and catalytic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiphenyl 3abyproducts 3acatalytic activity 3achlorination 3achlorine 3aferric chloride 3afilms (materials) 3ahelium 3ahydrochloric acid 3airon 3amass spectrometry 3ametalloporphyrins 3anickel 3aporosity 3aporous media 3avapors 0afused porphyrins 0aconjugated polymers 0aoxidative coupling 0athin films 0achemical vapor deposition1 aBengasi, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8679-60241 aLoyer, François,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5636-38851 aFernandes, Joao Paulo Cosas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6131-99261 aEl Assad, Dana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7454-42361 aDe Castro, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9968-66951 aBoscher, Nicolas D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3693-68660 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 21, v. 12, no. 33 p.37732-37740dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c096303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008100163300001800244500001100262520144700273592002801720596006401748650001801812650002601830650001301856650002201869650001101891650002901902650002101931650001901952650002001971650001701991650002102008700001802029700005602047773014502103856008302248852000902331655001202340IND60682492120221121133703.0200324e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068249212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-10317-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Bora10aStress responses linked to antimicrobial resistance in Acinetobacter species  ap. 1423-1435.  aReview  aSince the last 20 years, bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter have been the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. In addition to the ability of Acinetobacter species to acquire rapid antibiotic resistance, limited knowledge on the mechanisms of multidrug resistance to antibiotics limits the treatment options for such infections. Here, we present a review of cellular processes, including oxidative stress defense, energy metabolism, ppGpp signaling, toxin-antitoxin system, and quorum sensing network in Acinetobacter species and their roles in antimicrobial resistance. Although inhibition of stress responses is an attractive approach to the development of effective antimicrobial therapeutic agents, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that cause antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter species, as they are not as well studied as those in other pathogenic bacteria. RelA/SpoT has been shown to be involved in ppGpp synthesis in all 50 genomes of 35 Acinetobacter species. However, toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are present in less than 30% of the 50 genomes (28/30% of SplT/A; 14/14% of HigB/A; 4/6% of HicA/B), except the RelE/B system (30/78%). These data suggested that ppGpp signaling is conserved in Acinetobacter species, but TA systems are not. This review describes our current knowledge on stress responses with respect to antibiotic resistance or tolerance in pathogenic and non-pathogenic Acinetobacter species.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2019R1A2C1088452cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aAcinetobacter 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3aenergy metabolism 3agenome 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoxidative stress 3aquorum sensing 3astress response 3atherapeutics 3avirulent strains1 aPark, Chulwoo1 aPark, Woojun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3166-15280 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 4 p.1423-1435dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10317-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01229naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245010100165300001800266520026600284592002800550650002300578650002300601650001600624650001300640700001900653700002200672700002300694773012900717856007200846852000900918655001200927IND60657515720221121040758.0190816e20040624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065751572DNAL7 a10.1039/b402305f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetrangolo, Pierangelo10aMetric engineering of perfluorocarbon–hydrocarbon layered solids driven by the halogen bonding  ap. 1492-1493.  aThe halogen bonding driven self-assembly of 1,4-dicyanobutane and 1,6-dicyanohexane with a range of perfluorinated telechelic diiodoalkanes yields layered 1D, infinite chain co-crystals.

The rates of breast-feeding at 1, 3, 5–6, 8–9 and 12 months were 88 %, 75 %, 64 %, 52 % and 32 %, respectively, with 5 % and 3 % continuing up to 24 and 36 months. Exclusive breast-feeding was 64 %, 54 % and 20 % at 1, 3 and 5–6 months, respectively; 57 % at 5 months and 85 % at 6 months were given complementary foods. Only 8 % and 10 % of children were taking five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, while 47 % and 51 % were consuming sugar-sweetened beverages at 36 and 60–72 months, respectively. At 60–72 months, less than 10 % reported at least 1 h of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on 5–7 d/week, and 32 % watched television or played videogames for more than 2 h/d, every day. The majority of paediatricians rated the surveillance system as reliable and feasible.ConclusionsSurveillance for diet and physical activity in pre-school children, with data gathered during well-child visits, is feasible and potentially useful to plan and evaluate activities for the prevention of obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3abeverages 3abody mass index 3abreast feeding 3acomplementary foods 3adata collection 3adiet 3amonitoring 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3apreschool children 3atelevision 3avegetables 3aItaly 0aSurveillance 0aChild growth 0aDiet 0aPhysical activity1 aMacaluso, Anna1 aPani, Paola1 aCaroli, Margherita1 aGiacchi, Mariano1 aMontico, Marcella1 aCattaneo, Adriano0 tPublic health nutrition.g2013 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.616-624dCambridge University Pressx1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800120034363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245014900187300001600336520174800352592002802100650001402128650002802142650001102170650002202181650001802203650003002221650002102251650001102272650002602283650001702309651001602326653001902342653002302361653001002384653001602394653003002410700002502440700001702465700002302482700002502505773012702530856008202657852000902739655001202748IND60517498620221120172248.0190803e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051749862DNAL7 a262222262pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150021772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuiten, Claire M10aUltra-processed foods have the worst nutrient profile, yet they are the most available packaged products in a sample of New Zealand supermarkets  ap. 530-538.  aTo examine the availability of packaged food products in New Zealand supermarkets by level of industrial processing, nutrient profiling score (NPSC), price (energy, unit and serving costs) and brand variety. Secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data on packaged supermarket food and non-alcoholic beverages. Products were classified according to level of industrial processing (minimally, culinary and ultra-processed) and their NPSC. Packaged foods available in four major supermarkets in Auckland, New Zealand. Packaged supermarket food products for the years 2011 and 2013. The majority (84 % in 2011 and 83 % in 2013) of packaged foods were classified as ultra-processed. A significant positive association was found between the level of industrial processing and NPSC, i.e. ultra-processed foods had a worse nutrient profile (NPSC=11·63) than culinary processed foods (NPSC=7·95), which in turn had a worse nutrient profile than minimally processed foods (NPSC=3·27), P<0·001. No clear associations were observed between the three price measures and level of processing. The study observed many variations of virtually the same product. The ten largest food manufacturers produced 35 % of all packaged foods available. In New Zealand supermarkets, ultra-processed foods comprise the largest proportion of packaged foods and are less healthy than less processed foods. The lack of significant price difference between ultra- and less processed foods suggests ultra-processed foods might provide time-poor consumers with more value for money. These findings highlight the need to improve the supermarket food supply by reducing numbers of ultra-processed foods and by reformulating products to improve their nutritional profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy 3afood availability 3afood industry 3aminimally processed foods 3anutrient content 3aprices 3aprocessing technology 3asupermarkets 3aNew Zealand 0aProcessed food 0aNutrient profiling 0aPrice 0aFood brands 0aSupermarket interventions1 aSteenhuis, Ingrid HM1 aEyles, Helen1 aNi Mhurchu, Cliona1 aWaterlander, Wilma E0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 19, no. 3 p.530-538dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150021773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245018500158300002000343520127200363592002801635650002801663650001401691650001301705650002601718650001701744650001701761650002001778650002201798650001201820650002001832650001601852650001801868650001901886650001401905650001101919650001501930650002201945650002801967653003701995653002002032653002502052700001402077700001502091700001402106700005702120700001802177700005202195700005902247700005602306773014202362856007802504852000902582655001202591IND60707338120221122014348.0200819e20200724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070733812DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c096572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Lei10aCancer Cell-Targeted Photosensitizer and Therapeutic Protein Co-Delivery Nanoplatform Based on a Metal–Organic Framework for Enhanced Synergistic Photodynamic and Protein Therapy  ap. 36906-36916.  aEfficient and cancer cell-targeted delivery of photosensitizer (PS) and therapeutic protein has great potentiality for improving the anticancer effects. Herein, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoparticles, one of the most attractive metal–organic framework materials, were used for coencapsulating the chlorin e6 (Ce6, a potent PS) and cytochrome c (Cyt c, a protein apoptosis inducer); then the nanoparticle was subsequently decorated with the hyaluronic acid (HA) shell to form cancer cell-active targeted nanoplatform (Ce6/Cyt c@ZIF-8/HA). The in vitro and in vivo experiments show the cancer cell targeting capability and pH-responsive decomposition and the release behavior of Ce6/Cyt c@ZIF-8/HA. Upon light irradiation, the released Ce6 produced cytotoxic reactive oxygen species for photodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, the released Cyt c-induced programmed cell death for protein therapy. Furthermore, the Cyt c worked normally under hypoxia conditions and could decompose H₂O₂ to O₂ (with peroxidase-/catalase-like activity), resulting in synergistically improved therapeutic efficiency. These small molecules and protein codelivery nanoplatforms would promote the development of complementary and synergetic modes for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3achlorins 3acoordination polymers 3acytochrome c 3acytotoxicity 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypoxia 3ain vivo studies 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoxygen 3aperoxidase 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 0azeolitic imidazolate framework-8 0aprotein therapy 0aphotodynamic therapy1 aLin, Xiao1 aLin, Ziguo1 aWu, Yanni1 aLiu, Xiaolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3096-49811 aLiu, Jingfeng1 aWu, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8326-40761 aZhang, Xiaolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9423-14611 aZeng, Yongyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7441-42710 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 24, v. 12, no. 33 p.36906-36916dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c096573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245013800190300001600328520163400344592002801978650001202006650003202018650001702050650001602067650001102083650001402094650001202108650001002120650000902130650001102139650001402150650002402164650001902188650001602207650001402223650001502237650001502252653003402267653001302301653001702314653001502331700001802346700002502364700003202389700002702421700002802448700002602476773013602502856008202638852000902720655001202729IND60516205320221121161019.0190726e20120128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051620532DNAL7 a217497382pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145110029232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalkowiak, Jaroslaw10aAdaptive changes of pancreatic protease secretion to a short-term vegan diet: influence of reduced intake and modification of protein  ap. 272-276.  aIn our previous study, we demonstrated that abstaining from meat, for 1 month, by healthy omnivores (lacto-ovovegetarian model) resulted in a statistical decrease in pancreatic secretion as measured by faecal elastase-1 output. However, no correlation between relative and non-relative changes of energy and nutrient consumption and pancreatic secretion was documented. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to assess the changes of exocrine pancreatic secretion with a more restrictive dietetic modification, by applying a vegan diet. A total of twenty-one healthy omnivores (sixteen females and five males) participated in the prospective study lasting for 6 weeks. The nutrient intake and faecal output of pancreatic enzymes (elastase-1, chymotrypsin and lipase) were assessed twice during the study. Each assessment period lasted for 7 d: the first before the transition to the vegan diet (omnivore diet) and the second during the last week of the study (vegan diet). The dietary modification resulted in a significant decrease in faecal elastase-1 (P < 0·05) and chymotrypsin output (P < 0·04). The lipase excretion remained unchanged. The decrease in proteolytic enzymes was documented to be positively correlated with a decreased protein intake (P < 0·05). In addition, elastase-1 and chymotrypsin outputs were also related to the changes of protein type, plant v. animal (P < 0·04 and P < 0·03, respectively). It was concluded that significant reduction and modification of protein intake due to a short-term vegan diet resulted in an adaptation of pancreatic protease secretion in healthy volunteers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3achymotrypsin 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3aexcretion 3afemales 3amales 3ameat 3amodels 3aomnivores 3aprospective studies 3aprotein intake 3aproteolysis 3asecretion 3avegan diet 3avolunteers 0aExocrine pancreatic secretion 0aElastase 0aChymotrypsin 0aVegan diet1 aMądry, Edyta1 aLisowska, Aleksandra1 aSzaflarska-Popławska, Anna1 aGrzymisławski, Marian1 aStankowiak-Kulpa, Hanna1 aPrzysławski, Juliusz0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Jan. 28, v. 107, no. 2 p.272-276dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145110029233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245002900174300001600203520122700219592002801446650001901474650004201493650001101535650001101546650001301557650001501570650001301585650001701598653000901615653001001624653001101634653000901645653001001654653001101664700002601675700001801701773009501719856008301814852000901897655001201906IND60530145820221119152311.0180830e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053014582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkatesh, Thejaswini10atRFs: miRNAs in disguise  ap. 133-138.  atRFs and tiRNAs are two new classes of regulatory non-coding small RNAs that are derived from the cleavage of pre-existing tRNAs. tRFs are 18–22 nt long and are classified into the tRF-5, tRF-3, and tRF-1 series. Here, we discuss in detail the regulatory roles of tRFs in translation, viral infections, and carcinogenesis. Moreover, we have reviewed the association of tRFs with Argonaute proteins, including their potential to function as miRNAs. Interestingly, few miRNAs are generated from pre-existing tRNAs. Hence, tRNAs generate similar-sized tRFs and miRNAs, leading to misannotations due to cross mapping of tRFs and tRNA-derived miRNAs during deep sequencing data analysis. Therefore, it is important to catalogue the overlapping sequences between tRNA-derived miRNAs and tRFs. We have catalogued the miRNAs that overlap with tRFs sequences in humans using miRBase. We identified 20 tRNA-derived miRNAs that share sequences with tRFs. Of the 20 miRNAs, 5 miRNAs (miR-3182, miR-4521, miR-1260a, miR-1260b, and miR-7977) showed significant prediction scores. Furthermore, we have identified a lysine degradation pathway as a common regulatory pathway for miR-1260a, miR-1260b, and miR-3182 by using DIANA-mirPath.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3alysine 3amicroRNA 3aprediction 3aproteins 3atransfer RNA 0atRFs 0atRNAs 0amiRNAs 0atRFs 0atRNAs 0amiRNAs1 aSuresh, Padmanaban S.1 aTsutsumi, Rie0 tGene.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 579, no. 2 p.133-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002100167245013900188300001600327520132300343592002801666650001301694650001901707650001801726650000901744650001901753650001501772650002601787650001201813650004001825650003001865650005101895650002801946650001601974650004301990650002702033650002202060650001702082700001602099700002102115700002002136773012002156856008402276852000902360655001202369IND4447375320221119184708.0141111e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444737532DNAL7 a209800592pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolst, B.

The effect of fixation and storage for up to 14 days in 1% paraformaldehyde on labelled samples and within assay variation was evaluated. Monoclonal antibodies directed to monocyte marker CD14, and to adhesion molecules CD11a, CD18, CD32 and CD49d were used. Cell surface marker, cell population, time, and the interactions between time and cell marker significantly affected expression of cell adhesion factors. For CD18, there was a significant difference in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) between fresh and stored samples (P<0.001), but no significant difference between stored samples. The MFIs of CD11a and CD49d were not significantly affected by fixation and storage. The CVs differed significantly depending on cell marker (P<0.001) and cell population (P=0.005). Fixation and storage did not significantly affect the CV. In conclusion, a no-lyse, no-wash method can be applied to canine leukocytes. The effect of fixation and storage on the resulting MFI differs between monoclonal antibodies, and should be evaluated for each antibody before use. The coefficient of variation was generally acceptable, and high CVs were related to a low MFIs or low numbers of analysed cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3ablood sampling 3acell adhesion 3adogs 3aflow cytometry 3aleukocytes 3amonoclonal antibodies 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, CDxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Adhesionxphysiology 2aCell Adhesion Moleculesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aDogsxblood 2aGene Expression Regulationxphysiology 2aLeukocytesxmetabolism 2aSpecimen Handling 2aTime Factors1 aHagberg, M.1 aLilliehöök, I.1 aJohannisson, A.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 139, no. 2-4 p.271-276dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002600188245013200214300001600346506007600362520165300438592002802091506003702119650003202156650002202188650001902210650001702229650001202246650001502258650001602273650001302289650001402302650001902316650001502335650001002350651001402360653001802374653001602392653003002408653001902438700002602457700001802483700002202501700002102523773012702544856008202671852000902753655001202762IND60517498720221207085822.0190803e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051749872DNAL7 aPMC47440952pmcid7 a264115352pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150027242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaspi, Caitlin Eicher10aDifferences in healthy food supply and stocking practices between small grocery stores, gas-marts, pharmacies and dollar stores  ap. 540-547.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLittle is known about the practices for stocking and procuring healthy food in non-traditional food retailers (e.g. gas-marts, pharmacies). The present study aimed to: (i) compare availability of healthy food items across small food store types; and (ii) examine owner/manager perceptions and stocking practices for healthy food across store types. Descriptive analyses were conducted among corner/small grocery stores, gas-marts, pharmacies and dollar stores. Data from store inventories were used to examine availability of twelve healthy food types and an overall healthy food supply score. Interviews with managers assessed stocking practices and profitability. Small stores in Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN, USA, not participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. One hundred and nineteen small food retailers and seventy-one store managers. Availability of specific items varied across store type. Only corner/small grocery stores commonly sold fresh vegetables (63 % v. 8 % of gas-marts, 0 % of dollar stores and 23 % of pharmacies). More than half of managers stocking produce relied on cash-and-carry practices to stock fresh fruit (53 %) and vegetables (55 %), instead of direct store delivery. Most healthy foods were perceived by managers to have at least average profitability. Interventions to improve healthy food offerings in small stores should consider the diverse environments, stocking practices and supply mechanisms of small stores, particularly non-traditional food retailers. Improvements may require technical support, customer engagement and innovative distribution practices.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afood and nutrition programs 3afood availability 3agrocery stores 3ahealthy diet 3ainfants 3ainterviews 3ainventories 3amanagers 3araw fruit 3araw vegetables 3avegetables 3awomen 3aMinnesota 0aCorner stores 0aFood retail 0aHealthy food availability 0aStore managers1 aPelletier, Jennifer E1 aHarnack, Lisa1 aErickson, Darin J1 aLaska, Melissa N0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 19, no. 3 p.540-547dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150027243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245012900154300001600283520125400299592002801553650001201581650001901593650002001612650001501632650002001647650002101667650001701688650001201705650001001717650002501727650001201752650001501764650002901779650001201808650002301820650003101843650001701874650002301891650000901914650001501923651003101938653001701969653002601986653002102012653002302033653001002056700001902066700002002085700002102105700001802126700002002144700001802164700002302182700001602205700001802221773010902239856007102348961001202419852000902431655001202440IND60477901520221118030536.0160108s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047790152DNAL7 a10.1071/WF141662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrand, Tara10aGrassland and forest understorey biomass emissions from prescribed fires in the south-eastern United States – RxCADRE 2012  ap. 102-113.  aSmoke measurements were made during grass and forest understorey prescribed fires as part of a comprehensive programme to understand fire and smoke behaviour. Instruments deployed on the ground, airplane and tethered aerostat platforms characterised the smoke plumes through measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4) and particulate matter (PM), and measurements of optical properties. Distinctions were observed in aerial and ground-based measurements, with aerial measurements exhibiting smaller particle size distributions and PM emission factors, likely due to particle settling. Black carbon emission factors were similar for both burns and were highest during the initial flaming phase. On average, the particles from the forest fire were less light absorbing than those from the grass fires due to the longer duration of smouldering combustion in the forest biomass. CO and CH4 emission factors were over twice as high for the forest burn than for the grass burn, corresponding with a lower modified combustion efficiency and greater smouldering combustion. This dataset reveals the evolution of smoke emissions from two different commonly burned fuel types and demonstrates the complexity of emission factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3adata collection 3aemissions factor 3aforest fires 3aforests 3afuels 3afuels (fire ecology) 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amethane 3aoptical properties 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticulates 3aprescribed burning 3asoot 3aunderstory 3aSoutheastern United States 0ablack carbon 0acombustion efficiency 0aemissions factor 0aparticulate matter 0asmoke1 aGullett, Brian1 aUrbanski, Shawn1 aO’Neill, Susan1 aPotter, Brian1 aAurell, Johanna1 aHolder, Amara1 aLarkin, Narasimhan1 aMoore, Mark1 aRorig, Miriam0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2016, v. 25, no. 1 p.102-113dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF141663Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01282naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245012400157300001800281520032800299592002800627650002600655650001200681650002300693700002100716700002600737700002000763773012800783856007200911852000900983655001200992IND60657516020221121040723.0190816e20040428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065751602DNAL7 a10.1039/b402327g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakha, Mohamed10aExploiting phenyl embraces and π-stacking in the assembly of arrays of tetraphenylphosphonium p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene  ap. 1066-1067.  aPhenyl embraces involving tetraphenylphosphonium cations feature in complexes of p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene where a phenyl ring of a cation is included in the cavity of the calixarene.

Serological detection of specific antibodies against ALV-J infection is important for successful clinical diagnosis. Here, a 293F stable cell line was established to stably express gp85 protein. In this cell line, gp85 protein was expressed at approximately 30 mg/L. A subgroup-specific indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) was developed using ALV-J gp85 protein as coated antigen to detect antibodies against ALV-J. The sensitivity of the iELISA (1:51200 diluted in serum) was 16 times more than that of indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA; 1:3200 diluted in serum). Moreover, there was no crossreactivity with antibodies against other common avian viruses and other avian leukosis virus subgroups, such as subgroups A and B. The practicality of the iELISA was further evaluated by experimental infection and clinical samples. The results from experimental infection indicated that anti-ALV-J antibodies were readily detected by iELISA as early as 4 weeks after ALV-J infection, and positive antibodies were detected until 20 weeks, with an antibody-positive rate of 11.1% to 33.3%. Moreover, analysis of clinical samples showed that 9.49% of samples were positive for anti-ALV-J antibodies, and the concordance rate of iELISA and IFA was 99.24%. Overall, these results suggested that the subgroup-specific iELISA developed in this study had good sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility. This iELISA will be very useful for epidemiological surveillance, diagnosis, and eradication of ALV-J in poultry farms.  aPublisher supplied data  a(2016YFD0501605)cKey Technologies Research and Development Program (CN)  a31761133002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31872482cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAvian leukosis virus 3aanimal viruses 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3acell lines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afinancial economics 3afluorescent antibody technique 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3apoultry 3apoultry industry1 aXing, Lixiao1 aXing, Zhifeng1 aYu, Mengmeng1 aBao, Yuanling1 aWang, Suyan1 aFarooque, Muhammad1 aLi, Xinyi1 aLiu, Peng1 aPan, Qing1 aQi, Xiaole1 aGao, Li1 aLi, Kai1 aLiu, Changjun1 aZhang, Yanping1 aCui, Hongyu1 aWang, Xiaomei1 aGao, Yulong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0448-84670 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 4 p.1785-1793dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10320-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003300164245008500197300001400282520163100296592002801927650001901955650001301974650001301987650002202000650004102022650001202063650002402075650001402099650002302113650002202136650001102158650001202169650001502181650002502196650003202221650003802253650001402291650002302305650002402328650003302352651001102385651001102396700002802407700002602435700002702461773009702488856004802585852000902633655001202642IND4475196420221122050849.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447519642DNAL7 a219839982pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-011-9759-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez Salvador, Martín,10aAgave salmiana Plant Communities in Central Mexico as Affected by Commercial Use  ap. 55-63.  aAgave salmiana is a native plant species harvested for the commercial production of mezcal (Agave spirits) in the highlands of central Mexico. The objective of this study was to identify vegetation changes in natural communities where A. salmiana has been differentially harvested for commercial purposes. Three plant community categories were identified in the state of Zacatecas based on their history of A. salmiana utilization: short (less than 10 years of use), moderate (about 25 years), and long (60 or more years). Species cover, composition, and density were evaluated in field surveys by use category. A gradient of vegetation structure of the communities parallels the duration of A. salmiana use. A. salmiana density was greatest (3,125 plants ha−1) in the short-use areas and less (892 plants ha−1) in the moderate-use areas, associated with markedly greater density of shrubs (200%) and Opuntia spp. (50%) in moderate-use areas. The main shrubs were Larrea tridentata, Mimosa biuncifera, Jatropha dioica and Buddleia scordioides while the main Opuntia species were Opuntia leucotricha and Opuntia robusta. A. salmiana density was least (652 plants ha−1) in the long-use areas where shrubs were less abundant but Opuntia spp. density was 25% higher than in moderate-use areas. We suggest that shrubs may increase with moderate use creating an intermediate successional stage that facilitates the establishment of Opuntia spp. Long-term Agave use is generating new plant communities dominated by Opuntia spp. (nopaleras) as a replacement of the original communities dominated by A. salmiana (magueyeras).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave salmiana 3aBuddleja 3aJatropha 3aLarrea tridentata 3aMimosa aculeaticarpa var. biuncifera 3aOpuntia 3acommunity structure 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3aplant communities 3ashrubs 3asurveys 3avegetation 3avegetation structure 2aAgavexgrowth & development 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aGeography 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 3aMexico 0aMexico1 aMata-González, Ricardo1 aMorales Nieto, Carlos1 aValdez-Cepeda, Ricardo0 tEnvironmental management.g2012 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.55-63dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-011-9759-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245011500175300001800290520171000308592002802018650001702046650001702063650001902080650002202099650001002121650001602131650001402147650001302161650001502174650001602189650001602205650001902221650001302240650002102253650002102274650002102295650001702316650001902333650001702352700003402369700003202403700003202435700003002467773014602497856008102643852000902724655001202733IND60572347720221119041604.0170717e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057234772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-8535-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendes, Kassio Ferreira10aQuantification of the fate of mesotrione applied alone or in a herbicide mixture in two Brazilian arable soils  ap. 8425-8435.  aThe effects of mesotrione, S-metolachlor, and terbuthylazine, applied in mixture, on soil biodegradation remain insufficiently researched. However, herbicide mixtures have been a common practice in agricultural systems in the last years. Understanding the fate of soil-applied herbicides may help on planning weed management tactics towards more sustainable and efficient weed control. Therefore, this study evaluated the fate of mesotrione alone and in mixture with S-metolachlor and terbuthylazine when applied to two contrasting arable Brazilian soils. Mineralization and degradation experiments were conducted using ¹⁴C-mesotrione alone or in mixture. From the 49-day laboratory incubation data, increased mineralization half-life of mesotrione was observed for the mixture of herbicides, ranging from a 4-day increase for the sandy loam soil to a 1-day increase in the sandy clay texture soils. Mesotrione degradation rate had a twofold increase in the sandy loam compared to the sandy clay soil. Two metabolites can be identified from mesotrione degradation, 4-methyl-sulfonyl-2-nitrobenzoic acid (MNBA) and 2-amino-4-methylsulfonyl benzoic acid (AMBA). Indices for the score of ubiquity in groundwater indicated mesotrione possesses leaching potential for both soils. Applying mesotrione alone or in mixture did not influence the amount of bound residues from mesotrione. However, mesotrione degradation rate was influenced by soil texture regardless if applied alone or in mixture. Mesotrione biotransformation was relatively quick, indicating that this herbicide has low persistence and, consequently, low residual effect on crops and weeds when present in similar soils to this present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3abenzoic acid 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3acrops 3agroundwater 3ahalf life 3aleaching 3amesotrione 3ametabolites 3ametolachlor 3amineralization 3aplanning 3aresidual effects 3asandy clay soils 3asandy loam soils 3asoil texture 3aterbuthylazine 3aweed control1 aMartins, Bianca Assis Barbosa1 ados Reis, Marcelo Rodrigues1 aPimpinato, Rodrigo Floriano1 aTornisielo, Valdemar Luiz0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Mar., v. 24, no. 9 p.8425-8435dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8535-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245010500215300001800320506007600338520146800414592002801882506003701910650001801947650002401965650002801989650003802017650001302055650002202068650001302090650001702103650001902120650002802139650001402167650002402181650002202205650001302227653000902240653001202249653001802261653001202279653001502291700002202306700003102328700001802359700002202377700001802399700006202417700002302479700002302502700002302525773011202548856008602660852000902746655001202755IND60679979120221207070719.0200217e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067997912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.0622doi7 aPMC71764082pmcid7 a319594222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStinson, Jordan A.10aThin silk fibroin films as a dried format for temperature stabilization of inactivated polio vaccine  ap. 1652-1660.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurrent inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) products are sensitive to both freezing and elevated temperatures and therefore must be shipped and stored between 2 °C and 8 °C, a requirement that imposes financial and logistical challenges for global distribution. As such, there is a critical need for a robust, thermally stable IPV to support global polio eradication and post-eradication immunization needs. Here, we present the development of air-dried thin films for temperature stabilization of IPV using the biomaterial silk fibroin. Thin-film product compositions were optimized for physical properties as well as poliovirus D-antigen recovery and were tested under accelerated and real-time stability storage conditions. Silk fibroin IPV films maintained 70% D-antigen potency after storage for nearly three years at room temperature, and greater than 50% potency for IPV-2 and IPV-3 serotypes at 45 °C for one year. The immunogenicity of silk fibroin IPV films after 2-week storage at 45 °C was assessed in Wistar rats and the stressed films generated equivalent neutralizing antibody responses to commercial vaccine for IPV-1 and IPV-2. However, the absence of IPV-3 responses warrants further investigation into the specificity of ELISA for intact IPV-3 D-antigen. By demonstrating immunogenicity post-storage, we offer the air-dried silk film format as a means to increase IPV vaccine access through innovative delivery systems such as microneedles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterovirus C 3aambient temperature 3abiocompatible materials 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibroins 3afilms (materials) 3afreezing 3aimmunization 3aimmunogenicity 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aserotypes 3astorage temperature 3athermal stability 3avaccines 0aSilk 0aFibroin 0aStabilization 0aVaccine 0aPoliovirus1 aPalmer, Carter R.1 aM., Davidq(David Miller),1 aLi, Adrian B.1 aLightner, Kandice1 aJost, Heather1 aWeldon, William C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5624-64111 aOberste, M.

In this communication, we describe that the antibodies raised against purified dextransucrase effectively inhibited the growth of S. mutans. The purified enzyme showed 58-fold enrichment, 17.5% yield and a specific activity of 3.96 units/mg protein. Purified IgG fraction of the antibody showed significant affinity with the antigenic protein. Immunotritation of the enzyme with dextransucrase antibody showed a gradual increase in inhibition of dextransucrase activity. The growth of S. mutans was also inhibited by 85% in the presence of 28 μg of IgG fraction of the antibody. Antibodies also impaired glucosyltransferase activity (72.8%) and biofilm formation by 92.6% in S. mutans. Western blot analysis revealed no cross reactivity with the various tissues of mice, rat, rabbit and humans. Dot blot analysis showed little reactivity with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Staphylococcus aureus and there was no reactivity with other bacterial strains like Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that antibody raised against dextransucrase exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of S. mutans and biofilm formation with no reactivity with various mammalian tissues, thus it could be an effective anticariogenic agent.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStaphylococcus mutans 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3abiofilm 3across reaction 3adental caries 3adextransucrase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aetiological agents 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3arabbits 3arats1 aSharma, Sukesh Chander1 aMahmood, Akhtar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3614-30490 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 4 p.1761-1772dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10327-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245011900185300001600304520155600320592002801876650001601904650000901920650001301929650001201942650001001954650001201964650003101976650001002007650002602017650001502043651002002058653001902078653001502097653001102112653001702123653001302140700001602153700001902169700001602188700001902204773012602223856008202349852000902431655001202440IND60517417320221119231909.0190803e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051741732DNAL7 a218997922pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800110020352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorsini, Nadia10aRewards can be used effectively with repeated exposure to increase liking of vegetables in 4–6-year-old children  ap. 942-951.  aTo examine whether parents offering a sticker reward to their child to taste a vegetable the child does not currently consume is associated with improvements in children's liking and consumption of the vegetable. A randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of exposure only (EO) and exposure plus reward (E + R), relative to a control group, on children's liking and consumption of a target vegetable. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 2 weeks from baseline (post-intervention). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 4 weeks and 3 months from baseline. The study took place in Adelaide, South Australia. Participants were self-selected in response to local media advertisements seeking to recruit parents finding it difficult to get their children to eat vegetables. Participants were 185 children (110 boys, seventy-five girls) aged 4–6 years and their primary caregiver/parent (172 mothers, thirteen fathers). The E + R group was able to achieve more days of taste exposure. Both EO and E + R increased liking at post-intervention compared with control and no further change occurred over the follow-up period. All groups increased their intake of the target vegetable at post-intervention. Target vegetable consumption continued to increase significantly over the follow-up period for E + R and control but not for EO. The findings provide support for the effectiveness of using a sticker reward with a repeated exposure strategy. In particular, such rewards can facilitate the actual tastings necessary to change liking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvertising 3aboys 3achildren 3afathers 3agirls 3amothers 3arandomized clinical trials 3ataste 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 3aSouth Australia 0aTaste exposure 0aVegetables 0aReward 0aIntervention 0aChildren1 aSlater, Amy1 aHarrison, Adam1 aCooke, Lucy1 aCox, David N.,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2013 May, v. 16, no. 5 p.942-951dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800110020353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011200170300002000282520154200302592002801844596005001872650002201922650002301944650001101967650001701978650001701995650001702012650001102029650001502040650001302055650002002068650001702088650001102105650001502116650003102131650004302162650001402205650002002219650001102239650001402250650001102264650000902275650001802284700002202302700002102324700002102345700002102366700002002387700002302407700006702430773016902497856008202666852000902748655001202757IND60624623320221119061731.0190528e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062462332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-3510-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabizadeh, Samaneh10aPrevalence and probabilistic health risk assessment of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 in Iranian edible oils  ap. 35562-35570.  aThe prevalence of aflatoxins (AFs) B₁, B₂, G₁, and G₂ in Iranian edible oils were assessed by immunoaffinity column cleanup and HPLC equipped with a fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD). Ninety-seven samples including sunflower, canola, refined olive, unrefined olive, frying, and blend oils were collected from eight provinces (n = 15 samples of refined olive oil, n = 15 samples of unrefined olive oil, n = 15 samples of sunflower oil, n = 15 samples of canola oil, n = 17 samples of frying oil, and n = 20 samples of blend oil). Also, cancer risk of aflatoxins in the adults and children due to ingestion of edible oils was estimated via margin of exposure (MOE) estimation in the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) model. Considering the limit of detection (LOD) of the current study, two unrefined olive oil samples from Zanjan Province were contaminated with AFB₂ in the concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 ng/g while other samples were free from AFB₁, AFB₂, AFG₁, and AFG₂. This study revealed that about 98% of the collected samples were free from AFs and the concentrations of AFs in the polluted samples were within the standard range suggested by European Commission regulation (20 μg/kg). However, health risk assessment indicated that both adult and children in the Zanjan Province are at considerable liver cancer risk (percentile 95% of MOE < 10,000 value). Therefore, national plan to address this issue and strict inspection of edible oil products by the regulatory bodies are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data  a3240274290cCNPq-TWAS Postgraduate Fellowship 3aHelianthus annuus 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadults 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin B2 3aaflatoxin G1 3acanola 3acanola oil 3achildren 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afrying 3afrying oil 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aingestion 3aliver neoplasms 3amodels 3aolive oil 3aolives 3arisk 3asunflower oil1 aShariatifar, Nabi1 aShokoohi, Esmail1 aShoeibi, Shahram1 aGavahian, Mohsen1 aFakhri, Yadolah1 aĀz̲arī, ʻAlī,1 aMousavi Khaneghah, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5769-00040 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Dec., v. 25, no. 35 p.35562-35570dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3510-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01223naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008000153300001800233520022700251592002800478650001400506650002300520650002500543650001100568650001100579650003000590700001600620700001600636700002700652773013500679856007400814852000900888655001200897IND60659961920221123000803.0190823e20130919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065996192DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc45233f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jian10aHighly active catalysts of bisphosphine oxides for asymmetric Heck reaction  ap. 9425-9427.  aBisphosphine oxides formed highly active asymmetric Heck catalysts, which were applied in asymmetric synthesis of pharmacologically active azacycles.

The relatively recently isolated genotype 3 rabbit HEV (rHEV-3) and the more well known genotype 3 isolates from humans and swine (hsHEV-3) have all been confirmed experimentally to be capable of infecting both non-human primates and specific-pathogen free (SPF) pigs. In a previous study rHEV-3 was shown to cause acute hepatitis in experimentally infected rabbits. However, whether hsHEV-3 can productively infect rabbits remained unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the experimental infection of rabbits with human HEV-3 (hHEV-3, JRC-HE3), to compare it to that with rHEV-3 (CHN-BJ-rb14) and to further characterise the pathogenesis of the two isolates. All animals inoculated with rHEV-3 (CHN-BJ-rb14) became infected, exhibiting an intermittent viremia, elevated liver enzymes, and persistent fecal virus shedding throughout the 15 week study period. Liver histopathology showed acute inflammation and both positive- and negative-stranded viral RNA was detected in various tissues from necropsied rabbits. By contrast, neither sero-conversion nor alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation was observed in most rabbits inoculated with hHEV-3 (JRC-HE3). In addition, rHEV-3 (CHN-BJ-rb14) but not hHEV-3 (JRC-HE3) recovered from primary infected rabbits was transmissible to naive rabbits. These results showed that SPF rabbits are readily susceptible to infection with rHEV-3 (CHN-BJ-rb14) but not hHEV-3 (JRC-HE3), which might indicate the influence of viral genomic organization on its pathogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3arabbits 3ahepatitis 3aviremia 3anecropsy 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aalanine transaminase 3agenotype 3aviral shedding 3apathogenesis 3abiological resistance 3atissues 3apathogens 3ahumans 3apathogenicity 3ahistopathology 3aswine 3aliver 3azoonoses 3ainflammation 3anucleotide sequences 3aRNA 3aPrimates 0aHEV genotype 3 (HEV-3) 0aInfection 0aRabbits 0aPathogenesis 0aHepatitis E virus1 aGong, Wanyun1 aSong, William Tianshi1 aFu, Hongwei1 aWang, Lin1 aLi, Manyu1 aWang, Ling1 aZhuang, Hui0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Aug., v. 207 p.1-6dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015900167300002000326520192000346592002802266596008502294650002602379650001502405650001502420650002002435650002602455650002902481650001102510650001102521650002802532650002402560650000902584650001502593650001102608650002102619650001402640650000702654650000902661650001302670650001802683650001102701650002402712650001702736650001502753650001502768650000902783651002502792700001602817700002002833700002002853773016902873856008203042852000903124655001203133IND60624623420221119061801.0190528e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062462342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-3463-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherfouh, Rabia10aLong-term, low technicality sewage sludge amendment and irrigation with treated wastewater under Mediterranean climate: impact on agronomical soil quality  ap. 35571-35581.  aWe evaluated the agronomic quality of loam to clay–loam soils from a Mediterranean area, which have been submitted for more than 10 years to irregular and poorly controlled treated wastewater (TWW) irrigation and sewage sludge (SS) amendment, both TWW and SS issuing from a domestic effluent treatment plant. A soil was submitted to SS amendment only, another to TWW irrigation only, another to both treatments, and another was not submitted to any of these treatments. We found that the agronomic quality of the treated soils has not decreased. In treated soils, it was observed a slight increase of pH, an increase of the cation exchange capacity, and no change of either salinity or electrical conductivity. Sodium adsorption ratio and exchangeable sodium percentage remained satisfactory, below 13 and 15, respectively, and no infiltration problems were observed, indicating that rainwater percolation was sufficient to leach the salt brought by SS or TWW. The soil organic matter (SOM) increased in all SS-amended and/or TWW-irrigated soils, the increase being higher in SS-amended soils. The SOM kept a satisfactory C/N ratio, lower than 15; the SUVA (Specific UV Absorbance) and E2/E3 index showed normal characteristics of the water-extracted organic matter (WEOC). Both SS amendment and TWW irrigation brought high amounts of nutrients in the considered soils and increased the nutrients disponibility, especially regarding K and P, as shown by the nutrient concentrations in the soil water extracts. The pH increase does not seem to be a problem for the bioavailability of trace elements, at least regarding Cu, Zn, Co, and Fe. Complementary studies should be undertaken for Ni. These observations highlight the potential agronomical benefits of application of wastewater and sewage sludge, even without great technicality, the better results being obtained using both SS amendment and TWW irrigation.  aPublisher supplied data  aDoctoral ScolarshipcAlgerian Ministry of High Education and Scientific Research 3aMediterranean climate 3aabsorbance 3aadsorption 3abioavailability 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acation exchange capacity 3acobalt 3acopper 3aelectrical conductivity 3aexchangeable sodium 3airon 3airrigation 3anickel 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3apH 3arain 3asalinity 3asewage sludge 3asodium 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3asoil water 3awastewater 3azinc 3aMediterranean region1 aLucas, Yves1 aDerridj, Arezki1 aMerdy, Patricia0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Dec., v. 25, no. 35 p.35571-35581dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3463-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245008400185300001600269520137800285592002801663650001101691650001801702650002101720650001601741650001201757650001801769650001601787650001101803650001501814653001501829653001301844653001701857653001601874653002001890700002001910700001601930700001801946700002201964700001501986773012702001856008202128852000902210655001202219IND60517499220221120152556.0190803e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051749922DNAL7 a259950492pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150014082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Eric10aDishware size and snack food intake in a between-subjects laboratory experiment  ap. 633-637.  aThe use of smaller dishware as a way of reducing food consumption has intuitive appeal and is recommended to the general public. Recent experimental studies have failed to find an effect of plate size on food intake, although the methods used across studies have varied. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect that bowl size had on snack food consumption in a ‘typical’ snacking context (snacking while watching television). Between-subjects. Laboratory experiment. Sixty-one adult participants served themselves and ate popcorn while watching television. Participants were randomly assigned to serve themselves with and eat from either a small or a large bowl. The use of a smaller bowl size did not reduce food consumption. Unexpectedly, participants in the small bowl condition tended to consume more popcorn (34·0 g) than participants in the large bowl condition (24·9 g; 37 % increase, d=0·5), although the statistical significance of this difference depended on whether analyses were adjusted to account for participant characteristics (e.g. gender) associated with food intake (P=0·02) or not (P=0·07). Counter to widely held belief, the use of a smaller bowl did not reduce snack food intake. Public health recommendations advising the use of smaller dishware to reduce food consumption are premature, as this strategy may not be effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aeating habits 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3apopcorn 3apublic health 3asnack foods 3asnacks 3atelevision 0aPlate size 0aDishware 0aPortion size 0aFood intake 0aMindless eating1 aSheen, Florence1 aHarrold, Jo1 aBoyland, Emma1 aHalford, Jason CG1 aMasic, Una0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Mar., v. 19, no. 4 p.633-637dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150014083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245012400189300001800313500001500331520182300346592002802169650002002197650001202217650001002229650002402239650000902263650001702272650001502289650001302304650001202317650001402329650001102343650001202354650001202366650001102378650002002389650002602409650000902435650002702444650001402471650002702485650002702512650002802539650002402567653001602591653001002607700002202617773010402639856005502743852000902798655001202807IND4469216120221122053052.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446921612DNAL7 a220611052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05337.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKRIST, MILOŠ10aSuperiority of extra‐pair offspring: maternal but not genetic effects as revealed by a mixed cross‐fostering design  ap. 5074-5091.  a2019-12-06  aExtra‐pair copulations (EPC) are the rule rather than an exception in socially monogamous birds, but despite widespread occurrences, the benefits of female infidelity remain elusive. Most attention has been paid to the possibility that females gain genetic benefits from EPC, and fitness comparisons between maternal half‐siblings are considered to be a defining test of this hypothesis. Recently, it was shown that these comparisons may be confounded by within‐brood maternal effects where one such effect may be the distribution of half‐siblings in the laying order. However, this possibility is difficult to study as it would be necessary to detect the egg from which each chick hatched. In this study, we used a new approach for egg‐chick assignment and cross‐fostered eggs on an individual basis among a set of nests of the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. After hatching, chicks were ascribed to mothers and therefore to individual eggs by molecular genetic methods. Extra‐pair young predominated early in the laying order. Under natural conditions, this should give them a competitive advantage over their half‐siblings, mediated by hatching asynchrony. However, we experimentally synchronized hatching, and after this treatment, extra‐pair young did not outperform within‐pair young in any studied trait including survival up to recruitment and several indicators of reproductive success and attractiveness. We obtained only modest sample sizes for the last two traits and did not test for extra‐pair success of male offspring. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility of advantages of extra‐pair young during the adult phase of life. However, our data tentatively suggest that the more likely reason for females’ EPCs is the insurance against the infertility of a social mate.  aPublisher supplied data 3amaternal effect 3amothers 3anests 3agenetic improvement 3aeggs 3ayoung adults 3acopulation 3ahatching 3aprogeny 3ainsurance 3achicks 3afemales 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGenetic Fitness 2aGenotyping Techniques 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aOviparity 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSongbirdsxgenetics 0arecruitment 0abirds1 aMUNCLINGER, PAVEL0 tMolecular ecology.g2011 Dec., v. 20, no. 23 p.5074-5091dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05337.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010400174300001800278520108200296592002801378650001101406650001601417650001501433650003101448650001101479650001501490700002201505700002401527700002801551700003001579700002501609700001901634700001901653700001801672773009801690856008601788852000901874655001201883IND60086311520221120144904.0141101e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008631152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderies, John M.14aThe challenge of understanding decisions in experimental studies of common pool resource governance  ap. 1571-1579.  aCommon pool resource experiments in the laboratory and the field have provided insights that have contrasted to those derived from conventional non-cooperative game theory. Contrary to predictions from non-cooperative game theory, participants are sometimes willing to restrain voluntarily from over extracting resources and use costly punishment to sanction other participants. Something as simple as face-to-face communication has been shown to increase average earnings significantly. In the next generation of experiments, both in the laboratory and in the field, we need to extract more information that provides insight concerning why people make the decisions they make. More information is needed concerning attributes of individuals as well as the social and social–ecological context in which they interact that may give rise to such deviations from theoretical predictions. In the process of extracting more information from participants and the contexts in which they interact, we face several methodological and ethical challenges which we address in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethics 3agame theory 3agovernance 3alaboratory experimentation 3apeople 3aprediction1 aJanssen, Marco A.1 aBousquet, François1 aCárdenas, Juan Camilo,1 aCastillo Durante, Daniel,1 aLopez, Maria-Claudio1 aTobias, Robert1 aVollan, Björn1 aWutich, Amber0 tEcological economics.g2011 July 15, v. 70, no. 9 p.1571-1579dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004800094040001800142100002200160245009100182300001300273506002800286520150800314592002801822506003701850650001201887650001801899650000901917650002301926650001701949650002101966650001701987650001702004650001402021650001402035650001302049650001202062650001202074651001302086653001502099653002102114653001302135653002202148653000802170700001702178700002302195773010902218856009502327852000902422655001202431IND60775001220221207115924.0200610e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077500122DNAL7 ahttps://doi.org/10.21897/rta.v22i1.9112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuarez, Isidro E.10aArrow cane (Gynerium sagitatum Aubl.) in vitro rhizome formation and plantlet recovery  ap. 9-18.  aResource is Open Access  aGynerium sagitatum Aubl. (Poaceae) is an important environmental, cultural and economic species for aboriginal communities in Northern Colombia, in which the centrale central nerve is used to make precious craftsmanship products. The massive use of the plant with no restoration has dangerously decreased natural populations. Micropropagation has emerged as a way to efficiently produce planting material for cropping and restoration of affected areas. To improve cost efficiency of the micropropagation protocol, in vitro rhizome structures were induced using in vitromaintained plants as explants under three quantities of sucrose, four of benzyl aminopurine - BAP and four of abscisic acid - ABA supplied in MS with (in mg L-1) myo-inositol (100), thiamine HCL (0.4), and solidified with Phytagel® (3.000). Treatments (48) were distributed using a complete randomized design with six replicates per treatment. Cultures were stored during eight weeks at 25 °C with 12 h photoperiod (40 μmol photons m-2 s-1) provided by with cold fluorescent lamps. Statistical differences were observed with respect to number of rhizomes and rhizome length as a result of three factor interaction. Ex vitro plantlet recovery occurred at highest percentage from rhizomes developed in media supplied with sucrose at 263000 µM combined with 4.44 and 8.88 µM BAP. Data evidenced the possibility of inducing in vitro rhizome growth from arrow cane explants to use them as a way for propagation and plant conservation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPoaceae 3aabscisic acid 3acold 3acost effectiveness 3afluorescence 3amicropropagation 3amyo-inositol 3anerve tissue 3aplantlets 3aprotocols 3arhizomes 3asucrose 3athiamin 3aColombia 0aarrow cane 0amicropropagation 0ain vitro 0arhizome formation 0apgr1 aOrtiz, Orlis1 aLópez, Claudia M.0 tTemas Agrarios.g2017 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.9-18dUniversidad de CórdobawJournal:27729x2389-91827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.21897/rta.v22i1.9113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002200161245007000183300001800253500000900271520160800280592002801888650002201916650001301938650001801951650001501969650001901984650002302003650002102026650000902047650001802056650001702074650001902091651001702110700001702127773015002144856009602294852000902390655001202399IND60668438820221119120720.0191125e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066843882DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300060023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchumacher, W. K.10aResidual Effects of Chloride Application in a Corn-Wheat Rotation  ap. 1742-1747.  aepub  aSignificant correlations have been noted between soil Cl, Cl uptake, and yield response in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Little information exists, however, concerning the residual value of Cl, especially in subhumid areas. Therefore, a study was conducted to determine residual effects of Cl application on soil Cl levels and on associated crop yield in a wheat-corn (Zea mays L.) rotation. Six Cl rates ranging from 0 to 510 kg ha⁻¹ were applied as KCl (muriate of potash) to a soil (Udic Haploboroll) with an initial soil-Cl content of 19 kg ha⁻¹ in the upper 60 cm. A corn-spring wheat rotation was practiced between two adjacent sites. Soil Cl levels were measured after the first three seasons at five depth increments to a final depth of 120 cm. Maximum Cl concentrations following the first growing season occurred at approximately 50 cm. By the beginning of the third growing season, most of the Cl had leached below 120 cm. Deep sampling to 3 m after the third growing season indicated maximum Cl accumulation between 1 and 2 m. A positive response of spring wheat to added Cl was observed for the first two growing seasons. Factors contributing to the removal of Cl from the upper 120 cm include above-average precipitation and large precipitation events. Chloride soil testing is recommended prior to the establishment of a Cl-responsive crop in regions where responses have been verified. Contribution from South Dakota Agric. Exp.

Sugar cane bagasse was applied to the PFB as immobilizing material. Starting at a concentration of 80g/L of glucose, Propionibacterium freudenreichii CCTCC M207015 produced 41.20±2.03g/L of propionic acid at 108h in the PFB. The value was 21.07% higher than that produced by free cell fermentation. Intermittent and constant fed-batch fermentations were performed in the PFB to optimize the fermentation results. The highest propionic acid concentration obtained from constant fed-batch fermentation was 136.23±6.77g/L, which is 1.40 times higher than the highest concentration (97.00g/L) previously reported. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that cells exhibited striking changes in morphology after PFB domestication. Compared with free cell fermentation, the fluxes of propionic acid synthesis and the pentose phosphate pathway in PFB fermentation increased by 84.65% and 227.62%, respectively. On the other hand, a decrease in succinic and acetic acid fluxes was also observed. The metabolic flux distributions of the two PFB fed-batch fermentation strategies also demonstrated that constant fed-batch fermentation is a more beneficial method for the immobilized production of propionic acid. The relevant key enzyme activities and metabolic flux variations of the batch cultures showed good consistency. These results suggest that the PFB was effective in high-concentration propionic acid production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPropionibacterium freudenreichii 3aacetic acid 3abatch fermentation 3abioreactors 3adomestication 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose 3apentose phosphate cycle 3apropionic acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asugarcane bagasse 0aGLC 0aG6P 0aF6P 0aDHAP 0aGAP 0aG3P 0aRU5P 0aCO2 0aXU5P 0aR5P 0aS7P 0aE4P 0aPEP 0aPYR 0aAACoA 0aOACE 0aSUC 0aMMCoA 0aPPCoA 0aSUCCoA 0aPA 0aLA 0aAC 0aPTA 0aACK 0aOTC 0aCoAT 0aPPC 0aG6PDH 0aPropionibacterium freudenreichii CCTCC M207015 0aPropionic acid 0aSugar cane bagasse 0aPlant fibrous-bed bioreactor 0aCell physiological change 0aMetabolic flux analysis1 aFeng, Xiaohai1 aXu, Hong1 aZhang, Dan1 aOuyang, Pingkai0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2013 Mar., v. 164 p.202-210dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007900161300001800240520098100258592002801239650002301267650002501290650002601315650001301341653001301354653002101367653002601388653002301414653003701437700001801474700002401492700001401516700001601530700001701546773012701563856007301690852000901763655001201772IND60527452020221122065651.0160715e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052745202DNAL7 a10.1021/am401119j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Arun Kumar10aTailoring the Electrical Properties of Graphene Layers by Molecular Doping  ap. 5276-5281.  aIt is an essential issue in graphene-based nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices to tune the electrical properties of graphene layers, while preserving its unique band structure. Here, we report the tuning of electronic properties of single-, bi-, and trilayer mechanically exfoliated graphenes by p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) molecular doping. Raman spectroscopy and charge transport measurements revealed that PTSA molecule imposes n-doping to single-, bi-, and trilayer graphenes. The shift of G and 2D peak frequencies and intensity ratio of single-, bi-, and trilayer graphenes are analyzed as a function of reaction time. The Dirac point is also analyzed as a function of reaction time indicates the n-type doping effect for all single-, bi-, and trilayer graphenes. Our study demonstrates that chemical modification is a simple approach to tailor the electrical properties of single-, bi-, and trilayer graphenes, while maintaining the important electrical assets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3achemical engineering 3aelectrical properties 3agraphene 0agraphene 0amolecular doping 0aelectrical properties 0aRaman spectroscopy 0atransparent conducting electrode1 aAhmad, Muneer1 aSingh, Vivek Kumar,1 aShin, Koo1 aSeo, Yongho1 aEom, Jonghwa0 tACS applied materials .g2013 June 12, v. 5, no. 11 p.5276-5281dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am401119j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018500168300001400353520149700367592002801864650002001892650002901912650001201941650001701953650001201970650001501982650001501997650001502012650001502027650001702042650004102059650001802100650001102118650001202129650001602141650001502157650001702172650002202189650001602211650002202227650001702249650001402266650001102280650001402291650001202305700002102317773008902338856008102427852000902508655001202517IND60555579420221122221334.0170725e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055557942DNAL7 a10.1007/s13199-016-0379-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, James M.10aComparative metabolomics of root nodules infected with Frankia sp. strains and uninfected roots from Alnus glutinosa and Casuarina cunninghamiana reflects physiological integration  ap. 87-96.  aNitrogen-fixing root nodules on actinorhizal plants have varying internal architectures, implying diversity in how Frankia sp. integrates into plant physiologies. To understand this integration we compared the metabolomes of Alnus glutinosa and Casuarina cunninghamiana root nodules with roots from uninfected plants. High throughput gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was done on extracts of nodules and roots from uninfected seedlings. Over 118 metabolites in C. cunninghamiana roots and nodules and over 163 in A. glutinosa roots and nodules were identified; between one-third to one-half of the metabolites significantly increased or decreased between roots and nodules. Amino acid patterns varied between the plants with only glutamate and alanine, which may be conducive to the induction of nitrogenase, and citrulline, elevated in nodules of both. Sugar levels were similar between species excepting a striking increase of maltose and cellobiose in C. cunninghamiana nodules indicating starch mobilization and cell wall modification. Stress related compounds increased in both systems. Phenylacetic acid was elevated in A. glutinosa nodules. High ethanolamine content was found in C. cunninghamiana nodules suggesting lipid degradation. We conclude that C. cunninghamiana responds more robustly to the presence of the endophyte than A. glutinosa with metabolite patterns consistent with different strategies used for compartmentalizing the symbiont from uninfected tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aCasuarina cunninghamiana 3aFrankia 3aactinorhizae 3aalanine 3acell walls 3acellobiose 3acitrulline 3aendophytes 3aethanolamine 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglutamic acid 3alipids 3amaltose 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogenase 3aphenylacetic acid 3aroot nodules 3aseedlings 3astarch 3asymbionts 3atissues1 aBenson, David R.0 tSymbiosis.g2016 June, v. 70, no. 1-3 p.87-96dSpringer Netherlandsx0334-51147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-016-0379-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008800170300001600258500001500274520070200289592002800991650001401019650001301033650001201046650001201058650001001070650001201080650001601092650001101108650001001119650001601129650001201145650001001157650001401167653001401181653001301195653002101208653002001229653003801249653001901287653002101306653001501327700001901342700002201361773011101383856005101494852000901545655001201554IND50076503020221119173937.0140410e20130313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007650302DNAL7 a10.1080/87559129.2012.7144352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweley, Jess C.10aQuality Traits and Popping Performance Considerations for Popcorn (Zea mays Everta)  ap. 157-177.  a2019-12-05  aPopcorn is a snack food with significant commercial popularity. Popcorn popping mechanics can be described by a series of polymeric transformations. The most important quality traits for popcorn are expansion volume and “eatability” factors, including unpopped kernels, hull dispersion, and the color, texture, and flavor of popped flakes. Popcorn quality depends on both intrinsic factors, such as hybrid selection, kernel conditioning, and kernel physiochemical attributes, and extrinsic variables, including popping method and ingredient additives. Developing new technologies and establishing new quality attributes for popcorn may help to further increase consumer liking and consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanics 3aZea mays 3ahybrids 3apopcorn 3aseeds 3atexture 3asnack foods 3aflavor 3acolor 3aingredients 3apopping 3ahulls 3aadditives 0aMicrowave 0aPericarp 0aExpansion volume 0aHull dispersion 0aPhysical and chemical composition 0anew technology 0aUnpopped kernels 0atechnology1 aRose, Devin J.1 aJackson, David S.0 tFood reviews international.g2013 Mar. 13, v. 29, no. 2 p.157-177dTaylor & Francis Groupx1525-61037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/87559129.2012.714435  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008300166300001600249520060600265592002800871650001400899650000700913650002000920650001900940650002100959650002700980700001901007773011601026856008101142852000901223655001201232IND60575336420221118201558.0170728e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057533642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10311-008-0182-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmanuel, Neela10aPhoto detoxification of solubilized vat dye effluent using different pH ranges  ap. 375-379.  aThe removal of solubilized vat dye effluent using photo detoxification method was studied at various pH ranges.

The degradable stamp materials are based on polyanhydrides synthesized using thiol–ene polymerization. In this study, curing the monomers 4-pentenoic anhydride and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) on a master mold yields low modulus, elastomeric, degradable polyanhydride polymer stamps that are a negative of the master. These stamps can be then used as a sacrificial template during the fabrication of a replica of the master, and can be readily degraded away from the replica using water. The resultant imprinted materials exhibited excellent uniformity over a large area. Compared with other conventional imprint lithography stamp materials, the thiol–ene polymerized polyanhydrides are degradable, master mold safe, show great release properties, have fast cure rates, are relatively low cost, and can be fabricated onto variety of substrates and materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3apolymerization 3apolymers 0asoft imprint lithography 0adegradable network polymer 0apolyanhydride 0apatterning 0adegradable stamp 0athiol−ene polymerization1 aShipp, Devon A.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2012 Sept. 26, v. 4, no. 9 p.4457-4460dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam301312n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245010700154300001800261520133000279592002801609650004401637650002201681650002801703650001301731650001001744650001801754650001901772650001501791650003301806650001101839650002101850650002101871650003701892650001801929650003701947653004601984653002202030653002102052653001602073653002102089653001802110700001502128773012402143856007502267852000902342655001202351IND60527452120221120074912.0160715e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052745212DNAL7 a10.1021/am401124j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoyu10aSynthesis of Raspberry-Like SiO2–TiO2 Nanoparticles toward Antireflective and Self-Cleaning Coatings  ap. 5282-5290.  aSilica–titania core–shell nanoparticles of 30, 40, 50, 55, 75, and 110 nm were prepared from tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and tetraisopropyl titanate (TIPT). After calcination, the amorphous titania shell transformed into anatase nanoparticles, and the silica–titania core–shell nanoparticles became raspberry-like nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and UV–vis spectroscopy. Hierarchically structured antireflective and self-cleaning particulate coatings were fabricated on glass substrates via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly using silica–titania core–shell nanoparticles and silica nanoparticles as building blocks followed by calcination. The maximum transmittance of coated glass substrates reached as high as ca. 97%, while that of the glass substrates is only ca. 91%. The morphologies of the coatings were observed by SEM and atom force microscopy (AFM). Such hierarchically structured raspberry-like SiO₂–TiO₂ nanoparticle coatings had superhydrophilic and antifogging properties.

We identified 7344 and 3934 ⁵ᵐCs in the ACN14a and CcI3 genomes, respectively. These cytosine methylations fell into two categories in which the rate of methylated molecules contained within the libraries differed. In category 1, cytosines were methylated in most of the chromosome molecules contained in the library. In category 2, however, cytosines in only some of the chromosome molecules were methylated. In the ACN14a genome, both categories of methylation were found, whereas in the CcI3 genome only category 2 methylation was detected. We found evidence of consensus sequences around the three types of ⁵ᵐC: 5′-GGC⁵ᵐCGGCC-3′ (ACN14a, category 1), 5′-GGC⁵ᵐCGGCT-3′ (ACN14a, category 2), and 5′-CGGC⁵ᵐCGGC-3′ (CcI3, category 2). The consensus sequence for the ACN14a category 1 ⁵ᵐCs was identical to the recognition sequence of a type II methyltransferase M.FseI, which was isolated from Frankia sp. NRRL 18528. A Frankia ACN14a gene, FRAAL0689, showed strong homology to M.FseI, indicating that the gene is responsible for category 1 methylation in ACN14a. Consensus sequences for category 2 ⁵ᵐCs were not identical to any recognition sequences of known restriction endonucleases and DNA methyltransferases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aFrankia 3achromosomes 3aconsensus sequence 3acytosine 3agenes 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3arestriction endonucleases 3asequence analysis 3asymbiosis1 aKamiharai, Toshihito0 tSymbiosis.g2016 June, v. 70, no. 1-3 p.31-36dSpringer Netherlandsx0334-51147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-016-0384-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012800172300001600300520166500316592002801981650001102009650001102020650002002031650001402051650002702065650002302092650001502115650001402130650002202144650002102166650001102187650002302198650001502221650001502236650001302251650002302264650001202287650001802299650001802317651001502335653001902350653002702369653002702396653001702423653002602440700002002466700006202486773010602548856008502654852000902739655001202748IND60630864620221119205619.0190410e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063086462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2018.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanford, Bronwen10aWhere and why does restoration happen? Ecological and sociopolitical influences on stream restoration in coastal California  ap. 219-227.  aThe distribution of conservation effort on the landscape is affected by both ecological and social priorities and constraints. Together these influences can result in bias towards certain types of ecological or human communities. We evaluate the distribution of restoration projects on the California Central Coast, USA, to evaluate sociopolitical and biophysical influences on the type and distribution of one type of conservation effort. We compiled data on 699 sites with publicly funded stream restoration and management projects completed in the past 30 years and the biophysical and sociopolitical characteristics of the 310 sub-catchments in our study area. Our database contains three categories of stream projects: ecological restoration to benefit natural ecosystems, human-oriented projects to enhance ecosystem services, and data collection projects for planning and monitoring. Both ecological and human-oriented restoration efforts were clustered near the coastline. Stream activities of all kinds were highest in sub-catchments with water quality impairment, high population density, high pro-environmental voting, and a highly educated, wealthy, non-Hispanic white population. Ecological restoration and data collection were also greater in catchments with higher native fish richness. Our findings indicate that restoration activity is aligned with, and perhaps responding to, ecological need, and that restoration efforts are concentrated near human population centers and restoration organizations. Disparities in conservation effort by income, race, and education are concerning and should be evaluated in more depth and in other regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhites 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aecological restoration 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aeducation 3ahuman communities 3ahuman population 3aincome 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3apopulation density 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3awater quality 3aCalifornia 0aPrioritization 0aEcological restoration 0aImpaired water quality 0aHuman impact 0aEnvironmental justice1 aZavaleta, Erika1 aMillard-Ball, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2353-87300 tBiological conservation.g2018 May, v. 221 p.219-227dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01958naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009700166300001400263520075300277592002801030650001701058650002001075650001401095650001501109650001801124650001001142650000901152650001301161650001301174650001001187653001901197653003401216653002301250700001601273700001801289700001601307700001901323773009801342856008701440852000901527655001201536IND60610911720221120033615.0190402e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061091172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Lei10aMolecularly imprinted polymer grafted paper-based method for the detection of 17β-estradiol  ap. 82-86.  a17β-estradiol (17β-E2) usually is used to promote the growth of animal.

Individual determinations were adapted and comprised within the same manifold to attain a comprehensive assessment of the environmental status of natural waters. The multiparametric determination was performed to explore the features of a sequential injection analysis technique yielding a real-time assessment of various parameters and effective in-line sample handling. The sequential injection multiparametric method enabled the determination within the ranges: 15.0–150 μM nitrate; 0.15–5.00 μM nitrite; 1.00–60 μM ammonium; and 0.2–30 μM phosphate. The determination rates provided a full nutrient analysis within 7 minutes, an overwhelming improvement in relation to the individual determination of each parameter. The described method was successfully applied to seasonal monitoring of six inland bathing waters dealing in-line with sample variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanalytical methods 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphates1 aMachado, Ana1 aSantos, Inês C.1 aBordalo, Adriano A.1 aRangel, António O.

Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapilla) use their chick-a-dee call as a mobbing call when encountering a perched hawk or owl. This social signal appears to serve as an alert to other chickadees, causing them to rally to the vicinity of the predator and join in a chorus of calling. We asked the question: do chickadees vary the mobbing call in a manner that could convey the immediacy of threat from a potential predator? We examined the responses of chickadees to a taxidermic mount of an avian predator presented at distances of 1 m and 6 m from each subject. Vocal responses were recorded and analyzed for response latency, calling rate, and syllable composition of calls. During 5-min trials, the subjects responded more quickly and produced significantly more chick-a-dee calls for predator presentations at the 1-m distance than at the 6-m distance. Alterations of syllable composition of the call also were observed under the two treatments. These results suggest that information about the immediacy of threat or proximity of a predator may be signaled by alteration of the rate of calling, with possible additional information contained in proportional changes in the different syllable types of the call. Studies of referential (symbolic) communication in birds and mammals often have failed to consider the problem of response urgency separately from predator-type labeling in vocal signal design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecile atricapillus 3aStrigiformes 3aantipredatory behavior 3ahawks 3amammals1 aBecker, April M.,0 tWilson bulletin.g2002 Dec., v. 114, no. 4 p.510-516dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F0043-5643%282002%29114%5B0510%3AMCOBCC%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008900166520100400255592002801259650001601287650002101303650001301324650001701337650001601354650001401370650001601384650001801400650001601418650002201434650002601456650001301482650001301495650002101508650003101529653001801560653001601578653002301594653003201617653002901649700001401678700001301692700001301705700001601718700005201734700001601786700005301802773010701855856008601962852000902048655001202057IND60684955920221118155833.0220118e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068495592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1160582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, C.Q.10aChitosan ducts fabricated by extrusion-based 3D printing for soft-tissue engineering  aThree kinds of methods based on extrusion and 3D printing and different acidic solutions (formic acid (FA), acetic acid (AA), glycolic acid (GA) and lactic acid (LA)) were applied for manufacturing the CS ducts.

Many studies support their roles in the prevention and treatment of cancer, arterial sclerosis, osteoporosis and menopausal syndrome. Genistin and genistein, the two highest amount active ingredients in soy isoflavones, were developed into two new certified reference materials (CRMs) in this work. According to the guidelines of development of CRMs, mainly ISO Guides 34:2009 and 35:2005, studies on sample preparation, homogeneity, stability, characterization, and uncertainty estimation were carried out. In the characterization, two methods based on different theories, namely differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and coulometric titrimetry (CT), were employed. Genistin and genistein CRM certified values and corresponding expanded uncertainties, obtained from the combined standard uncertainty multiplied by the coverage factor (k = 2), for a confidence level of 95%, were 99.7 ± 0.3% and 99.3 ± 0.5%. The mass balance (MB) method was employed to cross-check the results. Genistin and genistein CRMs have been approved and assigned as a grade primary reference material by the National Administrative Committee. These CRMs can be applied to the analysis of soy isoflavones in related products, such as (fermenting) soybean foods or medicines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3acertification 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afoods 3agenistein 3agenistin 3aguidelines 3amenopause 3aneoplasms 3aosteoporosis 3areference standards 3asclerosis 3asecondary metabolites 3asoybeans 3auncertainty1 aYang, Shiying1 aZhang, Baoxi1 aLu, Yang0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Dec. 17, v. 8, no. 1 p.89-96dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay02304a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245017900175300001600354500001500370520173300385592002802118650001402146650002802160650002402188650001802212650001102230650000902241650001702250650000902267650001202276650001302288650001202301650002602313650001302339650001602352653002702368653001702395653001102412653002302423653001502446653001702461700001402478700002302492700001802515700001802533700001702551700002002568700001402588773007702602856008902679852000902768655001202777IND60556741320221120074234.0161102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055674132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Liangliang10aTransformation and speciation of typical heavy metals in soil aquifer treatment system during long time recharging with secondary effluent: Depth distribution and combination  ap. 100-109.  a2019-12-06  aSoil aquifer treatment (SAT) systems rely on extensive physical and biogeochemical processes in the vadose zone and aquifer for water quality improvement. In this study, the distribution, quantitative changes, as well as the speciation characteristics of heavy metals in different depth of soils of a two-year operated lab-scale SAT was explored. A majority of the heavy metals in the recharged secondary effluent were efficiently trapped by the steady-state operated SAT (removal efficiency ranged from 74.7% to 98.2%). Thus, significant accumulations of 31.7% for Cd, 15.9% for Cu, 15.3% for Zn and 8.6% for Cr were observed for the top soil after 730 d operation, leading to the concentration (in μg g−1) of those four heavy metals of the packed soil increased from 0.51, 46.7, 61.0 and 35.7 to 0.66, 54.2, 70.4 and 38.8, respectively. By contrast, the accumulation of Mn and Pb were quite low. The residual species were the predominant fraction of the six heavy metals (ranged for 59.8–82.4%), followed by oxidisable species. Although the Zn, Cr, Cd, Cu and Mn were efficiently bounded onto the oxide components within the soil, the percentage of the labile metal fractions (water-, acid-exchangeable and reducible metal fractions) exhibited a slight increasing after 2 Y operation. Significantly heavy metals accumulation and slightly decreasing of the proportion of the stable fractions indicated a potentially higher environmental hazard for those six heavy metals after long-term SAT operation (especially for Cu, Zn and Cd). Finally, a linear relationship between the accumulation rate of metal species and the variation of soil organic carbon concentration and water extractable organic carbon was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3ainterspecific variation 3asoil organic carbon 3awater quality 3acopper 3azinc 3aheavy metals 3alead 3acadmium 3aaquifers 3atopsoil 3aenvironmental hazards 3achromium 3avadose zone 0aSoil aquifer treatment 0aAccumulation 0acarbon 0aSecondary effluent 0aSpeciation 0aHeavy metals1 aWang, Kun1 aNoguera, Daniel R.1 aJiang, Junqiu1 aOyserman, Ben1 aZhao, Ningbo1 aZhao, Qingliang1 aCui, Fuyi0 tChemosphere.g2016 Dec., v. 165 p.100-109dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100006000189245014500249300001100394506007600405520195300481592002802434596004402462506003702506650001702543650001402560650001202574650001202586650001002598650000902608650002502617650001602642650001702658700006702675700005802742700005902800773011202859856008302971852000903054655001203063IND60687780220221207094727.0201204e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068778022DNAL7 aPMC71188242pmcid7 a322659972pmid7 a10.1186/s12983-020-00353-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicolakis, Doris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0478-499510aUltrasonic vocalizations in house mice depend upon genetic relatedness of mating partners and correlate with subsequent reproductive success  ap. 10.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Courtship vocalizations are used by males of many species to attract and influence the behavior of potential mating partners. Our aim here was to investigate the modulation and reproductive consequences of courtship ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in wild-derived house mice (Mus musculus musculus). The courtship USVs of male mice are surprisingly complex and are composed of a variety of different syllable types. Our specific aims were to test whether (1) the emission of courtship USVs depends upon the kinship of a potential mating partner, and (2) whether USV emission during courtship affects the pairs’ subsequent reproductive success. RESULTS: We experimentally presented males with an unfamiliar female that was either genetically related or unrelated, and we recorded USV emission, first while the sexes were separated by a perforated partition and then during direct interactions, after removing the partition. USVs were detected by the Automatic Mouse Ultrasound Detector (A-MUD) and manually classified into 15 syllable types. The mice were kept together to test whether and how courtship vocalizations predict their subsequent reproductive success. We found that the mice significantly increased their amount of vocalizations (vocal performance) and number of syllable types (vocal repertoire) after the partition was removed and they began interacting directly. We show that unrelated pairs emitted longer and more complex USVs compared to related pairs during direct interactions. Unrelated pairs also had a greater reproductive success compared to related pairs, and in addition we found a negative correlation between the mean length and amount of vocalizations with the latency to their first litter. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that house mice modulate the emission of courtship USVs depending upon the kinship of potential mating partners, and that courtship USVs correlate with reproductive success.  aPublisher supplied data  aP 28141-B25cAustrian Science Fund (AT)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMus musculus 3acourtship 3afemales 3akinship 3amales 3amice 3areproductive success 3aultrasonics 3avocalization1 aMarconi, Maria Adelaide1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3429-74151 aZala, Sarah M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0698-52991 aPenn, Dustin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5406-80650 tFrontiers in zoology.g2020 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.10-10dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001775x1742-99947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-020-00353-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245009400154300001600248500002000264520171000284592002801994650001102022650001602033650001602049650002302065650001102088650002202099650001302121650001802134650001502152650001102167650001902178650001102197650000902208650001202217650001002229700001802239773013302257856007202390852000902462655001202471IND60589275620221118004556.0180210e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058927562DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.32402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, N.E.10aInfluence of tributaries on the longitudinal patterns of benthic invertebrate communities  ap. 165-173.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThere has been little effort to understand how tributaries influence mainstem rivers at large scales beyond the immediate influence of the tributary and downstream of the mixing zone. Such knowledge is needed to create breaks in stream networks that can aid in the classification of stream valley segments and conservation studies that rely on the delineation of zones. We use benthic invertebrate assemblages to infer longitudinal gradients and discontinuities and relate these patterns to confluence symmetry ratio (CSR; the size ratio of the tributary basin to the mainstem basin upstream of the confluence). In addition, we briefly explore reach and catchment‐scale environmental influences. We found evidence for both gradual and abrupt longitudinal changes in benthic invertebrate communities. There was not a smooth continuous gradient but a sawtooth pattern with an overarching trend. Two major discontinuities were found: one associated with a large CSR = 0.74 and reach scale factors including predominance of sand and an abundance of benthic organic matter that provided a unique habitat; and a second associated with a large CSR = 0.64 and a transition from coarse textured morainal deposits to glaciolacustrine deposits. There were synchronous additions of some benthic invertebrates (e.g., Eukiefferiella brehmi, Antocha, Hydropsyche morosa, and Oligochaeta) showing an affinity for downstream reaches, whereas others showed an affinity for headwater reaches (e.g., Simulium tuberosum, Baetis tricaudatus, and Micropsectra). Benthic invertebrate communities were driven by a combination of confluence symmetry ratio, landscape, and reach scale factors that can confound interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaetis 3aHydropsyche 3aOligochaeta 3aSimulium tuberosum 3abasins 3abenthic organisms 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3alandscapes 3amixing 3aorganic matter 3arivers 3asand 3astreams 3awater1 aSchmidt, B.J.0 tRiver research and applications.g2018 Feb., v. 34, no. 2 p.165-173dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.32403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010900165300001800274520128400292592002801576596008101604596012701685596004001812650001501852650001201867650001901879650001101898650002001909650001501929650001901944650001001963653001701973653002701990653003402017653002802051700006402079700002202143700002402165773012102189856008002310852000902390655001202399IND60655004220221119053244.0190729e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065500422DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175187833542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTunák, Maroš10aSpatial arrangement of stainless steel fibers within hybrid yarns designed for electromagnetic shielding  ap. 2019-2030.  aYarns containing textile fibers and fine metal fibers in their structure are often used to produce electrically conductive fabrics. The blending quality of the fiber components in a yarn significantly affects the properties of the yarn and the produced fabric. Therefore, the arrangement of metal fibers in yarn structures needs to be analyzed, which can be done using image analysis and spatial statistics methods. One of the aims of this paper is to introduce a suitable methodology for obtaining adequate cross-sections of a yarn containing metal fibers that would allow the usage of objective image analysis methods to identify the component fibers for subsequent evaluation of spatial arrangement. In this paper, an algorithm for the objective segmentation of the component fibers in a yarn cross-section is proposed, and a methodology for evaluating the spatial arrangement of fibers using spatial statistics data is presented. The second aim is to study the specific arrangement of the fibers in hybrid yarns containing 20 wt% of a conductive component, more precisely extremely thin discrete stainless steel fibers, by the proposed methodology. Based on the results, it is concluded that the metal fibers in the cross-sections of this hybrid yarn are randomly arranged.  aPublisher supplied data  aSGS no. 21199cMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic  aCZ.01.1.02/0.0/0.0/15_019/0004465cMinisterstvo Průmyslu a Obchodudhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004578  a18-01137ScCzech Science Foundation 3aalgorithms 3afabrics 3aimage analysis 3amixing 3astainless steel 3astatistics 3atextile fibers 3ayarns 0ahybrid yarns 0astainless steel fibers 0aspatial arrangement of fibers 0across-section of fibers1 aTunáková, Veronika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2410-69801 aSchindler, Martin1 aProcházka, Jiří,0 tTextile research journal.g2019 May, v. 89, no. 10 p.2019-2030dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175187833543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015300158300001800311520127100329592002801600650002101628650004401649650002701693650001501720650002901735650002201764650001301786650001301799650001701812650003101829650001901860650001301879650001801892650001501910650000701925650001901932650003301951650003701984650003702021653001802058653001802076653002302094653001702117653002302134700001702157700001802174700001902192700002202211700001602233773012402249856007502373852000902448655001202457IND60527452420221120085025.0160715e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052745242DNAL7 a10.1021/am40116442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoli, Kiran K.10aGeneration and Properties of Antibacterial Coatings Based on Electrostatic Attachment of Silver Nanoparticles to Protein-Coated Polypropylene Fibers  ap. 5298-5306.  aWe present a simple method for attaching silver nanoparticles to polypropylene (PP) fibers in a two-step process to impart antibacterial properties. Specifically, PP fibers are pretreated by the adsorption from an aqueous solution of heat-denatured lysozyme (LYS) followed by LYS cross-linking using glutaraldehyde and sodium borohydride. At neutral pH, the surface of the adsorbed LYS layer is enriched with numerous positive charges. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) capped with trisodium citrate are subsequently deposited onto the protein-coated PP. Nanoparticle binding is mediated by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged LYS layer and the negatively charged AgNPs. The density of AgNPs deposited on PP depends on the amount of protein adsorbed on the surface. UV–vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy are employed to follow all preparation steps and to characterize the resulting functional surfaces. The antibacterial activity of the modified surfaces is tested against gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli). Overall, our results show that PP surfaces coated with AgNPs exhibit excellent antibacterial activity with 100% removal efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aadsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3aaqueous solutions 3acitrates 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aglutaraldehyde 3alysozyme 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apH 3apolypropylenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aantibacterial 0apolypropylene 0aprotein adsorption 0ananoparticle 0afunctional coating1 aGera, Nimish1 aLiu, Xiaomeng1 aRao, Balaji

All infant formulas, available on the day of sampling, were purchased from random supermarkets in Grand Forks, ND, USA; San Diego, CA, USA; Washington, DC, USA; and Winnipeg, MB, Canada. Reference powdered milk, human milk (HM), and formula samples were weighed and acid-digested prior to analysis by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy. Mo content in all formulas ranged from 15.4 to 80.3 μg/L (mean ± SE, 37.7 ± 1.7 μg/L). HM Mo concentration ranged from 1.5 to 9.5 μg/L (5.09 ± 0.81 μg/L). Formulas intended for full-term or for premature infants feeding contained, on average, more Mo than HM. Formulas intended for infants with special needs contained similar mean Mo levels to HM. No significant differences were detected between mean Mo values of formulas of a same type purchased from different brands and/or at different locations. High Mo intake may pose health risks, despite lower bioavailability of Mo from formula compared with HM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioavailability 3abreast milk 3adiet 3adried milk 3ahumans 3ainfant formulas 3ainfants 3amolybdenum 3arisk 3asupermarkets 2aHumans 2aInfant Formulaxchemistry 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMolybdenumxanalysis 3aCanada 3aDistrict of Columbia 0aCanada 0aUnited States1 aMiller, Angela1 aYang, Haifeng1 aFriel, James K.0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 Nov., v. 143, no. 2 p.844-853dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-010-8950-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245011100165300002000276520141000296592002801706650001501734650001301749650001301762650001201775650001401787650001901801650001001820650001401830650001201844650001001856650001701866650001101883650001801894650004301912650000901955650001701964700002001981700002302001700002502024773012802049856007502177852000902252655001202261IND60534926720221120094235.0160803e20140902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053492672DNAL7 a10.1021/es502652n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Jacqueline M.10aYour Garden Hose: A Potential Health Risk Due to Legionella spp. Growth Facilitated by Free-Living Amoebae  ap. 10456-10464.  aCommon garden hoses may generate aerosols of inhalable size (≤10 μm) during use. If humans inhale aerosols containing Legionella bacteria, Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever may result. Clinical cases of these illnesses have been linked to garden hose use. The hose environment is ideal for the growth and interaction of Legionella and free-living amoebae (FLA) due to biofilm formation, elevated temperatures, and stagnation of water. However, the microbial densities and hose conditions necessary to quantify the human health risks have not been reported. Here we present data on FLA and Legionella spp. detected in water and biofilm from two types of garden hoses over 18 months. By culturing and qPCR, two genera of FLA were introduced via the drinking water supply and reached mean densities of 2.5 log₁₀ amoebae·mL–¹ in garden hose water. Legionella spp. densities (likely including pathogenic L. pneumophila) were significantly higher in one type of hose (3.8 log₁₀ cells·mL–¹, p < 0.0001). A positive correlation existed between Vermamoebae vermiformis densities and Legionella spp. densities (r = 0.83, p < 0.028). The densities of Legionella spp. identified in the hoses were similar to those reported during legionellosis outbreaks in other situations. Therefore, we conclude that there is a health risk to susceptible users from the inhalation of garden hose aerosols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella 3aaerosols 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abreathing 3adrinking water 3afever 3agardening 3agardens 3ahoses 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alegionellosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3awater supply1 aThomas, Torsten1 aStuetz, Richard

During PEDV infection, the spike protein (S) is a major virion structural protein interacting with receptors and inducing neutralizing antibodies. However, the neutralizing B-cell epitopes within PEDV S protein have not been well studied. METHODS: To accurately identify the important immunodominant region of S1, the purified truncated S1 proteins (SA, SB, SC, SD and SE) were used to immunize BALB/c mice to prepare polyclonal antibodies. The antisera titers were determined by indirect ELISA, western blot and IFA after four immunizations to find the important immunodominant region of S1, and then purified the immunodominant region of S1 protein and immunized mice to generate the special antibodies, and then used recombinant peptides to determine the B-cell epitopes of monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Five antisera of recombinant proteins of the spike protein region of PEDV were generated and we found that only the polyclonal antibody against part of the S1 region (signed as SE protein, residues 666–789) could recognize the native PEDV. Purified SE protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice and generate mAb 2E10. Pepscan of the SE protein demonstrated that SE16 (⁷²²SSTFNSTREL⁷³¹) is the minimal linear epitope required for reactivity with the mAb 2E10. Further investigation indicated that the epitope SE16 was localized on the surface of PEDV S protein in the 3D structure. CONCLUSIONS: A mAb 2E10 that is specifically bound to PEDV was generated and identified a specific linear B-cell epitope (SE16, ⁷²²SSTFNSTREL⁷³¹) of the mAb. The epitope region of PEDV S1 localized in the different regions in comparison with the earlier identified epitopes. These findings enhance the understanding of the PEDV spike protein structure for vaccine design and provide a potential use for developing diagnostic methods to detect PEDV.  aPublisher supplied data  a31872478cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFD0500103cNational Key Research and Development Programs of China  a19ZR1469100cNatural Science Foundation of Shanghai  a2017M611074cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3aWestern blotting 3aanorexia 3aantiserum 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3ainfectious diseases 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amortality 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apiglets 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aprotein structure 3areceptors 3arecombinant peptides 3arecombinant proteins 3astructural proteins 3avaccine development 3avirion 3avomiting 3aweight loss1 aMeng, Qiong1 aJiao, Yajuan1 aWu, Yongguang1 aZuo, Yewen1 aWang, Hua1 aSun, Dage1 aDong, Sujie1 aZhai, Huanjie1 aTong, Wu1 aZheng, Hao1 aYu, Hai1 aTong, Guangzhi1 aXu, Yongjie1 aShan, Tongling0 tVirology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.46-46dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01305-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245017500165300001400340520113900354592002801493650001501521650001501536650001301551650002101564650001201585650002001597650002101617650002201638650001301660650001801673650001801691650001901709650001401728650001701742650002101759653003301780653003201813653001701845653001301862653003101875700001301906700001201919700001501931700001101946773009501957856008202052852000902134655001202143IND60553377420221120055100.0161021e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055337742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lifang10aIonic liquid functionalized graphene based immunosensor for sensitive detection of carbohydrate antigen 15-3 integrated with Cd2+-functionalized nanoporous TiO2 as labels  ap. 75-80.  aA novel electrochemical immunosensor for sensitive detection of carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) based on dual signal amplification strategy of ionic liquid functionalized graphene and Cd2+-functionalized nanoporous TiO2 (f-TiO2–Cd2+) has been developed. Ionic liquid functionalized graphene was used to anchor primary CA15-3 antibody (Ab1). f-TiO2–Cd2+ was employed to immobilize secondary cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) antibody (Ab2) and the resulting nanocomposite (Ab2–f-TiO2–Cd2+) was used as trace tag for signal amplification. The fabricated immumosensor displayed a wide range of linear response (0.02–60U/mL), ultra-low detection limit (0.008U/mL), good reproducibility, selectivity and stability towards CA15-3. The good performance of the immunosensor can be attributed to (1) high surface-to-volume ratio of graphene which allows high-level immobilization of Ab1, (2) excellent biocompatibility and electron transfer rate originating from ionic liquid functionalized graphene, (3) a highly specific surface area of nanoporous TiO2 that facilitates the adsorption of high amount of Cd2+ for signal amplification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiocompatibility 3acadmium 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3aimmunosensors 3aionic liquids 3ananocomposites 3aneoplasms 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide 0aElectrochemical immunosensor 0aNanoporous titanium dioxide 0aIonic liquid 0aGraphene 0aCarbohydrate antigen 15-3.1 aWei, Qin1 aWu, Hua1 aDou, Jinke1 aLi, He0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 59 p.75-80dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008900172300001600261520122700277592002801504650001501532650003001547650002501577650001101602650001601613650001601629650002501645650001201670650002301682650002001705650002101725650001301746650001701759650001601776650000701792650001301799650002701812650002501839650001501864653002701879653002301906653002001929653001801949653001701967700003001984700002202014700002302036773010402059856005102163852000902214655001202223IND50076503520221119174116.0140410e20130703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007650352DNAL7 a10.1080/87559129.2013.7900462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlashi, Adeola M.10aTechnological and Bioactive Functionalities of Canola Meal Proteins and Hydrolysates  ap. 231-260.  aCanola meal proteins have been credited with some technological food functional abilities, including foaming, water absorption, solubility, gelling, emulsifying, and foaming properties, despite the presence of other nonprotein moieties in the preparations studied to date. Unfortunately, these proteins have found limited practical use in food processing, presumably due to their poor solubility in aqueous systems at neutral pH. Consequently, canola meal proteins are undervalued as food ingredients. There is, however, high potential to improve the value of canola meal proteins via modification, especially by enzymatic hydrolysis to improve their solubility, and, hence, many of these functional properties. Enzymatic hydrolysis can also be employed to generate nutritionally functional hydrolysates and bioactive peptides. The most studied bioactive properties of canola protein hydrolysates was found to be the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and antioxidant activities, whereas others such as the antimicrobial and anticancer properties have been less investigated. Therefore, this review looks into some of the studies carried out on canola proteins and gives an insight to the future research needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3acanola 3acanola meal 3aemulsifying 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afoaming 3afoaming properties 3afood processing 3afunctional foods 3agelation 3ahydrolysates 3aingredients 3apH 3apeptides 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aprotein hydrolysates 3asolubility 0aAntioxidant properties 0aBioactive peptides 0aCanola proteins 0aFunctionality 0aHydrolysates1 aBlanchard, Christopher L.1 aMailer, Rodney J.1 aAgboola, Samson O.0 tFood reviews international.g2013 July 3, v. 29, no. 3 p.231-260dTaylor & Francisx1525-61037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/87559129.2013.790046  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245011500130300001400245500012800259500001500387520136200402592002801764650001401792650001801806650001201824650001701836650000901853650001101862650001901873650001301892650001601905650001501921650001501936653002201951700001701973773010701990852000902097939003302106946001302139655001202152991568410170742620221119190803.0181002e198701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870418392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDAO, T.

We measured the kinetics of adsorption and degradation of C-aniline, C-benzoic acid, C-phenol, and C-diuron in the solution phase at 3 and 22°C. In the initial stages of reactions, the adsorption of all four chemicals was instantaneous at both temperatures under accelerated soil and solution mixing. A steady state was observed after the onset of equilibrium for the adsorption reaction for all compounds within 10 to 30 min. Its length varied according to the expected order of susceptibility to microbial degradation, i.e., diuron > aniline > phenol ≥ benzoate. It was apparent that the steady-state period without or in combination with low temperature could be advantageously used to obtain adsorption measurements in microbially active systems. Minimal interference from solute transformations in the solution phase would be expected from soil micro-organisms. A mechanistic sorption-catalyzed degradation model was evaluated to uncouple mathematically these processes. The model described satisfactorily the disappearance of labile chemicals in soil suspensions. Numerical analysis allowed the concurrent determination of adsorption, desorption, and biodegradation rate coefficients.  aPublisher supplied data 3asolutions 3abenzoic acids 3aphenols 3asoil biology 3asoil 3adiuron 3abiodegradation 3akinetics 3atemperature 3adesorption 3aadsorption 0aorganic compounds1 aLavy, T.

Different from nanocellulose, the combination of nanochitin with synthetic polymers to obtain nanocomposite hydrogels has not been extensively and systematically studied. Herein, a physically and chemically dual crosslinked nanocomposite hydrogel was successfully synthesized, where chitin nanowhiskers (ChNWs) and Zn²⁺ were incorporated within polyacrylamide (PAAm) matrix. Nanochitin/metal ion dual reinforcement imparts increased elasticity, enhanced mechanical properties, and improved recovery performance to PAAm network. The PAAm/ChNWs/Zn²⁺ hydrogel could be stretched to over 13 times its original length with tensile strength of 321.9 ± 8.2 kPa, and restore its original shape rapidly even when compressed at a strain of 95% with a corresponding compressive strength of 6.95 ± 0.20 MPa. The multiple crosslinks and interactions among ChNWs, Zn²⁺ and synthetic polymeric network were investigated. Moreover, the hydrogel was applied in drug release and soft bioelectronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3achitin 3acompression strength 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3ahydrogels 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3apolyacrylamide 3atensile strength 3azinc 0aChitin nanowhiskers 0aMetal coordination 0aNanocomposite hydrogels 0aPolyacrylamide 0aReversible interactions1 aGao, Huichang1 aLi, Miaosi1 aChen, Guangxue1 aGuan, Liyun1 aHe, Minghui1 aTian, Junfei1 aCao, Rong0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 May 15, v. 236 p.116061-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1160613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245008300171300001400254520078200268592002801050650001501078650001201093650002001105650001201125650001901137653002001156653001801176653002701194700001201221700001101233773011701244856008001361852000901441655001201450IND60616760020221121005927.0181020e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061676002DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175080904972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Winnie Wing-man,10a3-D Surface Reconstruction and Evaluation of Wrinkled Fabrics by Stereo Vision  ap. 36-46.  aThis paper presents a stereo vision system for reconstructing the three-dimensional (3-D) surface of a wrinkled fabric and for detecting and characterizing wrinkles to evaluate the severity of wrinkling. The system captures a pair of images through two 10.2-megapixel digital cameras, performs subpixel stereo matching based on correlation gradients, and yields a depth resolution under 0.1 mm. The matching algorithm is realized in a regularization framework and implemented by the finite-element method, in which the disparity map is parameterized by dense bicubic B-splines. The outputs of the system include a wrinkle map that depicts the locations of the ridges of individual wrinkles and quantitative data on wrinkle density, amplitude, and sharpness for a tested sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acameras 3acomputer vision 3afabrics 3atextile fibers 0afabric wrinkles 0astereo vision 0a3-D wrinkle evaluation1 aYao, M.1 aXu, B.0 tTextile research journal.g2009 Jan., v. 79, no. 1 p.36-46dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175080904973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245010900171520198800280592002802268650001202296650001602308650002102324650001502345650002802360650001502388650001702403650002402420650002802444650002102472650001402493650002102507650001602528653001302544653001202557653001502569653000802584653001302592700001702605700002402622700001202646700001502658700001902673700001602692700001302708700001402721700001702735700001602752700005102768773009202819856009002911852000903001655001203010IND60778710520221120172331.0220628e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077871052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1351562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Kaihong10aInteraction of fluoride exposure and CREB1 gene polymorphisms on thyroid function in school-age children  aTo evaluate the effects of CREB1 gene polymorphisms and long-term exposure to fluoride on thyroid function of children. A total of 424 children (including 226 boys and 198 girls) aged 7–12 years old were enrolled in Kaifeng, China by cross-sectional study in 2017. The concentrations of urinary fluoride (UF) and creatinine (UCr) were measured using fluoride ion-selective electrode assay and creatinine assay kit (picric acid method), respectively. The concentration of UCr-adjusted UF (CUF) was calculated. Children were divided into high fluoride exposure group (HFG, CUF >1.41 mg/L) and low fluoride exposure group (LFG, CUF ≤1.41 mg/L) according to the median concentration of CUF (1.41 mg/L). The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total triiodothyronine (TT3) and total thyronine (TT4) levels were detected by the radiation immunoassay. The B-mode ultrasound was performed to test the thyroid volume (Tvol). Genotyping of CREB1 gene was conducted by a custom-by-design 48-plex SNPscan™ Kit. Associations between CUF concentration, CREB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and thyroid function were assessed by multiple linear regression models. Negative and positive associations between serum TT4 level (β = −0.721, 95%CI: −1.209, −0.234) and Tvol (β = 0.031, 95%CI: 0.011, 0.050) and CUF concentration were observed respectively. Children carrying CREB1 rs11904814 TG and rs2254137 AC genotypes had lower TT3 levels (P < 0.05). Children in HFG carrying rs11904814 TT, rs2253206 GG genotypes and rs6740584 C allele easily manifested lower serum TT4 levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, interactions between excessive fluoride exposure and CREB1 SNPs on Tvol were observed, and the interaction among different loci of CREB1 gene could modify serum TT3 level (P < 0.05, respectively). Fluoride could alter children's serum TT4 levels and Tvol. Interactions between fluoride exposure and CREB1 polymorphisms may modify thyroid volume of children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3ablood serum 3achronic exposure 3acreatinine 3across-sectional studies 3agenotyping 3aimmunoassays 3aregression analysis 3aspecific ion electrodes 3athyroid function 3athyronine 3atriiodothyronine 3aultrasonics 0aFluoride 0aThyroid 0aCREB1 gene 0aSNP 0aChildren1 aFeng, Zichen1 aAfrim, Francis Kojo1 aMa, Jun1 aYang, Shuo1 aZhang, Xuanyin1 aNiu, Zeyuan1 aAn, Ning1 aDu, Yuhui1 aYu, Fangfang1 aZhou, Guoyu1 aBa, Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9659-79930 tChemosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 303 p.135156-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1351563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010600158300001800264520195800282592002802240650001502268650002802283650002102311650001702332650001702349650002302366650001502389650002102404650000902425653002602434653001402460653002002474653002302494653002702517653002802544653003902572700001902611700002202630700002502652700002302677773012702700856007302827852000902900655001202909IND60527452720170818000000.0160715e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052745272DNAL7 a10.1021/am401201q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHart, Aaron
S.10aPorphyrin-Sensitized Solar Cells: Effect of Carboxyl Anchor Group Orientation on the Cell Performance  ap. 5314-5323.  aThe effect of the orientation of the porphyrin sensitizer onto the TiO₂ surface on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is reported. Free-base and zinc porphyrins bearing a carboxyl anchoring group at the para, meta, or ortho positions of one of the meso-phenyl rings were synthesized for application in Grätzel-type photoelectrochemical cells. The remainder of the meso-phenyl rings was substituted with alkyl chains of different length to visualize any aggregation effects. Absorption and fluorescence studies were performed to characterize and observe spectral coverage of the thirteen newly synthesized porphyrin derivatives. Photoelectrochemical studies were performed after immobilization of porphyrins onto nanocrystalline TiO₂ and compared with DSSC constructed using N719 dye as reference. The performance of DSSCs with the porphyrin anchoring at the para or meta position were found to greatly exceed those with the anchoring group in the ortho position. Additionally, cells constructed using zinc porphyrin derivatives outperformed the free-base porphyrin analogs. Better dye regeneration efficiency for the zinc porphyrin derivatives compared to their free-base porphyrin analogs, and for the meta and para derivatives over the ortho derivatives was evaluated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy studies were performed to probe the kinetics of charge injection and charge recombination with respect to the orientation of porphyrin macrocycle on TiO₂ surface. The ortho porphyrin derivative with an almost flat orientation to the TiO₂ surface revealed fast charge recombination and suggested occurrence of through-space charge transfer. The overall structure-performance trends observed for the present porphyrin DSSCs have been rationalized based on spectral, electrochemical, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and transient spectroscopy results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorescence 3ananocrystals 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aporphyrins 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc 0aphotoelectrochemistry 0aporphyrin 0adye orientation 0aorganic solar cell 0aimpedance spectroscopy 0alight energy conversion 0afemtosecond transient spectroscopy1 aKC, Chandra B.1 aGobeze, Habtom B.1 aSequeira, Lindsey R.1 aD’Souza, Francis0 tACS applied materials .g2013 June 12, v. 5, no. 11 p.5314-5323dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am401201q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245012000211300001600331506007600347520177300423592002802196506003702224650002002261650001302281650002302294650001702317650001802334650002002352650002102372650002602393650001702419650001702436650001102453650001102464650001102475650004402486650001802530650002202548650002002570650001702590650001802607700002602625700002202651700002202673700002002695700002402715700002502739700001702764700001902781773012102800856008102921852000903002655001203011IND60537257220221207115810.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053725722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-016-0784-y2doi7 aPMC55908192pmcid7 a273505502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhedr, Amgad I.

The aim of this study is to quantify the difference in hepatic lipid content with metabolic changes during the progression of steatosis by using localized MRS sequence with T2 relaxation time determination. Fatty liver disease was induced in C57BL/6N mice through a high-fat diet (HFD) of pellets containing 60% fat, 20% protein, and 20% carbohydrates. We used stimulated echo acquisition mode (repetition time: 3500 ms; mixing time: 10 ms; echo time: 20 ms) sequence. Using enhanced and mono exponential curve-fitting methods, the lipid relaxation time in mice was estimated at a fixed repetition time of 5000 ms and echo time ranging from 20 to 70 ms. The calculated lipid contents with incorrect and correct relaxation times were as follows: total saturated fatty acid (4.00 ± 2.90 vs 6.74 ± 2.25, p < 0.05 at week 0; 15.23 ± 9.94 vs 25.53 ± 10.49, p < 0.05 at week 4); total unsaturated fatty acid (0.40 ± 0.49 vs 0.56 ± 0.47, p < 0.05 at week 4; 0.33 ± 0.26 vs 0.60 ± 0.21, p < 0.01 at week 7); total unsaturated bond (0.48 ± 0.52 vs 1.05 ± 0.58, p < 0.05 at week 10). Furthermore, we determined that the correct relaxation times of triglycerides between 0 and 10 weeks were significantly altered in the resonances (∼2.03 ppm: 31.07 ± 1.00 vs 27.62 ± 1.20, p < 0.01; ∼2.25 ppm: 29.10 ± 1.52 vs 26.39 ± 1.08, p < 0.05; ∼2.78 ppm: 37.67 ± 2.92 vs 29.37 ± 2.64, p < 0.001). The work presented focused on the significance of the J-coupling effect. The selection of an appropriate relaxation time considering the J-coupling effect provides an effective method for quantifying lipid contents and characterizing hepatic steatosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid value 3acarbohydrate content 3acarbohydrates 3afatty acids 3afatty liver 3ahigh fat diet 3alipid content 3amice 3amixing 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apellets 3aprotein content 3atriacylglycerols 0aNAFLD 0aMRS 0aSNR 0aSTEAM 0aHFD 0aMRI 0aTR 0aTE 0aFSE 0aTM 0aOVS 0aVOI 0aVAPOR 0aTL 0aTSFA 0aTUFA 0aTUSB 0aPUSB 0aLCModel 0aCRLB 0aALB 0aGLU 0aTBIL 0aAST 0aALT 0aALP 0aH&E 0aNCD 0aPCA 0aPC 0aHR-MAS 0aMagnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aStimulated echo acquisition mode 0aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease 0aRelaxation time 0aHigh-fat diet1 aLee, Min Young,1 aYoo, Chi-Hyeon1 aLim, Song-I1 aChoe, Bo-Young0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2018 May, v. 212 p.35-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2018.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245013600181300001600317520163200333592002801965650002401993650002002017650001702037650002302054650001302077650001302090650001802103650001102121650002102132650003602153650001702189650002202206650001802228650001002246650003602256650002102292700001602313700001802329700001702347700001602364700001502380700001502395700001602410700001302426700001502439700001802454700001502472700001202487700001602499700001502515700001602530773009702546856008102643852000902724655001202733IND60120147220221122233814.0150131e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012014722DNAL7 a254136292pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-014-4230-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Qiang10aClonorchis sinensis ferritin heavy chain triggers free radicals and mediates inflammation signaling in human hepatic stellate cells  ap. 659-670.  aClonorchiasis, caused by direct and continuous contact with Clonorchis sinensis, is associated with hepatobiliary damage, inflammation, periductal fibrosis, and the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Hepatic stellate cells respond to liver injury through production of proinflammatory mediators which drive fibrogenesis; however, their endogenous sources and pathophysiological roles in host cells were not determined. C. sinensis ferritin heavy chain (CsFHC) was previously confirmed as a component of excretory/secretory products and exhibited a number of extrahepatic immunomodulatory properties in various diseases. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and biological role of CsFHC in C. sinensis. CsFHC was expressed throughout life stages of C. sinensis. More importantly, we found that treatment of human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 with CsFHC triggered the production of free radicals via time-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. The increase in free radicals substantially promoted the degradation of cytosolic IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits (p65 and p50). CsFHC-induced NF-κB activation was markedly attenuated by preincubation with specific inhibitors of corresponding free radical-producing enzyme or the antioxidant. In addition, CsFHC induced an increased expression level of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6, in NF-κB-dependent manner. Our results indicate that CsFHC-triggered free radical-mediated NF-κB signaling is an important factor in the chronic inflammation caused by C. sinensis infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClonorchis sinensis 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aantioxidants 3aendogenous sources 3aferritin 3afibrosis 3afree radicals 3ahumans 3aimmunomodulators 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3axanthine oxidase1 aXie, Zhizhi1 aWang, Xiaoyun1 aChen, Wenjun1 aRen, Mengyu1 aShang, Mei1 aLei, Huali1 aTian, Yanli1 aLi, Shan1 aLiang, Pei1 aChen, Tingjin1 aLiang, Chi1 aXu, Jin1 aLi, Xuerong1 aHuang, Yan1 aYu, Xinbing0 tParasitology research.g2015 Feb., v. 114, no. 2 p.659-670dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-4230-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245012000202300001600322500001900338520185400357592002802211650001602239650001602255650001402271650001402285650001502299650001802314650001902332650001702351650001602368650002802384650001302412700005702425773013602482856008302618852000902701655001202710IND60682490020221121175847.0200404e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068249002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-019-03490-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRu, Sushan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2299-570X10aPredicted genetic gains from introgressing chromosome segments from exotic germplasm into an elite soybean cultivar  ap. 605-614.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKEY MESSAGE: To improve an elite soybean line, introgress longer chromosome segments instead of QTL alleles from exotic germplasm. Broadening the diversity of cultivated soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] through introgression of exotic germplasm has been difficult. Our objectives were to (1) determine if introgressing specific chromosome segments (instead of quantitative trait locus alleles) from exotic soybean germplasm has potential for improving an elite cultivar, and (2) identify strategies to introgress and pyramid exotic chromosome segments into an elite cultivar. We estimated genomewide marker effects for yield and other traits in seven crosses between the elite line IA3023 and seven soybean plant introductions (PIs). We then predicted genetic gains from having ≤ 2 targeted recombinations per linkage group. When introgression was modeled for yield while controlling maturity in the seven PI × IA3023 populations, the predicted yield was 8–25% over the yield of IA3023. Correlated changes in maturity, seed traits, lodging, and plant height were generally small but were in the favorable direction. In contrast, selecting the best recombinant inbred (without targeted recombination) in each of the PI × IA3023 populations led to negative or minimal yield gains over IA3023. In one PI × IA3023 population, introgressing and pyramiding only two linkage groups from recombinant inbreds into IA3023 was predicted to achieve an 8% yield gain over IA3023 without sacrificing the performance for other traits. The probability of inheriting intact chromosomes was high enough to allow introgression and pyramiding of chromosome segments in 5–6 generations. Overall, our study suggested that introgressing specific chromosome segments is an effective way to introduce exotic soybean germplasm into an elite cultivar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3agermplasm 3ainbreeding 3aintrogression 3alinkage groups 3aplant height 3aprobability 3aquantitative trait loci 3asoybeans1 aBernardo, Rex1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3323-46900 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 Feb., v. 133, no. 2 p.605-614dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-019-03490-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245011700167300001800284520048100302592002800783650001300811650001400824650001400838650001300852650001400865650002400879700001800903700002200921700001600943700001900959773013500978856007401113852000901187655001201196IND60659959020221120185355.0190823e20130917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065995902DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc45175e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚarmā, Kamalanayana,10aSingle source precursor routes for synthesis of PdTe nanorods and particles: solvent dependent control of shapes  ap. 9344-9346.  aThe PdTe NPs (hexagonal) and nanorods (first example) have been synthesized for the first time from single source precursors (SSPs), [Pd(L1)Cl₂] (1) and [Pd(L2)Cl]BF₄ (2) [L1, 4-bromo-1-[2-(4-methoxyphenyltellanyl)ethyl]-1H-pyrazole; L2, bis-[2-(4-bromopyrazol-1-yl)ethyl]telluride], by their thermolysis in an OA–ODE mixture (1 : 1) and TOP respectively.

Time series analysis using the 1960–2017 annual period has been adapted with this respect. Results confirm the long-term impacts of tourism and services trade sectors on real income growth in Turkey. Tourism and trade (both services and manufacturing) exert positively significant effects on the long-term performance of macroeconomic activity as measured by gross domestic product. Oil prices negatively impact on real income growth of Turkey. It is also found that oil prices negatively moderate the effects of foreign trade, services trade, and tourism on real income growth in Turkey. This finding reveals that significant effects of foreign trade, services trade, and tourism on real income are negatively influenced from oil price changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3agross domestic product 3aincome 3ainternational trade 3amacroeconomics 3amanufacturing 3aoils 3aprices 3atime series analysis 3atourism 3aTurkey (country)1 aKatircioglu, Setareh1 aAltun, Ozlem0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Dec., v. 25, no. 35 p.35266-35275dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3448-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245017500169300001800344520154600362592002801908650001501936650002301951650002401974650001201998650001102010650001602021650003102037650001502068650000902083650001602092650001302108650000702121650003502128650001302163650001502176700002002191700002202211773014602233856008102379852000902460655001202469IND60572344420221118021736.0170717e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057234442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-8493-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakayanagi, Akari10aRemoval of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) from wastewaters by zero-valent iron (ZVI): predominant removal mechanism for effective SDBS removal  ap. 8087-8097.  aMechanisms for removal of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) in wastewaters by zero-valent iron (ZVI) were systematically examined. The contributions of four removal mechanisms, i.e., reductive degradation, oxidative degradation, adsorption, and precipitation, changed significantly with solution pH were quantified and the effective removal of SDBS by ZVI was found to be attributed to the adsorption capability of iron oxides/hydroxides on ZVI surface at nearly neutral pH instead of the degradation at acidic condition. The fastest SDBS removal rate and the maximum TOC (total organic carbon) removal efficiency were obtained at pH 6.0. The maximum TOC removal at pH 6.0 was 77.8%, and the contributions of degradation, precipitation, and adsorption to TOC removal were 4.6, 14.9, and 58.3%, respectively. At pH 3.0, which is an optimal pH for oxidative degradation by the Fenton reaction, the TOC removal was only 9.8% and the contributions of degradation, precipitation, and adsorption to TOC removal were 2.3, 4.6, and 2.9%, respectively. The electrostatic attraction between dodecyl benzene sulfate anion and the iron oxide/hydroxide layer controlled the TOC removal of SDBS. The kinetic model based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood/Eley-Rideal approach could successfully describe the experimental results for SDBS removal by ZVI with the averaged correlation coefficient of 0.994. ZVI was found to be an efficient material toward the removal of anionic surfactant at nearly neutral pH under the oxic condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaerobic conditions 3aanionic surfactants 3abenzene 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydroxides 3airon 3airon oxides 3akinetics 3apH 3asodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate 3asulfates 3awastewater1 aKobayashi, Maki1 aKawase, Yoshinori0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Mar., v. 24, no. 9 p.8087-8097dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8493-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245016700165300001800332520200000350592002802350650001402378650002602392650001402418650001002432650001902442650000902461650001802470650001402488650001202502650001802514650001402532650001402546650002102560650002902581651001402610653001402624653001302638653002402651653002302675653001302698653001002711653002802721700002002749700002002769700002102789700001902810700001702829773012702846856007802973852000903051655001203060IND60477899020221122131115.0160106e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047789902DNAL7 a10.2983/035.034.03312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aA, J. Antonio Baez10aReproductive Investment in a Phyletic Giant, the Caribbean King Crab Damithrax spinosissimus: Exploring Egg Production Costs in Large Brooding Marine Inertebrates  ap. 1049-1056.  aThe Caribbean king crab Damithrax spinosissimus, a phyletie giant and the largest crab in the western Atlantic, was used to explore the costs of brooding, in terms of reproductive investment, in marine invertebrates. Given (i) the theoretical allometry between gamete production and brooding surfaces and (ii) increased physiological costs with increased brood mass, it was expected that larger broods from larger crabs should suffer higher mortality and brood loss than smaller broods from smaller crabs. It was also expected that smaller females should allocate disproportionably more resources to egg production than larger females. In D. spinosissimus, fecundity in females carrying early and late embryos varied, respectively, between 5.170 and 26.024 eggs/crab (mean ± SD = 16.569 ± 4.899) and between 1.966 and 26.906 eggs/crab (15.147 ± 7.003). In disagreement with expectation, females did not experience brood loss during embryo development. Egg mortality in females carrying early and late eggs varied, respectively, between 0% and 69% (4.71 ± 15.37) and between 2% and 100% (27.17 ± 33.99). Also in disagreement with expectations, egg mortality did not increase disproportionably with parental female body size. Reproductive output varied between 10.45% and 43.79% (34.02% ± 7.4) of crab body dry weight. Finally, in agreement with expectations, the slope (b = 0.54 ± 0.17) of the line describing the relationship between brood and parental female dry weight was significantly less than unity. Overall, most of the results disagree with the notion that the allometry of gamete production and increased physiological costs with increased brood size explain the association between brooding and small body size in marine invertebrates. Comparative studies on the reproductive investment of brooding species pertaining to monophyletic clades with extensive disparity in body size are warranted to further our understanding about the evolution of brooding in marine invertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abody size 3acrabs 3aegg production 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3afecundity 3afemales 3agametogenesis 3amonophyly 3amortality 3aproduction costs 3areproductive performance 3aCaribbean 0afecundity 0aegg size 0areproductive output 0aallometry. scaling 0abrooding 0acosts 0aDamithrax spinosissimus1 aSimpson, Lunden1 aAmbrosio, L.

Recognition of rice seedling rows is a challenging research problem for mechanized rice weeding. This paper proposed a novel and fast rice seedling row recognition method based on row vector grid classification. This method builds an end-to-end CNN model composed of seedling feature extraction and row vector grid classification, which converts seedling row recognition into a grid classification problem based on row vectors using global feature. Our method can significantly reduce the computational cost through the selection based on row vectors, and can reach a running speed close to 170 fps at an image resolution of 800*288; the loss function of the proposed CNN model is modeled based on the two prior constraints including the continuity between the row vectors of the seedling row and the shape of the seedling row. The proposed method for recognizing rice seedling rows was tested on a test set composed of normal conditions, duckweed, weeds, and vibration blur scenes. The test results showed that the proposed CNN model reached an F1 score of 89.22% and a running speed of 170 fps with an image resolution of 800*288.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraceae 3aagriculture 3aelectronics 3amechanization 3amodels 3arice 3aseedlings 3avibration 0aRecognition of rice seedling rows 0aCNN model 0aRow vector 0aGrid classification1 aZhang, Wenyi1 aWang, Xingsong1 aYu, Shanshan0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 Nov., v. 190 p.106454-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1064543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009300166300001800259520099400277592002801271650001901299650002001318650002201338650002201360650002501382650001501407773014601422856008101568852000901649655001201658IND60572344520221117224033.0170717e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057234452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6247-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajcen, Špela10aEvidence based policy making in the European Union: the role of the scientific community  ap. 7869-7871.  aIn the times when the acquis of the European Union (EU) has developed so far as to reach a high level of technical complexity, in particular in certain policy fields such as environmental legislation, it is important to look at what kind of information and data policy decisions are based on. This position paper looks at the extent to which evidence-based decision-making process is being considered in the EU institutions when it comes to adopting legislation in the field of environment at the EU level. The paper calls for closer collaboration between scientists and decision-makers in view of ensuring that correct data is understood and taken into consideration when drafting, amending, negotiating and adopting new legal texts at all levels of the EU decision-making process. It concludes that better awareness of the need for such collaboration among the decision-makers as well as the scientific community would benefit the process and quality of the final outcomes (legislation).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3adecision making 3aenvironmental law 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3ascientists0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Mar., v. 24, no. 9 p.7869-7871dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6247-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245013000182520099500312592002801307653001901335653001401354653002301368653002601391653001901417653002501436700005901461700006101520700005701581773011101638856008701749852000901836655001201845IND60679976920221119054301.0200106e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067997692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma Khanal, Bal Kumari10aSimulated oral processing, in vitro digestibility and sensory perception of low fat Cheddar cheese containing sodium alginate  aInvestigation on the effect of fat and fat replacer sodium alginate (alginate) on low fat Cheddar cheese was conducted by systematic studies in three cheese types, namely control full fat cheese (CFFC ~ 32% fat), control low fat cheese (CLF C ~ 5% fat) and low-fat cheese with alginate (LFCA ~ 3% fat). Lubrication properties, coefficient of friction, in vitro digestibility, and textural sensory analysis were studied. Coefficient of friction (CoFₘᵢₙ) of CFFC and LFCA were not different (P > 0.05) from each other and were lower (P < 0.05) than CLFC. Rate of protein release and cheese matrix disintegration were directly influenced by cheese composition (moisture and fat content and presence of alginate) and textural properties of cheese. Hence, this study suggested that the presence of fat and sodium alginate in cheese exhibited more lubrication and enhanced digestion compared to CLFC, whereas sensory properties of all cheeses were similar to each other.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLow fat cheese 0aTribology 0aSensory evaluation 0aInvitro digestibility 0aDisintegration 0aFriction coefficient1 aBhandari, Bhesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8800-62951 aPrakash, Sangeeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1297-39481 aBansal, Nidhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2266-61240 tJournal of food engineering.g2020 Apr., v. 270 p.109749-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245010400178500002200282520157600304592002801880650001401908650001301922650001301935650001701948650001401965650001101979650001601990650001702006650002002023650001902043650002102062650001302083650001302096650001102109650001302120650001602133653002802149653001302177653001802190653003002208653003302238700001702271700001602288773011002304856008602414852000902500655001202509IND60573043520221119220439.0170720s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057304352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrujillo-Cayado, L.A.10aEffects of ethoxylated fatty acid alkanolamide concentration and processing on d-limonene emulsions  aPre-press version  aCurrently, researchers are engaged in exploring new ecological solvents and rational use of energy for different applications, due to the current trends in green chemistry. This is influencing the formulation of emulsions in different fields (cosmetics, pharmacy, medicine, food, agrochemistry). This paper is a contribution to the development of concentrated d-limonene-in-water emulsions. We report the effects of a) surfactant concentration, namely of an ethoxylated fatty acid alkanolamide, and b) the homogenization rate on the droplet size distribution and physical stability of 30wt% d-limonene emulsions prepared with a rotor-stator equipped with a toothed dispersing unit. In addition, the effect of pressure when using a Microfluidizer with a Y-type interaction chamber was also studied. The surface response methodology was used and the results obtained fitted a quadratic model. An increase in surfactant concentration (2–4) wt% and homogenization rate (2000–10,000rpm) shifted to smaller droplet sizes the droplet size distributions, resulting in lower mean droplet sizes. Multiple light scattering height scans demonstrated that the creaming rate was clearly influenced by surfactant concentration and homogenization rate. The best physical stability was achieved avoiding depletion flocculation at 3.20wt% surfactant and 10,000rpm. Mean diameters decreased with the homogenization pressure of the Microfluidizer, but only the emulsion prepared using a rather high pressure, 25,000 psi, exhibited lower mean diameter than the corresponding pre-emulsion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acosmetics 3acreaming 3adiameter 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3aflocculation 3agreen chemistry 3ahomogenization 3alight scattering 3alimonene 3amedicine 3amodels 3asolvents 3asurfactants 0aEco-friendly surfactant 0aEmulsion 0aGreen solvent 0aMultiple light scattering 0aResponse surface methodology1 aAlfaro, M.C.1 aMuñoz, J.,0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015400166520124900320592002801569650003101597650001601628650002501644650001601669650001301685650001301698650001201711653002101723653001901744653002201763653002001785653002301805700001301828700002001841700001501861700002001876700002001896700001301916773012501929856008502054852000902139655001202148IND60752239420221116193148.0220110e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075223942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1064582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Jiahao10aRecovering tractor stability from an intensive rollover with a momentum flywheel and active steering: System formulation and scale-model verification  aAs a representative type of off-road vehicle, agricultural wheeled tractors are driven under varied and complicated road conditions such as plowed and hilly fields. Active control is the essential technique to solve tractor rollover accidents which have been identified as the most fatal incident along with agricultural mechanization. The aim of this study is to provide active correction of tractor attitude in emergency cases by combing a single-axis momentum flywheel system and active steering system. In this study, the time-varying structural nonlinear vehicle dynamic system and its subsystems are formulated during transitions among tractor states under road stimulation. By exploring the phased mutation mechanism of tractor stability, the corresponding stability criteria are proposed. The coordinated tractor safety control strategy was verified using parametric studies in a simulation and scale-model experiments. The results indicated the effective and robust control of tractor safety regarding the independent and integrated active control systems. The proposed approach is expected to provide a theoretical basis and technical support for advanced driver assistance systems applied to future intelligent agricultural vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural mechanization 3aagriculture 3aall-terrain vehicles 3aelectronics 3amomentum 3amutation 3aplowing 0aTractor rollover 0aActive control 0aMomentum flywheel 0aActive steering 0aModel verification1 aWu, Anbo1 aSong, Zhansheng1 aHe, Zhizhu1 aSuh, Chiider S.1 aZhu, Zhongxiang1 aLi, Zhen0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 Nov., v. 190 p.106458-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1064583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001700167245025700184300001600441520140400457592002801861650002001889650001701909650001201926650002101938650001101959650001201970650001001982650000901992650002502001650001302026650001202039650004102051650005702092650005602149650002402205650001102229650000902240650000902249650006202258650003002320650004902350650001602399651003402415651002702449700001902476700002302495700002202518700002202540773010202562856008402664852000902748655001202757IND4458397320221119184416.0141111e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445839732DNAL7 a212697752pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.12.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSak, Bohumil14aThe first report on natural Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon spp. infections in wild East-European House Mice (Mus musculus musculus) and West-European House Mice (M. m. domesticus) in a hybrid zone across the Czech Republic–Germany border  ap. 246-250.  aTo determine the occurrence of potentially human pathogenic microsporidia (Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon spp.) in wild mice, we examined 289 East-European House Mice (Mus musculus musculus) and West-European House Mice (M. m. domesticus) trapped at 74 localities in an area across the Czech–German border. Microsporidia were detected at 33 localities, in 34% of M. m. musculus and 33% of M. m. domesticus examined specimens. Single-species infection was detected in 23 mice for E. hellem, 42 mice for E. cuniculi and 25 mice for E. bieneusi. No Encephalitozoon intestinalis positive animals were identified. Moreover, co-infections were detected in 6 animals; E. bieneusi co-existed with E. cuniculi or E. hellem in 3 mice. The natural infection of E. hellem has never been recorded in mice before. No differences were found by a statistical analysis of microsporidia occurrence between the House Mouse subspecies. Although the gender-dependent infestation of microsporidia was statistically supported in M. m. musculus, no significant differences were observed when the occurrence of microsporidia was estimated for all males and females irrespective of the House Mouse subspecies. The results of this report document the low host specificity of detected microsporidia species and imply the importance of synanthropic rodents as a potential source of human microsporidial infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEncephalitozoon 3aMus musculus 3afemales 3ahost specificity 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3amales 3amice 3astatistical analysis 3atrapping 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Protozoanxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEncephalitozoonxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEnterocytozoonxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMice 2aMicrosporidiosisxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRodent Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aSex Factors 0aCzech Republicxepidemiology. 0aGermanyxepidemiology.1 aKváč, Martin1 aKvětoňová, Dana1 aAlbrecht, Tomáš1 aPiálek, Jaroslav0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2011 June 10, v. 178, no. 3-4 p.246-250dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016500171300001600336520162700352592002801979650000802007650002802015650001102043650002802054650001402082650001802096650001502114650001602129650001602145653000802161653000702169653000702176653000802183653000702191653000902198653000702207653000802214653002702222653002102249653002502270653001802295653004002313700001902353700002002372700001902392700002302411773010702434856008702541852000902628655001202637IND60573043620221119220329.0180830e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057304362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhmura, Kyohei10aControlling the phase-separated morphology of a two-dimensional integrated layer of magnetic nanoparticles by surface modifications using immiscible amphiphiles  ap. 462-474.  aSurface modification with immiscible surfactants was utilized to induce phase separation at the nanometer scale in a two-dimensional particle layer of magnetic nanoparticles. Cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) particles (diameter=30nm) and magnetite (Fe3O4) particles (diameters=5 and 30nm) were typically subjected to surface modification with a hydrogenated and fluorinated long-chain carboxylic acid. A mixed monolayer of hydrogenated and fluorinated organo-magnetic nanoparticles was spread at the air/water interface. This system was used to assess the phase separation because the collapsed surface pressures of both components were individually observed in the isotherms that were measured by systematically changing the composition ratio. A nano-sized phase separation morphology was observed on the surface of the mixed single-particle layers by atomic force microscopy. A “sea-island” structure was observed in which the expanded phase formed by the fluorinated organo-magnetic nanoparticles surrounded the condensed nano-domains of the hydrogenated organo-magnetic nanoparticles. The separate (particulate) nano-phase morphology showed a temperature dependence, and in this case, the fluorinated “sea” phase transformed into a network morphology. The nano-domain of the hydrogenated organo-modified magnetic nanoparticles was a crystalline phase in which the modified chain was packed with two-dimensional hexagonal or orthorhombic systems. The nanophase separation on the surface of the magnetic single-nanoparticle layers likely formed because of repulsive interactions between the immiscible surface modifiers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatomic force microscopy 3acobalt 3aferrimagnetic materials 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3aseparation 3asurfactants 3atemperature 0aAFM 0aFT 0aLB 0aMNP 0aNP 0aoMNP 0aTG 0aXRD 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aPhase separation 0aSurface modification 0aImmiscibility 0aMethod of organized molecular films1 aYunoki, Takeru1 aShidara, Yusaku1 aIizuka, Manami1 aFujimori, Atsuhiro0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 529 p.462-474dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007300167520152100240592002801761650001601789650002001805650001601825650001801841650001601859650001201875650001101887650001601898650002901914651001001943653001701953653000801970653000801978653000801986653001601994653000802010700001902018700001602037700002002053700001902073700001802092700001602110700001702126773012502143856008502268852000902353655001202362IND60752239520221116192921.0220110e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075223952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1064602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qianwei10aTarget-free ULS-TLS point-cloud registration for alpine forest lands  aModern laser scanning techniques have been commonly used for forest land studies. Complementary scanning capabilities can be particularly obtained using unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (ULS) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technologies. The registration of the ULS and TLS data can thus lead to more comprehensive data acquisition and information extraction in forest lands. However, this registration process is typically hindered by problems of data density and inconsistency of the scanned forest canopy shape. In this paper, we propose a tree-height registration (TR) method for ULS-TLS point-cloud registration, and apply this method to the alpine forest land of the Shangri-La City of the Northwestern Yunnan Province in China. The tree height points are obtained from a digital surface model (DSM), which contains isosurface points of the forest structures. Rotation and translation matrices are then calculated through singular value decomposition (SVD), and rough registration is completed. Finally, fine registration is achieved through nearest-neighbor iterative SVD. The results show that the proposed method can effectively register ULS and TLS forest data samples, with an average accuracy of 0.43 m. The method has an average running time of less than 21 s through 3m-by-3m window size to search tree height point for registration, and also shows good applicability in forest lands with slopes in the range of 2-18°. Moreover, the best outcomes were obtained for a 3m-by-3m window size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adata collection 3aelectronics 3aforest canopy 3aforest land 3aforests 3amodels 3atree height 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aChina 0aRegistration 0aTLS 0aULS 0aDSM 0aTree-height 0aSVD1 aWang, Jinliang1 aMa, Weifeng1 aZhang, Jianpeng1 aDeng, Yuncheng1 aShao, Dajiang1 aXu, Dongfan1 aLiu, Yicheng0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 Nov., v. 190 p.106460-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1064603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245008200167300001600249500002000265520234600285592002802631650001002659650001302669650001502682650001602697650001302713650002102726650002202747650002202769650001002791650001202801651002002813700002002833700002102853700002402874700002502898700003202923700002002955700002002975700001902995700002603014700002403040773013003064856007403194852000903268655001203277IND60587637020221122065056.0180117e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058763702DNAL7 a10.1890/13-0585.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendoza, Sergio Vilchez10aConsistency in bird use of tree cover across tropical agricultural landscapes  ap. 158-168.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn tropical regions where forests have been replaced by agriculture, the future of biodiversity is increasingly dependent on the presence of remnant forest patches and on‐farm tree cover within agricultural landscapes. While there is growing evidence of the importance of tree cover within agricultural landscapes, most studies have been conducted in a single landscape, making it difficult to ascertain whether the conservation value of different types of tree cover can be generalized across landscapes. To explore whether use of different forms of tree cover by birds is consistent across landscapes, we compared the number of individuals, species richness, and diversity of birds associated with different forms of tree cover in four agricultural landscapes in Central America, using a standardized methodology and sampling effort. In each landscape, we compared bird assemblages in six tree cover types (secondary forests, riparian forests, forest fallows, live fences, pastures with high tree cover, and pastures with low tree cover). We observed a total of 10 723 birds of 283 species, with 83–196 species per landscape. The specific patterns of bird species richness, number of individuals, and diversity associated with tree cover types varied across the four landscapes, but these variables were consistently higher in the forest forms of tree cover (riparian forests, secondary forests, and forest fallows) than in non‐forest habitats. In addition, forest forms of tree cover had distinct species composition from non‐forest forms in all landscapes. There was also consistency in the use of different types of tree cover by forest birds across the four landscapes, with higher richness and number of individuals of forest birds in forested than non‐forested forms of tree cover, and more forest bird species in pastures with high tree cover than in pastures with low tree cover. Our findings indicate that riparian and secondary forests are consistently of higher value for bird conservation (particularly for forest species) than live fences and pastures with tree cover. Consequently, agricultural and land use policies that promote the retention of secondary and riparian forests and increase tree cover within pastures would greatly benefit bird conservation, regardless of the landscape in which they are applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alive fences 3apastures 3ariparian forests 3asecondary forests 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3atropics 3aCentral America1 aHarvey, Celia A1 aSáenz, Joel C.,1 aCasanoves, Fernando1 aCarvajal, Jose Pablo1 aVillalobos, Jorge González1 aHernandez, Blas1 aMedina, Arnulfo1 aMontero, Jorge1 aMerlo, Dalia Sánchez1 aSinclair, Fergus L.0 tEcological applications.g2014 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.158-168dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0585.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002200188245018700210300001600397506007600413520176600489592002802255506003702283650001102320650001302331650001402344650001502358650001002373650001902383650002002402650001102422650002802433650001802461650001602479650001702495650001102512650001802523650002502541650002402566650002502590650001102615651001302626653001602639653001402655653002302669653002002692700001902712700002102731700001802752700002202770773012702792856008202919852000903001655001203010IND60517497020221207081806.0190803e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051749702DNAL7 aPMC55761482pmcid7 a259019662pmid7 a10.1017/S136898001500107X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedrick, Valisa E10aEvaluation of a novel biomarker of added sugar intake (δ¹³C) compared with self-reported added sugar intake and the Healthy Eating Index-2010 in a community-based, rural US sample  ap. 429-436.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe δ ¹³C value of human blood is an emerging novel biomarker of added sugar (AS) intake for adults. However, no free-living, community-based assessments of comparative validity of this biomarker have been conducted. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) score, SoFAAS score (HEI-2010 sub-component for solid fat, alcohol and AS), AS and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intakes were associated with δ ¹³C value of fingerstick blood in a community-based sample of adults, while controlling for relevant demographics. A cross-sectional analysis of data obtained from assessments of BMI, dietary intake using 24 h recalls and a fingerstick blood sample was completed. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression and one-way ANOVA. Rural Southwest Virginia, USA. Adults (n 216) aged >18 years who consumed at least 837 kJ/d (200 kcal/d) from SSB. This sample of adult participants with low socio-economic status demonstrated a mean HEI-2010 score of 43·4 (sd 12·2), mean SoFAAS score of 10·2 (sd 5·7), mean AS intake of 93 (sd 65) g/d and mean blood δ ¹³C value of −18·88 (sd 0·7) ‰. In four separate regression models, HEI-2010 (R ²=0·16), SoFAAS (R ²=0·19), AS (R ²=0·15) and SSB (R ²=0·14) predicted δ ¹³C value (all P≤0·001). Age was also predictive of δ ¹³C value, but not sex or race. These findings suggest that fingerstick δ ¹³C value has the potential to be a minimally invasive method for assessing AS and SSB intake and overall dietary quality in community-based settings. Strengths, limitations and future areas of research for using an objective δ ¹³C biomarker in diet-related public health studies are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aalcohols 3abeverages 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3abody mass index 3acarbon 3across-sectional studies 3adata analysis 3afood intake 3ahealthy diet 3ahumans 3alinear models 3anutritional adequacy 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic status 3asugars 3aVirginia 0aAdded sugar 0aBiomarker 0aDietary assessment 0aDietary quality1 aDavy, Brenda M1 aWilburn, Grace A1 aJahren, Hope,1 aZoellner, Jamie M0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 19, no. 3 p.429-436dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S136898001500107X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003600152245014300188520114800331592002801479650002501507650001701532650001701549650001401566650002501580650001501605650001201620650001601632650002301648650001801671650002301689650002401712650002501736650002101761650002701782650001701809650001501826653002501841653001701866653001701883653001301900653002001913700006401933773011101997856008702108852000902195655001202204IND60679977120221119054442.0210820e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067997712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Matheus Henrique Gouveia10aImprovement of the functional and antioxidant properties of rice protein by enzymatic hydrolysis for the microencapsulation of linseed oil  aIn this study, the potential use of rice protein hydrolysates as emulsifying and encapsulating agents in the microencapsulation of linseed oil by spray drying was evaluated. The proteases Alcalase and Flavourzyme were used to obtain protein hydrolysates with various degrees of hydrolysis from rice protein isolate. Linseed oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by maltodextrin and protein hydrolysates obtained by Alcalase or Flavourzyme were characterized by oil droplet size, ζ-potential, rheological behavior, emulsion stability, and emulsion capacity. The emulsions were spray dried and evaluated according to their encapsulation efficiency and lipid oxidation stability. The results showed that the emulsions stabilized by Flavourzyme protein hydrolysate presented smaller oil droplets and were more stable than Alcalase protein hydrolysate and rice protein isolate, resulting in high encapsulation efficiency (89.5%) for higher degree of hydrolysis. In contrast, microparticles containing Alcalase protein hydrolysate reduced the lipid oxidation of linseed oil during storage, due to higher antioxidant capacity of the protein hydrolysate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahydrolysis 3alinseed 3alinseed oil 3alipid peroxidation 3amaltodextrins 3amicroencapsulation 3aoxidative stability 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aprotein isolates 3arheological properties 3arice protein 3asubtilisin 0aRice protein isolate 0aMaltodextrin 0aSpray drying 0aEmulsion 0aLipid oxidation1 aKurozawa, Louise Emy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9023-43930 tJournal of food engineering.g2020 Feb., v. 267 p.109761-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012100174300001600295520135400311592002801665650001601693650001601709650001701725650002201742650002201764650002301786650002201809650002301831650001101854650002201865650001501887651002601902653001601928653002001944653001901964653002001983653002402003653001602027653001802043700002202061700002202083700002402105773013102129856008502260961001202345852000902357655001202366IND60611066520221118063503.0200503e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061106652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.07.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodwin, Marissa J.14aThe 15-year post-treatment response of a mixed-conifer understory plant community to thinning and burning treatments  ap. 617-624.  aDisturbance is central to maintaining diversity in forest ecosystems. In the dry forests of the western United States, over a century of fire exclusion has altered the fire regimes of these forests, resulting in high fuel loads and a loss of plant diversity. Mechanical thinning and prescribed fire are widely used to restore structural complexity and species diversity in many western U.S. forests. While studies have shown that the reintroduction of fire into these forests initially promotes plant diversity, there is limited information on the persistence of this effect. We evaluated the effects of thinning and burning treatments on the understory plant community fifteen years after treatment in an old-growth, Sierran mixed-conifer forest. Using a full-factorial design, including three levels of thinning and two levels of burning, we found mechanical thinning and prescribed fire reduced litter depths and increased the availability of bare ground, resulting in an initial increase in herb cover. However, fifteen years after treatment, litter depths and shrub cover increased, resulting in a more homogenous understory community and a loss of herb cover. Overall, our results suggest that while thinning and burning treatments initially promote herbaceous plant cover, these effects are short lived in the absence of a second disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry forests 3afire regime 3afuel loading 3aground vegetation 3aherbaceous plants 3aold-growth forests 3aplant communities 3aprescribed burning 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3aunderstory 3aWestern United States 0aDisturbance 0aPlant diversity 0aFire Exclusion 0aPrescribed fire 0aMechanical thinning 0aShrub cover 0aSierra Nevada1 aNorth, Malcolm P.1 aZald, Harold S.J.1 aHurteau, Matthew D.0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 429 p.617-624dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245009400190300001600284520174600300592002802046650001502074650001102089650002102100650001202121650001102133650002102144650001402165650001602179650001002195650001102205650002502216650001102241650002002252650001802272650001202290650001202302650001002314650001402324650000902338650001702347653001202364653001102376653001602387653001802403653001402421653000902435700002302444700002202467700002102489700002402510700002202534773012702556856008202683852000902765655001202774IND60517497120221120111935.0190803e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051749712DNAL7 a259363812pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150012022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdegboye, Amanda RA10aCalcium, vitamin D, casein and whey protein intakes and periodontitis among Danish adults  ap. 503-510.  aTo investigate whether intakes of Ca, vitamin D, casein and whey are associated with periodontitis and to investigate the possibility of interactions between them.

Intakes of Ca within recommendations (OR=0·76; 95 % CI 0·58, 0·99), whey ≥9·6 g/d (OR=0·75; 95 % CI 0·58, 0·97) and casein ≥32 g/d (OR=0·75 95 % CI 0·58, 0·97) were associated with lower likelihood of severe periodontitis after adjustment for age, gender, education, smoking, sucrose intake, alcohol consumption, number of teeth, daily brushing, regular visits to the dentist and chronic illness, irrespective of vitamin D intake levels. Intake of vitamin D alone was not associated severe with periodontitis. Intakes of Ca, casein and whey protein were inversely associated with periodontitis. Consumption of foods rich in Ca, casein and whey (e.g. dairy foods) should be promoted, as they may contribute to the prevention of periodontitis. Further longitudinal studies are required to confirm these associations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadults 3aalcohol drinking 3acalcium 3acasein 3achronic diseases 3aeducation 3afood intake 3afoods 3agender 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3anutrient intake 3aperiodontitis 3asucrose 3asurveys 3ateeth 3avitamin D 3awhey 3awhey protein 0aCalcium 0aCasein 0aOral health 0aPeriodontitis 0aVitamin D 0aWhey1 aBoucher, Barbara J1 aKongstad, Johanne1 aFiehn, Nils-Erik1 aChristensen, Lisa B1 aHeitmann, Berit L0 tPublic health nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 19, no. 3 p.503-510dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150012023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04556naa a2201225 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014500165300001600310520160000326592002801926650002101954650001701975650001601992650002202008650002002030650003102050650001002081650001902091650001802110650002602128650001902154650002502173650003302198650004302231650005202274650002402326650002602350650003602376653000702412653001002419653001002429653001002439653000902449653001102458653001002469653001002479653001002489653001002499653000902509653000902518653000802527653001002535653001002545653001002555653001002565653000702575653000902582653000902591653000802600653000902608653000902617653000902626653000902635653001002644653001002654653001002664653001002674653001102684653000902695653000802704653001102712653000802723653000902731653000902740653000902749653000902758653001102767653001102778653000902789653001202798653001102810653001002821653001102831653000902842653001002851653001002861653001002871653001002881653001102891653001002902653001002912653001002922653000902932653001102941653000902952653000902961653001002970653003502980653002203015653001803037700001303055700001703068700001603085700001403101700001603115773009503131856008303226852000903309655001203318IND60530144120221119153540.0180830e20160310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053014412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qianqian10aMicroarray-based gene expression profiling reveals genes and pathways involved in the oncogenic function of REG3A on pancreatic cancer cells  ap. 263-273.  aWe previously reported that regenerating islet-derived protein 3 alpha (REG3A) exacerbates pancreatic malignancies. The mechanism of this effect has not been clearly elucidated. Here we first identified key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and signal pathways in the pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990, compared to two control cell lines, by microarray analysis. We then identified key genes and pathways regulated by REG3A or the cytokine IL6 in SW1990 cells. Afterwards, these DEGs induced by REG3A or IL6 were subjected to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and GO function analysis by the DAVID online tool. Ultimately, we constructed protein–protein interaction networks among the DEGs by Cytoscape. Among the three pancreatic cell lines, SW1990 exhibited highly deterioration with the activation of genes and pathways related to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and invasion. As a result, 50 DEGs enriched in 11 pathways were identified in REG3A-treated SW1990 cells, and 28 DEGs enriched in 9 pathways were detected in IL6-treated cells. Overall, results of microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting suggest that REG3A regulates pancreatic cell growth by increasing the expression of at least 8 genes: JAK1, STAT3, IL10, FOXM1, KRAS, MYC, CyclinD1, and c-fos; and activation of at least 4 signal pathways: TGFβ, PDGF, angiogenesis and RAS. Similar results were obtained with IL6 treatment. Regulation network analysis confirmed the cell growth related DEGs, and further uncovered three transcription factor families with immune functions regulated by REG3A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aangiogenesis 3acell growth 3acomputer software 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aAP 0aBACH1 0aBACH2 0aCARD9 0aCDK4 0aCDKN2A 0ac-fos 0ac-Jun 0aCLDN2 0aDAVID 0aDEGs 0aDOK3 0aEGF 0aFOXM1 0aFOXO3 0aGATA1 0aGATA2 0aGO 0aGRB2 0aIL10 0aIL6 0aJAK1 0aJAK2 0aKEGG 0aKRAS 0aMAPK1 0aMAPK3 0aMAPK4 0aMAPK9 0aMAPK14 0aMRAS 0aMYC 0aNF-κB 0aPAP 0aPAX4 0aPDAC 0aPDGF 0aPID1 0aPIK3CA 0aPPP2CB 0aRALB 0aRAPGEF6 0aRASAL2 0aREG3A 0aRT-PCR 0aSHC1 0aSMAD4 0aSOCS3 0aSPRY1 0aSTAT3 0aSTAT5A 0aTGFβ 0aTIMP1 0aTIMP2 0aTP53 0aTWIST1 0aTyk2 0aVEGF 0aREG3A 0aDifferentially expressed genes 0aPancreatic cancer 0aProliferation1 aFu, Rong1 aYin, Guoxiao1 aLiu, Xiulan1 aLiu, Yang1 aXiang, Ming0 tGene.g2016 Mar. 10, v. 578, no. 2 p.263-273dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011000166300001400276520162900290592002801919650001101947650001701958650002601975650002002001650001502021650002202036650001802058650002202076650001202098650001802110650002202128650001102150650002202161650002102183650002102204650002102225650001502246650002302261650001002284650003702294651001002331653002702341653002002368653001702388653001802405653001802423653002202441700005902463773011402522856008502636852000902721655001202730IND60611066620221118063412.0200515e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061106662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinqi10aMycorrhizal associations differentiate soil respiration in five temperate monocultures in Northeast China  ap. 78-85.  aTree species associated with different mycorrhizal fungi play a crucial role in the carbon (C) cycling of forest ecosystems, while their effects on soil respiration (RS) and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. In this study, we used a common garden experiment that included five monocultures (two arbuscular mycorrhizal – (AM) and three ectomycorrhizal-associated (ECM) temperate tree species) to explore the effects of mycorrhizal associations on the RS and the driving factors. Our specific objectives were to (1) compare the RS between the AM and ECM stands, and (2) explore the driving factors of the RS. We found that the RS in the AM stands was significantly greater (34.3%) than that in the ECM stands. The RS was significantly and positively correlated with microbial biomass C (Cₘᵢc), fine roots biomass (Bᵣₒₒₜ), or soil water content (W₅), but negatively with forest floor mass (Fₘₐₛₛ) or soil dissolved organic C content (Cdᵢₛ). The best-fitted models of RS explained 46.3%, 38.3%, and 45.4% of the variations in the RS for the AM stands, the ECM stands, and the combined dataset, respectively. However, the factors contributing to the RS varied with mycorrhizal groups. The RS of the AM stands was mainly influenced by Cₘᵢc, Bᵣₒₒₜ, root C/N ratio, Fₘₐₛₛ, and Cdᵢₛ, whereas the RS of the ECM stands was mainly affected by litter C/N ratio, Cdᵢₛ, soil dissolved nitrogen content, soil temperature and W₅. These findings highlight the significance of shifts in AM or ECM tree abundance due to forest management and global change in forest C cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adata collection 3afine roots 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest litter 3aforest management 3aforests 3aglobal change 3amicrobial biomass 3amodels 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen content 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atrees 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aChina 0aArbuscular mycorrhizae 0aEctomycorrhizae 0aTree species 0aSoil CO2 flux 0aCommon garden 0aMicrobial biomass1 aWang, Chuankuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3513-54260 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 430 p.78-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245008900175300001800264520125300282592002801535650002201563650002201585650002301607650002001630700001901650700002401669773010301693856008101796852000901877655001201886IND60158293020221119031838.0150530e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015829302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-015-1000-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashemy Shahdany, S.

The potential application of the controller is examined. The main objective of this controller is fair distribution of water between upstream and downstream users in main canals suffering from water shortages. The scheme uses the Integrator-Delay (ID) model for canal pool responses in a model predictive controller. The designed controller is tested on an accurate simulation model of a large canal system, using four test scenarios. The scenarios suffer from limited water supply conditions that are imposed by a limitation on the canal inflow. The results show fast reactions in equitable sharing of water level deviations from target throughout the canal. Since, all the pools are involved in optimally managing the water shortage, significant improvements in operational performance of the canal are achieved. In addition, the operational performance of the designed controller is remarkably improved by applying a new strategy of target-bands instead of target-levels in the canal pools as it increases the flexibility of the controller in making appropriate decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3airrigation canals 3asimulation models 3awater distribution 3awater shortages1 aMaestre, J.

Fruits, vegetables, starch, meat, pulses, dairy products and added sugars in the diet were assessed with portion sizes estimated using standard methods.SettingTwelve randomly selected clusters from the Sri Lanka Diabetes and Cardiovascular Study.SubjectsSix hundred non-institutionalized adults.ResultsThe daily intake of fruit (0·43), vegetable (1·73) and dairy (0·39) portions were well below national recommendations. Only 3·5 % of adults consumed the recommended 5 portions of fruits and vegetables/d; over a third of the population consumed no dairy products and fewer than 1 % of adults consumed 2 portions/d. In contrast, Sri Lankan adults consumed over 14 portions of starch and 3·5 portions of added sugars daily. Almost 70 % of those studied exceeded the upper limit of the recommendations for starch intake. The total daily number of meat and pulse portions was 2·78.ConclusionsDietary guidelines emphasize the importance of a balanced and varied diet; however, a substantial proportion of the Sri Lankan population studied failed to achieve such a recommendation. Nutrition-related diseases in the country may be closely correlated with unhealthy eating habits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3adairy products 3adiabetes 3adiet-related diseases 3aeating habits 3afood consumption 3afruit consumption 3afruits 3aguidelines 3ameat 3aportion size 3astarch 3asugars 3avegetables 3aSri Lanka 0aFood consumption 0aSri Lanka 0aDietary survey 0aFood servings 0aFood portions1 aByrne, Nuala M.,1 aSoares, Mario J1 aKatulanda, Prasad1 aHills, Andrew P.,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2013 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.653-658dCambridge University Pressx1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800120030113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245006700178300001600245520157400261592002801835650000801863650001701871650001401888650002501902650001401927650003201941650001501973650001701988650002202005650002402027650001902051650000902070650001302079650001502092653000802107653000702115653000702122653000902129653000802138653000902146653000802155653000802163653000802171653000702179653000702186653000802193653000802201653000702209653000902216653000802225653000702233653000902240653000802249653000802257653000802265653000802273653000702281653000702288653000902295653001402304653002402318653001402342653001502356653001402371653001302385700002602398700002402424700002102448700002002469700002402489700002602513700002002539700002102559700001802580773010402598856008502702852000902787655001202796IND60609254020221119212042.0181207e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060925402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsatsakis, Aristidis M.10aEnvironmental impacts of genetically modified plants: A review  ap. 818-833.  aPowerful scientific techniques have caused dramatic expansion of genetically modified crops leading to altered agricultural practices posing direct and indirect environmental implications. Despite the enhanced yield potential, risks and biosafety concerns associated with such GM crops are the fundamental issues to be addressed. An increasing interest can be noted among the researchers and policy makers in exploring unintended effects of transgenes associated with gene flow, flow of naked DNA, weediness and chemical toxicity. The current state of knowledge reveals that GM crops impart damaging impacts on the environment such as modification in crop pervasiveness or invasiveness, the emergence of herbicide and insecticide tolerance, transgene stacking and disturbed biodiversity, but these impacts require a more in-depth view and critical research so as to unveil further facts. Most of the reviewed scientific resources provide similar conclusions and currently there is an insufficient amount of data available and up until today, the consumption of GM plant products are safe for consumption to a greater extent with few exceptions. This paper updates the undesirable impacts of GM crops and their products on target and non-target species and attempts to shed light on the emerging challenges and threats associated with it. Underpinning research also realizes the influence of GM crops on a disturbance in biodiversity, development of resistance and evolution slightly resembles with the effects of non-GM cultivation. Future prospects are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiodiversity 3abiosafety 3aenvironmental impact 3agene flow 3agenetically modified plants 3aherbicides 3ainsecticides 3aissues and policy 3anontarget organisms 3aplant products 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atransgenes 0aALS 0abp 0aBt 0aCaMV 0aDNA 0aEFSA 0aEPA 0aERA 0aFSA 0aGD 0aGM 0aGMO 0aHGT 0aHR 0aICSU 0aIMI 0aMn 0anDNA 0aNIH 0aNOS 0aPAT 0aRNA 0aUK 0aUS 0aWYMV 0aGM plants 0aEnvironmental risks 0aGene flow 0aTransgenes 0aWeediness 0aToxicity1 aNawaz, Muhammad Amjad1 aKouretas, Demetrios1 aBalias, Georgios1 aSavolainen, Kai1 aTutelyan, Victor A.1 aGolokhvast, Kirill S.1 aLee, Jeong Dong1 aYang, Seung Hwan1 aChung, Gyuhwa0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 July, v. 156 p.818-833dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245012500207300001400332500001500346520123400361592002801595650001301623650001501636650001001651650001101661650001301672650001401685650002501699650002801724650001801752650001301770650001601783650002701799650001901826650001201845650001401857650002101871651001601892651001001908653000901918653002801927653000901955653000801964653000801972653001001980653000901990653001001999653001902009653002502028653000802053653000802061653002102069653000902090653000802099700001502107700002002122700002502142700002002167773009302187856008302280852000902363655001202372IND60530144220221119153529.0180830e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053014422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaikwad, Satish1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1031-567710aGenetic characterization and evolutionary analysis of Newcastle disease virus isolated from domestic duck in South Korea  ap. 34-40.  a2019-12-06  aDomestic ducks are considered a potential reservoir of Newcastle disease virus. In the study, a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated from a domestic duck during surveillance in South Korea was characterized. The complete genome of the NDV isolate was sequenced, and the phylogenetic relationship to reference strains was studied. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain clustered in genotype I of Class II ND viruses, has highly phylogenetic similarity to NDV strains isolated from waterfowl in China, but was distant from the viruses isolated in chickens and vaccine strains used in South Korea. Pathogenicity experiment in chickens revealed it to be a lentogenic virus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein confirmed that the isolate contained the avirulent motif ¹¹²GKQGRL¹¹⁷ at the cleavage site and caused no apparent disease in chickens and ducks. With phylogeographic analysis based on fusion gene, we estimate the origin of an ancestral virus of the isolate and its sister strain located in China around 1998. It highlights the need of continuous surveillance to enhance current understanding of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of the pathogenic strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3amonitoring 3aducks 3agenome 3avaccines 3aphylogeny 3aamino acid sequences 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3apathogenicity 3agenotype 3agene fusion 3amolecular epidemiology 3aphylogeography 3aviruses 3awaterfowl 3avirulent strains 3aSouth Korea 3aChina 0aMCMC 0aNewcastle disease virus 0aDK13 0aHPD 0aCDS 0aEID50 0aICPI 0aTMRCA 0aPhylogeography 0aDomestic duck origin 0aESS 0aNDV 0aAvirulent strain 0aLBMs 0aSPF1 aKim, Ji-Ye1 aLee, Hyun-Jeong1 aChŏng, Sŏk-chʻan,1 aChoi, Kang-Seuk0 tGene.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 579, no. 1 p.34-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01418naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245014300158300001800301520046600319592002800785650002300813650002300836650001600859650002800875700002600903773012900929856007301058852000901131655001201140IND60657514120221121030448.0190816e20040901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065751412DNAL7 a10.1039/b402150a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmarsson, Örn10aCrystal engineering of the composition of pharmaceutical phases.

Methods and Results: The results showed T. abietinum 1302BG and L. spadicea could use the cyanobacterial bloom materials taken from Taihu Lake for growth to measure the mycelial plaque and dry‐weight mycelial pellicles of fungi. The removal rate of dried cyanobacterial bloom materials incubated with white rot fungi is approximately 100%. Conclusions: The cyanobacterial bloom material can be used as a glucose substitute in white rot fungi medium. The white rot fungi, T. abietinum 1302BG and L. spadicea, can also directly decrease the biomass of cyanobacterial bloom material taken from Taihu Lake. Significance and Impact of the Study: Cyanobacterial bloom thrives in eutrophic fresh waters all over the world. Micro‐organisms, particularly fungi, have attracted attention as possible agents for the degradation of phytoplankton species. Dealing with cyanobacterial bloom material as a medium for fungi instead of directly discharging them as organic fertilizers is a new, safe and environmentally friendly approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichaptum 3abiomass 3aglucose 3alakes 3aorganic fertilizers 3aphytoplankton 3awhite-rot fungi 2aBasidiomycotaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aCyanobacteriaxmetabolism 2aLakesxmicrobiology1 aWang, C.1 aZhao, G.1 aGuo, P.1 aTian, X.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2012 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.96-101dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2011.03178.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245008000184300001600264520132500280592002801605650001901633650001701652650001001669650002601679650002801705650002001733650001001753650002701763650001501790650002701805650000901832650001801841650002601859650001301885650005401898650002601952650004301978650000902021650003502030651001002065653002402075653004402099653000902143700001802152700001802170700001802188700001702206700001702223700001802240700002002258773013602278856008202414852000902496655001202505IND60516204020221123023104.0190726e20120128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051620402DNAL7 a217333392pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145110027042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong Du, Xiao10aSNP and mRNA expression for glutathione peroxidase 4 in Kashin-Beck disease  ap. 164-169.  aKashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a chronic endemic osteoarthropathy, which mainly occurs in West and Northeast China. Epidemiological studies suggest that Se deficiency is an important environmental factor for the incidence of KBD. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) belongs to the glutathione peroxidase family, which is crucial for optimal antioxidant defences. Our purpose is to investigate the putative association between GPx4 polymorphisms and the risk of KBD. Restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR was used to detect two SNP (rs713041, rs4807542) in 219 cases and 194 controls in Han Chinese subjects, and quantitative analysis for the GPx4 mRNA level was performed by the real-time PCR method. The results revealed that linkage disequilibrium existed in the two SNP. A significant difference was observed in the haplotype A-T (P = 0·0066) of GPx4, which was obviously lower in the KBD cases (0·006 v. 0·032 %). Correlation analysis based on a single locus showed no association between each SNP and KBD risk. Furthermore, the GPx4 mRNA level was dramatically lower in the blood of KBD patients. Overall, our finding indicated GPx4 polymorphisms and decreased mRNA level may be related to the development of KBD in the Chinese population, suggesting GPx4 as a possible candidate susceptibility gene for KBD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aantioxidants 3ablood 3aenvironmental factors 3aepidemiological studies 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahaplotypes 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3anutrient deficiencies 3apatients 3aphospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aChina 0aKashin-Beck disease 0aGlutathione peroxidase 4: Polymorphisms 0amRNA1 aXia Dai, Xiao1 aXia Song, Rui1 aZhen Zou, Xiu1 aYan Sun, Wen1 aYan Mo, Xiao1 aLu Bai, Guang1 aMin Xiong, Yong0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Jan. 28, v. 107, no. 2 p.164-169dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145110027043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008500169300001600254520144600270592002801716650001901744650001801763650001601781650002401797650002401821650003001845650002101875650001701896650001301913650001201926650000901938650001401947650002301961651001101984653000701995653000702002653000902009653000802018653000802026653001802034653002302052653001202075653002302087653001902110653003602129700001602165700002202181700001902203700001802222700002502240700002302265700002202288773010402310856008502414852000902499655001202508IND60609254120221119212036.0181207e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060925412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoux, Jonathan10aAir pollution by particulate matter PM10 may trigger multiple sclerosis relapses  ap. 404-410.  aSeasonal variation of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that season-dependent factors, such as ambient air pollution, may trigger them. However, only few studies have considered possible role of air pollutants as relapse's risk factor.We investigated the effect of particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10µm (PM10) on MS relapses.In total, 536 relapsing MS patients from Strasbourg city (France) were included, accounting for 2052 relapses over 2000–2009 period. A case-crossover design was used with cases defined as the days of relapse and controls being selected in the same patient at plus and minus 35 days. Different lags from 0 to 30 days were considered. Conditional logistic regressions, adjusted on meteorological parameters, school and public holidays, were used and exposure was considered first as a quantitative variable and second, as a binary variable.The natural logarithm of the average PM10 concentration lagged from 1 to 3 days before relapse onset was significantly associated with relapse risk (OR =1.40 [95% confidence interval 1.08–1.81]) in cold season. Consistent results were observed when considering PM10 as a binary variable, even if not significant.With an appropriate study design and robust ascertainment of neurological events and exposure, the present study highlights the effect of PM10 on the risk of relapse in MS patients, probably through oxidative stress mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3acold season 3aconfidence interval 3aexperimental design 3ameteorological parameters 3aoxidative stress 3aparticulates 3apatients 3arelapse 3arisk 3asclerosis 3aseasonal variation 3aFrance 0aMS 0aPM 0aPM10 0aSMA 0aSES 0aAir pollution 0aMultiple sclerosis 0aRelapse 0aParticulate matter 0aCase-crossover 0aConditional logistic regression1 aBard, Denis1 aLe Pabic, Estelle1 aSegala, Claire1 aReis, Jacques1 aOngagna, Jean-Claude1 ade Sèze, Jérôme1 aLeray, Emmanuelle0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 July, v. 156 p.404-410dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04158naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111024002000148040001800168072000900186072000900195100001700204245016200221300001800383500002400401500001500425520200200440650002102442650001702463650002302480650002102503650002702524650001002551650001302561650001602574650002102590650001702611650001302628650002102641650002702662650001202689650003002701650003502731650002802766650003102794650002702825650003802852650002902890651001402919651001202933651001202945651001902957651003102976653001503007700001403022700002003036773012603056852000903182856008703191856011103278930003303389945002503422946001303447961001203460655001203472IND4376993420221122021449.0060105e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437699342DNAL7 a165391332pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-98.6.20582doi7 a10113/15822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK0011 aMiller, D.R.10aAttraction of southern pine engravers and associated bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) to ipsenol, ipsdienol, and lanierone in southeastern United States  ap. 2058-2066.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aWe determined the response of the small southern pine engraver, Ips avulsus (Eichhoff); eastern fivespined ips, Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff); sixspined ips, Ips calligraphus (Germar); and pine engraver, Ips pini (Say) to the pheromones (+/-)-ipsenol, (+/-)-ipsdienol, and lanierone in the southeastern United States. Catches of I. avulsus and I. grandicollis to baited multiple-funnel traps were increased by (+/-)-ipsenol and (+/-)-ipsdienol in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina. In all four localities, the highest numbers of I. avulsus were caught in traps baited with the combination of (+/-)-ipsenol, (+/-)-ipsdienol, and lanierone. In Florida, the highest numbers of I. grandicollis were captured in traps baited with the combination of (+/-)-ipsenol and (+/-)-ipsdienol (with or without lanierone). In the remaining three localities, the largest catches of I. grandicollis occurred in traps baited with (+/-)-ipsenol alone or the combination of (+/-)-ipsenol and (+/-)-ipsdienol (with or without lanierone). (+/-)-Ipsdienol was the only consistent attractant for I. calligraphus and I. pini. Attraction of I. pini in North Carolina to (+/-)-ipsdienol-baited traps was synergized by lanierone but interrupted with (+/-)-ipsenol. The interruptive effect of (+/-)-ipsenol on attraction of I. pini to (+/-)-ipsdienol was negated by lanierone. (+/-)-Ipsdienol was attractive to black turpentine beetle, Dendroctonus terebrans (Olivier), in Florida but not North Carolina, whereas (+/-)-ipsdienol was attractive to I. calligraphus in Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida. Both (+/-)-ipsenol and (+/-)-ipsdienol affected catches of Gnathotrichus materiarus (Fitch) in North Carolina. Trap catches of Hylurgops rugipennis pinifex (Fitch), Hylastes salebrosus Eichhoff, and Hylastes tenuis Eichhoff were unaffected by the pheromone treatments. The combination of (+/-)-ipsenol, (+/-)-ipsdienol, and lanierone may be a cost-effective general lure for I. avulsus, I. grandicollis, and I. pini. 3aambrosia beetles 3abark beetles 3ainsect attractants 3aIps grandicollis 3aaggregation pheromones 3abaits 3atrapping 3aIps avulsus 3apheromone blends 3afunnel traps 3aIps pini 3aIps calligraphus 2aAlcoholsxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxdrug effects. 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aMonoterpenesxpharmacology 2aOctanolsxpharmacology 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aPheromonesxpharmacology 3aLouisiana 3aFlorida 3aGeorgia 3aNorth Carolina 0aSoutheastern United States 0aScolytidae1 aAsaro, C.1 aBerisford, C.W.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2005 Dec., v.  98, no.  6 p.2058-2066dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-98.6.20583Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/15823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070813b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/26  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03177naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245011000147300001800257520226400275650001302539650001402552650001002566650001102576650002402587650002202611650003002633653001102663700001702674700001702691773007602708852000902784939003302793946001302826655001202839IND9104673620221120070130.0911119e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910467362DNAL7 a166683162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarquis, J.I.10aEthylene evolution from maize (Zea mays L.) seedling roots and shoots in response to mechanical impedance  ap. 1171-1177.  aThe effect of mechanical impedance on ethylene evolution and growth of preemergent maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings was investigated by pressurizing the growth medium in triaxial cells in a controlled environment. Pressure increased the bulk density of the medium and thus the resistance to growth. The elongation of maize primary roots and preemergent shoots was severely hindered by applied pressures as low as 10 kilopascals. Following a steep decline in elongation at low pressures, both shoots and roots responded to additional pressure in a linear manner, but shoots were more severely affected than roots at higher pressures. Radial expansion was promoted in both organs by mechanical impedance. Primary roots typically became thinner during the experimental period when grown unimpeded. In contrast, pressures as low as 25 kilopascals caused a 25% increase in root tip diameter. Shoots showed a slight enhancement of radial expansion; however, in contrast to roots, the shoots increased in diameter even when growing unimpeded. Such morphological changes were not evident until at least 3 hours after initiation of treatment. All levels of applied pressure promoted ethylene evolution as early as 1 hour after application of pressure. After 1 hour, ethylene evolution rates had increased 10, 32, 70, and 255% at 25, 50, 75, and 100 kilopascals respectively, and continued to increase linearly for at least 10 hours. When intact corn seedlings were subjected to a series of hourly cycles of pressure, followed by relaxation, ethylene production rates increased or decreased rapidly, illustrating tight coupling between mechanical impedance and tissue response. Seedlings exposed to 1 microliter of ethylene per liter showed symptoms similar to those shown by plants grown under mechanical impedance. Root diameter increased 5 times as much as the shoot diameter. Pretreatment with 10 micromolar aminoethoxyvinyl glycine plus 1 micromolar silver thiosulfate maintained ethylene production rates of impeded seedlings at basal levels and restored shoot and root extension to 84 and 90% of unimpeded values, respectively. Our results support the hypothesis that ethylene plays a pivotal role in the regulation of plant tissue response to mechanical impedance. 3aZea mays 3aseedlings 3aroots 3ashoots 3aethylene production 3amechanical damage 3aresistance to penetration 0agrowth1 aJordan, W.R.1 aMorgan, P.W.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Aug., v. 96, no. 4 p.1171-1177x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02850naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009800127300001600225500002400241520166700265650002401932650001301956650002001969650001901989650001802008650001702026650001402043650002102057650001402078653001302092653002002105700002002125700001602145700001702161773012602178852000902304856007002313930003302383945001302416946001102429655001202440IND2329288420221120070336.0021010e20020311ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232928842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobb, D.H.F.10aElectrical stunning of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): factors that affect stun duration  ap. 359-371.  aIncludes references  aMany present commercial methods of slaughtering fish for food cause stress and aversive behaviour, which could be considered inhumane. This is especially true for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which are usually slaughtered by removal from water resulting in death by anoxia. In the context of fish farming, this slaughter method is becoming less acceptable both from a welfare perspective and in terms of providing consistent and potentially improved flesh quality characteristics. The increasing concern for the welfare of fish has led to research to improve the situation. The use of electricity at slaughter could offer a humane procedure for stunning and/or killing large numbers of small fish when carried out correctly. This paper separately investigates the importance of stun application time, frequency and current magnitude of a sinusoidal alternating current on the ability to stun and stun/kill rainbow trout. In particular, increasing current magnitude and current application time were both found to increase the time for which the animals were effectively stunned. Also, above a current magnitude threshold, the trout were killed by the application. Increasing the frequency of the current waveform decreased the stun duration, until a threshold frequency was reached, at which it is suggested that it may not be possible to stun trout with the current parameters used. All three parameters need to be considered to ensure a humane stun or stun/kill, but such applications may also have implications for quality attributes of the flesh. This investigation will assist in the design of a humane electrical slaughter device for rainbow trout. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aduration 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal welfare 3afish products 3afood quality 3amortality 3aelectric current 3afrequency 0astunning 0aelectronarcosis1 aO'Callaghan, M.1 aLines, J.A.1 aKestin, S.C.0 tAquaculture.g2002 Mar. 11, , no. 3/4 p.359-371dElsevier Pub.

The addition of spermidine to this initiation medium significantly increased the production of somatic embryos. In this case, the total polyamine content of the embryogenic mass was higher than that of cultures without spermidine. At day 6 of the culture, a transient accumulation of free polyamines, mainly spermidine, was observed. After this peak, free and conjugated polyamines levels did not show significant variation nor did the polyamine oxidase activity. The results clearly demonstrated that spermidine supplied to the medium was oxidised by polyamine oxidase and partially metabolised into putrescine. The role of spermidine and its interaction with auxin in the initiation of the embryogenic process in Panax ginseng are discussed in relation to embryogenic potential. 3aPanax pseudoginseng 3amicropropagation 3a2,4-D 3acallus 3adose response 3adrugs 3aspermine 3aputrescine 3akinetin 3aquantitative analysis 3aspermidine 3aenzyme activity 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aembryo (plant) 3asomatic embryogenesis 3aoxidoreductases 0aregenerative ability 0amethodology 0amurashige and skoog medium 0aembryogenesis 0abenzoselenienyl-3 acetic acid 0aauxins1 aKevers, C.1 aDommes, J.1 aGaspar, T.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2002 Mar., v. 68, no. 3 p.225-232dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02686naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010900125300001600234500009900250500002400349500001500373520111100388650001601499650001801515650001001533650002401543650002401567650001901591650001301610650001801623650002301641650002601664650001801690650001701708650002101725650002701746650001001773650001101783653002501794653001601819653001801835653001001853700001201863700001501875773012301890852000902013856007702022930003302099945001302132946001102145655001202156IND2329366520221120043201.0021017e200203  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232936652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeng, W.L.10aExplant preparation affects culture initiation and regeneration of Panax ginseng and Panax quinquefolius  ap. 233-239.  aIn the special section: In Vitro Culture of Medicinal Plants.

Explant preparation was defined as the application of surface disinfection and homogenization to ginseng roots and embryos. Surface disinfection significantly affected culture initiation and subsequent embryogenesis. A high success rate (80-97%) in culture initiation was associated with explants from non-surface disinfected root tissue. The cumulative contamination rate after 8 months was below 4%; in contrast, a contamination rate of 85% was observed in disinfected root explants. For non-disinfected explants, visible callus was induced in 1 week, adventitious root and somatic embryos were formed in 2 and 6 months, respectively. Explants from disinfected roots required 1 month to induce visible callus, 5-7 months for adventitious roots and 10 months for somatic embryogenesis. For germinating embryos, disinfected embryos required double the time for embryogenesis than non-disinfected ones. It was considered that surface disinfection imposed a stress and subsequently a carry-over effect on explants. 3agermination 3adose response 3adrugs 3aPanax pseudoginseng 3aPanax quinquefolius 3aembryo (plant) 3aexplants 3aculture media 3aadventitious roots 3asomatic embryogenesis 3abenzyladenine 3adisinfection 3amicropropagation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3a2,4-D 3acallus 0aregenerative ability 0amethodology 0aembryogenesis 0aroots1 aSin, T.1 aTeng, M.C.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2002 Mar., v. 68, no. 3 p.233-239dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03312naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245014700162300001400309520162900323650002201952650001301974650001201987650002301999650002802022650001202050650002202062650002402084650002002108650001502128650001902143650001002162650002702172650003002199650001202229650002802241650001502269650002502284653000802309653001202317653002402329700001602353700001702369700002402386700001802410700002202428700002302450700002702473773010802500852000902608856008502617930003302702946001102735655001202746IND4447285920221120043054.0110107e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444728592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-010-9414-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunkeaw, S. 10aConstruction of a genetic linkage map using simple sequence repeat markers from expressed sequence tags for cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)  ap. 67-75.  aCassava (Manihot esculenta) is an economically important crop that is grown in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Use of molecular technology for genetic improvement of cassava has been limited by the lack of a large set of DNA markers and a genetic map. Therefore, the aims here were to develop additional simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from the public expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and to construct a genetic linkage map. In this study, we designed 425 EST-SSR markers from sequences obtained from the cassava EST database in GenBank, and integrated them with 667 SSR markers from a microsatellite-enriched genomic sequence received from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). Of these, 107 EST-SSR and 500 genomic SSR primer pairs showed polymorphic patterns when screened in two cassava varieties, Hauy Bong 60 and Hanatee, which were used as female and male parental lines, respectively. Within the 107 and 500 primer pairs, 81 and 226 EST-SSR and SSR primer pairs were successfully genotyped with 100 samples of F₁ progeny, respectively. The results showed 20 linkage groups consisting of 211 markers--56 EST-SSR and 155 SSR markers--spanning 1,178 cM, with an average distance between markers of 5.6 cM and about 11 markers per linkage group. These novel EST-SSR markers provided genic PCR-based co-dominant markers that were useful, reliable and economical. The EST-SSRs were used together with SSR markers to construct the cassava genetic linkage map which will be useful for the identification of quantitative trait loci controlling the traits of interest in cassava breeding programs. 3aManihot esculenta 3abreeding 3acassava 3achromosome mapping 3aexpressed sequence tags 3afemales 3agenetic databases 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3alinkage groups 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny 3aquantitative trait loci 3asubtropics 3atropical agriculture 0aEST 0aEST-SSR 0aGenetic linkage map1 aYoocha, T. 1 aSraphet, S. 1 aBoonchanawiwat, A. 1 aBoonseng, O. 1 aLightfoot, D.

The modelling framework incorporates farming systems models and, thus, simulates crop and pasture production, whilst also accounting for lateral fluxes of water (surface and subsurface) and groundwater recharge and discharge.The framework was applied to Simmons Creek catchment, a subcatchment of the Billabong Creek in southern New South Wales, comprising gentle uplands and substantial low-relief areas containing swamps. An integrated approach incorporating soil, hydrology, hydrogeology, and terrain analysis resulted in interpretation of landscape function and the necessary parameterization of the modelling framework. Current land use (crop rotation and pasture) and an alternative land use (10% trees on uphill units and pasture in the lower lying lands) were simulated to compare the relative contribution of parts of the catchment with total recharge. Comparison between current and alternative land use over 44 years of simulations indicated a decrease of mean annual drainage from 39 to 29 mm year⁻¹ and an average reduction of the groundwater level of about 0·4 m. A more substantial decrease in water-table depth would require targeted tree planting over larger areas. This can be investigated further with the spatial framework. 3acrop production 3acrop rotation 3adrainage 3afarming systems 3agroundwater recharge 3ahighlands 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apastures 3asalts 3asoil 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3aswamps 3atrees 3awater table 3aNew South Wales1 aGallant, John0 tHydrological processes.g2008 June 30, v. 22, no. 13 p.2094-2104dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.6809 7aarticle02027naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245014000145300001400285300001900299500001500318520098100333650002501314650002501339650002001364650002101384650002101405650001301426653001701439653001401456700001901470700001901489700001801508773007201526852000901598939003301607946001301640655001201653IND9100997320221120043545.0910226e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910099732DNAL7 a166679532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWingsle, G.10aIsolation, purification, and subcellular localization of isozymes of superoxide dismutase from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles  ap. 21-28.  ap. 21-28. ill.  a2019-12-05  aTwo of four isozymes of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (EC 1.15.1.1) were purified from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles. One form was cytosolic (SOD-1) and the other was associated with chloroplasts (SOD-3). The holoenzyme molecular masses was estimated at approximately 35 kilodaltons by gel filtration. The subunit molecular weight of the dimeric enzymes was estimated to 16.5 kilodaltons (SOD-1) and 20.4 kilodaltons (SOD-3) on sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gels. The NH2-terminal sequence of the pine enzymes showed similarities to other purified superoxide dismutases located in the corresponding compartment. The cytosolic form revealed two additional amino acids at position 1 and 2 at the NH2-terminal. Both forms were cyanide- and hydrogenperoxide-sensitive and SOD-3 was found to contain approximately one copper atom per subunit, indicating that they belong to the cupro-zinc SODs The isoelectric point was 4.9 and 4.5 for SOD-1 and SOD-3, respectively. 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aamino acid sequences 3aconifer needles 3aPinus sylvestris 3amolecular weight 3aisozymes 0apurification 0aisolation1 aGardestrom, P.1 aHallgren, J.E.1 aKarpinski, S.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.21-28x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02169naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002700115245004200142300001200184300001700196520111700213650003201330650001301362650002401375650002401399650002201423650001501445650001301460650001201473650001301485650001701498650001701515653002701532653001901559653002701578653002401605773006901629852000901698939003301707945000801740946001101748655001201759991572994510742620221120043542.0820602e198203  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820007892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCole-Hamilton, Isabel.12aA personal view of teaching nutrition  ap. 6-9.  ap. 6-9. ill.  aCurrent contributions of community dietitians to nutrition education are described.

Relative gene activation was compared to 17beta-estradiol and varied over eight orders of magnitude. Analysis of the data compared to 17beta-estradiol identified three structural criteria that were related to xenoestrogen activity and potency: (1) the hydrogen-bonding ability of the phenolic ring mimicking the A-ring, (2) a hydrophobic centre similar in size and shape to the B- and C-rings, and (3) a hydrogen-bond donor mimicking the 17beta-hydroxyl moiety of the D-ring, especially with an oxygen-to-oxygen distance similar to that between the 3- and 17beta-hydroxyl groups of 17beta-estradiol. Binding data were segregated into activity clusters including strong, moderate, weak, and detectable gene expression, and those compounds that were inactive. The hydrogen-bonding ability of hydroxy group in the 3-position on 17beta-estradiol was observed to be essential for gene activation. Compounds with a 4-hydroxyl substituted benzene ring and a hydrophobic moiety of size and shape equivalent to the B-ring of 17beta-estradiol were generally observed to be weakly active compounds. Moderately active compounds have a 4-hydroxyl substituted benzene ring with a hydrophobic moiety equivalent in size and shape to the B- and C-ring of 17beta-estradiol, or have a high hydrogen-bond donor capacity owing to the presence of halogens on a nonphenolic ring. Strongly active compounds, similar to 4,4'-diethylethylene bisphenol (DES), possess the same hydrophobic ring structure as described for moderately active compounds and an additional hydroxyl group with an oxygen-to-oxygen distance close to that exhibited by the 3- and 17-hydroxyl groups of 17beta-estradlol. 3aaromatic compounds 3aestrogenic properties 3atranscriptional activation 3agene expression 3abioassays 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3areporter genes 3axenoestrogens 2aBenzophenonesxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aEstrogensxbiosynthesis 2aEstrogens, Non-Steroidalxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aFlavonoidsxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aHydrocarbons, Aromaticxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aLethal Dose 50 2aPhenolsxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTranscriptional Activation 2abeta-Galactosidasexbiosynthesis 0axenoestrogenicity1 aSinks, G.D.1 aCronin, M.T.D.0 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2002 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.14-23dJohn Wiley & Sonsx1520-40817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.100273Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1522-72783Available from publisher's Web site  a20100727b20100807c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02430naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001700161245010200178300001400280500002400294520085800318650002301176650003801199650005701237650005801294650005801352650003501410650004301445650002301488650002101511700001701532700001401549700001601563700001401579773018801593852000901781856008201790856006701872930003301939945001301972946001101985655001201996IND2329118720221123044209.0020930e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232911872DNAL7 a121617732pmid7 a10.1038/sj.jim.70002702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubinder, K.10aAmylase hyperproduction by deregulated mutants of the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus  ap. 70-74.  aIncludes references  aThermomyces lanuginosus was subjected to three cycles of mutagenesis (UV/NTG) and a selection procedure to develop amylase-hyperproducing, catabolite-repression-resistant and partially constitutive strains.

The regression models computed showed significantly high R2 values of 96 and 97% for alpha-amylase and glucoamylase activities, respectively, indicating that they are appropriate for predicting relationships between corn flour, soybean meal and pH with alpha-amylase and glucoamylase production. 3athermophilic fungi 2aAmylasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aAscomycotaxenzymologyxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungalxradiation effects 2aGlucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMutagenesisxradiation effects 2aMutationxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aSelection, Genetic 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aChadha, B.S.1 aSingh, N.1 aSaini, H.S.1 aSingh, S.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2002 Aug., v. 29, no. 2 p.70-74dPublished by Stockton Press on behalf of the Society for Industrial Microbiologyx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.70002703Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.naturesj.com./jim/3Table of contents and abstracts  a20030101b20030107c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01701naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245008300147300001600230300002100246500001500267520078700282650002001069650002601089650002601115653001401141653002801155700001701183700001901200700001501219773007401234852000901308939003301317946001301350655001201363IND9101002120221123042216.0910227e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910100212DNAL7 a166679742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, J.R.10aIdentification and localization of carbonic anhydrase in two Chlorella species  ap. 331-334.  ap. 331-334. ill.  a2019-12-05  aCarbonic anhydrase (CA) activity and localization have been examined in two species of the eukaryotic green alga Chlorella.

The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by a procedure involving salt fractionation as well as ion-exchange, size exclusion, and affinity chromatography. Since the final preparation produced two bands on SDS polyacryamide gels but only one band on a nondenaturating gel, it is concluded that the two subunits (44 and 40 kilodaltons, respectively) are part of a single enzymatic protein which shows GS activity. The pH optimum for leaf GS ranged between 6.2 and 6.5, one pH unit lower than the values reported for higher plants which utilize primarily nitrate nitrogen. Magnesium requirements for GS in P. banksiana were different for leaves and roots, showing Vmax/2 values of 2.5 and 8 millimolar, respectively at 5 millimolar ATP. Furthermore, Km values for ammonium were higher for the enzyme in leaves (33.1 micromolar) than in roots (19.2 micromolar). Km values for ATP and for glutamate, on the other hand, were similar for the two tissues. A polyclonal antibody was produced against the purified leaf GS. Western blots of leaf homogenates produced two bands, the lighter one being more abundant. The same pattern was found when immunodetection was performed using an anti GS IgG produced against purified GS from Phaseolus nodules thus indicating common antigenic determinants. At least 30% of total GS was recovered in a plastid-fraction of dark-grown calli produced from the basal part of P. banksiana hypocotyls. 3aprotein composition 3alaboratory techniques 3aion exchange 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aPinus banksiana 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3aleaves 0apurification 0asalt fractionation1 aMargolis, H.A.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Oct., v. 94, no. 2 p.657-664x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02207naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245012800149300001600277300002100293520115800314650001301472650001101485650002101496650002001517650002001537650002501557650003701582650001901619653001501638700001801653700001601671700001701687773007401704852000901778939003301787946001301820655001201833IND9006156920221123042238.0901213e199010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900615692DNAL7 a166677432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen-Quoc, B.10aSucrose synthase in developing maize leaves. Regulation of activity by protein level during the import to export transition  ap. 516-523.  ap. 516-523. ill.  aThe maize (Zea mays) leaf is a valuable system to study the sucrose import to sucrose export transition at the cellular level. Rapidly growing and fully heterotrophic cells in the basal part of the young leaf showed a high sucrose synthase (SS) activity. Leaf SS has been purified to homogeneity. By comparison with purified kernel SS isozymes, the leaf SS has been identified as SS2. SS1 protein and SS2 protein were clearly separated by electrophoresis and the two monomers differed in size by 6 kilodaltons. Nevertheless, kinetic parameters of both enzymes were very similar. Immunodetection of SS protein showed that in young heterotrophic tissues SS2 was a major protein accounting for 3% of the total protein. Concurrent with greening, SS activity decreased and the change of activity was explained by regulation of the protein level. In mature green tissues, which are synthetizing sucrose as evidenced by the presence of sucrose phosphate synthase activity, SS activity was almost completely absent. Results suggested that down regulation of SS2 enzyme protein level was an early event in the transition from import to export status of the leaf. 3aZea mays 3aleaves 3asucrose synthase 3aenzyme activity 3aprotein content 3adevelopmental stages 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aphotosynthates 0aregulation1 aKrivitzky, M.1 aHuber, S.C.1 aLecharny, A.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Oct., v. 94, no. 2 p.516-523x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02750naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245011200146300001400258300001900272500001500291520176500306650001802071650002002089650002302109650001602132650001602148650002002164650001302184650002302197653001702220653002402237773007202261852000902333939003302342946001302375655001202388IND9100997220221123042213.0910226e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910099722DNAL7 a166679412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMellon, J.E.10aPurification and characterization of isoperoxidases elicited by Aspergillus flavus in cotton ovule cultures  ap. 14-20.  ap. 14-20. ill.  a2019-12-05  aTwo anionic isoperoxidases were isolated from media of Aspergillus flavus-inoculated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) ovule cultures and purified about 150-fold to apparent homogeneity by treatment with Cell Debris Remover and ion exchange chromatography on Accell QMA medium. These isoperoxidases were present in noninoculated cotton ovule cultures at low levels. The major activity peak (B) represented 90% of the recovered peroxidase activity and was electrophoretically homogeneous. The minor activity peak (A) was about 95% pure. Isoelectric focusing analysis showed that B was greater than 95% pure with respect to other peroxidase isozymes, while the enzyme in A was about 90% isozymically pure. Each isoperoxidase displayed a molecular mass of 56 kilodaltons by interpolation from denaturing gel electrophoresis. The B isozyme displayed a molecular mass of 55 kilodaltons by gel filtration chromatography. The pH optima for the cotton ovule isoperoxidases were similar, 5.0 for isozyme A and 6.0 for isozyme B. The isoelectric points for isozymes A and B were 4.2 and 4.4, respectively. Eugenol, guaiacol, and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine were good electron donor substrates, whereas 4-aminoantipyrine was a poor substrate. The absorption spectrum of the material in B revealed a major peak at 400 nanometers and a minor peak at 280 nanometers. The molar extinction coefficient at 400 nanometers (pH 7.0) was calculated to be 1.07 X 10(5) per square centimeter per mole. Amino acid analysis of isozyme B confirmed the acidic nature of this protein and identified a number of similarities to the anionic peroxidases from tobacco and potato. This glycoprotein was found to contain 12 to 14% sugar (by weight), mainly in the form of galactose and mannose. 3aovule culture 3aprotein content 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aperoxidases 3aamino acids 3aenzyme activity 3aisozymes 3aAspergillus flavus 0apurification 0aprotein composition0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.14-20x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03154naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245020100147300001300348300001800361500001500379520206400394650001902458650002202477650002002499650001102519650002002530650002002550650001802570653001702588700001602605700001702621700001602638773007102654852000902725939003302734946001302767655001202780IND9100997120221123031903.0910226e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910099712DNAL7 a166679822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAskerlund, P.10aNADH-ferricyanide reductase of leaf plasma membranes. Partial purification and immunological relation to potato tuber microsomal NADH-ferricyanide reductase and spinach leaf NADH-nitrate reductase  ap. 6-13.  ap. 6-13. ill.  a2019-12-05  aPlasma membranes obtained by two-phase partitioning of microsomal fractions from spinach (Spinacea oleracea L. cv Medania) and sugar beet leaves (Beta vulgaris L.) contained relatively high NADH-ferricyanide reductase and NADH-nitrate reductase (NR; EC 1.6.6.1) activities. Both of these activities were latent. To investigate whether these activities were due to the same enzyme, plasma membrane polypeptides were separated with SDS-PAGE and analyzed with immunoblotting methods. Antibodies raised against microsomal NADH-ferricyanide reductase (tentatively identified as NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, EC 1.6.2.2), purified from potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Bintje) tuber microsomes, displayed one single band at 43 kilodaltons when reacted with spinach plasma membranes, whereas IgG produced against NR from spinach leaves gave a major band at 110 kilodaltons together with a few fainter bands of lower molecular mass. Immunoblotting analysis using inside-out and right-side-out plasma membrane vesicles strongly indicated that NR was not an integral protein but probably trapped inside the plasma membrane vesicles during homogenization. Proteins from spinach plasma membranes were solubilized with the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio] 1-propanesulfonate and separated on a Mono Q anion exchange column at pH 5.6 with fast protein liquid chromatography. One major peak of NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity was found after separation. The peak fraction was enriched about 70-fold in this activity compared to the plasma membrane. When the peak fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE the NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity strongly correlated with a 43 kilodalton polypeptide which reacted with the antibodies against potato microsomal NADH-ferricyanide reductase. Thus, our data indicate that most, if not all, of the truly membrane-bound NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity of leaf plasma membranes is due to an enzyme very similar to potato tuber microsomal NADH-ferricyanide reductase (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase). 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aoxidoreductases 3aleaves 3aplasma membrane 3aenzyme activity 3aBeta vulgaris 0apurification1 aLaurent, P.1 aNakagawa, H.1 aKader, J.C.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.6-13x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01189naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001800117245002300135300001500158520051000173650001600683650002200699650001300721650001500734653002300749653002400772773006500796852000900861939003300870945000800903655001200911991572991410742620221123021028.0781001e197805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894836152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKittrell, Ed.14aThe electronic fix  ap. 20- 36.  aA provocative essay explores issues and effects relating to children's television viewing.

Two estrogenic actions, initiation of implantation and maintenance of pregnancy, were examined in progesterone-primed, delayed-implanting, hypophysectomized rats exposed to several polychlorinated hydrocarbons. The insecticide P,P'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was nearly devoid of estrogenic activity for initiating implantation, as was a dichloro analog, 1,1-dichloro-2-[p-chlorophenyl],2-[o-chlorophenyl]ethane (O,P'-DDD), but another such analog, 1,1-dichloro-2-(p-chlorophenyl), 2-(o-chlorophenyl)ethylene (O,P'-DDE), was nearly as estrogenic as the O,P'- DDT isomer of DDT and the methoxylated analog methoxychlor. The latter three compounds not only initiated implantation, but maintained pregnancy when given in large (200 mg/kg) and repeated doses. Another insecticide, chlordecone (Kepone) was more estrogenic than any of the DDT analogs and maintained pregnancy with a single dose of 50 mg/kg. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a toxic contaminant of herbicide production, did not induce implantation at a dose of 125 microgram/kg, but inhibited the implantation initiated by estrone in 35% of the animals. The mechanism of this antiestrogenicity is unknown but most probably does not involve direct action via the classical estrogen receptor. The possible interference with the normal blastocyst-uterine interactions of these polychlorinated xenobiotics may be an important factor in their being considered reproductive toxins. 3amethoxychlor 3achlordecone 3atoxicity 3aestrogenic properties 3aembryo implantation 3apregnancy 3ahypophysectomy 3arats 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aDDD (pesticide) 3aDDE (pesticide) 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 0aanalogs 0aantiestrogens 0areproductive toxins1 aSen, M.1 aDey, S.K.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1992 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.42-48x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02560naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245006900122300001600191500002400207500001500231520111200246650001201358650001201370650001801382650002401400650001301424650001201437650002401449650002301473650002101496650001301517650001801530650002301548650002101571650002701592650001801619650001101637653002501648653002001673653001601693653003101709653002101740700001501761773012301776852000901899856007701908930003301985945001302018946001102031655001202042IND2329400920221123021008.0021021e200203  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232940092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, G.10aDirect plant regeneration from leaf explants of Plumbago species  ap. 311-314.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDirect plant regeneration was achieved from leaf explants of Plumbago rosea and Plumbago zeylanica on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6.7 micromolar 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), 1.4 micromolar indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 370 micromolar adenine sulfate (Ads) and 3% (w/v) sucrose. The shoot initials developed within 2-3 weeks on the leaf margin as well as from the cut surface of the leaf. High frequency shoot-bud regeneration was achieved on similar medium in subsequent subcultures. The semi-mature leaves produced more shoot-buds as compared to the younger leaves. Mature leaves did not show any response for shoot bud initiation. More than 85% of the semi-mature explants produced shoot-buds per leaf explant within 4 weeks of culture. Shoots rooted on half-strength basal MS medium supplemented with 1.2 micromolar indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 2% (w/v) sucrose; approximately 90% of the in vitro raised plantlets survived in the greenhouse. The regenerated plantlets looked morphologically similar to the mother plants.

PBCp (Solanum phureja Juz. & Buk. genotype 1-3 x CP2) and CBC (CP2 x S. chacoense Bitt. genotype 80-1) resulted from a cross between CP2 (intermediate ACR) and its parents, S. chacoense 80-1 (low ACR) and S. phureja 1-3 (high ACR). Three components of ACR were initially investigated: embryos per anther (EPA), embryo regeneration rate and percent monoploids (2n=1x=12) among regenerants. EPA was selected for further characterization because of its relative stability. In a series of studies of EPA on a total of 44 genotypes within CBC, nine high (mean EPA=2.5) and ten low (mean EPA=0.02) selections were made. In PBCp, ten high (mean EPA= 4.7) and ten low (mean EPA=0.05) selections were made from 67 genotypes. High and low selections were used for bulk segregant analysis to screen 214 RAPD primers as candidate markers linked to EPA. Bands amplified by OPQ-10 and OPZ-4 were associated in coupling and repulsion, respectively, to ACR in PBCp. A band amplified by OPW-14 primer was associated in coupling to ACR in CBC. One-way ANOVAs using presence/absence of each candidate band to classify additional genotypes in each population verified association of the markers with EPA. 3abackcrossing 3aanther culture 3aplant breeding 3ahybrids 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3adiploidy 3aembryo (plant) 3aSolanum chacoense 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aculture media 3aSolanum tuberosum subsp. andigenum 0asegregation 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0aSolanum phureja1 aVeilleux, R.E.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2002 Mar., v. 68, no. 3 p.277-286dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02776naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013300125300001600258500002400274520122000298650002001518650002801538650000801566650001401574650002101588650001401609650002601623650001701649650002501666650001801691650001501709650001201724650001801736650003601754653001501790653001601805653001801821653002901839653002401868653001601892700001301908700001601921700002501937700001801962773012301980852000902103856007702112930003302189945001302222946001102235655001202246IND2329400620221123003635.0021021e200203  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232940062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucumi, E.10aAlkaloid formation in cell suspension cultures of Tabernaemontana elegans after feeding of tryptamine and loganin or secologanin  ap. 293-299.  aIncludes references  aA cell suspension culture of Tabernaemontana elegans lost its ability to produce alkaloids after a prolonged period of subculture. To determine whether it was still capable of performing the later steps of the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway, the culture was fed with tryptamine and loganin. The precursors and alkaloids were determined in the biomass and in the medium during a growth cycle. In this culture, an increase in the amount of serotonin was found in the biomass after feeding of tryptamine and loganin. Secologanin was detected in small amounts but strictosidine was not. Therefore, a limitation in alkaloid formation in this T. elegans cell line occured in the formation of secologanin from loganin. After feeding of secologanin alone, strictosidine, 10-hydroxy strictosidine, strictosidinic acid and two other indole alkaloids, as yet unidentified, were formed. However, the alkaloids originally produced by this cell line were not found. As the biosynthesis is impaired at several steps, it seems that the loss of productivity is more likely to be to a change on the level of the regulation of the pathway, than due to the loss of the capacity to express an individual biosynthetic gene of the pathway. 3aTabernaemontana 3acell suspension culture 3aage 3aviability 3aindole alkaloids 3aserotonin 3aquantitative analysis 3abiosynthesis 3abiochemical pathways 3aculture media 3atryptamine 3aloganin 3adose response 3achemical constituents of plants 0aprecursors 0asecologanin 0astrictosidine 0a10-hydroxy strictosidine 0astrictosidinic acid 0aculture age1 aVera, A.1 aHallard, D.1 aHeijden, R. van der.1 aVerpoorte, R.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2002 Mar., v. 68, no. 3 p.293-299dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02535naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002200163245017100185300001600356300002100372500001500393520139300408650004301801650002201844650001801866650002001884650002501904650001101929650002001940653002101960653001701981700002201998773007402020852000902094930003302103946001302136655001202149IND8902401920221123003636.0890517e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890240192DNAL7 a166666462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fulvia fulva [Cooke] Cif) results in a marked accumulation of several pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins in the apoplast. Two predominant PR proteins were purified from apoplastic fluid by ion exchange chromatography followed by chromatofocusing. One protein (molecular mass [Mr] 35 kilodaltons [kD] isoelectric point ł approximately 6.4) showed 1,3-beta glucanase activity, while the other one (Mr26 kD, pl approximately 6.1) showed chitinase activity. Identification of the products that were released upon incubation of the purified enzymes with laminarin or regenerated chitin revealed that both enzymes showed endo-activity. Using antisera raised against these purified enzymes from tomato and against chitinases and 1,3-beta-glucanase isolated from other plant species, one additional 1,3-beta-glucanase (Mr33 kD) and three additional chitinases (Mr 27, 30, and 32 kD) could be detected in apoplastic fluids or homogenates of tomato leaves inoculated with C. fulvum. Upon inoculation with C. fulvum, chitinase and 1,3-beta-glucanase activity in apoplastic fluids increased more rapidly in incompatible interactions than in compatible ones. The role of these hydrolytic enzymes, potentially capable of degrading hyphal walls of C. fulvum, is discussed in relation to active plant defense. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aprotein synthesis 3apathogenicity 3aenzyme activity 3apurification methods 3aleaves 3aPassalora fulva 0aprotein analysis 0aFulvia fulva1 aWit, P.J.G.M. de.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.945-951x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a20140520b20140606c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02630naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002400142245013700166300001800303500001500321520127700336650001201613650001801625650001901643650000901662650001301671650001501684650001701699650002501716650001101741650003001752650000701782650001701789650001101806650001401817653001701831700002701848700002001875700002101895700002201916700002401938773009601962852000902058856008202067946001102149655001202160IND4445656520221122232121.0101126e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444565652DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2010004242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStockton, Amanda M.10aAnalysis of carbonaceous biomarkers with the Mars Organic Analyzer microchip capillary electrophoresis system: Aldehydes and ketones  ap. 3642-3649.  a2019-12-04  aA microchip CE method is developed for the analysis of two oxidized forms of carbon, aldehydes and ketones, with the Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA). Fluorescent derivitization is achieved in ∼15 min by hydrazone formation with Cascade Blue hydrazide in 30 mM borate pH 5-6. The microchip CE separation and analysis method is optimized via separation in 30 mM borate buffer, pH 9.5, at 20°C. A carbonyl standard consisting of ten aldehydes and ketones found in extraterrestrial matter is successfully separated; the resulting LOD depends on the reactivity of the compound and range from 70 pM for formaldehyde to 2 μM for benzophenone. To explore the utility of this method for analyzing complex samples, analyses of several fermented beverages are conducted, identifying ten aldehydes and ketones ranging from 30 nM to 5 mM. A Martian regolith simulant sample, consisting of a basalt matrix spiked with soluble ions and acetone, is designed and analyzed, but acetone is found to have a limited detectable lifetime under simulant Martian conditions. This work establishes the capability of the MOA for studying aldehydes and ketones, a critical class of oxidized organic molecules of interest in planetary and in terrestrial environmental and health studies. 3aacetone 3abenzophenones 3aderivatization 3aions 3aregolith 3abiomarkers 3afluorescence 3aenvironmental health 3acarbon 3acapillary electrophoresis 3apH 3aformaldehyde 3abasalt 3abeverages 0abenzophenone1 aTjin, Caroline Chandra1 aHuang, Grace L.1 aBenhabib, Merwan1 aChiesl, Thomas N.1 aMathies, Richard A.0 tElectrophoresis.g2010 Nov., v. 31, no. 22 p.3642-3649dWiley‐VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2010004243Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01065naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245006200130300001300192520014000205650002000345650001800365650002300383650002100406650002300427650001600450650001900466650002700485650001200512650002000524650002500544773008300569852000900652939003300661945000800694946001300702655001200715991572988420742620221122222212.0911024e199004  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910031162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHavala, S.10aMom was right: research shows vegetables are good for you  ap. 1, 6.  aThis article discusses the differences in various types of vegetarian diets as well as the health and nutrition benefits and drawbacks. 3avegetarian diet 3aeating habits 3anutrition research 3ahealth promotion 3adisease prevention 3afood intake 3aprotein intake 3airon deficiency anemia 3acalcium 3achild nutrition 3anutritional adequacy0 tEnvironmental nutrition.g1990 Apr., v. 13, no. 4 p.1, 6-1, 6x0893-44527nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle00993naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001300115245004500128300001000173520020500183650002000388650001700408650002000425650001900445650001900464650000900483650001500492650001100507653001000518773007600528852000900604939003300613945000800646946001300654655001200667991572988280742620221122222137.0911024e199005  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910031142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelm, J.10aAisle-by-aisle advice for shopping smart  ap. 2.  aSome shopping tips for grocery buyers are; make a list before going to the store and read package labels to compare choices.

Separation is accomplished using a microdevice based on direct current insulator gradient dielectrophoresis that can isolate and concentrate multiple analytes simultaneously at different positions. The device is dependent upon dielectrophoretic and electrokinetic forces incorporating a global longitudinal direct current field as well as using shaped insulating features within the channel to induce local gradients. This design allows for the production of strong local field gradients along a global field causing particles to enter, initially transported through the channel by electrophoresis and electroosmosis (electrokinetics), and to be isolated via repulsive dielectrophoretic forces that are proportional to an exponent of the field gradient. Sulfate‐capped polystyrene nano and microparticles (20, 200 nm, and 1 μm) were used as probes to demonstrate the influence of channel geometry and applied longitudinal field on separation behavior. These results are consistent with models using similar channel geometry and indicate that specific particulate species can be isolated within a distinct portion of the device, whereas concentrating particles by factors from 10³ to 10⁶. 3acapacitance 3adielectrophoresis 3aelectrophoresis 3amodels 3aphysical properties 3apolystyrenes1 aChen, Kang Ping1 aTaylor, Thomas J.1 aPacheco, Jose Rafael1 aHayes, Mark A.0 tElectrophoresis.g2010 Nov., v. 31, no. 22 p.3634-3641dWiley‐VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2010004383Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01031naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004700133300001000180520028400190650002000474650001100494650001600505650002400521650001800545650001300563653001300576773007700589852000900666939003300675945000800708946001300716655001200729991572987330742620221122161407.0911024e199003  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910031212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendoza, T.G.10aCrackers: not all they're cracked up to be  ap. 4.  aCrackers have been attracting attention as nutritional concerns prompted manufacturers to modify recipes.

Repeated measurements of the same population of 15 stomates show much lower variability than measurements of different populations either on the same peel or on different peels. 3aVicia faba 3astomata 3aplant morphology 3ameasurement 3alaboratory techniques 0aepidermis1 aWilliams, W.E.1 aBinns, M.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.387-390x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03455naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002400160245009400184300001800278500002400296520175100320650001102071650001302082650002002095650001802115650001002133650001502143650001502158650001202173650000902185650002302194650001502217650001002232650001002242650002902252650001802281650002302299650002702322650001102349650000902360650001602369650001102385650001102396650000902407650001202416650002302428651001902451651001902470700002502489700002002514700002302534700002202557700002302579700002402602773011302626852000902739856008102748655001202829IND4458322920221122161413.0110520e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445832292DNAL7 a215252572pmid7 a10.3945/jn.110.1359882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFram, Maryah Stella10aChildren Are Aware of Food Insecurity and Take Responsibility for Managing Food Resources  ap. 1114-1119.  aIncludes references  aChild food insecurity is measured using parental reports of children's experiences based on an adult-generated conceptualization. Research on other child experiences (e.g. pain, exposure to domestic violence) cautions that children generally best report their own experiences, and parents' reports of children's experiences may lack adequate validity and impede effective intervention. Because this may be true of child food insecurity, we conducted semistructured interviews with mothers, children (age 9-16 y), and other household adults in 26 South Carolina families at risk for food insecurity. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a constant comparative process combining a priori with inductive coding. Child interviews revealed experiences of food insecurity distinct from parent experiences and from parent reports of children's experiences. Children experienced cognitive, emotional, and physical awareness of food insecurity. Children took responsibility for managing food resources through participation in parental strategies, initiation of their own strategies, and generation of resources to provide food for the family. Adults were not always aware of children's experiences. Where adult experiences of food insecurity are conditioned on inadequate money for food, child experiences were grounded in the immediate household social and food environment: quality of child/parent interactions, parent affect and behavior, and types and quantities of foods made available for children to eat. The new, child-derived understanding of what children experience that results from this study provides a critical basis from which to build effective approaches to identify, assess, and respond to children suffering from food insecurity. 3aadults 3achildren 3afamily violence 3afood security 3afoods 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3amothers 3arisk 3asocial environment 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aChild Nutrition Sciences 2aCommunication 2aFamilyxpsychology 2aFamily Characteristics 2aFemale 2aFood 2aFood Supply 2aHumans 2aHunger 2aMale 2aPoverty 2aSocial Environment 3aSouth Carolina 0aSouth Carolina1 aFrongillo, Edward A.1 aJones, Sonya J.1 aWilliams, Roger C.1 aBurke, Michael P.1 aDeLoach, Kendra P.1 aBlake, Christine E.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2011 June, v. 141, no. 6 p.1114-1119dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.110.1359883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle00922naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245001400132300001400146300001900160520024000179650001600419650001800435650001400453650001600467700001700483773007100500852000900571939003300580945000800613946001100621655001200632991572986220742620221122124357.0820817e198205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820010402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnes, P.J.10aRancidity  ap. 16-18.  ap. 16-18. ill.  aCauses, methods of measurement, and ways of preventing rancidity in foods are detailed.

Primary foliage leaves of seedlings given continuous illumination from 2 days post-imbibition reached a final mean length of 15 centimeters at 6.5 days, whereas primary leaves of dark-grown seedlings required 7 days to reach a similar length. Dividing cells were observed in the basal 0.5 to 1 centimeter of primary leaves until 5.5 days post-imbibition. Plastids isolated form cells located in the basal meristem of 4-day-old seedlings were small (approximately 2 micrometers in diameter), exhibited low transcription activity and contained approximately 130 copies of plastid DNA per organelle. Cell size increased from 18 to 60 micrometers in a 1 to 3 centimeter region located adjacent to the leaf basal meristem. In this region, transcriptional activity per plastid increased 10-fold and DNA copy number increased from 130 to 210. Plastid trancriptional activity declined rapidly in illuminated plants with increasing leaf cell age and plastid DNA copy number also declined but with a slower time course. In dark-grown seedlings plastid transcriptional activity declined more slowly than in illuminated plants while DNA copy number remained constant with increasing cell age. These data show that plastid transcriptional activity and DNA copy number increase early in chloroplast development and that transcriptional activity per DNA template varies up to 5-fold during barley leaf biogenesis. 3aplant development 3aHordeum vulgare 3aseedlings 3aDNA 3alight 3achloroplasts 0areplication 0agrowth rate 0aplastids 0alight relations1 aRapp, J.C.1 aMullet, J.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.1011-1018x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02071naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008900128300001800217520113700235650002001372650001001392650002001402650002001422650000901442650002601451650001301477650001801490650002001508650002001528700002501548700001701573773007601590852000901666939003301675946001301708655001201721IND9104671420221122124332.0911119e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910467142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcantara, E.10aPlasmalemma redox activity and H+ extrusion in roots of Fe-deficient cucumber plants  ap. 1034-1037.  aCucumber plants (Cucumis sativus L.) with incipient Fe deficiency showed increased root capacity to reduce chelated Fe3+ compared to Fe-sufficient plants. When Fe-ethylenediaminetetraacetate was added to the root medium of the Fe-deficient plants, the reductase activity was associated with acidification of the medium and an increase in the net apparent K+ efflux. In the presence of the H+-ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide the net apparent H+ efflux was completely suppressed, though some reductase activity was preserved, and the net apparent K+ efflux was significantly increased. The inhibition of the reductase activity by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was similar whether the pH of the medium was buffered or not. Anoxia and the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone also caused a similar inhibition of the reductase activity. It is proposed that this redox system transports electrons only and that its activity is inhibited by plasmamembrane depolarization and anoxia. The H+ and K+ efflux associated with the reductase activity may be a result of the plasmamembrane depolarization it causes. 3aCucumis sativus 3aroots 3aoxidoreductases 3aenzyme activity 3airon 3anutrient deficiencies 3ahydrogen 3aion transport 3aplasma membrane 3aredox reactions1 aGuardia, M.D. de la.1 aRomera, F.J.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Aug., v. 96, no. 4 p.1034-1037x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01699naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099040001800116100002400134245005400158300001600212520049900228650001300727650002100740650001700761650001400778650001500792650002300807650001500830650005700845650001100902650001100913650006300924650002000987650002201007650001401029650002501043653002801068700001701096700002201113773008001135852000901215939003301224945000801257655001201265991572984880742620221122094212.0780501e19771115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894823022DNAL7 a9207702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeinfeld, Robert H.10aPregnancy associated with anorexia and starvation  ap. 698-699.  aA case history of a patient is summarized and assessed.

However, due to previously unrecognized problems associated with the derivatization of agmatine, this important intermediate in plant polyamine metabolism cannot be quantitated using this method. Also, two polyamines, putrescine and diaminopropane, also are not well resolved using this method. A simple modification of the original HPLC procedure greatly improves the separation and quantitation of these amines, and further allows the simulation analysis of phenethylamine and tyramine, which are major monoamine constituents of tobacco and other plant tissues . We have used this modified HPLC method to characterize amine titers in suspension cultured carrot (Daucus carota L.) cells and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) leaf tissues. 3apolyamines 3alaboratory techniques 3amonoamines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aNicotiana tabacum 3achemical constituents of plants 0aliquid chromatography1 aFlores, H.E.1 aGalston, A.W.1 aWeinstein, L.H.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.512-517x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03094naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245016200160300001800322520177100340650002302111650001702134650002002151650001102171650001502182650002202197650001202219650001402231650001302245650001302258650001602271650001502287700001902302700001802321700002402339700002602363700001902389700002002408700002202428773009602450852000902546856008202555946001102637655001202648IND4445657820221122094209.0101126e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444565782DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2010003732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordman, Nina10aFeasibility of SU‐8‐based capillary electrophoresis‐electrospray ionization mass spectrometry microfluidic chips for the analysis of human cell lysates  ap. 3745-3753.  aMonolithically integrated, polymer (SU‐8) microchips comprising an electrophoretic separation unit, a sheath flow interface and an ESI emitter were developed to improve the speed and throughput of proteomics analyses. Validation of the microchip method was performed based on peptide mass fingerprinting and single peptide sequencing of selected protein standards. Rapid, yet reliable identification of four biologically important proteins (cytochrome C, β‐lactoglobulin, ovalbumin and BSA) confirmed the applicability of the SU‐8 microchips to ambitious proteomic applications and allowed their use in the analysis of human muscle cell lysates. The characteristic tryptic peptides were easily separated with plate numbers approaching 10⁶, and with peak widths at half height as low as 0.6 s. The on‐chip sheath flow interface was also exploited to the introduction of an internal mass calibrant along with the sheath liquid which enabled accurate mass measurements by high‐resolution Q‐TOF MS. Additionally, peptide structural characterization and protein identification based on MS/MS fragmentation data of a single tryptic peptide was obtained using an ion trap instrument. Protein sequence coverages exceeding 50% were routinely obtained without any pretreatment of the proteolytic samples and a typical total analysis time from sampling to detection was well below ten minutes. In conclusion, monolithically integrated, dead‐volume‐free, SU‐8 microchips proved to be a promising platform for fast and reliable analysis of complex proteomic samples. Good analytical performance of the microchips was shown by performing both peptide mass fingerprinting of complex cell lysates and protein identification based on single peptide sequencing. 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acytochrome c 3aelectrophoresis 3ahumans 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amuscles 3aovalbumin 3apeptides 3apolymers 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics1 aSikanen, Tiina1 aAura, Susanna1 aTuomikoski, Santeri1 aVuorensola, Katariina1 aKotiaho, Tapio1 aFranssila, Sami1 aKostiainen, Risto0 tElectrophoresis.g2010 Nov., v. 31, no. 22 p.3745-3753dWiley‐VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2010003733Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02167naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245008700146300001600233300002100249500001500270520118200285650001301467650002201480650001601502650001701518650002301535650001701558650002001575650002201595650001501617653001501632700001701647773007401664852000901738939003301747946001301780655001201793IND8903101320221122094259.0890616e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890310132DNAL7 a166665832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristou, P.10aCytokinin antagonist activity of substituted phenethylamines in plant cell culture  ap. 564-568.  ap. 564-568. ill.  a2019-12-05  aA series of structurally related substituted phenethylamines shows extreme toxicity toward wild-type callus tissue cultures of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), soybean (Glycine max), corn (Zea mays), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), but tobacco crown gall cultures are resistant to the compounds. The essential components that result in toxicity of the phenethylamines include one aromatic hydroxyl and one primary aliphatic amino group. A series of attenuated crown gall cultures, generated by transformation of tobacco with various modified Agrobacterium strains, has been used to demonstrate that the resistance of crown galls to the phenethylamines is due to the expression in these tissues of isopentenyl transferase, a first step in cytokinin biosynthesis. The toxicity of the compounds to tissue cultures is very rapid, but can be overcome by prior exposure of the calli to exogenous cytokinin. Because of the relationships we have observed between cytokinins and these compounds, we propose that the substituted phenethylamines may represent a class of chemicals that can be used as specific probes to further an understanding of cytokinin metabolism in plant tissues. 3aZea mays 3aHelianthus annuus 3aGlycine max 3abiosynthesis 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acell culture 3aphenethylamines 3aNicotiana tabacum 3acytokinins 0ametabolism1 aBarton, K.A.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.564-568x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01329naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245008200146300001600228300002100244500001500265520036600280650002000646650002000666650002400686650001900710650002100729650001700750653001100767653002400778700001700802700001900819773007400838852000900912939003300921946001300954655001200967IND8903100920221122070132.0890616e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890310092DNAL7 a166665792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrof, C.P.L.10aEffect of sodium nutrition on the ultrastructure of chloroplasts of C4 plants  ap. 539-543.  ap. 539-543. ill.  a2019-12-05  aMesophyll chloroplasts from sodium-deficient compared to normal plants of the C4 species Kochia childsii and Amaranthus tricolor were found to have significantly less stacking in their grana.

Mitochondria isolated after all four heat shock treatments were active in O2 consumption at 28 degrees C in response to succinate and ADP (derived P/O ratios were 1.6, 1.7, 1.3, and 1.3, respectively.) The mitochondria from all four treatments were also active in O2 uptake at 42.5 degrees C. However, only mitochondria isolated after treatment (C) were tightly coupling at 42.5 degrees C (derived ADP/O ratio was about 1.4). Combined with our earlier findings on the subcellular localization of heat shock proteins, our present data demonstrate that association of heat shock proteins with mitochondria by treatment (C) enables them to phosphorylate at 42.5 degrees C (i.e. they become thermotolerant). Isolated mitochondria from treatment (C) and treatment (A) were compared by electron microscopy. They appeared to be very similar and no significant ultrastructural differences were noted. 3aGlycine max 3aseeds 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3amitochondria 3aprotein synthesis 3astress response1 aChen, Y.M.1 aLin, C.Y.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.617-621x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02705naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245007500149300001600224300002100240500001500261520178000276650002102056650002202077650001902099650002202118650001602140653002202156700001602178700001902194700001302213773007402226852000902300939003302309946001302342655001202355IND8903101420221122070300.0890616e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890310142DNAL7 a166665842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbernethy, R.H.10aThermotolerance is developmentally dependent in germinating wheat seed  ap. 569-576.  ap. 569-576. ill.  a2019-12-05  aDuring the initial 9 to 12 hours of imbibition, the imbibing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seed was found to exhibit substantial tolerance to high temperature relative to later times of imbibition. Tolerance was assessed by seed viability and seedling growth. This initial high temperature tolerance gradually declines with increasing time of seed imbibition. A range of 2 hour heat pretreatments (38-42 degrees C) prior to imposition of a 2 hour heat shock (51-53 degrees C) during this same 9 to 12 hour interval was unable to increase survival or seedling growth over that of seed that did not receive a pretreatment. However, after 9 to 12 hours of imbibition the pretreatment provided both increased survival and increased seedling growth, measured 120 hours later, i.e., classical thermotolerance could be acquired. This response is called a 'thermotolerance transition.' Isolated embryos responded in a similar manner using a 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay for viability determination following heat treatments. The high temperature tolerance during early imbibition indicates that the thermotolerance transition involves the loss of an existing thermotolerance coincident with acquiring the ability to become thermotolerant following heat pretreatment. Despite the inability to acquire thermotolerance, heat shock protein synthesis was induced by heat shock immediately upon imbibition of wheat seed or isolated embryos. Developmentally regulated heat shock proteins of 58 to 60, 46, 40, and 14 kilodaltons were detected at 1.5 hours of imbibition following heat shock, but were absent or greatly reduced by 12 hours. Constitutive synthesis of 70 and 90 kilodalton hsp groups appeared to be greater at 1.5 hours of imbibition than at 12 hours of imbibition. 3aseed germination 3aprotein synthesis 3aheat tolerance 3aTriticum aestivum 3atemperature 0aplant development1 aThiel, D.S.1 aPetersen, N.S.1 aHelm, K.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.569-576x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle00903naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245005300134300001200187500001500199520010000214650002400314650001800338650002100356650001800377650002400395650002300419653002400442653001600466773007700482939003300559852000900592655001200601991572977250742620221121230138.0911024e199108  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910031062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroihier, C.A.10aVitamin health claims: the truth behind the hype  ap. 1-7.  a2019-12-04  aThis article discusses the controversy concerning the need for vitamin and mineral supplements. 3aconsumer protection 3ahealth claims 3ahealth promotion 3afood industry 3avitamin supplements 3anutrition labeling 0afood misinformation 0aadvertising0 tEnvironmental nutrition.g1991 Aug., v. 14, no. 8 p.1-7x0893-44527nnas  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aDNAL 7aarticle00981naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245005000132300001000182520020800192650001900400650001600419650001600435650001100451650002100462650002000483650002400503653001300527653002000540773007700560939003300637852000900670655001200679991572976950742620221121230018.0911024e199108  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910031082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntinoro, L.10aSay buon giorno to convenience, Italian-style  ap. 4.  aThe nutritive value of convenience frozen Italian foods is discussed.

This demonstrates that the pancreatic secretion is stimulated by dietary protein with a pancreatic protease-independent pathway. To examine the chemical structure of casein responsible for the enhancement of pancreatic secretion, we prepared chemically modified casein in which lysine residues were guanidinated. Secretion of protein, amylase, and chymotrypsin in the chronic BPJ-diverted rat was increased much more after the rats were fed a diet containing guanidinated casein (250 g/kg diet) than after they were fed a diet containing intact casein (250 g/kg diet). In normal rats whose diverted BPJ was returned to the duodenum, the increases in the pancreatic secretion after consuming the guanidinated casein diet were comparable to those after consuming the intact casein diet. In vitro digestibility of guanidinated casein by trypsin and chymotrypsin was much lower than that of intact casein. Also, guanidinated casein inhibited tryptic hydrolysis of benzoyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide to a lesser extent than did intact casein as determined by an in vitro assay. These results demonstrate that guanidinated casein is less sensitive to trypsin than is intact casein and that the structure that is sensitive to trypsin is not involved in the stimulation of pancreatic secretion in diverted rats. The results evidence that masking luminal trypsin activity does not predominantly contribute to the enhancement of pancreatic secretion in 7-day BPJ diverted rats. Also, In normal rats, the luminal protease-independent mechanism may play a role partly in increasing the pancreatic secretion by dietary protein. 3apancreas 3atrypsin 3alysine 3ain vitro digestibility 3asecretion 3achemical reactions 3acasein 3arats 3achemical structure 2aAmylasesxsecretion. 2aAnimals 2aBenzoylarginine Nitroanilidexmetabolism 2aBile 2aCaseinsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aChymotrypsinxsecretion. 2aGuanidinesxchemistry 2aHomoargininexchemistry 2aHydrolysisxdrug effects 2aLysinexchemistry 2aMale 2aPancreasxdrug effectsxsecretion. 2aPancreatic Juice 2aProteinsxsecretion. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTrypsinxmetabolism 2aTrypsin Inhibitorsxpharmacology 0adietary protein 0aguanidination1 aNishi, T.1 aKasai, T.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1995 Dec., v. 210, no. 3 p.278-284x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02363naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002800115245012100143300001600264520123800280650001401518650002201532650001301554650001601567650001401583650001001597650002001607650001301627650001401640650002301654650002601677651001001703653001501713700001901728700001501747700001301762700001801775773008501793852000901878939003301887945000801920946001301928655001201941991572975290742620221121004350.0911018e199109  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910030912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Manzanares, E.10aRelationship between classical indicators and several pathogenic microorganisms involved in shellfish-borne diseases  ap. 711-717.  aQuantitative relationships between classical indicators and the main pathogenic microorganisms involved in shellfish-borne diseases were established from shellfish samples (cockles, Cardium edule and striped venus, Chamelea gallina) collected from five sampling stations located at different depths in the estuary of Guadalhorce river (Malaga, Spain). F-ANOVA analyses applied to the variables: seasons, depth, and sampling stations, showed that a significant relationship could be established only between the season of the year and the concentrations of total anaerobic bacteria, coliphage, and Aeromonas hydrophila. Classical indicators present no significant correlation with the pathogenic microorganisms in shellfish samples, which questions the existence of a universal indicator of shellfish hygiene. However, from the lineal correlations between detection percentages of pathogens and the medians of the lognormal distribution (XX50) of the indicators, it can be deduced that the use of three indicators, Escherichia coli, fecal streptococci, or coliphages, is valid to establish the potential health hazard associated with the presence of Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Staphylococcus aureus in shellfish samples. 3ashellfish 3afoodborne illness 3asampling 3aplate count 3aestuaries 3adepth 3afood sanitation 3abacteria 3apathogens 3aseasonal variation 3aquantitative analysis 3aSpain 0aindicators1 aMorinigo, M.A.1 aCornax, R.1 aEgea, F.1 aBorrego, J.J.0 tJournal of food protection.g1991 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.711-717x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01663naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245008800146300001600234300002100250500001500271520081600286650003601102650002001138650001001158653001701168653001901185700001601204773007401220852000901294939003301303946001301336655001201349IND8903103320221121004441.0890620e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890310332DNAL7 a166666022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoriyasu, Y.10aPartial purification and characterization of Aminopeptidase II from Chara australis  ap. 687-691.  ap. 687-691. ill.  a2019-12-05  aAminopeptidase II, one of the two major aminopeptidases in the giant alga Chara australis, was partially purified.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that it is composed of a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 85,000. Aminopeptidase II hydrolyzed alanine-2-naphthylamide more efficiently than the naphthylamides of lysine and proline, and only weakly hydrolyzed the naphthylamides of arginine, phenylalanine, valine, and leucine. The optimal pH for the hydrolysis of alanine-2-naphthylamide was near 7.0. The activity of aminopeptidase II was inhibited by the SH-reagents p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and N-ethylmaleimide and by the metal chelator 1,10-phenanthroline. 3achemical constituents of plants 3aenzyme activity 3aChara 0apurification 0aaminopeptidase1 aMiyoshi, Y.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.687-691x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02004naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010900126300001600235300002100251520097200272650002201244650002801266650001401294650001301308650001801321650002701339650001501366650002001381650001901401650002601420700001801446700001801464700001901482773007401501852000901575939003301584946001301617655001201630IND9006157020221121004446.0901213e199010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900615702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReuveni, M.10aEnhanced H+ transport capacity and ATP hydrolysis activity of tonoplast H+ -ATPase after NaCl adaptation  ap. 524-530.  ap. 524-530. ill.  aTonoplast enriched membrane vesicle fractions were isolated from unadapted and NaCl (428 millimolar) adapted tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum L. var Wisconsin 38).

These antibodies cross-reacted exclusively to a tobacco polypeptide of an apparent molecular weight of 69 kilodaltons. The antibodies inhibited ATP-dependent, NO3(-) sensitive H+ transport into vesicles in tonoplast enriched membrane fractions from both unadapted and NaCl adapted cells. The relative H+ transport capacity per unit of 69 kilodalton subunit of the tonoplast ATPase of vesicles from NaCl adapted cells was fourfold greater than that observed for vesicles from unadapted cells.

Two formulations of CFM, made with 0.3 or 0.7% acetic acid in the aqueous phase, and four formulations of RCM, made with 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, or 0.7% acetic acid in the aqueous phase, were evaluated. The initial pH of the products after equilibration ranged from 3.9 to 4.3, which was adjusted by addition of HCl. Products were inoculated with an eight- or six-strain mixture of Salmonella sp. or L. monocytogenes, respectively, at ca. 10(6) CFU per gram and held at 23.9 degrees C for up to 2 weeks. L. monocytogenes survived longer than Salmonella in equivalent preparations of mayonnaise. No Salmonella (per 100 g) was detected at 48 h in either variety of mayonnaise made with 0.7% acetic acid in the aqueous phase. Salmonella levels in mayonnaise made with lower levels of acetic acid decreased during storage, and at 2 weeks the organism was not detectable in samples containing 0.3% acetic acid in the aqueous phase. No L. monocytogenes (per 100 g) was detected at 14 or 10 d postinoculation in CFM or RCM, respectively, made with 0.7% acetic acid in the aqueous phase. Results indicate these new varieties of mayonnaise, when formulated with 0.7% acetic acid in the aqueous phase, will inactivate >10(7) Salmonella and >10(4) L. monocytogenes per gram within the 72-h holding time required for regular mayonnaise made with unpasteurized eggs. Hence, properly acidified (pH <4.1) reduced-calorie mayonnaise containing 0.7% acetic acid in the aqueous phase is a microbiologically safe product. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3acondiments 3acholesterol 3aacetic acid 3apH 3atemperature 3afood storage 3afood safety 0alow calorie foods1 aDoyle, M.P.0 tJournal of food protection.g1991 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.691-695x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02741naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012300128300001800251300002300269500001500292520177300307650001902080650001502099650002102114650001002135650002602145650001102171653001502182653002302197653002302220700001702243773007602260852000902336939003302345946001302378655001202391IND9002866620221121004814.0900615e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900286662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Veau, E.J.10aGlycolate metabolism in low and high CO2-grown Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Pavlova lutheri as determined by 18O-labeling  ap. 1085-1093.  ap. 1085-1093. ill.  a2019-12-05  aPhotorespiration in Chlorella pyrenoidosa Chick. was assayed by measuring 18O-labeled intermediates of the glycolate pathway. Glycolate, glycine, serine, and excreted glycolate were isolated and analyzed on a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer to determine isotopic enrichment. Rates of glycolate synthesis were determined from 18O-labeling kinetics of the intermediates, pool sizes, derived rate equations, and nonlinear regression techniques. Glycolate synthesis was higher in high CO2-grown cells than in air-grown cells when both were assayed under the same O2 and CO2 concentrations. Synthesis of glycolate, for both types of cells, was stimulated by high O2 levels and inhibited by high CO2 levels. Glycolate synthesis in 1.5% CO2-grown Chlorella, when exposed to a 0.035% CO2 atmosphere, increased from about 41 to 86 nanomoles per milligram chlorophyll per minute when the O2 concentration was increased from 21% to 40%. Glycolate synthesis in air-grown cells increased from 2 to 6 nanomoles per milligram chlorophyll per minute under the same gas levels. Synthesis was undetectable when either the O2 concentration was lowered to 2% or the CO2 concentration was raised to 1.5%. Glycolate excretion was also sensitive to O2 and CO2 concentrations in 1.5% CO2-grown cells and the glycolate that was excreted was 18O-labeled. Air-grown cells did not excrete glycolate under any experimental condition. Indirect evidence indicated that glycolate may be excreted as a lactone in Chlorella. Photorespiratory 18O-labeling kinetics were determined for Pavlova lutheri, which unlike Chlorella and higher plants did not directly synthesize glycine and serine from glycolate. This alga did excrete a significant proportion of newly synthesized glycolate into the media. 3acarbon dioxide 3ametabolism 3aisotope labeling 3aalgae 3aChlorella pyrenoidosa 3aoxygen 0aglycolates 0aalgae and seaweeds 0aglycolate pathways1 aBurris, J.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Nov., v. 91, no. 3 p.1085-1093x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02462naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010800147300001800255520151400273650001601787650001101803650001801814650002001832650001601852650001401868650001801882650001301900650002901913653002301942700001601965773007601981852000902057939003302066946001302099655001202112IND9104674620221120214311.0911121e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910467462DNAL7 a166683252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkubara, P.A.10aIsolation and characterization of three genes negatively regulated by phytochrome action in Lemna gibba  ap. 1237-1245.  aWe have isolated three distinct cDNA clones from Lemna gibba representing mRNAs that increase in abundance during dark treatment. All three mRNAs showed reduced expression in response to red or white light. These mRNAs range from approximately 680 to 800 nucleotides in length and thus encode relatively small proteins (maximum relative molecular weight 17,000 to 19,000). The genes corresponding to these dark-abundant mRNAs are designated NPR (negatively phytochrome regulated) 1, 2, and 3. Differences in the rapidity of mRNA accumulation during dark treatment were observed for each of the genes in both mature green plants and in etiolated plants. Differences in accumulation pattern were also observed in etiolated plants, depending on whether the plants received a far-red light treatment prior to darkness. Transcription of all three genes, assayed in nuclei isolated from either green or etiolated plants, increased during dark treatment. In etiolated plants, a single 2 minute red light treatment caused a detectable decrease in the transcription of the genes after the dark treatment, and 10 minutes of far-red light given immediately after the red light resulted in a reversal of the effect of red light. Additionally, treatment of the plants with far-red light prior to darkness resulted in greater rates of transcription of the NPR genes. Therefore, we conclude that phytochrome action results in decreased transcription of these NPR genes. Each of the NPR mRNAs are encoded by one to two genes. 3aLemna gibba 3aclones 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3aphytochrome 3ared light 3afar-red light 3agenomics 3atranscription (genetics) 0agenetic regulation1 aTobin, E.M.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Aug., v. 96, no. 4 p.1237-1245x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02699naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001700156245016600173300001800339500002400357500001500381520105800396650001501454650002501469650001901494650001901513650001801532650002501550650003001575650001201605650002101617650001901638650004301657650003601700650000901736650001401745650003901759653001701798700001501815700002001830700001801850773012201868852000901990856011101999930003302110945001302143946001302156655001202169IND2329001120221120214200.0020920e200107  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232900112DNAL7 a115040392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL001 0aL8211 aNelson, L.J.10aCorrespondence of soldier defense secretion mixtures with cuticular hydrocarbon phenotypes for chemotaxonomy of the termite genus Reticulitermes in North America  ap. 1449-1479.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSoldier defense secretions from samples of Reticulitermes collected in California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Georgia were characterized and correlated with cuticular hydrocarbon phenotypes. Twenty-seven cuticular hydrocarbon phenotypes have been defined, and soldier defense secretion (SDS) phenotypes have been described for 25 of these. Forty-five terpenoid compounds were found, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and a few diterpenes. The monoterpenes include (-)-alpha-pinene, (-)-beta-pinene, (-)-camphene, myrcene, (Z)- and (E)-ocimene, and (-)-limonene. The major sesquiterpenes produced are (+)-gamma-cadinene, (+)-gamma-cadinene aldehyde, (-)-germacrene A, germacrene B, gamma-himachalene, and beta-bisabolene. Some SDS phenotypes pair with more than one cuticular hydrocarbon phenotype; however, with two exceptions, each hydrocarbon phenotype is associated with only one SDS phenotype. These chemical characterizations lend support to the conclusion that there are numerous undescribed species of Reticulitermes in North America. 3aterpenoids 3achemical composition 3aReticulitermes 3aanimal cuticle 3achemotaxonomy 3adefensive secretions 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aClassification 2aHydrocarbonsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aIsopteraxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aPhenotype 2aTerpenesxchemistryxpharmacology. 0ahydrocarbons1 aCool, L.G.1 aForschler, B.T.1 aHaverty, M.I.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2001 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.1449-1479dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/99943Available in Treesearch, US Forest Service's digital repository  a20090529b20090608c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02160naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010200147300001800249500002400267520074800291650002701039650002701066650002601093650001801119650001801137650003601155650001301191650003001204650001601234650003201250650001601282650002801298650001001326650001401336650003901350650002801389700001701417773012301434852000901557856007701566930003301643945001301676946001301689655001201702IND2329001620221120182602.0020920e200109  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232900162DNAL7 a115453672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmore, A.K.10aEnvironmental and genotypic influences on isoquinoline alkaloid content in Sanguinaria canadensis  ap. 1729-1747.  aIncludes references  aIn a common garden, we investigated genetic and environmental influences on alkaloid production using Sanguinaria canadensis as a model. Nutrient and shade regimes were applied to replicated clones over one growing season, and induction of alkaloid production in bloodroot was tested on a whole-plant basis using jasmonic acid as an elicitor. Alkaloid concentrations increased with decreasing light intensity and fertilizer levels. Induction was not achieved by foliar application of jasmonic acid. Genetic influences represented by clone effects may be indicated by variation in alkaloid concentration by clone, but this experimental design did not allow us to distinguish genetic from pre-experiment environmental influences on the rhizomes. 3aSanguinaria canadensis 3aisoquinoline alkaloids 3aenvironmental factors 3ajasmonic acid 3aphototoxicity 3achemical constituents of plants 3agenotype 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aClone Cells 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aFertilizers 2aIsoquinolinesxanalysis 2aLight 2aOxylipins 2aPapaveraceaexchemistryxgenetics. 2aPlant Rootsxphysiology1 aHunter, M.D.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2001 Sept., v. 27, no. 9 p.1729-1747dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3electronic resource  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03274naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245009900142300001800241500002400259520160600283650002501889650001901914650002501933650001401958650002601972650001701998650001502015650001202030650002102042650003102063650001102094650001902105650001002124650002702134650000902161650001302170650004602183650002802229650000902257700001502266700002202281700001402303700001602317700001702333700001502350700001702365700001502382700001902397773012302416852000902539856007702548930003302625945001302658946001302671655001202684IND2329002420221120182703.0020920e200109  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232900242DNAL7 a115453762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCork, A.10aFemale sex pheromone of brinjal fruit and shoot borer, Leucinodes orbonalis blend optimization  ap. 1867-1877.  aIncludes references  aThe brinjal fruit and shoot borer, Leucinodes orbonalis is the major pest of eggplant in South Asia. Analysis of female pheromone gland extracts prepared from insects of Indian and Taiwanese origin confirmed (E)11-hexadecenyl acetate (E11-16:Ac) as the major pheromone component with 0.8 to 2.8% of the related (E)-11-hexadecen-1-ol (E11-16:OH), as previously reported from Sri Lanka. The average quantity of E11-16:Ac extracted per female was estimated to be 33 ng, with a range of 18.9 to 46.4 ng when collected 2 to 3 hr into the scotophase. In field trials conducted in India, blends containing between 1 and 10% E11-16:OH caught more male L. orbonalis than E11-16:Ac alone. At the 1000 microgram dose, on white rubber septa, addition of 1% E11-16:OH to E11-16:Ac was found to be more attractive to male L. orbonalis than either 0.1 or 10% E11-16:OH. Trap catch was found to be positively correlated with pheromone release rate, with the highest dose tested, 3000 microgram, on white rubber septa catching more male moths than lower doses. Field and wind tunnel release rate studies confirmed that E11-16:OH released from white rubber septa and polyethylene vials at approximately twice the rate of E11-16:Ac and that the release rate of both compounds was doubled in polyethylene vials compared to white rubber septa. This difference in release rate was reflected in field trials conducted in Bangladesh where polyethylene vial dispensers caught more male moths than either black or white rubber septa, each loaded with the same 100:1 blend of E11-16:Ac and E11-16:OH in a 3000 microgram loading. 3aLeucinodes orbonalis 3asex pheromones 3achemical composition 3asynthesis 3afield experimentation 3ainsect traps 3amonitoring 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aExocrine Glandsxchemistry 2aFemale 2aInsect Control 2aLarva 2aLepidopteraxchemistry 2aMale 2aMovement 2aSex Attractantsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aWind1 aAlam, S.N.1 aDas, A.q(Apurba)1 aDas, C.S.1 aGhosh, G.C.1 aFarman, D.I.1 aHall, D.R.1 aMaslen, N.R.1 aVedham, K.1 aPhythian, S.J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2001 Sept., v. 27, no. 9 p.1867-1877dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3electronic resource  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01984naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245011500144300001800259500002400277520049500301650001200796650002300808650001900831650002500850650002300875650002600898650001200924650002100936650002400957650003100981650004101012650002101053650002701074650001301101650006101114700001601175700001501191700001401206700001401220773012301234852000901357856007701366930003301443945001301476946001301489655001201502IND2329002320221120183058.0020920e200109  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232900232DNAL7 a115453752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, C.C.10aIsolation, identification and field tests of the sex pheromone of the carambola fruit borer, Eucosma notanthes  ap. 1855-1865.  aIncludes references  aTwo components, (Z)-8-dodecenyl acetate (Z8-12:Ac) and (Z)-8-dodecenol (Z8-12:OH), were isolated from sex pheromone glands of the carambola fruit borer, Eucosma notanthes, and were identified by GC, and GC-MS, chemical derivatization, and comparison of retention times.

The results from the above esterification reactions were compared to reactions using a commercially available immobilized lipase, Lipozyme IM-60. Time course studies showed that free Lipase PS-30 or Lipase F enhanced esterification reactions with the use of silica-supported glycerol. In contrast, immobilized Lipase PS-30-catalyzed reactions occurred at the same conversion rate when using either free or silica-supported glycerol. For immobilized Lipase F and Lipozyme IM-60 reactions, the use of silica-supported glycerol favored the production of DAG and TAG over MAG.

Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays, no nitrate reductase was found in five strains while in eight mutants the enzyme was detected. The latter strains contained different patterns of nitrate reductase partial reactions. All isolates were of the nia-type as indicated by the inducibility of purine hydroxylase I and by complementation of nitrate reductase activity in the Neurospora crassa mutant Nit-1. A restoration of NADP-nitrate reductase in Nit-1 was also obtained with NH4+- grown cells indicating that Mo-cofactor is constitutive in Chlorella. Complementation experiments among the Chlorella mutants resulted in restoration NADH-nitrate reductase activity. The characteristics of some of the Chlorella mutants are discussed in view of an improper orientation of Mo-cofactor in the residual nitrate reductase protein. 3anitrate reductase 3aChlorella sorokiniana 3amutants 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aenzyme activity 0amethodology 0aisolation 0aprotein analysis1 aTischner, R.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.786-791x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02550naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007100128300001600199500001500215520119600230650002001426650001701446650001201463650001501475650002001490650002201510650002401532650002601556650002501582650001101607650001001618650002201628650001901650650002401669650001801693650002001711651001701731653001201748653001001760653002501770653002101795700001701816700001701833700001801850700001801868773006601886852000901952930003301961945001301994946001302007655001202020IND2038157320221120142245.0940323e199307  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203815732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerksen, D.A.10aImpact of agronomic practices on weed communities: tillage systems  ap. 409-417.  a2019-12-05  aAdverse changes in weed communities are a limiting factor for the adoption of conservation tillage practices. Predictions of an increased association of annual and perennial grasses, perennial dicot weeds, wind-disseminated species, and volunteer crops as weeds, and decreased association of annual dicot weeds in reduced-tillage systems were tested. Field experiments involving zero-, minimum-, and conventional-tillage systems were conducted in Saskatchewan from 1986 to 1990 at Ituna and Waldron, and from 1986 to 1988 at Tadmore. Weed community composition was analyzed for years 1988 to 1990 by canonical discriminant analysis. An increased association of perennial and annual grasses with zero tillage did not generally occur. Wind-dispersed species and volunteer crops were associated with reduced tillage and summer annual dicots with conventional tillage, but exceptions occurred. Species responded differently among sites or within a site over time. Within the time frame of this research, changes in weed communities were influenced more by location and year than by tillage systems, indicating fluctuational rather than directional or consistent changes in community composition. 3aminimum tillage 3aweed biology 3aannuals 3ano-tillage 3aHordeum vulgare 3aplant communities 3aLinum usitatissimum 3abotanical composition 3aconventional tillage 3afallow 3aflora 3aTriticum aestivum 3aBrassica napus 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3aperennial weeds 3aSaskatchewan 0atillage 0aweeds 0aconservation tillage 0avolunteer plants1 aLafond, G.P.1 aThomas, A.G.1 aLoeppky, H.A.1 aSwanton, C.J.0 tWeed science.g1993 , v. 41, no. 3 p.409-417x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle01386naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006100128300001400189520047900203650003400682650001200716650001000728650002000738650002000758650002100778650000900799653001600808653001000824653002200834653002800856700001800884773007900902852000900981939003300990946001301023655001201036IND9104623220221120132730.0911115e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910462322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuthrie, G.P.10aStreamlining interagency collaboration for youth at risk  ap. 17-22.  aTo meet the complex needs of today's students, schools and community agencies need a thoughtful approach for pooling their efforts as well as an awareness of the pitfalls to avoid.

The additional N reduced the glyphosate-induced inhibition of rhizome growth on the intact plant at the lowest glyphosate dosage (2.8 micrograms per plant) but had no significant effect at higher dosages. Both the 2- and 4-d high N treatments significantly increased the length, dry weight, and water content of the lateral buds by the time the herbicide was applied. They also increased bud growth on the glyphosate-treated plants during the 7 d following the herbicide application and promoted release of the buds from inhibition during a subsequent bioassay of their regenerative growth on excised, single-node rhizome segments. These effects of N supply interacted significantly with glyphosate dosage, bud position on the rhizome, and duration of incubation. It is postulated that bud growth response to increased N supply may reduce the inhibiting effect of the herbicide by diluting the glyphosate concentration in the bud, or that the additional N may counteract the toxic action of glyphosate on amino acid metabolism or protein synthesis. 3amechanism of action 3aweed biology 3aapical meristems 3aweed control 3abuds 3adose response 3anitrogen 3afoliar application 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aElymus repens subsp. repens 3aglyphosate 3agrowth retardation 3arhizomes 3achemical control 3aperennial weeds 0alateral meristems 0ainteractions 0ainhibitors 0agrowth rate 0auptake1 aXiao, Ai.1 aMcIntyre, G.I.0 tWeed science.g1993 , v. 41, no. 3 p.426-433x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle01949naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245008000148300001600228300002100244520108300265650001601348650001901364650002601383650001801409650001801427653001501445700001801460700001601478773007401494852000901568939003301577946001301610655001201623IND8902399120221120132631.0890511e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890239912DNAL7 a166666192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchheim, J.A.10aMaturation of soybean somatic embryos and the transition to plantlet growth  ap. 768-775.  ap. 768-775. ill.  aThe maturation of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) somatic embryos was characterized. Maturation was assayed by evaluating the ability of somatic embryos to make the transition to a plantlet through a germination-like process. Somatic embryos were organized from cotyledons of immature soybean embryos. Maturation of somatic embryos occurred on a Murashige-Skoog basal medium supplemented with activated charcoal and 0.28 molar sucrose. After 8 weeks on this medium, somatic embryos exhibited vigorous, high frequency development to plantlets. The "germination" frequency (conversion) of somatic embryos, and plantlet recovery frequency varied concurrently with maturation period. Conversion and plant recovery required no exogenous growth regulators. Desiccation of immature somatic embryos under controlled humidity regimes resulted in increased frequency of conversion immature somatic embryos. Morphological abnormalities appeared in the somatic embryos, but few were detrimental to conversion velocity. There was little effect of genotype on conversion velocity or frequency. 3aGlycine max 3aembryo (plant) 3asomatic hybridization 3aculture media 3aembryogenesis 0amaturation1 aColburn, S.M.1 aRanch, J.P.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.768-775x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01822naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245010400131300001800235500002400253520080000277650002201077653001901099700001801118700002101136700001701157700001901174700001701193700001601210773011501226852000901341856007701350930003301427945001301460946001101473655001201484IND2329082720221120121612.0020926e200208  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232908272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChronopoulos, G.10aLactic acid fermentation of Lactobacillus casei in free cell form and immobilised on gluten pellets  ap. 1233-1236.  aIncludes references  aA comparative study of the fermentation of a range of carbohydrate substrates, at various temperatures, was carried out using a commercial Lactobacillus casei strain in a free cell form and immobilised on gluten pellets.

Recently, a novel ceramic membrane has been developed which can withstand high temperatures above 130°C and chlorinated organic solvents, thus making it possible to characterise semicrystalline polyolefins by HT-AF4. Two ceramic membranes and one cellulose membrane were compared with regard to their quality of molar mass separation and the loss of the polymer material through the pores. Separating polystyrene standards as model compounds at different cross-flow gradients the complex relationship between cross-flow velocity, separation efficiency, the molar mass and peak broadening could be elucidated in detail. Moreover, the dependence of signal quality and reproducibility on sample concentration and mass loading was investigated because the evaluation of the obtained fractograms substantially depends on the signal intensities. Finally, the performance of the whole system was tested at high temperature by separating PE reference materials of high molar mass. 3acellulose 3aceramics 3afractionation 3agel chromatography 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 3apolystyrenes 3arefractive index 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aBrüll, R.1 aMacko, T.1 aPasch, H.1 aKlein, T.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2010 Jan. 29, v. 1217, no. 5 p.722-730dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.12.0143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03488naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014500127300001600272500002400288520221400312650002802526650001702554650002502571650002402596650001502620650001402635650003002649653001102679700001502690700001302705700002302718700001602741700001802757700001502775700001502790773012502805852000902930856007002939930003303009945001303042946001103055655001203066IND2329069520221120121603.0020925e20020524ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232906952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeedom, T.A.10aRecombinant bovine growth hormone treatment of tilapia: growth response, metabolic clearance, receptor binding and immunoglobulin production  ap. 359-380.  aIncludes references  aExperiments were performed to examine the growth-promoting effects of recombinant bovine growth hormone (rbGH) in the euryhaline tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). A radioreceptor assay using a prude membrane preparation of tilapia liver revealed that rbGH was about 100-fold less potent than native tilapia GH (tGH) in displacing 125I-labeled tGH. Bovine prolactin (bPRL) was equipotent to bovine GH indicating that the GH receptor of tilapia does not distinguish mammalian GH from mammalian PRL. When juvenile tilapia, weighing 1 g, were maintained at 28 degrees C and received intraperitoneal injection of rbGH at doses of 0.1, 1 or 10 microgram/g weekly for 8 weeks, no significant effect on growth was observed. A second experiment examined weekly doses ranging from 1 to 50 microgram/g for 16 weeks, using 1 g fish maintained at 23 degrees C. rbGH (50 microgram/g) significantly increased growth after 14 and 16 weeks, although the growth rate was significantly less than those held at 28 degrees C. More pronounced growth-promoting effects were observed, however, when fish weighing 5 g and held at 29 degrees C were injected with rbGH at doses of 100 and 1000 microgram/g once a week for 4 weeks. A single injection of a sustained-release formulation of rbGH (Posilac, 100 and 1000 microgram/g) also elicited growth-promoting effects in fish weighing 4 g and kept at 29 degrees C. Treatment with rbGH, Posilac or bovine serum albumin (BSA) elicited significant increases in plasma levels of immunoglobulin (IgM) in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, there was no change in plasma levels of lysozyme activity in rbGH- or Posilac-injected fish compared with controls. An uptake and clearance study confirmed a slower decline in circulating levels of rbGH following Posilac injection compared with rbGH in saline. There was no change in plasma concentration of tGH after rbGH treatment, indicating that GH secretion from the tilapia pituitary was unaffected by high plasma levels of rbGH. The relative refractoriness of juvenile tilapia to growth-promoting effects of rbGH compared with that of other species may be due to the specific nature of the tGH receptor in recognizing the homologous hormone. 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3asomatotropin 3arecombinant proteins 3ahormone supplements 3ametabolism 3areceptors 3aintraperitoneal injection 0agrowth1 aUchida, K.1 aYada, T.1 aRichman, N.H.

Specific activities of ROL immobilized on mesocellular foam (MCF) were only 0.47 and 0.43U/mg protein in [OMIm][PF₆] and [BMIm][PF₆], respectively. However, the specific activities of ROL immobilized on octadecyl functionalized MCF (C₁₈-MCF) increased significantly to 15.64 and 14.84U/mg protein in [OMIm][PF₆] and [BMIm][PF₆], respectively. Consequently, ROL immobilized on C₁₈-MCF is a promising biocatalyst for biotransformation reactions in ionic liquids. 3aRhizopus oryzae 3abiocatalysts 3abiotechnology 3abiotransformation 3afoams 3aionic liquids 3atransesterification1 aKawakami, Koei0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2010 Feb. 1, v. 145, no. 3 p.281-283dElsevierx0168-16567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2009.11.0143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02338naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002500129245015300154300001800307300002300325520130100348650002401649650001201673650001701685650001901702650002501721650002701746650002601773653002701799700001501826700001601841773007601857852000901933939003301942946001301975655001201988IND9000442520221120111516.0900126e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900044252DNAL7 a166666562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgernprasirtsiri, J.10aImmunochemical analysis shows that an ATP/ADP-translocator is associated with the inner-envelope membranes of amyloplasts from Acer pseudoplatanus L  ap. 1024-1027.  ap. 1024-1027. ill.  aPure preparations of intact amyloplasts and chloroplasts, free from mitochondrial contamination, were isolated from cultured cells of the white-wild and green-mutant lines of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), respectively. A specific rabbit antiserum against yeast mitochondrial cytochrome c1 only cross-reacted with mitochondrial membranes from the white-wild sycamore cells. The outer and inner envelope-membranes of the two plastid-types were isolated and subsequently analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to charaterize polypeptide patterns in each fraction. Analysis by immunoblotting clearly showed that antiserum against the 29-kilodalton inorganic orthophosphate translocator isolated from pea chloroplasts cross-reacted with a 31-kilodalton polypeptide residing in the inner-envelope membranes from both sycamore chloroplasts and amyloplasts. In contrast, antiserum against the ADP/ATP-translocator isolated from mitochondria of Neurospora crassa yielded a positive signal with a 32-kilodalton polypeptide in the inner-membranes isolated from amyloplasts, but not green-mutant chloroplasts. We propose that this 32-kilodalton polypeptide in the amyloplast envelope is a putative ATP-ADP-translocator and its possible functional significance is discussed. 3aAcer pseudoplatanus 3amutants 3acell culture 3acell membranes 3achemical composition 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosine diphosphate 0achloroplast physiology1 aTakabe, T.1 aAkazawa, T.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1024-1027x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01484naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002300148245014700171300001600318500002400334520052400358650004300882650004300925650001500968650004100983773009701024852000901121856008801130655001201218IND4431636920221120101352.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443163692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.11.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCalley, David V.14aThe challenges of the analysis of basic compounds by high performance liquid chromatography: Some possible approaches for improved separations  ap. 858-880.  aIncludes references  aThis review considers some of the difficulties encountered with the analysis of ionised bases using reversed-phase chromatography, such as detrimental interaction with column silanol groups, and overloading which both lead to poor peak shapes.

Thus, ethyl digallate appears to be the major compound protecting red maple from feeding by FTC, with a minor contribution from other gallates. 3aMalacosoma disstria 3ahost plants 3aAcer rubrum 3aleaves 3aantifeedants 3aesters 3aphenolic compounds 3apest resistance 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant-insect relations 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aFeeding Behavior 2aGallic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aLarva 2aMoths 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aSapindaceaexchemistry1 aHelson, B.V.1 aNozzolillo, C.1 aArnason, J.T.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2001 Dec., v. 27, no. 12 p.2517-2527dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3electronic resource  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01534naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245012100121300001600242500002400258520062700282650001700909700001300926700001200939700001200951700001500963773011100978852000901089856007701098930003301175945001301208946001101221655001201232IND2329008320221120043033.0020920e200205  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232900832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, D.10aResponse of growth and photosynthesis of marine red tide alga Heterosigma akashiwo to iron and iron stress condition  ap. 743-747.  aIncludes references  aHeterosigma akashiwo, a red tide alga, was grown in Fe-deficient and Fe-replete batch cultures.

The red:far-red ratio inside the stem of Datura ferox L. seedlings and the estimated phytochrome photoequilibrium were strongly reduced by the presence of neighbors forming canopies too sparse to cause any mutual shading at the level of the leaves. In such canopies, change in plant density had little effects on the light regime inside the leaves of the succulent Aeonium haworthii (S.D.) Webb et Berth., particularly when the lamina was kept nearly normal to the direct rays of the sun. In field experiments using D. ferox and Sinapis alba L. seedlings, the elongation of the internodes responded to various types of localized light-quality treatments that simulated different plant densities in sparse canopies . The responses were quantitatively similar to those elicited by changes in plant density. The evidence supports the hypothesis that, in stands formed by plants of similar size, the red:far-red ratio of the light that impinges laterally on the stems is among the earliest environmental cues that allow plants to detect local canopy density and adjust axis extension accordingly. 3aprobes (equipment) 3aDatura ferox 3aSinapis alba 3aCrassulaceae 3aseedlings 3acanopy 3astems 3aleaves 3alight 0agrowth rate 0alight relations 0aaeonium haworthii 0afiber optic probes1 aScopel, A.L.1 aSanchez, R.A.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1324-1330x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02401naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245009400170300001600264520096300280650001701243650001901260650001801279650001801297650001701315650001301332650003001345650001601375650001701391650002301408650001201431650001001443650002301453650001301476650002501489653001101514653003601525653001601561700001401577700001601591700001301607773009201620852000901712856009401721930003301815945001301848946001101861990002301872655001201895IND2332843520221120042859.0030602e200212  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233284352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4506.2002.tb00044.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordi, P.L.10aSensory quality of foods after holding in steam table and temperature containment cabinet  ap. 217-226.  aMaintaining the proper temperature of foods that are cooked and then held for later service has always been a concern for the foodservice industry; however, holding the foods over periods of time without losing flavor, texture, taste, and overall quality has proven to have greater implications in the hospitality industry. In this study two types of holding equipment were tested, a temperature containment cabinet and a steam table. Three different food items were used to monitor and measure changes in the temperature and changes in the quality of the foods. All three food items used in testing were meat products. The temperature of food products held over time was measured comparing the results from the two types of equipment, and their ability to maintain temperature. Additionally the study evaluated the sensory qualities of taste, texture, appearance, and overall quality of these foods items at various time intervals from both holding devices. 3afood service 3aprepared foods 3ameat products 3afood handling 3afood storage 3asteamers 3afood processing equipment 3atemperature 3afood quality 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3acolor 3afood acceptability 3aduration 3aappearance (quality) 0atastes 0atemperature containment cabinet 0asteam table1 aYoder, E.1 aLambert, C.1 aCole, C.0 tFoodservice research international.g2002 Dec., v. 13, no. 4 p.217-226x1524-82757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4506.2002.tb00044.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02786naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245009500170300001600265500001500281520122300296650001501519650001701534650002101551650002101572650001701593650002001610650001401630650002601644650002801670650001701698650001601715650002301731650001901754650001801773650001901791650002901810650001301839650002301852650001201875650002801887650001701915653001601932653001901948773009201967852000902059856009402068930003302162945001302195946001302208990002302221655001202244IND2333410720221120042851.0030709e200210  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233341072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4506.2002.tb00040.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodgers, S.10aBotulism risk prevention with protective cultures in extended shelf-life, cook-chill meals  ap. 179-192.  a2019-12-06  aSelected commercial hot-fill meals were challenged with nonproteolytic Clostridium botulinum and protective cultures (PCs), Lactococcus lactis (7.0 x 10(7) cfu/g) or Pediococcus pentosaceus (6.0 x 10(8) cfu/g) or their mix. The PCs were enumerated on M17, De Man, Rogosa, Sharpe (MRS) and maltose tryptic soy agar, C. botulinum, on salicin tryptic soy agar, and background microflora, on plate count agar. Botulinal toxin was detected by the immunoassay and bacteriocins, by well diffusion assay. In the products supporting active growth of C. botulinum the co-incubation with the PCs singularly and as a mixture reduced C. botulinum populations to undetectable levels and prevented toxigenesis, their pH was reduced to 4.2-5.0. The use of a mixture did not produce a more rapid inhibition than the singular PC. The bacteriocidal effect on C. botulinum populations was associated with bacteriocin production (100-400 IU/g of nisin and 35 AU/g of pediocin A) by the PCs. Static C. botulinum populations in products with low pH and vegetable-based products were unaffected by the PCs. This confirmed the bacteriostatic effect of low pH and demonstrated that ungerminated C. botulinum spores were resistant to inhibition. 3ashelf life 3acooked foods 3abacterial toxins 3ain vitro culture 3abacteriocins 3arisk assessment 3adetection 3aClostridium botulinum 3aPediococcus pentosaceus 3ainactivation 3aplate count 3aLactococcus lactis 3aprepared foods 3arefrigeration 3arisk reduction 3aantibacterial properties 3abotulism 3afood contamination 3acooling 3amicrobial contamination 3acold storage 0afood safety 0ahot-fill meals0 tFoodservice research international.g2002 Oct., v. 13, no. 3 p.179-192x1524-82757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4506.2002.tb00040.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdPNN  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02666naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245011600168300001600284500001500300520136200315650001701677650002301694650001601717650002101733650003501754650002201789650001001811650002801821651001801849653001701867653003001884653003701914700001801951773009201969852000902061856009402070930003302164945001302197946001102210990002302221655001202244IND2332843120221120043422.0030602e200212  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233284312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4506.2002.tb00043.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobey, L.10aComparison of international food guide graphics for the eight most commonly consumed ethnic cuisines in the U.S  ap. 205-216.  a2019-12-06  aFoodservice in the United States (U.S.) encompasses a wide variety of ethnic cuisines. This article reviews the food guide graphics for the eight most popular ethnic cuisines served in the U.S. Food guide graphics display culturally identifiable foods in different food groups and can be used as cultural guides when preparing international cuisine. Our study objective was to introduce foodservice professionals to food guide graphics, comparing shapes, food groupings, and foods pictured in each group. Guides compared in this study ranked from most to least tried cuisines include, Italy, Mexico, China, Germany, Greece, Japan, France and Sweden. Food guide graphic evaluation will help foodservice professionals provide nutritionally balanced meals when serving the most popular ethnic cuisines. This study reveals great diversity in Food Guide Graphic shape and some differences in food groupings. Foods pictured on food guide graphics show great diversity. Yet the basic recommendation for consuming a variety of foods is common to all. Most graphics recommend relatively greater amounts of grains, vegetables, and fruits and less meat, milk, and beans. As international nutrition recommendations have been shown to be similar, focusing on specific food selection and food grouping is important when cooking healthy balanced meals in various cuisines. 3aportion size 3aDietary Guidelines 3afood groups 3anutrient balance 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3atraditional foods 3ashape 3afood service management 3aUnited States 0afood service 0ainternational comparisons 0aunited states food guide pyramid1 aPainter, J.E.0 tFoodservice research international.g2002 Dec., v. 13, no. 4 p.205-216x1524-82757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4506.2002.tb00043.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01351naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010100124300001800225500002400243520042800267650001300695650002400708650001400732653003000746700001500776773011500791852000900906856007700915930003300992945001301025946001101038655001201049IND2329040920221120043452.0020924e200112  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232904092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil, K.I.10aModelling of inhibition of nitrite oxidation in biological nitritation processes by free ammonia  ap. 2021-2026.  aIncludes references  aTo understand nitrite build-up in the nitritation process, the inhibition kinetics of free ammonia (FA) on nitrite oxidation were investigated.

The oxygen analyzer is based on a calciazirconium sensor and can resolve concentration differences to within 2 microliters per liter against the normal background of 210,000 microliters per liter. In wild-type plants receiving ammonium as their sole nitrogen source or in nitrate reductase-deficient mutants, photosynthetic and respiratory fluxes of oxygen equaled those of carbon dioxide. By contrast, wild-type plants exposed to nitrate had unequal oxygen and carbon dioxide fluxes: oxygen evolution at high light exceeded carbon dioxide consumption by 26% and carbon dioxide evolution in the dark exceeded oxygen consumption by 25%. These results indicate that a substantial portion of photosynthetic electron transport or respiration generates reductant for nitrate assimilation rather than for carbon fixation or mitochondrial electron transport. 3aHordeum vulgare 3ashoots 3aoxygen 3acarbon dioxide 3aflow 3ameasurement 3aequipment 3aphotosynthesis 3aelectrons 3anitrates 3amitochondria 3awater vapor 0aassimilation 0arespiration 0atransport 0areductant1 aCaldwell, R.M.1 aFinazzo, J.1 aWarner, R.L.1 aWeissbart, J.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Sept., v. 91, no. 1 p.352-356x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03203naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245008900147300001800236520235400254650001302608650001002621650002302631650001502654650002502669650002702694650002002721700001702741773007602758852000902834939003302843946001302876655001202889IND9104675420221120043500.0911122e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910467542DNAL7 a166683332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomson, C.J.10aMetabolic evidence for stelar anoxia in maize roots exposed to low O2 concentrations  ap. 1294-1301.  aThis investigation presents metabolic evidence to show that in 4- to 5-day-old roots of maize (Zea mays hybrid GH 5010) exposed to low external O2 concentrations, the stele receives inadequate O2 for oxidative phosphorylation, while the cortex continues to respire even when the external solution is at zero O2 and the roots rely solely on aerenchyma for O2 transport. Oxygen uptake rates (micromoles per cubic centimeter per hour) declined at higher external O2 concentrations in excised segments from whole roots than from the isolated cortex; critical O2 pressures for respiration were greater than 0.26 moles per cubic meter O2 (aerated solution) for the whole root and only 0.075 moles per cubic meter O2 for the cortex. For plants with their shoots excised and the cut stem in air, ethanol concentrations (moles per cubic meter) in roots exposed to 0.06 moles per cubic meter O2 were 3.3 times higher in the stele than in the cortex, whereas this ethanol gradient across the root was not evident in roots exposed to 0 moles per cubic meter O2. Alanine concentrations (moles per cubic meter) in the stele of roots exposed to 0.13 and 0.09 moles per cubic meter O2 increased by 26 and 44%, respectively, above the levels found for aerated roots, whereas alanine in the cortex was unchanged; the increase in stelar alanine concentration was not accompanied by changes in the concentration of free amino acids other than alanine. For plants with their shoots intact, alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase activities (micromoles per gram protein per minute) in roots exposed to 0.13 moles per cubic meter O2 increased in the stele by 40 to 50% over the activity in aerated roots, whereas there was no appreciable increase in alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase activity in the cortex of these roots. More convincingly, for roots receiving O2 solely from the shoots via the aerenchyma, pyruvate decarboxylase in the cortex was in an "inactive" state, whereas pyruvate decarboxylase in the stele was in an "active" state. These results suggest that for roots in O2-free solutions, the aerenchyma provides adequate O2 for respiration in the cortex but not in the stele, and this was supported by a change in pyruvate decarboxylase in the cortex to an active state when the O2 supply to the roots via the aerenchyma was blocked. 3aZea mays 3aroots 3aoxygen requirement 3ametabolism 3aanaerobic conditions 3apyruvate decarboxylase 3aenzyme activity1 aGreenway, H.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Aug., v. 96, no. 4 p.1294-1301x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01496naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245012500133300001800258500002400276520058900300650002600889650001800915650002700933773011500960852000901075856007701084930003301161945001301194946001101207655001201218IND2328939620221123043757.0020917e200207  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232893962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Fattah, Y.R.10aOptimization of thermostable lipase production from a thermophilic Geobacillus sp. using Box-Behnken experimental design  ap. 1217-1222.  aIncludes references  aThermostable lipase production by Geobacillus thermoleovorans was optimized in shake-flask cultures using Box-Behnken experimental design.

Each unit operation was represented by one major processing feature. The gel strength of the surimi products was shown to be significantly affected by leaching, grinding, setting and heating and their two-way interactions. The whiteness of the fish sausage was primarily affected by leaching and the interaction of leaching and grinding. Significant correlations were obtained between instrumental and sensory quality attributes. The significant effect of interaction terms implies that the conventional 'one variable at a time' strategy is inadequate to optimize surimi processing systems. 3afish 3araw foods 3afood processing 3agels 3asensory evaluation 3acrushing 3aheat treatment 3aleaching 3afood quality 0asetting0 tJournal of food engineering.g1990, v. 11, no. 3 p.241-250x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02112naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245018200167300001800349500002400367520082800391650001001219650001901229650001601248650001101264650001301275650001201288650000901300650000701309650001601316700001901332700002101351700002401372700002101396700002001417700001901437700001901456700001801475773010001493852000901593856008801602655001201690IND4431634520221123043804.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443163452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlisz, István10aHigh-performance liquid chromatographic enantioseparation of β²-amino acids using a long-tethered (+)-(18-crown-6)-2,3,11,12-tetracarboxylic acid-based chiral stationary phase  ap. 1075-1082.  aIncludes references  aReversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic methods were developed for the separation of enantiomers of eleven unnatural β²-amino acids on a new chiral stationary phase, using the 11-methylene-unit spacer of aminoundecylsilica gel for the bonding of (+)-(18-crown-6)-2,3,11,12-tetracarboxylic acid as selector.

The suitability of several mixtures as solvent systems in countercurrent chromatography was tested. The applicability of the ENFB/2-PrOH/H₂O mixture to the separation of enantiomers, in combination with a fluorinated chiral selector (CS), was evaluated. N-Perfluoroundecanoyl-l-proline-3,5-dimethylanilide (2), analogous to the previously used N-dodecyl-l-proline-3,5-dimethylanilide (1), was synthesized for this purpose. The capacity of the new solvent system to retain the fluorinated CS in the fluorinated phase used as stationary was examined. Chiral selector 1 was applied in analogous conditions for comparative purposes. Additionally, MTBE/phosphate buffer solvent system was also used with the two CSs. The ENFB/2-PrOH/H₂O (25:35:40) mixture was found to be adequate in the enantioseparation of DNB-Leu and DNB-Leu-tBu. Enantioselectivity was maintained in the fluorinated solvent system without compromising eluting time. The complete separation of DNB-Leu-tBu was achieved and no leaks of CS to the mobile phase were detected. 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aenantiomers 3asolvents1 aMinguillón, Cristina.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2010 Feb. 12, v. 1217, no. 7 p.1094-1100dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.09.0713Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01651naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006500126300001600191500001500207520087300222650002401095650001301119650001601132650001301148653001601161653002001177700001901197773008001216852000901296939003301305946001101338655001201349IND9104733520221123042413.0911122s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910473352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, R.V.10aModeling thermal processes using the equivalent point method  ap. 103-117.  a2019-12-04  aEvaluation of thermal processes requires accurate treatment of the time-temperature history of exposure.

  1 aScheublin, T.R.10aNonlegumes, legumes, and root nodules harbor different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities  ap. 6240-6246.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLegumes are an important plant functional group since they can form a tripartite symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium bacteria and phosphorus-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, not much is known about AMF community composition in legumes and their root nodules. In this study, we analyzed the AMF community composition in the roots of three nonlegumes and in the roots and root nodules of three legumes growing in a natural dune grassland. We amplified a portion of the small-subunit ribosomal DNA and analyzed it by using restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct sequencing. We found differences in AMF communities between legumes and nonlegumes and between legume roots and root nodules. Different plant species also contained different AMF communities, with different AMF diversity. One AMF sequence type was much more abundant in legumes than in nonlegumes (39 and 13%, respectively). Root nodules contained characteristic AMF communities that were different from those in legume roots, even though the communities were similar in nodules from different legume species. One AMF sequence type was found almost exclusively in root nodules. Legumes and root nodules have relatively high nitrogen concentrations and high phosphorus demands. Accordingly, the presence of legume- and nodule-related AMF can be explained by the specific nutritional requirements of legumes or by host-specific interactions among legumes, root nodules, and AMF. In summary, we found that AMF communities vary between plant functional groups (legumes and nonlegumes), between plant species, and between parts of a root system (roots and root nodules).0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aPilosella officinarum 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aOnonis 3aTrifolium repens 3aribosomal DNA 3aroot nodules 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aspecies diversity 3anucleotide sequences 3aFestuca ovina 3aLotus corniculatus 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aFabaceaexmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycorrhizaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosis 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlands 0amolecular sequence data 0aroots 0aOnonis repens 0aHieracium pilosella1 aRidgway, K.P.1 aYoung, J.P.W.1 aHeijden, M.G.A. van der0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 Oct., v. 70, no. 10 p.6240-6246x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.10.6240-6246.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/01/14  aOther US 7aarticle02555naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245007500152300001600227500002400243520143300267650002201700650002301722650001401745650001001759650002601769650001601795650004401811650002101855650001601876650002101892700001701913700001701930700001701947773013101964852000902095856007702104655001202181IND4431490220221122192410.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443149022DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.22952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Yanli12aA facile and practical approach to randomly methylated β-cyclodextrin  ap. 248-251.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Because of its high demand for use in pharmaceutical products, cosmetics, soil remediation technologies, etc., randomly methylated β-cyclodextrin (RM-β-CD) is one of the most important cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives. The aim of this present work is to use a green and commercially available approach to obtain RM-β-CD. Compared with other methylated CDs, RM-β-CD with an asymmetric molecular structure has higher water solubility. When the degree of substitution (DS) is about 1.8, the solubility tends to increase with increasing temperature and is suitable for pharmaceutical applications.RESULTS: RM-β-CD was synthesized using a green approach with ideal DS equal to 1.79. The one step process of β-cyclodextrin methylation by CH₃Cl instead of (CH₃)₂SO₄ at mild temperature (80 °C) and pressure (1.60 MPa) with a good yield (78%), is convenient and environmentally friendly. The mixture of RM-β-CD obtained contained five compounds with various DS, from which the main compound with a DS equal to 1.8 was separated by column chromatography. The compounds were carefully characterized by infra-red, NMR and mass spectrometry.CONCLUSIONS: The one-step process to RM-β-CDs with CH₃Cl is more economical, more efficient and less noxious than the usual method using (CH₃)₂SO₄. Moreover, this approach avoids some poisonous residual materials and meets the demand for protecting the environment. 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3achemical structure 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aliquid chromatography 3amethylation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asoil remediation 3atemperature 3awater solubility1 aWang, Caixia1 aMao, Jianwei1 aYu, Yongping0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2010 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.248-251dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.22953Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04568naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004200132040001800174072001700192100001600209245012700225300001800352506007600370520188800446506003702334650002302371650001602394650001802410650001902428650001402447650002302461650001102484650002002495650001802515650002502533650001402558650004502572650001402617650002502631650006102656650006202717650003402779650002002813650007302833650002402906650007002930650007303000650006803073650002803141650002403169650001403193650002803207650005503235650005603290650005603346650002203402650001903424653002703443653005403470700001903524700002003543773009903563852000903662856009203671930003303763945002503796946001303821655001203834IND4365524820221207080818.0041112e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436552482DNAL7 a154665142pmid7 aPMC5220772pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.10.5778-5786.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In methanogenic environments, due to thermodynamic constraints, the oxidation of propionate requires syntrophic cooperation of propionate-fermenting proton-reducing bacteria and H2-consuming methanogens. We have identified here microorganisms that were active in syntrophic propionate oxidation in anoxic paddy soil by rRNA-based stable-isotope probing (SIP). After 7 weeks of incubation with [13C]propionate (<10 mM) and the oxidation of approximately 30 micromol of 13C-labeled substrate per g dry weight of soil, we found that archaeal nucleic acids were 13C labeled to a larger extent than those of the bacterial partners. Nevertheless, both terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and cloning analyses revealed Syntrophobacter spp., Smithella spp., and the novel Pelotomaculum spp. to predominate in "heavy" 13C-labeled bacterial rRNA, clearly showing that these were active in situ in syntrophic propionate oxidation. Among the Archaea, mostly Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina spp. and also members of the yet-uncultured "rice cluster I" lineage had incorporated substantial amounts of 13C label, suggesting that these methanogens were directly involved in syntrophic associations and/or thriving on the [13C]acetate released by the syntrophs. With this first application of SIP in an anoxic soil environment, we were able to clearly demonstrate that even guilds of microorganisms growing under thermodynamic constraints, as well as phylogenetically diverse syntrophic associations, can be identified by using SIP. This approach holds great promise for determining the structure and function relationships of further syntrophic or other nutritional associations in natural environments and for defining metabolic functions of yet-uncultivated microorganisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflooded conditions 3apaddy soils 3asoil bacteria 3apropionic acid 3aoxidation 3aanalytical methods 3acarbon 3astable isotopes 3aribosomal RNA 3aanaerobic conditions 3aanaerobes 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aphylogeny 3adelta-Proteobacteria 2aArchaeaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aDeltaproteobacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aMethanobacteriumxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMethanomicrobiaceaexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMethanosarcinaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhylogeny 2aPropionatesxmetabolism 2aRNA, Archaealxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aThermodynamics 0astable isotope probing 0aterminal restriction fragment length polymorphism1 aPommerenke, B.1 aFriedrich, M.W.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 Oct., v. 70, no. 10 p.5778-5786x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.10.5778-5786.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/01/14  aOther US 7aarticle02258naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245007700154300001600231500002400247520115300271650001801424650001501442650001201457650001201469650002301481650001501504650001701519650001501536650002601551650001101577650001101588650001101599700002401610700002101634773013101655852000901786856007701795655001201872IND4431489520221122192353.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443148952DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.22872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarun, Razif10aMicroalgal biomass as a fermentation feedstock for bioethanol production  ap. 199-203.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: The increasing cost of fossil fuels as well as the escalating social and industrial awareness of the environmental impacts associated with the use of fossil fuels has created the need for more sustainable fuel options. Bioethanol, produced from renewable biomass such as sugar and starch materials, is believed to be one of these options, and it is currently being harnessed extensively. However, the utilization of sugar and starch materials as feedstocks for bioethanol production creates a major competition with the food market in terms of land for cultivation, and this makes bioethanol from these sources economically less attractive.RESULT: This study explores the suitability of microalgae (Chlorococum sp.) as a substrate for bioethanol production via yeast (Saccharomyces bayanus) under different fermentation conditions. Results show a maximum ethanol concentration of 3.83 g L⁻¹ obtained from 10 g L⁻¹ of lipid-extracted microalgae debris.CONCLUSION: This productivity level (~38% w/w), which is in keeping with that of current production systems endorses microalgae as a promising substrate for bioethanol production. 3aSaccharomyces 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3amicroalgae 3aproduction technology 3astarch 3asugars 3ayeasts1 aDanquah, Michael K.1 aForde, Gareth M.0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2010 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.199-203dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.22873Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02611naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245011600152300001600268500002400284520157200308650002101880650001601901650001701917650001401934650001501948650001701963650001901980650001501999650002402014700001802038773013102056852000902187856007702196655001202273IND4431489020221122192422.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443148902DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.23002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSani, Amir10aImprovements in the production of bacterial synthesized biocellulose nanofibres using different culture methods  ap. 151-164.  aIncludes references  aThis review summarizes previous work that was done to improve the production of bacterial cellulose nanofibres. Production of biocellulose nanofibres is a subject of interest owing to the wide range of unique properties that makes this product an attractive material for many applications. Bacterial cellulose is a natural nanomaterial that has a native dimension of less than 50 nm in diameter. It is produced in the form of nanofibres, yielding a very pure cellulose product with unique physical properties that distinguish it from plant-derived cellulose. Its high surface-to-volume ratio combined with its unique properties such as poly-functionality, hydrophilicity and biocompatibility makes it a potential material for applications in the biomedical field. The purpose of this review is to summarize the methods that might help in delivering microbial cellulose to the market at a competitive cost. Different feedstocks in addition to different bioreactor systems that have been previously used are reviewed. The main challenge that exists is the low yield of the cellulosic nanofibres, which can be produced in static and agitated cultures. The static culture method has been used for many years. However, the production cost of this nanomaterial in bioreactor systems is less expensive than the static culture method. Biosynthesis in bioreactors will also be less labour intensive when scaled up. This would improve developing intermediate fermentation scale-up so that the conversion to an efficient large-scale fermentation technology will be an easy task. 3abiocompatibility 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3acellulose 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3ahydrophilicity 3ananofibers 3aphysical properties1 aDahman, Yaser0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2010 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.151-164dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.23003Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02552naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002300137245018800160300001600348500002400364520145500388650002201843650001001865650002001875650001201895650000701907650001501914650001101929650001601940700002201956700001901978773013101997852000902128856007702137655001202214IND4431489320221122162223.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443148932DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.22812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCírkva, Vladimír10aMicrowave photochemistry V: Low-pressure batch and continuous-flow microwave photoreactors with quartz mercury electrodeless discharge lamps. Photohydrolysis of mono-chloroacetic acid  ap. 185-191.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Low-pressure batch and continuous-flow microwave photoreactors were equipped with microwave powered quartz mercury electrodeless discharge lamps (Hg-EDLs). Photohydrolysis of aqueous mono-chloroacetic acid (MCAA) into hydroxyacetic acid and HCl was chosen as the model reaction to evaluate these photoreactors. The effects of operational parameters on the MCAA photolysis through a UV/MW process were investigated.RESULTS: Studies were carried out at relatively high MCAA concentration (0.1 mol L⁻¹). The photoreaction course was monitored by the pH change in the solution. The MCAA conversion was optimized as a result of a trade-off between the thermal dependence of the photochemical quantum yield (which increases with increasing temperature) and the thermal dependence of the EDL light intensity of 254 nm line (which increases with decreasing temperature). The microwave photoreactors made it possible to study the temperature dependence of MCAA photohydrolysis.CONCLUSION: It was found that operational parameters (i.e. reaction temperature, quantum yield) had important effects on photoefficiency. Photohydrolysis of MCAA in the microwave photoreactors can be enhanced by the UV/MW system. The results of conversions (in 120 min) for the particular photoreactor set-ups show that the best reaction conditions for MCAA photolysis were obtained in the low-pressure batch microwave photoreactor (the conversion was 46% at 80 °C). 3ahydrochloric acid 3alamps 3alight intensity 3amercury 3apH 3aphotolysis 3aquartz 3atemperature1 aRelich, Stanislav1 aHájek, Milan.0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2010 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.185-191dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.22813Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02305naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245017400162300001600336500002400352520114700376650002401523650001601547650001701563650002201580650001601602650000701618650001301625650002001638650001201658650001801670700001801688700003101706773011201737852000901849856008501858655001201943IND4431484420221122162139.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443148442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-009-0317-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Ya-Jie12aA novel biotransformation process of 4′-demethylepipodophyllotoxin to 4′-demethylepipodophyllic acid by Bacillus fusiformis CICC 20463, Part II: process optimization  ap. 237-246.  aIncludes references  aThis work optimized the novel biotransformation process of 4′-demethylepipodophyllotoxin (DMEP) into 4′-demethylepipodophyllic acid (DMEPA) by Bacillus fusiformis CICC 20463. Firstly, the biotransformation process was significantly affected by medium composition. 5 g/L of yeast extract and 10 g/L of peptone were optimal for DMEPA production (i.e., 2.81 ± 0.21 mg/L), while not beneficial for the cell growth of B. fusiformis. This indicated that the biosynthesis of DMEPA was not corresponded well to the cell growth of B. fusiformis. 40 g/L of sucrose was optimal for DMEPA production (i.e., 2.94 ± 0.17 mg/L), and 3 g/L of NaCl was the best for DMEPA production (i.e., 4.10 ± 0.18 mg/L). Secondly, the production of DMEPA was significantly enhanced by the control of substrate concentration and culture pH. 100 mg/L of substrate was optimal for DMEPA production (i.e., 6.47 ± 0.35 mg/L), and DMEPA concentration was enhanced to 38.78 mg/L by controlling culture pH at 9.0 in the stirred-tank bioreactors. The fundamental information obtained in this study provides a simple and efficient way to produce DMEPA by biotransformation. 3aBacillus fusiformis 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3acell growth 3apH 3apeptones 3asodium chloride 3asucrose 3ayeast extract1 aXu, Xiao-Ling1 aZhong, J.-J.q(Jian-Jiang)0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.237-246dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-009-0317-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02660naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015600165300001600321500002400337520152500361650002601886650001701912650002001929650001701949650001501966650001201981650001201993700001702005700001202022700001602034700002202050700002002072773011202092852000902204856008502213655001202298IND4431484620221122161535.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443148462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-009-0320-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yong-Hong10aRegulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolism: glucose limitation enhances the component of isovalerylspiramycin for the bitespiramycin production  ap. 257-265.  aIncludes references  a4′′-O-isovalerylspiramycins are the major components of bitespiramycin complex consisting of a group of 4′′-O-acylated spiramycins. The availability of isovaleryl group, usually in vivo derived from leucine, one of the branched-chain amino acids, affects the content of isovaleryispiramycin significantly. In this study, the effect of glucose on the activity of branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which catalyzed the rate-limiting as well as the first irreversible reaction oxidative decarboxylation for branched-chain amino acids degradation, and isovaleryispiramycin biosynthesis was investigated. In the initial glucose concentration experiment, when the residual glucose concentration in the medium declined to 2-4 g/L, the BCKDH activity rose rapidly, and glucose deprivation and the summit of BCKDH activity appeared nearly at the same time. After a delay of about 6 h, the maximal isovalerylspiramycin content was observed. However, the shortage of glucose at the later production phase resulted in the marked decrease in BCKDH activity and isovaleryispiramycin content. In the fermentation in a 50 L fermentor, glucose feeding at the late production phase helped to maintain the residual glucose concentration between 0 and 1 g/L, leading to the high level of BCKDH activity and thus isovalerylspiramycin content. These suggested that glucose concentration could be used as a key parameter to regulate BCKDH activity and isovaleryispiramycin biosynthesis in the bitespiramycin production. 3aamino acid metabolism 3abiosynthesis 3adecarboxylation 3afermentation 3afermenters 3aglucose 3aleucine1 aWu, Chun-Hai1 aChu, Ju1 aHao, Yu-You1 aZhuang, Ying-Ping1 aZhang, Si-Liang0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.257-265dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-009-0320-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02130naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245016000160300001600320500002400336520085200360650001501212650001301227650002601240650001601266650002001282650002101302650001801323650002801341650001101369650001701380650001801397650000901415650001301424700001401437700001601451700001901467700001601486773011201502852000901614856008501623655001201708IND4431483820221122161534.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443148382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-009-0302-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kaige10a[AuCl₄]⁻ and Fe³⁺/[Fe(CN)₆]³⁻ ions-derivated immunosensing interface for electrochemical immunoassay of carcinoembryonic antigen in human serum  ap. 179-185.  aIncludes references  a[AuCl₄]⁻ was initially deposited by electrochemical reduction on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to form porous nanogold layer, then prussian blue (PB) was electrodeposited onto the as-prepared nanogold layer, and then secondary nanogold particles were fabricated again on the PB surface by electrochemical reduction for the immobilization of anti-CEA antibodies.

The entire treatment system was operated at different hydraulic retention times (HRT's) of 13.3, 10 and 5.0 h. An overall reduction of 80-86% for CODtotal; 51-73% for CODcolloidal and 20-55% for CODsoluble was found at a total HRT of 5-10 h, respectively. By prolonging the HRT to 13.3 h, the removal efficiencies of CODtotal, CODcolloidal and CODsoluble increased up to 92, 89 and 80%, respectively. However, the removal efficiency of CODsuspended in the combined system remained unaffected when increasing the total HRT from 5 to 10 h and from 10 to 13.3 h. This indicates that, the removal of CODsuspended was independent on the imposed HRT. Ammonia-nitrogen removal in MBBR treating UASB reactor effluent was significantly influenced by organic loading rate (OLR). 62% of ammonia was eliminated at OLR of 4.6 g COD m⁻² day⁻¹. The removal efficiency was decreased by a value of 34 and 43% at a higher OLR's of 7.4 and 17.8 g COD m⁻² day⁻¹, respectively. The mean overall residual counts of faecal coliform in the final effluent were 8.9 × 10⁴ MPN per 100 ml at a HRT of 13.3 h, 4.9 × 10⁵ MPN per 100 ml at a HRT of 10 h and 9.4 × 10⁵ MPN per 100 ml at a HRT of 5.0 h, corresponding to overall log₁₀ reduction of 2.3, 1.4 and 0.7, respectively. The discharged sludge from UASB-MBBR exerts an excellent settling property. Moreover, the mean value of the net sludge yield was only 6% in UASB reactor and 7% in the MBBR of the total influent COD at a total HRT of 13.3 h. Accordingly, the use of the combined UASB-MBBR system for sewage treatment is recommended at a total HRT of 13.3 h. 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiofilm 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoliform bacteria 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3atemperature 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 3awastewater1 aEl-Gohary, F.1 aTemmink, H.0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.267-276dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-009-0321-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02639naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004200132040001800174072001700192072001700209100001300226245003900239300001800278506007600296520094500372506003701317650001201354650002101366650001001387650001801397650000901415650001301424650001501437650002401452650002201476650002201498650001401520650002601534650003301560650001901593650002701612650002201639650002201661650003801683650002301721700001601744700001501760700001501775773009901790852000901889856009201898930003301990945002502023946001302048655001202061IND4365525120221207092201.0041112e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436552512DNAL7 a154665222pmid7 aPMC5220962pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.10.5842-5846.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In the present study, we tested the possibility that viruses from one biome can successfully propagate in another. Viral concentrates were prepared from different near-shore marine sites, lake water, marine sediments, and soil. The concentrates were added to microcosms containing dissolved organic matter as a food source (after filtration to allow 100-kDa particles to pass through) and a 3% (vol/vol) microbial inoculum from a marine water sample (after filtration through a 0.45-micrometer-pore-size filter). Virus-like particle abundances were then monitored using direct counting. Viral populations from lake water, marine sediments, and soil were able to replicate when they were incubated with the marine microbes, showing that viruses can move between different ecosystems and propagate. These results imply that viruses can laterally transfer DNA between microbes in different biomes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aviruses 3amarine sediments 3alakes 3asurface water 3asoil 3aseawater 3aecosystems 3apopulation dynamics 3avirus replication 3acommunity ecology 2aEcosystem 2aFresh Waterxvirology 2aGeologic Sedimentsxvirology 2aMarine Biology 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aSoil Microbiology 2aVirus Replication 2aVirusesxisolation & purification 2aWater Microbiology1 aCarlson, S.1 aWegley, L.1 aRohwer, F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 Oct., v. 70, no. 10 p.5842-5846x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.10.5842-5846.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/01/14  aOther US 7aarticle03828naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004200132040001800174072001700192072001700209072001700226100001500243245015100258300001800409500001500427506007600442520172200518506003702240650001702277650002702294650002302321650002402344650001902368650002702387650001202414650002902426650005102455650003902506650004002545650003602585650002602621650003502647650002202682650002402704650004502728650005402773650002602827653003102853653002302884653001902907700001702926773009902943852000903042856009203051930003303143945002503176946001303201655001203214IND4365525820221207092202.0041112e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436552582DNAL7 a154665102pmid7 aPMC5220762pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.10.5750-5755.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In broth media at 20 degrees C, 5 mM eugenol or 30 mM cinnamaldehyde was bactericidal (>1-log reduction in the number of CFU per milliliter in 1 h) to Listeria monocytogenes. At a concentration of 6 mM eugenol was bactericidal to Lactobacillus sakei, but treatment with 0.5 M cinnamaldehyde had no significant effect. To investigate the role of interference with energy generation in the mechanism of action, the cellular and extracellular ATP levels of cells in HEPES buffer at 20 degrees C were measured. Treatment of nonenergized L. monocytogenes with 5 mM eugenol, 40 mM cinnamaldehyde, or 10 micromolar carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) for 5 min prevented an increase in the cellular ATP concentration upon addition of glucose. Treatment of energized L. monocytogenes with 40 mM cinnamaldehyde or 10 micromolar CCCP caused a rapid decline in cellular ATP levels, but 5 mM eugenol had no effect on cellular ATP. Treatment of L. sakei with 10 mM eugenol prevented ATP generation by nonenergized cells and had no effect on the cellular ATP of energized cells. CCCP at a concentration of 100 micromolar had no significant effect on the cellular ATP of L. sakei. No significant changes in extracellular ATP were observed. Due to their rapidity, effects on energy generation clearly play a major role in the activity of eugenol and cinnamaldehyde at bactericidal concentrations. The possible mechanisms of inhibition of energy generation are inhibition of glucose uptake or utilization of glucose and effects on membrane permeability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosynthesis 3aadenosine triphosphate 3afood preservatives 3aLactobacillus sakei 3afood pathogens 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aeugenol 3aantibacterial properties 2aAcroleinxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aEugenolxpharmacology 2aFlavoring Agentsxpharmacology 2aFood Microbiology 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aLactobacillusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 0anatural food preservatives 0aaromatic compounds 0acinnamaldehyde1 aHolley, R.A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 Oct., v. 70, no. 10 p.5750-5755x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.10.5750-5755.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/01/14  aOther US 7aarticle02923naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245018300167300001600350500002400366520170200390650001602092650001902108650002002127650004102147650002202188650002602210650001602236700001302252700001802265700001402283700002302297700001602320700001802336773009802354852000902452856008802461655001202549IND4431344320221122130222.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443134432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreissinet, C.10aSearch for evidence of life in space: Analysis of enantiomeric organic molecules by N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal derivative dependant Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry  ap. 731-740.  aIncludes references  aWithin the context of the future space missions to Mars (MSL 2011 and Exomars 2016), which aim at searching for traces of life at the surface, the detection and quantitation of enantiomeric organic molecules is of major importance. In this work, we have developed and optimized a method to derivatize and analyze chiral organic molecules suitable for space experiments, using N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal (DMF-DMA) as the derivatization agent. The temperature, duration of the derivatization reaction, and chromatographic separation parameters have been optimized to meet instrument design constraints imposed upon space experiment devices. This work demonstrates that, in addition to its intrinsic qualities, such as production of light-weight derivatives and a great resistance to drastic operating conditions, DMF-DMA facilitates simple and fast derivatization of organic compounds (three minutes at 140°C in a single-step) that is suitable for an in situ analysis in space. By using DMF-DMA as the derivatization agent, we have successfully identified 19 of the 20 proteinic amino acids and been able to enantiomerically separate ten of the potential 19 (glycine being non-chiral). Additionally, we have minimized the percentage of racemized amino acid compounds produced by optimizing the conditions of the derivatization reaction itself. Quantitative linearity studies and the determination of the limit of detection show that the proposed method is also suitable for the quantitative determination of both enantiomeric forms of most of the tested amino acids, as limits of detection obtained are lower than the ppb level of organic molecules already detected in Martian meteorites. 3aamino acids 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aorganic compounds 3aquantitative analysis 3atemperature1 aBuch, A.1 aSternberg, R.1 aSzopa, C.1 aGeffroy-Rodier, C.1 aJelinek, C.1 aStambouli, M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2010 Jan. 29, v. 1217, no. 5 p.731-740dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.11.0093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02329naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010600167300001600273500002400289520134100313650002101654650001801675650002301693650001301716650002801729650002101757650002001778700002301798773010001821852000901921856008501930655001202015IND4431447920221122130235.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443144792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-009-0537-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeufel, Katharina10aInteraction of transcription activator GvpE with TATA-box-binding proteins of Halobacterium salinarum  ap. 143-149.  aIncludes references  aGvpE is the transcriptional activator of the gvp gene cluster involved in gas vesicle formation in Haloabacterium salinarum. A 20-nucleotide sequence is required for the GvpE-mediated activation of the two oppositely oriented gvp promoters, P A and P D . This sequence is located adjacent to the TATA-box and the transcription factor-B-binding site BRE, suggesting an interaction between GvpE and proteins of the transcription initiation apparatus. Here, we analysed the interaction of GvpE with the five different TATA-box-binding proteins, TBP, of Hbt. salinarum PHH1. The His-tagged TbpA through TbpE proteins were produced in Escherichia coli, bound to Ni-NTA matrices and tested for interaction with GvpE by protein-protein affinity chromatography. All TbpHis proteins retained the two different GvpE proteins from lysates of Haloferax volcanii transformants expressing the respective gvpE reading frame in pJAS35. Also, both GvpEHis proteins bound to Ni-NTA matrices retained TbpB, whereas the 20-kDa soluble gas vesicle protein GvpHHis neither bound TbpB nor GvpE from the respective lysates of Hfx. volcanii. From these results, it appears that GvpE interacts with any TBP of Hbt. salinarum. This interaction might attract TBP and subsequently TFB and RNAP to the promoter and thus enhance transcription of the gvp gene cluster. 3aEscherichia coli 3aHalobacterium 3aHaloferax volcanii 3aTATA box 3aaffinity chromatography 3amultigene family 3atransactivators1 aPfeifer, Felicitas0 tArchives of microbiology.g2010 Feb., v. 192, no. 2 p.143-149dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-009-0537-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02344naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002500148245011600173300001800289520097900307592002801286650003001314650001201344650002201356650001401378650001701392650001801409650001701427650002101444650000901465650002001474650001801494650002001512700002701532700002901559700004201588700002501630700002301655700002701678773011201705856008401817852000901901655001201910IND4472273320221119144906.0150808e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447227332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerreault, François10aInvestigation of animal and algal bioassays for reliable saxitoxin ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity risk evaluation  ap. 1021-1026.  aContamination of water bodies by saxitoxin can result in various toxic effects in aquatic organisms. Saxitoxin contamination has also been shown to be a threat to human health in several reported cases, even resulting in death. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of animal (Neuro-2A) and algal (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) bioassays to saxitoxin effect. Neuro-2A cells were found to be sensitive to saxitoxin, as shown by a 24h EC50 value of 1.5nM, which was obtained using a cell viability assay. Conversely, no saxitoxin effect was found in any of the algal biomarkers evaluated, for the concentration range tested (2–128nM). These results indicate that saxitoxin may induce toxic effects in animal and human populations at concentrations where phytoplankton communities are not affected. Therefore, when evaluating STX risk of toxicity, algal bioassays do not appear to be reliable indicators and should always be conducted in combination with animal bioassays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aanimals 3aaquatic organisms 3abioassays 3acytotoxicity 3aecotoxicology 3ahuman health 3ahuman population 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asurface water 3awater pollution1 aSeleme Matias, Marcelo1 aPedroso Melegari, Silvia1 ade Carvalho Pinto, Catia Regina Silva1 aEkué Creppy, Edmond1 aPopović, Radovan,1 aGerson Matias, William0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2011 May, v. 74, no. 4 p.1021-1026dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016400166520143100330592002801761650001901789650001201808650001201820650001501832650001501847650002501862650001301887650002701900650001301927650001501940653000901955653002601964653001501990653001202005653001502017700002002032700001802052700002202070700001802092700002102110700002002131700002202151700002602173700003202199700002202231700002802253700005902281700002102340773010502361856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60777949220221119093541.0220921e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077794922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1134542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeka, Rahul12aA techno-economic approach for eliminating dye pollutants from industrial effluent employing microalgae through microbial fuel cells: Barriers and perspectives  aMicrobial fuel cells are biochemical factories which besides recycling wastewater are electricity generators, if their low power density can be scaled up. This also adds up to work on many factors responsible to increase the cost of running a microbial fuel cell. As a result, the first step is to use environment friendly dead organic algae biomass or even living algae cells in a microbial fuel cell, also referred to as microalgal microbial fuel cells. This can be a techno-economic aspect not only for treating textile wastewater but also an economical way of obtaining value added products and bioelectricity from microalgae. Besides treating wastewater, microalgae in its either form plays an essential role in treating dyes present in wastewater which essentially include azo dyes rich in synthetic ions and heavy metals. Microalgae require these metals as part of their metabolism and hence consume them throughout the integration process in a microbial fuel cell. In this review a detail plan is laid to discuss the treatment of industrial effluents (rich in toxic dyes) employing microbial fuel cells. Efforts have been made by researchers to treat dyes using microbial fuel cell alone or in combination with catalysts, nanomaterials and microalgae have also been included. This review therefore discusses impact of microbial fuel cells in treating wastewater rich in textile dyes its limitations and future aspects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectricity 3abiomass 3afabrics 3ametabolism 3amicroalgae 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aresearch 3atextile mill effluents 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aDyes 0aMicrobial fuels cells 0aMicroalgae 0aTextile 0aWastewater1 aShreya, Shristi1 aMourya, Megha1 aSirotiya, Vandana1 aRai, Anshuman1 aKhan, Mohd Jahir1 aAhirwar, Ankesh1 aSchoefs, Benoît,1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

This hormone is able to aggregate in a β-sheet conformation and deposit in islet amyloids, a hallmark in type II diabetes. Since amylin is a gene-encoded hormone, this peptide has variants caused by point mutations that can impact its functions.Here, we analyzed the structural effects caused by S20G and G33R point mutations which, according to the 1000 Genomes Project, have frequency in East Asian and European populations, respectively. The analyses were performed by means of aggrescan server, SNP functional effect predictors, and molecular dynamics.We found that both mutations have aggregation potential and cause changes in the monomeric forms when compared with wild-type amylin. Furthermore, comparative analyses with pramlintide, an amylin drug analogue, allowed us to infer that second α-helix maintenance may be related to the aggregation potential.The S20G mutation has been described as pathologically related, which is in agreement with our findings. In addition, our data suggest that the G33R mutation might have a deleterious effect. The data presented here also provide new therapy opportunities, whether for creating more effective drugs for diabetes or implementing specific treatment for patients with these mutations.Our data could help to better understand the impact of mutations on the wild-type amylin sequence, as a starting point for the evaluation and characterization of other variations. Moreover, these findings could improve the health of patients with type II diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3adrugs 3agenome 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3apeptides 3atherapeutics 0aMolecular dynamics 0aIslet amyloid 0aS20G mutation 0aPramlintide1 aFranco, Octavio L.1 aAlencar, Sergio A.1 aPorto, William F.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 Aug., v. 1865, no. 8 p.129935-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2021.1299353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007600168300001600244520157000260592002801830653001901858653003301877653002401910653002501934653002001959653002201979653002702001700006102028700001702089700002102106700001902127773015602146856008202302852000902384655001202393IND60555045920221118045547.0161026e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055504592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jasc.2014.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlikhan, Mir B.10aCytopathologic diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma in unusual clinical settings  ap. 244-249.  aKaposi sarcoma (KS) is a rare disease that presents as 1 of 4 distinct clinicopathologic subtypes; however, it may present in populations outside those normally encountered. In such cases, it will be important to consider KS in the differential diagnosis, as it may mimic other neoplastic and non-neoplastic entities.We describe 2 cases of KS, 1 in a patient not clinically fitting any of the 4 subtypes and the other in a patient with atypical presentation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated disease. The first is an 81-year-old African American (AA) woman with a history of KS of the leg, who presented with groin lymphadenopathy and the second is a 42-year-old AA man with a known history of HIV infection, no skin lesions, and new axillary lymphadenopathy.Fine-needle aspiration of the groin and axillary lymph node, respectively, showed atypical spindle cells in a lymphoplasmacytic background. The spindle cells were positive for human herpesvirus-8 on the cell block and subsequent lymph node excision. In patients with HIV infection, in addition to reactive and lymphoproliferative processes, KS should be considered. In the former case, the demographic of an elderly AA woman without immunosuppression would not cause concern for systemic KS, but for a metastatic tumor or lymphoma.Cytology is a helpful tool in narrowing the differential diagnosis for spindle cell lesions. With a diagnosis of KS, clinicians would be able to query the clinical history for a possible etiology, such as HIV, and exclude the possibility of metastatic disease.  aPublisher supplied data 0aKaposi sarcoma 0aHuman immunodeficiency virus 0aHuman herpesvirus-8 0aSpindle cell lesions 0aLymphadenopathy 0aImmunosuppression 0aFine-needle aspiration1 aTretiakova, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0819-96381 aKhan, Ghazal1 aHyjek, Elizabeth1 aAntic, Tatjana0 tJournal of the American Society of Cytopathology.g2014 Sept.,  Oct., v. 3 p.244-249dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Society of Cytopathologyx2213-29457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasc.2014.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011000164300002000274520101200294592002801306650001301334650002801347650001801375650001601393650002601409650000901435650001301444650002001457653002401477653001801501653002501519653000801544653001001552700001901562700001801581773012801599856007801727852000901805655001201814IND60528908220221118155919.0160717e20160504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052890822DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b012132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzuma, Tomoyuki10aCellular Response to Non-contacting Nanoscale Sublayer: Cells Sense Several Nanometer Mechanical Property  ap. 10710-10716.  aCell adhesion is influenced not only from the surface property of materials but also from the mechanical properties of the nanometer sublayer just below the surface. In this study, we fabricated a well-defined diblock polymer brush composed of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate (AEMA). The underlying layer of poly(MPC) is a highly viscous polymer, and the surface layer of poly(AEMA) is a cell-adhesive cationic polymer. The adhesion of L929 mouse fibroblasts was examined on the diblock polymer brush to see the effect of a non-contacting underlying polymer layer on the cell-adhesion behavior. Cells could sense the viscoelasticity of the underlying layers at the nanometer level, although the various fabricated diblock polymer brushes had the same surface property and the functional group. Thus, we found a new factor which could control cell spread at the nanometer level, and this insight would be important to design nanoscale biomaterials and interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiocompatible materials 3acell adhesion 3afibroblasts 3amechanical properties 3amice 3apolymers 3aviscoelasticity 0ablock polymer brush 0acell adhesion 0anon-contacting layer 0aXRR 0aQCM-D1 aTeramura, Yuji1 aTakai, Madoka0 tACS applied materials .g2016 May 04, v. 8, no. 17 p.10710-10716dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b012133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04464naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015600165300002000321500001900341520305600360592002803416650001603444650001503460650000803475650001503483650001703498650001403515650001503529650001903544650001503563650002503578650001803603650001903621650002103640650001803661650002003679700006103699700006003760773011703820856008403937852000904021655001204030IND60712089920221120194556.0201009e20200914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071208992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c025342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jin10aCollapsed Structure of Hydrophobically Modified Polyacrylamide Adsorbed at the Air–Water Interface: The Polymer Surface Excess and the Gibbs Equation  ap. 11661-11675.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNeutron reflectometry has been used to measure the surface excesses and structures of hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide polymers (HMPAMs) at the air–water (A–W) interface. The HMPAMs were based on a range of commercially available PAM, which were modified by the N-alkylation of the amide group to give an N–CₙD₂ₙ₊₁ hydrophobic group with n = 8, 12, and 16 at levels of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 mol %. A further HMPAM was synthesized in two isotopic forms with either N–CₙD₂ₙ₊₁ or N–CₙH₂ₙ₊₁ as hydrophobes. For moderate- and high MW species the near surface structure at the A–W interface consists of two layers. All the hydrophobic units are in these two layers as well as a large fraction of backbone units, often amounting to a total volume comparable to that of the hydrophobes. The outer layer next to air contains no water, but the residual volume in the inner layer is filled with water. A further large fraction of the backbone units also form a diffuse third layer extending a substantial distance into the solution. In a low MW HMPAMs there was preferential adsorption of species with higher mol % of hydrophobe and a tendency to form apparently nonequilibrium structures, which in some cases resulted in more complex structures than the simple one characteristic of the large MW polymers. With the exception of this polymer, the variation of the patterns of surface excess and structure with solution concentration suggested that systems containing hydrophobic units at a level of 0.5, 1, and 2 mol % formed equilibrium or near-equilibrium surface layers at bulk concentrations of 0.01–0.35 wt % for C₈ to C₁₆ units. However, higher levels of 4 and 6 mol % of the C₁₂ hydrophobe led to much less regular patterns of adsorption, indicating that equilibration is more difficult once the molar fraction of hydrophobe exceeds 2 mol %. The behavior of the surface tension (ST) over the same concentration range as the NR experiments could be accounted for by the Gibbs equation using the directly measured surface excesses and the incorporation of a low charge on the polymers (about 1 charge per 100 backbone units). The presence of such a charge in PAM can arise from hydrolysis of some amide to carboxylate and was known to be present for one of the polymers. The extra structural information obtained by NR on these HMPAMs combined with more recent measurements of the state of ionization in polyacrylates (PAA) allowed us to reinterpret earlier ST and X-ray reflection results on hydrophobically modified HMPAANa containing a similar level of 1 and 2 mol % C₁₂H₂₅ hydrophobes. The Gibbs equation again accounted quantitatively for the ST behavior by using the correct state of ionization of the polymer. Although the adsorption of hydrophobic groups in HMPAANa is about one-tenth of that for the corresponding HMPAM, the ST drops more quickly to lower values for HMPAANa because of its higher level of dissociation, which increases the magnitude of the slope in the Gibbs plot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aadsorption 3aair 3aalkylation 3adissociation 3aequations 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aionization 3aliquid-air interface 3amole fraction 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyacrylic acid 3areflectometry 3asurface tension1 aThomas, Robert K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0539-08591 aPenfold, Jeffrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2677-27680 tLangmuir.g2020 Sept. 14, v. 36, no. 39 p.11661-11675dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c025343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01347naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008300166300001600249520037400265592002800639653001200667653001400679653002700693653001800720653002000738700002400758700001700782773015500799856008200954852000901036655001201045IND60555046020221118045411.0161026e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055504602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jasc.2014.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToll, Adam D.10aRole of ancillary testing in thyroid fine needle aspiration: Review and update  ap. 218-224.  aThyroid nodules are common, and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration identifies 70-75% as benign, and 4% as malignant.

Indeed, the same stimulus–response pattern is observed at the molecular, cellular, and organismal scales and is not dependent upon the presence of neurons. Hence, a more inclusive theory is required to accommodate aneural forms of habituation. Here an abstraction of the habituation process that does not rely upon particular biological pathways or substrates is presented. Instead, five generalizable elements that define the habituation process are operationalized. The formulation can be applied to interrogate systems as they respond to several stimulation paradigms, providing new insights and supporting existing behavioral data. The model can be used to deduce the relative contribution of elements that contribute to the measurable output of the system. The results suggest that habituation serves as a general biological strategy that any system can implement to adaptively respond to harmless, repetitive stimuli.  aPublisher supplied data  cAllen Foundation 3ahabituation 3alearning 3amodels 3aneurons 3aneurophysiology1 aRouleau, Nicolas1 aLevin, Michael1 aKaplan, David Lee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9245-77740 tBioEssays.g2019 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.e1900028-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2019000283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245019600210300001800406520143300424592002801857650001301885650001501898650002101913650001401934650001501948650001501963650001801978650002501996650001002021650001102031650001402042650001602056650001402072650002902086650001202115651001102127700001702138700001302155773013502168856008202303852000902385655001202394IND60614200720221117002836.0191003e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061420072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-018-1590-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGazzarin, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1492-703X12aA comparison of economic performance between high-yielding temperate breeds and zebu-crossbreds on smallholder dairy farms in Southern Malawi with particular focus on reproductive performance  ap. 1519-1527.  aAs in other sub-Saharan African countries, purebred dairy genetics such as Holsteins were imported to Malawi. The study investigated their economic performance by comparing them with local Zebu-crossbreds based on 131 smallholder dairy farm observations from Southern Malawi. High-yielding purebred cows and crossbred cows showed no significant differences in lactation yield and calving interval. Looking at the farms’ actual costs, by-products such as maize bran clearly dominated the cost structure for both breeds, but crossbreeds showed significantly lower concentrate costs. While there was no statistically significant difference in income for both breed types, a substantial share (23%) of farms under investigation shows negative incomes. Based on survey data, two typical farms were established representing standard costs with homogenous assumptions such as identical milk price. The comparison of typical farms covering the full dairy system clearly indicated that crossbred dairy cows outperformed purebreds. In addition, a simulation of a shorter calving interval for both typical farms revealed a substantial positive impact on income for both breed types with more than 30% increase. We conclude that focusing on crossbreds in combination with improved feeding and fertility management offers a more promising strategy for smallholder dairy farms in Southern Malawi than just acquiring high-yielding purebreds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abyproducts 3acalving interval 3acorn bran 3acrossbreds 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3aeconomic performance 3afarms 3aincome 3alactation 3amilk prices 3apurebreds 3areproductive performance 3asurveys 3aMalawi1 aBanda, M.

In general, a surfactant-induced reduction of yield stress, apparent viscosity and sediment volume of the suspensions coincides with a decrease of adhesive interactions between sugar particles in soybean oil. Although the general influence of individual phospholipids and soybean lecithin is comparable, it is concluded from investigations at low CPLthat individual phospholipids exhibit a less pronounced impact on the analyzed parameters. Furthermore, at low CPL, binary mixtures of the phospholipids are more efficient than individual phospholipids as regards the reduction of yield stress and sediment volume. While the same tendency was detectable for AFM results, these differences were not statistically verified. Slight differences were also evident when comparing individual phospholipids and their influence on rheology and sedimentation which are, however, not in line with the results of AFM. A general understanding of these interrelations between surfactant composition and possible synergistic or antagonistic effects in mixtures of individual phospholipids contributes to optimizing lecithin composition with respect to functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3aphospholipids 3arheology 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3asugars 3aviscosity1 aSchadé, E.,1 aSchneider, Y.1 aFriedrichs, J.1 aBabick, F.1 aWerner, Cynthia,1 aRohm, H.0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2014 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.71-77dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-013-2361-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010000169300002000269500001900289520138100308592002801689650001601717650001301733650001501746650001701761650002101778650001401799650002001813700005301833700001501886700005501901700001201956700005901968773011702027856008402144852000902228655001202237IND60712090020221122035356.0201009e20200924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071209002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c025602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Guangdong10aBlue Light Induced Photopolymerization and Cross-Linking Kinetics of Poly(acrylamide) Hydrogels  ap. 11676-11684.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBlue light induced photopolymerization and photo-cross-linking kinetics of acrylamide (AM), with camphorquinone/diphenyl iodonium hexafluorophosphate (CQ/DPI) as photoinitiators, were investigated. The effects of a number of parameters, including mass fraction of CQ, DPI, and AM (wCQ, wDPI, and wAM) and light intensity (I), on photopolymerization efficiency and photogelation process were systematically studied by photo-differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and photo-rheometry. Photo-DSC indicated that the maximum photopolymerization rate (Rₚ, ₘₐₓ) was proportional to wCQ⁰.⁵, wDPI⁰.⁵, I⁰.⁵, and wAM, while Photo-Rheometry showed linear relationships between gel time tgₑₗ and wCQ and I, respectively, and power law relationships between tgₑₗ and wDPI and wAM, respectively. In addition, both peak cross-linking rate Rc,ₘₐₓ, and delay time td, which were both linearly proportional to wCQ⁰.⁵, wDPI⁰.⁵, and I⁰.⁵, showed power law relationships with wAM. Furthermore, exponential patterns were observed between all these factors, wCQ, wDPI, wAM, and I and plateau modulus G′∞. Combining such correlations obtained from experimental data, an empirical model was established describing the projected mechanical properties of poly(acrylamide) hydrogels from blue light initiated photopolymerization and photo-cross-linking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3abiphenyl 3ablue light 3acrosslinking 3aempirical models 3ahydrogels 3alight intensity1 aHuang, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9758-33501 aLi, Dapeng1 aFan, Qinguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1488-42841 aXu, Jin1 aShao, Jianzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2473-68590 tLangmuir.g2020 Sept. 24, v. 36, no. 39 p.11676-11684dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c025603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245009200165500001100257520096900268592002801237596005901265596005901324596005901383596005901442596005701501596006401558596006701622596006701689596006701756596006701823596007201890596012001962596006202082596009002144650002302234650001802257650002102275650001502296650002802311650002202339650001902361650002002380650002002400700006202420773011302482856007802595852000902673655001202682IND60648740220221122201404.0190701e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064874022DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2018002272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShigetomi, Kenta10aCell Adhesion Structures in Epithelial Cells Are Formed in Dynamic and Cooperative Ways  aREVIEW  aThere are many morphologically distinct membrane structures with different functions at the surface of epithelial cells. Among these, adherens junctions (AJ) and tight junctions (TJ) are responsible for the mechanical linkage of epithelial cells and epithelial barrier function, respectively. In the process of new cell–cell adhesion formation between two epithelial cells, such as after wounding, AJ form first and then TJ form on the apical side of AJ. This process is very complicated because AJ formation triggers drastic changes in the organization of actin cytoskeleton, the activity of Rho family of small GTPases, and the lipid composition of the plasma membrane, all of which are required for subsequent TJ formation. In this review, the authors focus on the relationship between AJ and TJ as a representative example of specialization of plasma membrane regions and introduce recent findings on how AJ formation promotes the subsequent formation of TJ.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP19H03227cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP17J00211cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP17H06012cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP19H04968cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJPMJPR12A4cJapan Science and Technology Corporation  a15664862cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development  aJP19H03227cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI  aJP17J00211cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI  aJP17H06012cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI  aJP19H04968cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI  a15664862cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development–PRIME  aJPMJPR12A4cThe Japan Science and Technology Corporation–Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology  cMSD Life Science Foundation and Takeda Science Foundation  ca Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Research Fellowship for Young Scientists 3aadherens junctions 3acell adhesion 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3alipid composition 3amicrofilaments 3aplasma membrane 3atight junctions1 aIkenouchi, Junichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2936-35480 tBioEssays.g2019 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.e1800227-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2018002273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001100181245009600192300001800288506007600306520111600382592002801498506003701526650002401563650001901587650001401606650001901620650001101639650001101650650002401661700002101685700001401706773012901720856007401849852000901923655001201932IND60663073720221207051725.0190909e20121119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066307372DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ib20044a2doi7 aPMC35027152pmcid7 a230804102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yu10aInter-cellular signaling network reveals a mechanistic transition in tumor microenvironment  ap. 1478-1486.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe conducted inter-cellular cytokine correlation and network analysis based upon a stochastic population dynamics model that comprises five cell types and fifteen signaling molecules inter-connected through a large number of cell–cell communication pathways. We observed that the signaling molecules are tightly correlated even at very early stages (e.g. the first month) of human glioma, but such correlation rapidly diminishes when tumor grows to a size that can be clinically detected. Further analysis suggests that paracrine is shown to be the dominant force during tumor initiation and priming, while autocrine supersedes it and supports a robust tumor expansion. In correspondence, the cytokine correlation network evolves through an increasing to decreasing complexity. This study indicates a possible mechanistic transition from the microenvironment-controlled, paracrine-based regulatory mechanism to self-sustained rapid progression to fetal malignancy. It also reveals key nodes that are responsible for such transition and can be potentially harnessed for the design of new anti-cancer therapies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautocrine signaling 3acancer therapy 3acytokines 3adynamic models 3aglioma 3ahumans 3apopulation dynamics1 aGarmire, Lana X.1 aFan, Rong0 tIntegrative biology.g2012 Nov. 19, v. 4, no. 12 p.1478-1486dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ib20044a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005600155245012300211520153800334592002801872650002201900650002201922650001601944650001001960650001301970650001401983650000701997650001902004650002002023650001502043650001302058650001702071650001702088650000902105650001502114653002902129653001602158653001902174653001602193653002002209700001802229700001402247700001802261700001602279700001402295773009102309856009002400852000902490655001202499IND60730001120221122031246.0220103e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073000112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1301192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wenyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6315-253310aThiosulfate enhanced degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution with g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation  aDeveloping new strategies to design more practicable and efficient g-C₃N₄ based photocatalysts is important to solve the environmental issues. Thiosulfate (STS) is a common residual product found in wastewater and removal of STS remains a matter of great environmental concern. In this work, however, STS is activated by g-C₃N₄ under visible light irradiation, resulting in a fast degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and other pollutants. The performance of g-C₃N₄ prepared from urea was much higher than that from melamine, due to the higher surface area and more negative conduction band potential of the former catalyst. In addition, comparison with other oxidants and reductants such as peroxymonosulfate, peroxydisulfate, hydrogen peroxide and sulfite, the use of STS in g-C₃N₄/Vis system showed the highest efficiency for RhB degradation. During ten successive cycles, the excellent reusability of the catalyst was also obtained. The effect of different concentrations of STS and g-C₃N₄, and initial solution pH on the performance of the system were also studied. The mechanism study suggests that STS is first oxidized to S₂O₃⁻ radicals by photohole, which will be transformed to other oxysulfur radicals such as SO₃⁻ and finally to SO₄²⁻ ions. At the same time, the rate of O₂ reduction by photoelectrons to O₂⁻ radicals as well as RhB degradation increases. The finding of this study provides a promising advanced oxidation process for organic pollutants degradation via STS activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airradiation 3alight 3amelamine 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotocatalysts 3areducing agents 3arhodamines 3asulfites 3asurface area 3athiosulfates 3aurea 3awastewater 0aGraphitic carbon nitride 0aThiosulfate 0aPhotocatalysis 0aRhodamine B 0aSuperoxide ions1 aYin, Chuankun1 aJin, Yezi1 aFeng, Xianjie1 aLi, Xiaoxia1 aXu, Aihua0 tChemosphere.g2021 July, v. 275 p.130119-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1301193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015300159300002000312520061300332592002800945650004600973650001301019650001601032650001201048650001501060650001301075700002201088700001801110700001901128700002001147700002101167700002001188773012401208856007401332852000901406655001201415IND60642241220221118193705.0190506e20171207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064224122DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra11622e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatveev, P.

Microorganisms can reduce, methylate, and assimilate Se, controlling the transport and fate of Se in the environment. However, the mechanisms controlling these microbial activities are still poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown how the negatively charged Se(IV) and Se(VI) oxyanions that dominate the aqueous Se speciation in oxidizing environments bind to negatively charged microbial cell surfaces in order to become bioavailable. Here, we show that the adsorption of selenite onto Bacillus subtilis bacterial cells is controlled by cell envelope sulfhydryl sites. Once adsorbed onto the bacteria, selenite is reduced and forms reduced organo-Se compounds (e.g., R₁S–Se–SR₂). Because sulfhydryl sites are present within cell envelopes of a wide range of bacterial species, sulfhydryl-controlled adsorption of selenite likely represents a general mechanism adopted by bacteria to make selenite bioavailable. Therefore, sulfhydryl binding of selenite likely occurs in a wide range of oxidized Se-bearing environments, and because it is followed by microbial conversion of selenite to other Se species, the process represents a crucial step in the global cycling of Se.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aadsorption 3abacteria 3amicrobial activity 3aoxidation 3aoxyanions 3aselenites 3aselenium1 aBoyanov, Maxim I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8758-52481 aLiu, Jinling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9989-65501 aKemner, Kenneth M.1 aFein, Jeremy B.0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Aug. 21, v. 52, no. 18 p.10400-10407dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b022803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245003000178520101000208592002801218650001501246650001601261650002501277653002501302653001001327653001601337700002501353773010301378856008501481852000901566655001201575IND60643009220221122143437.0200330e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064300922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2019.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouston, Alexander J.H.14aThe overall discount rate  aDiscounting refers to the way in which the value of an outcome depends on the delay until it is obtained. If an organism’s discount function is known, then its rate of discounting at any delay can be found. If the function is not known, the normalised area under an estimate of the discount function has been used as a measure that summarises the strength of discounting over a range of delays. We propose a new measure of the strength of discounting: the overall discount rate W, which is the drop in value from the start to the end of the value curve divided by the area under this curve. We show that our measure has various advantages over the normalised area, namely it can be linked to the instantaneous rate of discounting and it respects the special nature of exponential discounting. It does not give a unique value to each curve, but we prove that this is incompatible with the requirement that similar discount functions be assigned similar values, and so this is not a defect of the measure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestimation 3ameasurement 3astatistical analysis 0aArea under the curve 0aDelay 0aDiscounting1 aHouston, Alasdair I.0 tBehavioural processes.g2019 Oct., v. 167 p.103856-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013200167300001600299520096200315592002801277650001301305650001101318650001901329650002001348650001901368650001401387650003301401650002001434650000701454650001501461650001301476650002501489650001601514650001501530653002601545653001501571653005001586653003901636653002401675700001701699700001601716700001401732773011301746856008601859852000901945655001201954IND60625616920221117014138.0190321e20190220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062561692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.11.2532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zifeng10aRecovery of phosphate from piggery biogas slurry by ultrasonication, aeration and addition of MgO desulfurization waste residue  ap. 865-873.  aThe traditional phosphorus recovery process for piggery wastewater has not utilized the large amount of phosphorus in the biogas residue, resulting in a low phosphorus recovery percentage. This study uses an ultrasonic pretreatment step to release phosphorus from the biogas residue using magnesium oxide desulfurization waste residue (MDWR) as a low-cost magnesium source. CO2 is removed by aeration stripping to increase the pH of the system. The results showed that when the ultrasonication time was 80 min and the ultrasonic energy density was 1000 W·L−1, the phosphorus release was increased by 109.31%. Using an MDWR addition amount of 0.8 g·L−1, initial pH of 9.5, and aeration time of 2 h, the recovery percentage of PO43--P was 98.90%, the best recovery effect. The analysis shows that the recovered product is mainly struvite. The ultrasonic and aeration/MDWR addition combination process is thus considered to be a promising technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3adesulfurization 3aenergy density 3amagnesium 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amagnesium oxide 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aslurries 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3awastewater 0aPiggery biogas slurry 0aUltrasonic 0aMagnesium oxide desulfurization waste residue 0aMagnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) 0aPhosphorus recovery1 aPeng, Junjie1 aWang, Dehan1 aYang, Jie0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Feb. 20, v. 211 p.865-873dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.11.2533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245008600208300002000294520071400314592002801028650002301056650001101079650002301090650001701113700002601130700006401156773013801220856008001358852000901438655001201447IND60750022620221117233858.0210910e20210825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075002262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c053622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpkins, Blake S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7866-670810aMode-Specific Chemistry through Vibrational Strong Coupling (or A Wish Come True)  ap. 19081-19087.  aVibrational strong coupling offers newfound potential to affect chemical processes and represents a wholly new approach to catalysis.

This paper investigates the potential for using nitrate (NO₃−) ion selective electrodes (ISEs) and dual wavelength UV spectroscopy as part of a rapid soil NO₃− diagnostic test. Three soil types, representing the major soil types for agriculture in the western UK, were tested. For the three soils, the ISE rapid test procedure gave a near 1:1 response (r2 = 0.978, 0.968, 0.989) compared to the internationally-approved standard laboratory method. However, the accuracy of the ISE rapid test was reduced at low soil NO₃− concentrations (<10 mg NO₃− L−1). We also show that NO₃− analysis of H₂O soil extracts by dual wavelength UV spectroscopy was also highly correlated (r2 = 0.978, 0.983, 0.991) to the standard laboratory method. We conclude that both ISE and dual wavelength UV spectroscopy have clear potential to be used for the rapid on-farm determination of soil NO₃− concentration. Barriers to use of these field-based assessment tools include, farmer perception of cost-benefit, general attitude to new technologies and the ability to generate useful fertiliser use strategies from soil NO₃− measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarmers' attitudes 3afertilizer application 3alaboratory techniques 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3asoil types 3aspecific ion electrodes 3atechnology 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awavelengths 3aUnited Kingdom1 aWilliams, A.

Many rice breeders have tried their best to screen low-retrogradation rice cultivars without a specific indicator. To identify the main retrogradation-related properties of rice, the starch, amylose, and amylopectin from 16 rice cultivars were extracted from rice powder and their physicochemical properties, such as visible absorbance, infrared, average molecule weight (amylopectin), chain-length distribution (amylopectin), X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry, were determined. The correlation between starch retrogradation rates and those physicochemical properties was investigated. The results show that a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.85; r = 0.926; p < 0.01) exists only between proportions of the chains [degree of polymerization (DP) > 10] in amylopectin and the retrogradation rates of different rice starches. The findings in the paper offer a shortcut for rice breeders to screen cultivars with a low retrogradation rate. Because the genes related to the branching enzyme control the DP of amylopectin, they can be exploited as molecular markers to screen low-retrogradation rice cultivars. 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorbance 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acultivars 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymerization 3aretrogradation 3arice 3arice starch 3ashelf life 3atraditional foods1 aKang, Haiqi1 aSun, Haibo1 aLiu, Lizeng1 aLi, Lin0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Feb. 11, v. 63, no. 5 p.1562-1572dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf503203r  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009100165300001800256520123600274592002801510650001501538650001401553650001601567650000901583650001401592650001601606700002201622773012501644856008201769852000901851655001201860IND60593234020221119180132.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059323402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-018-1934-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharafati, A.10aAssessment of Dam Overtopping Reliability using SUFI Based Overtopping Threshold Curve  ap. 2369-2383.  aEstimation of earth-fill dam height and dimension of spillway are strongly depend on accurate evaluation of dam overtopping reliability. Ideally, whole random and effective variables on overtopping should be considered for dam overtopping reliability assessment. However, taking into account all affecting random variables as well as overtopping reliability assessment using algorithms such as Monte Carlo (MC) could be excessively time consuming and impossible in some cases. In this study, new approach has been introduced as conditional reliability method and it has been tried to reduce the simulations time significantly by using combination of rainfall threshold theory, SUFI (Sequential Uncertainty Fitting) and MC methods. According two defined indexes, the obtain results shown, the relative error of new approach in computation of Jamishan dam overtopping reliability is less than 0.23%. Also, time saving in new method against to regular MC method is more than 87%. So, the new introduced method has more efficiency with acceptable accuracy for assessment of dam overtopping reliability. In addition, among hydrological and hydraulic uncertainties, hydrological uncertainties have more effect on overtopping reliability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ahydrology 3amethodology 3arain 3aspillways 3auncertainty1 aAzamathulla, H.M.0 tWater resources management.g2018 May, v. 32, no. 7 p.2369-2383dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1934-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010600164300001800270520119200288592002801480650001501508650001301523650002101536650001101557650001701568650001101585650002101596700001301617700002201630700001801652773014101670856007401811852000901885655001201894IND60641686920221118020542.0190506e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064168692DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta06336a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrévot, Mathieu S.10aImproving charge collection with delafossite photocathodes: a host–guest CuAlO₂/CuFeO₂ approach  ap. 3018-3026.  ap-Type delafossite CuFeO₂ has recently been reported as a promising candidate for direct photoelectrochemical solar water reduction in alkaline conditions. However, despite its favorable optical band gap energy and light absorption, this material suffers from poor electron–hole separation that limits its optimum thickness to a few hundred nanometers. This limitation can be addressed by a host–guest strategy, where a mesoporous p-type scaffold is used to support a thin-film of the light absorber. Here we demonstrate this host–guest approach for the first time with CuFeO₂ using p-type transparent CuAlO₂ as a scaffold. Optimizing the scaffold layer thickness at 2 μm resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in photocurrent in the presence of O₂—a sacrificial electron scavenger—reaching 2.4 mA cm⁻² at +0.4 V vs. RHE. Moreover, comparing the performance to host–guest electrodes prepared with an insulating SiO₂ scaffold as a control suggested that the observed improvement with CuAlO₂ was due to a decreased recombination stemming from improved charge separation in addition to improved charge transport through the scaffold compared to the CuFeO₂ film alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acathodes 3aelectric current 3aenergy 3aporous media 3asilica 3asuperoxide anion1 aLi, Yang1 aGuijarro, Néstor1 aSivula, Kevin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 4, no. 8 p.3018-3026dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta06336a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01975naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245010800160300002000268520085100288592002801139650002201167650003001189650002201219650001101241650001101252650001101263650002301274700001501297700001401312700001501326700005701341773013801398856008001536852000901616655001201625IND60750022720221117233639.0210910e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075002272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c054432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zheng10aTheoretical Study of Oxygen Vacancy on Indium Oxide for Promoted Photothermal Catalytic Water Splitting  ap. 19294-19300.  aSolar-induced photothermal catalytic H₂O splitting is a promising method for H₂ production. On metal oxides, the interaction between H₂O and the surface can lead to the formation of oxygen vacancies (VOs) and alter the reaction pathway for overall H₂O splitting. Herein, the free energy profiles of two different pathways on the In₂O₃ (110) surface are calculated based on density functional theory, and the relation between surface VO formation and the reactivity of surface VOs reveals that surface VOs with a lower formation energy are more unfavorable for H₂ evolution. Doping In₂O₃ with a transition metal can effectively enhance the electron transfer from the surface O atoms to the doped metal, benefitting the formation of surface VOs and causing the doped metal to become the active reaction center for H₂O splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3adensity functional theory 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aindium 3aoxygen 3aphysical chemistry1 aLou, Chong1 aZhang, Li1 aXu, Chenyu1 aZhang, Yanwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1055-26800 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 125, no. 35 p.19294-19300dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c054433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245014200206300001800348520132600366592002801692650001501720650001601735650002701751650002201778650002001800650001701820650001301837650001201850650001501862650002101877650001401898650001601912700002401928700005601952700001802008773013602026856008002162852000902242655001202251IND60676871320200514000000.0191122e20191024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067687132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b079912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdhborg, Fredrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5168-293510aSinglet Energy Transfer in Anthracene–Porphyrin Complexes: Mechanism, Geometry, and Implications for Intramolecular Photon Upconversion  ap. 9934-9943.  aIn this work we show that the mechanism for singlet excitation energy transfer (SET) in coordination complexes changes upon changing a single atom. SET is governed by two different mechanisms; Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based on Coulombic, through-space interactions, or Dexter energy transfer relying on exchange, through-bond interactions. On the basis of time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption measurements, we conduct a mechanistic study of SET from a set of photoexcited anthracene donors to axially coordinated porphyrin acceptors, revealing the effect of coordination geometry and a very profound effect of the porphyrin central metal atom. We found that FRET is the dominating mechanism of SET for complexes with zinc-octaethylporphyrin (ZnOEP) as the acceptor, while Dexter energy transfer is the dominating mechanism of SET in a corresponding ruthenium complex (RuOEP). In addition, by analyzing the coordination geometry of the complexes and its temperature dependence, the binding angle potential energy of axially coordinated porphyrin complexes could be estimated. The results of this study are of fundamental importance and are discussed with respect to the consequences for developing intramolecular triplet–triplet annihilation photon upconversion in coordination complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanthracenes 3acoordination compounds 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3ageometry 3aphotons 3aporphyrins 3apotential energy 3aruthenium 3atemperature1 aKüçüköz, Betül1 aGray, Victor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6583-86541 aAlbinsson, Bo0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Oct. 24, v. 123, no. 46 p.9934-9943dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b079913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008400167300001600251520118700267592002801454650000801482650003001490650001601520650001401536650002201550650001801572650001501590650004501605650005201650650001001702651001001712651001001722700001701732700001901749700001901768700002101787700001801808700001901826700002101845773011301866856008401979852000902063655001202072IND60549488720221120231034.0160908e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054948872DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-06-13-0150-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhki, Takehiro10aBiological and Genetic Diversity of Wheat yellow mosaic virus (Genus Bymovirus)  ap. 313-319.  aThe biological and genetic diversity of Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) isolates in Japan was characterized. On the basis of wheat cultivar reactions, 14 WYMV isolates from various places were classified into pathotypes I, II, or III. These were distributed in central, northern, and southern areas of Japan, respectively. WYMV isolates comprised three genotypes (A, A′ and B) based on amino acid differences in RNA1 and two genotypes (a and b) based on amino acid differences in RNA2. A correlation was found between the WYMV RNA1-based genotype and pathotype, suggesting that factors associated with pathogenicity map to RNA1. Genotype Aa and A′a were distributed mainly in the central to southern areas of Japan, and genotype Bb was found in northern areas of Japan, as shown by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Chinese isolates YA and YZ were closely related to genotypes Bb and Aa, respectively. Wheat was introduced from China to Japan in the 4th and 5th centuries, and the two genotypes of WYMV might also have been introduced with the crop from China and later adapted to local wheat cultivars in Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aWheat yellow mosaic virus 3aamino acids 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3apathogenicity 3apathotypes 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3awheat 3aChina 3aJapan1 aNetsu, Osamu1 aKojima, Hisayo1 aSakai, Junichi1 aOnuki, Masatoshi1 aMaoka, Tetsuo1 aShirako, Yukio1 aSasaya, Takahide0 tPhytopathology.g2014 Mar., v. 104, no. 3 p.313-319dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-06-13-0150-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012000167300001600287520124600303592002801549650001501577650001301592650001201605650001601617650001501633650001201648650000901660653001301669653000901682653001301691653000901704653000901713653001601722700002201738700005701760773010301817856008501920852000902005655001202014IND60643009520221122123226.0190906e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064300952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2019.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoser, Julia10aExecuting specific foraging behaviours does not represent a general goal state of foraging in dry sows (Sus scrofa)  ap. 115-122.  aIntensively housed domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) have little opportunity to perform diverse foraging behaviour though they still seem strongly motivated to do so. Here, we investigated whether the execution of specific behaviours may in itself satisfy their foraging motivation.We elicited the specific foraging behaviours rooting, grazing, and biting & chewing by providing 24 dry sows with three different substrates. Sows visited three pens consecutively. Two of the three substrates were offered one in pen 1 and the other in pen 2, whereas pen 3 provided the three substrates simultaneously. In the control condition, all three materials were provided in all pens.In pen 1 and 2, the sows predominantly showed those foraging behaviours that were to be elicited by the specific substrates. Sows spent less time in pens with a single substrate compared with when all substrates were available. Moreover, durations of the specific behaviours which had not been performed in pen 1 and 2 increased in pen 3. Finally, the lowest proportion of time was spent in pen 3 in the control condition.In conclusion, the results indicate that performing single behaviours of the foraging repertoire did not satisfy the sows’ overall foraging motivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3aforaging 3agrazing 3amastication 3amotivation 3arooting 3asows 0aFunction 0aGoal 0aForaging 0aPigs 0aFeed 0aExploration1 aBurla, Joan-Bryce1 aGygax, Lorenz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8546-29300 tBehavioural processes.g2019 July, v. 164 p.115-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01462naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245007800176300001400254520058200268592002800850650001500878650001200893650001000905650002300915650001300938651001600951773013900967856005701106852000901163655001201172IND4480342220221118204353.0120418e196812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448034222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1968.tb00047.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCartwright, Wayne10aOptimizing the transfer of tax exemptions in new zealand farm development  ap. 42-51.  aFarmers and their advisers frequently face complex problems involving the scheduling of claims for tax exemptions.

The latter procedure is intended for use with forecast budgeting in farm development planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3afarmers 3afarms 3alinear programming 3aplanning 3aNew Zealand0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g1968 Dec., v. 12, no. 2 p.42-51dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8489.1968.tb00047.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002400137245010000161300001800261520142000279650004401699650001701743650002001760650001701780650002101797650000901818650002301827650001801850650002401868650001401892650002001906650000701926650002401933650001201957700002001969700002701989773016102016856004002177852000902217655001202226IND4535129720221120025439.0160314e20150211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453512972DNAL7 a10.1021/jf504184u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Danny M. T.10aDegradation of Hydroxycinnamic Acid Mixtures in Aqueous Sucrose Solutions by the Fenton Process  ap. 1582-1592.  aThe degradation efficiencies and behaviors of caffeic acid (CaA), p-coumaric acid (pCoA), and ferulic acid (FeA) in aqueous sucrose solutions containing the mixture of these hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) were studied by the Fenton oxidation process. Central composite design and multiresponse surface methodology were used to evaluate and optimize the interactive effects of process parameters. Four quadratic polynomial models were developed for the degradation of each individual acid in the mixture and the total HCAs degraded. Sucrose was the most influential parameter that significantly affected the total amount of HCA degraded. Under the conditions studied there was a <0.01% loss of sucrose in all reactions. The optimal values of the process parameters for a 200 mg/L HCA mixture in water (pH 4.73, 25.15 Â°C) and sucrose solution (13 mass %, pH 5.39, 35.98 Â°C) were 77% and 57%, respectively. Regression analysis showed goodness of fit between the experimental results and the predicted values. The degradation behavior of CaA differed from those of pCoA and FeA, where further CaA degradation is observed at increasing sucrose and decreasing solution pH. The differences (established using UV/vis and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy) were because, unlike the other acids, CaA formed a complex with Fe(III) or with Fe(III) hydrogen-bonded to sucrose and coprecipitated with lepidocrocite, an iron oxyhydroxide. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acaffeic acid 3acoprecipitation 3aferulic acid 3ahydrogen bonding 3airon 3airon oxyhydroxides 3alepidocrocite 3amathematical models 3aoxidation 3ap-coumaric acid 3apH 3aregression analysis 3asucrose1 aZhang, Zhanying1 aDoherty, William O.

This bacterium produces diverse antifungal factors, such as lytic enzymes and a secondary metabolite (heat-stable antifungal factor [HSAF]) having antifungal activity with a novel structure and mode of action. The regulatory mechanisms for biosynthesis of antifungal factors is largely unknown in L. enzymogenes. The solo LuxR proteins have been shown to be widespread, playing important roles in plant-associated bacteria. Here, we cloned and studied a solo LuxR protein, LesR, from L. enzymogenes strain OH11. Overexpression but not deletion of lesR significantly impaired HSAF biosynthesis levels and antimicrobial activities but did not show visible effect on production of major lytic enzymes. Overexpression of lesR also led to remarkably accelerated cell aggregation and induced production of a melanin-like pigment in L. enzymogenes; these two phenotypes are mediated by the diffusible factor cell-to-cell signaling system of L. enzymogenes. The C-terminus helix-turn-helix domain was shown to be critical for several lesR-controlled functions. Overall, our study provides the first example of the roles and mechanisms of a solo LuxR protein in a plant-associated L. enzymogenes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLysobacter enzymogenes 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3abiological control agents 3abiosynthesis 3aenzymes 3agene overexpression 3aheat stability 3amechanism of action 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3asecondary metabolites 0aquorum sensing1 aXu, Feifei1 aVenturi, Vittorio1 aDu, Liangcheng1 aLiu, Fengquan0 tPhytopathology.g2014 Mar., v. 104, no. 3 p.224-231dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-07-13-0188-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010500162300001400267520093000281592002801211650001601239650000801255650001701263650001601280650001401296650003101310650001001341650002301351650001101374650001501385650002401400650001601424650001301440650001001453650001301463650001001476650001201486650002201498700001501520700001101535700001501546700001701561700001601578773009101594856008101685852000901766655001201775IND60120786820221118103125.0150211e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012078682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-014-0461-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSha, A.

ZhongDou 24 (ZD24) exhibiting delayed flowering when grown under long-days (LD, a 16-h photoperiod) was used to identify the genetic control of flowering delay. A differential expression profiling technique enabled identification of a gene fragment that was up-regulated under LD. This fragment was homologous to a gene encoding methionine synthase (MS) in soybean and was named GmMS. The RNA content confirmed that GmMS was expressed in roots, stems, and leaves of soybean grown under LD. The highest expression was in stems. Full length GmMS, encoding 763 amino acids, was transferred into tobacco plants. The ectopic expression of GmMS in tobacco resulted in delayed flowering. Other effects included stunting, an increased MS activity and methionine content, a higher content of alcohol-soluble proteins and of chlorophylls, and a lower content of anthocyanins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aRNA 3aanthocyanins 3achlorophyll 3aflowering 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3amethionine 3amethionine synthase 3aphotoperiod 3aproteins 3aroots 3asoybeans 3astems 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants1 aGao, Z.

To date, few studies have investigated consumersâ acceptance of wines made using non-traditional oak treatments. In this study, two Cabernet Sauvignon wines were aged using traditional (i.e., barrel) and/or alternative (i.e., stainless steel or plastic tanks and vats, with oak wood added) maturation regimens. Chemical and sensory analyses were subsequently performed to determine the influence on wine composition and sensory properties, that is, the presence of key oak-derived volatile compounds and perceptible oak aromas and flavor. The quality of a subset of wines was rated by a panel of 10 wine experts using a 20-point scoring system, with all wines considered technically sound. Consumer acceptance of wines was also determined. Hedonic ratings ranged from 5.7 to 5.9 (on a 9-point scale), indicating there was no significant difference in consumersâ overall liking of each wine. However, segmentation based on individual liking scores identified three distinct clusters comprising consumers with considerably different wine preferences. These results justify wine producersâ use of alternative oak maturation regimens to achieve wine styles that appeal to different segments of their target market. 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumers (people) 3aexperts 3aflavor 3aoak barrels 3aodors 3aprices 3aproduction costs 3asensory evaluation 3astainless steel 3atanks 3avolatile compounds 3awines 3awood1 aJohnson, Trent E.1 aWilkinson, Kerry L.1 aBastian, Susan E.

In our previous study, transcriptional profiling of PRRSV-infected lung tissue of Tongcheng and landrane pigs, which have highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) susceptibility differences, showed differential expression of Rab11a. The small GTPase Rab11a regulates intracellular membrane trafficking events involved in autophagy. However, the involvement of convergence of endosomal Rab11a and autophagy pathways during PRRSV infection is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that PRRSV infection induced complete autophagy and up-regulated the expression of Rab11a. Furthermore, interference of the expression of Rab11a resulted in the accumulation of endogenous LC3-II and p62, indicating that Rab11a played vital role in autophagosome maturation. Silencing of Rab11a resulted in a compromise of the expression of intracellular viral NSP2 and ORF7. Besides, confocal microscopy analysis showed that viral NSP2 was colocalized with Rab11a in Marc145 cells. Collectively, our findings revealed that Rab11a act as a proviral host factor that benefited PRRSV replication in a manner that correlates with autophagy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aautophagy 3acell membranes 3aconfocal microscopy 3afinancial economics 3agene expression regulation 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aindustry 3alungs 3aphysiological transport 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3aswine 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aPRRSV 0aRab11a 0aAutophagy 0aReplication 0aNSP21 aLi, Shuaifeng1 aWorku, Tesfaye1 aHao, Xingjie1 aYang, Liaohan1 aZhang, Shujun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245020600204300001600410500002000426520103400446592002801480650001201508650001901520650002401539650001001563650001601573650001201589650001601601650001401617700006201631700006601693700006201759700006801821700007601889700006901965700007902034700006002113700006302173700006402236773013502300856007302435852000902508655001202517IND60686997520221122063521.0200322e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068699752DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.125282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Gisele J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1357-854410aComputed tomographic and radiographic morphometric study of cardiac and coelomic dimensions in captive blue‐fronted Amazon parrots (Amazona aestiva, Linnaeus, 1758) with varying body condition scores  ap. 299-306.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to assess radiographic and tomographic cardiac parameters, including width and length of the heart, and the ratio of heart width to coelom width of blue‐fronted Amazon parrots (Amazona aestiva) with varying body condition scores.

No differences were observed among the groups with regard to radiographic and tomographic measurements. Computed tomography enabled better identification of the structures of the cardiovascular system without interference from the overlying structures of the celomatic cavity observed in radiographic images. However, radiographic examinations should still be considered the standard screening method to identify cardiac alterations, such as increased or reduced organ dimensions. Standardizing the techniques and measurements performed in this study may serve as a basis for further research in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmazona 3abody condition 3acomputed tomography 3aheart 3amorphometry 3aparrots 3aradiography 3ascreening1 ada Silva, Jeana P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2852-62881 aHippólito, Alícia G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4097-91321 aFerro, Bárbara S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1286-16791 aOliveira, Elton Luís R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2891-13431 aOkamoto, Priscylla Tatiana C.

By applying PROMETHEE method, locations of potential environmental risk were determined and ranked according to the quality of water. Using its visual modeling option GAIA, the most dominant variables that affect the quality of water at certain locations were identified as polluting parameters (suspended matter, BOD-5, total N, NH4-N and PO4-P). Concentrations of identified pollutants were compared with limits of both EU and national recommendations so the actual water quality of the river was determined. The results showed that although WQI analysis indicated good and very good water quality, extension with MCDM methods revealed that there is a significant excess in values of PO4-P and E.coli at almost every location on the course of the river, as well as in values of total N and NH4-N. Proposed combined approach could serve to engineers and decision makers involved in water quality management in creating more detailed reports on water quality while facilitating the process of decision-making in the choice of selection of particular locations with critical water quality, where appropriate measures for remediation of pollution should be taken.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aalgorithms 3aammonium nitrogen 3aengineers 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3apollutants 3apollution 3aremediation 3arisk 3ariver water 3arivers 3awater quality 3aDanube River 3aSerbia1 aTakić, Lj.1 aNikolić, Đ.0 tWater resources management.g2018 May, v. 32, no. 7 p.2261-2276dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1927-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011000211300001100321500001900332520125100351592002801602596007701630650001901707650002401726650002001750650001601770650001901786650001401805650001401819650001601833650001901849651001101868773014901879856008302028852000902111655001202120IND60724038520221119225333.0210216e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072403852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-08850-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzydatek, Grzegorz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6603-613510aUsing advanced statistical tools to assess the impact of a small landfill site on the aquatic environment  ap. 71.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of the study was to assess the impact of a small municipal landfill on the aquatic environment over 9 years, using advanced statistical tools. The results of the study of surface, ground- and leachate waters from 2008 to 2016 were subjected to detailed statistical analysis based on 15 physicochemical indicators. Factor analysis accounted for the requirements of the WHO, the European Union and the nation of Poland using 8 statistical analytical methods. The analysis of leachate contamination from the landfill site with the use of advanced statistical tools revealed its interaction with groundwater. The assessment was based on increased and statistically significant values and correlations of temperature, Zn and N–NO₃ between leachate and groundwater, factors demonstrating the negative impact of the landfill. In the case of Zn, there was also a correlation between the tested waters below the landfill. The increased PAH values in the examined surface and ground waters were not a consequence of waste disposal. However, the deterioration of the chemical state of groundwater in the vicinity of the landfill could result from a certain dysfunction of the facility’s infrastructure after operating for more than 20 years.  aPublisher supplied data  aDNR.350-8/20cState University of Applied Sceinces in Nowy Sącz, Poland 3aEuropean Union 3aaquatic environment 3afactor analysis 3agroundwater 3ainfrastructure 3alandfills 3aleachates 3atemperature 3awaste disposal 3aPoland0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Feb., v. 193, no. 2 p.71-71dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-08850-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011500158300002000273520186300293592002802156650001502184650000902199650001302208650001602221650001102237700002002248700003302268773013502301856007502436852000902511655001202520IND60538648220170620000000.0160815e20120912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053864822DNAL7 a10.1021/ja303592q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogt, R. Aaron10aSubpicosecond Intersystem Crossing in Mono- and Di(organophosphine)gold(I) Naphthalene Derivatives in Solution  ap. 14808-14817.  aFemtosecond-to-microsecond broadband transient absorption experiments are reported for Cy₃PAu(2-naphthyl) (1), (Cy₃PAu)₂(2,6-naphthalenediyl) (2), and (Cy₃PAu)₂(2,7-naphthalenediyl) (3), where Cy = cyclohexyl. Global and target analyses of the data, based on a sequential kinetic model, reveal four spectral components. These components are assigned to (1) excited state absorption (ESA) of the ligand-centered S₁ state; (2) ESA of a receiver ligand-to-metal or metal-to-ligand charge transfer triplet state (τ₁ ≤ 300 fs); (3) ESA of the vibrationally excited, ligand-centered T₁ state (τ₃ = 7–10 ps); and (4) ESA of the relaxed T₁ state. Intersystem crossing (ISC) occurs in hundreds of femtoseconds, while internal conversion (IC) in the triplet manifold is slow (τ₂ ≈ 2 ps). The relaxed T₁ state shows biphasic decay kinetics in 2 and 3 with lifetimes of hundreds of picoseconds and hundreds of nanoseconds in air-saturated conditions, while only monophasic decay is observed in 1 under identical conditions. The primary decay pathway of the T₁ state is assigned to quenching by O₂, while the secondary channel is tentatively assigned to self-quenching or triplet–triplet annihilation. The ISC rate in 1 is not modulated significantly by the incorporation of a second heavy-atom group effecter. Instead, the position at which the second Au(I)–phosphine group is attached plays a noticeable role in the ISC rate, showing a 3-fold decrease in that of 2 compared to that of 3. The results challenge the conventional view that the rate of IC is larger than that of ISC, lending further support to the emerging kinetic model proposed for other transition-metal complexes. Gold(I) now joins the exclusive group of transition metals known to form organometallic complexes exhibiting excited-state nonequilibrium dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3agold 3akinetics 3anaphthalene 3aoxygen1 aGray, Thomas G.1 aCrespo-Hernández, Carlos E.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Sept. 12, v. 134, no. 36 p.14808-14817dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja303592q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245006700202300001600269500002000285520173100305592002802036650000902064650000902073650001702082650001102099650001202110700005702122700005902179773013502238856007302373852000902446655001202455IND60686997620221122063408.0200322e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068699762DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.125232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakkı Nur, İsmail1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7215-811210aOrigin and distribution of the brachial plexus of the Van cats  ap. 251-259.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aKnowing the structure and variations of the plexus brachialis is important in neck and shoulder surgery. The knowledge of the brachial plexus reduces the injury rate of the nerves in surgical interventions to the axillary region. The major nerve trunks of the thoracic limb were the suprascapular, subscapular, axillary, radial, musculocutaneous, median and ulnar nerves. In Van cats, the brachial plexus was formed by the ventral branches of the spinal nerves, C6‐C7‐C8 and T1. The 7th cervical nerve was quite thick compared to the others. The subscapular nerve was the thinnest (on the right side, the average length was 6.55 ± 0.60 mm and on the left side was 6.50 ± 0.60 mm), and the radial nerve was the thickest (the average length on the right side was 28.48 ± 0.44 mm and on the left side was 29.11 ± 0.55 mm). The suprascapular nerve was formed by the ventral branch of the 6th cervical nerve. The subscapular nerves were formed by a branch originating from the 6th cervical nerve and the two medial and caudal branches originating from the 7th cervical nerve. No communicating branch between the ulnar nerve and the median nerve was observed in the palmar region. The axillary nerve was formed by the ventral branches of the 7th nerve, the musculocutaneous nerve was formed by ventral branches of the 6th and 7th cervical nerves, and the ulnar nerve was formed by ventral branches of the 8th cervical and the 1st thoracic nerves. The radial nerve was the thickest branch in the brachial plexus. In Van cats, the origin and distribution of nerves were similar to those reported in the literature for other species of cats, with the exception of the suprascapular, subscapular and axillary nerves.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3aneck 3anerve tissue 3aplexus 3asurgery1 aKeleş, Hacı1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0770-82691 aPérez, William1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9647-47310 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2020 Mar., v. 49, no. 2 p.251-259dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.125233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245009400159300001200253520127200265592002801537650002401565650001101589650001301600650001501613650001401628650001401642700001801656700005501674700001501729773014001744856008201884852000901966655001201975IND60593234520221119175956.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059323452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3788-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yue10aAdvancement and Challenges of Microplastic Pollution in the Aquatic Environment: a Review  ap. 140.  aAs a new persistent environmental pollutant, microplastic pollution has attracted great interest recently. Microplastic particles are distributed widely throughout the world’s freshwaters, oceans, and seas, including the water column and sediments reaching as far as the deep sea. However, the practical considerations and protocols for microplastic pollution have, to the best of our knowledge, not been reviewed properly with regard to assessing their distribution, biotoxicity, sampling, and identification in the aquatic environment. In this review, the implications of microplastic pollution, including its wide distribution, biotoxicity threats, sampling, and identification challenges in the aquatic environment , were discussed and evaluated. The challenges and perspective of the related research are also presented to identify knowledge gaps and to prioritize future research needs.

In order to predict the properties of these systems, we used quantum mechanics (PBE flavor of density functional theory) to predict the most stable conformations of MTO and MTO3N and their optimum packing into the most stable crystal structures. We found that MTO has the P2₁ space-group with a density of ρ = 1.92 g cm⁻³ while MTO3N has the P2₁/c space-group with a density of ρ = 2.10 g cm⁻³. The heats of reaction (ΔHᵣₓₙ) were computed to be 1036 kcal kg⁻¹ for MTO, 1412 kcal kg⁻¹ for MTO3N, and 1653 kcal kg⁻¹ for a mixture of them. These properties are comparable to those of such other useful energetic materials as RDX (ρ = 1.80 g cm⁻³, ΔHᵣₓₙ = 1266 kcal kg⁻¹), HMX, and PETN, making MTO and MTO3N excellent candidates for environmentally friendly HEDMs. In addition, we predicted the stability of –NH₂, –NO, and –NO₂ groups in water solution. We also show that the ReaxFF-lg reactive FF leads to an accurate description of the structural properties of MTO and MTO3N crystals making it practical to carry out large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations practical for these systems to determine the sensitivity and performance (CJ point calculation and velocity) under shear, shock, and thermal loads.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy density 3aflavor 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular models 3aprediction 3aquantum mechanics 3asimulation models1 aZybin, Sergey1 aYe, Cai-Chao1 aGoddard III, William A.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Jan. 19, v. 4, no. 4 p.1264-1276dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta06426k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010900164300001100273500001900284520158500303592002801888650001601916650001601932650001801948650001501966650003101981650001402012650001202026650001302038650001902051650001402070650001502084650001502099700001902114700002102133700001802154700002202172773014902194856008302343852000902426655001202435IND60724038720221119225247.0210216e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072403872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-08865-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Adiba10aBiomarker-based evaluation of cytogenotoxic potential of glyphosate in Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper genotypes  ap. 73.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerbicides have proven to be a boon for agricultural fields. Their inherent property to kill weeds and unwanted vegetation makes them an essential biological tool for farmers and agricultural systems. Besides being capable of destroying weeds, they also exhibit certain effects on non-target crop plants. In the present study, a laboratory experiment was performed to assess the effect of glyphosate on Vigna mungo root meristem cells. Seeds of five different genotypes of V. mungo were treated with a series of concentrations of glyphosate ranging from 1 to 10 mM, and their effects on mitotic cell division were studied. Healthy and uniform-sized seeds were selected and were allowed to grow in Petri plates for 3 days, and all the doses were maintained in triplicates. Roots were fixed at day 3 after treatment (DAT) for cytological microscopic slide preparation. The results obtained indicate the dose-dependent reduction in the mitotic index in all the genotypes and an increase in the percentage of chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and relative abnormality rate (RAR). Most commonly observed chromosome aberrations at lower doses (< 6 mM) were fragments, stickiness, and disoriented metaphase, while at higher doses (6 to 10 mM) bridges, laggards, spindle disorientation, and clumping were obvious. The increase in the percentage of CAs and RAR indicates the inhibitory effect of glyphosate on cell cycle progression at various stages in root tip cells. The present study is a fine example of a biomarker-based genotoxic assessment of mitotic damage caused by glyphosate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna mungo 3achromosomes 3adose response 3aglyphosate 3alaboratory experimentation 3ametaphase 3amitosis 3amutagens 3aroot meristems 3aroot tips 3astickiness 3avegetation1 aKumar, Vaibhav1 aSrivastava, Alka1 aSaxena, Gauri1 aVerma, Praveen C.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Feb., v. 193, no. 2 p.73-73dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-08865-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009900163300001800262520097000280592002801250650000801278650002801286650001901314650001401333650000901347650002301356700001301379700001501392700001701407700001801424700001901442700001601461700001501477700005601492773013601548856008001684852000901764655001201773IND60676871920221120145201.0191122e20191104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067687192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b088912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Mingyan10aControlled Self-Assembly of λ-DNA Networks with the Synergistic Effect of a DC Electric Field  ap. 9809-9818.  aLarge-scale and morphologically controlled self-assembled λ-DNA networks were successfully constructed by the synergistic effect of a DC electric field. The effect of DNA concentration, direction, and intensity of the electric field, even the modification of the mica surface using Mg²⁺ on the characteristics of the as-prepared DNA networks, were investigated in detail by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that the horizontal electric field was more advantageous to the formation of DNA networks with more regular structures. At the same concentration, the height of DNA network was not affected significantly by the intensity change of the horizontal electric field. The modification of Mg²⁺ on mica surface increased the aggregation of DNA molecules, which contributed to the morphological change of the DNA networks. Furthermore, DNA molecules were obviously stretched in both horizontal and vertical electric fields at low DNA concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aatomic force microscopy 3aelectric field 3amagnesium 3amica 3aphysical chemistry1 aHu, Jing1 aWang, Ying1 aLiu, Mengnan1 aWang, Jianfei1 aSong, Zhengxun1 aXu, Hongmei1 aHu, Cuihua1 aWang, Zuobin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7168-09180 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 04, v. 123, no. 46 p.9809-9818dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b088913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012000168300001600288500001500304520148600319592002801805650001601833650001501849650001301864650001501877650001101892650002001903650000901923650001101932650002601943650001601969650003201985651001902017653001702036653001402053653000902067653000802076653000902084653000802093653000902101653002102110653001302131653000902144653000902153653001402162653001402176653000902190653001202199653000802211700002302219700002002242700002102262700002202283700001902305700002202324700001902346700001902365700001802384700001602402700001702418773009802435856008702533852000902620655001202629IND60576111920221119181039.0180830e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057611192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLove, Jenny14aThe addition of heat pump electricity load profiles to GB electricity demand: Evidence from a heat pump field trial  ap. 332-342.  a2019-12-06  aPrevious studies on the effect of mass uptake of heat pumps on the capability of local or national electricity grids have relied on modelling or small datasets to create the aggregated heat pump load profile. This article uses the UK Renewable Heat Premium Payment dataset, which records the electricity consumption of nearly 700 domestic heat pump installations every 2minutes, to create an aggregated load profile using an order of magnitude more sites than previously available. The aggregated profile is presented on cold and medium winter weekdays and weekends and is shown to contain two peaks per day, dropping overnight to around 40% of its peak. After Diversity Maximum Demand (ADMD) for the population of heat pumps is calculated as 1.7kW per site; this occurs in the morning, whereas the peak national grid demand occurs in the evening. Analysis is carried out on how heat pump ADMD varies with number of heat pumps in the sample. A simple upscaling exercise is presented to give a first order approximation of the increase in GB peak electricity demand with mass deployment of heat pumps. It is found that peak grid demand increases by 7.5GW (14%) with 20% of households using heat pumps. The effect of the same heat pump uptake on grid ramp rate is also discussed; this effect is found to be minor. Finally, a comparison of heat pump and gas boiler operation is given, discussing day and night time operation and mean and peak power at different external temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aheat pumps 3aexercise 3ahouseholds 3awinter 3adata collection 3aheat 3amodels 3afield experimentation 3atemperature 3aelectric energy consumption 3aUnited Kingdom 0aLoad profile 0aDiversity 0aADMD 0aSAP 0aRHPP 0aTSO 0aASHP 0aElectricity grid 0aDomestic 0aCLNR 0aEDRP 0aHeat pump 0aEmpirical 0aGSHP 0arecords 0aDNO1 aSmith, Andrew Z.P.1 aWatson, Stephen1 aOikonomou, Eleni1 aSummerfield, Alex1 aGleeson, Colin1 aBiddulph, Phillip1 aChiu, Lai Fong1 aWingfield, Jez1 aMartin, Chris1 aStone, Andy1 aLowe, Robert0 tApplied energy.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 204 p.332-342dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009100163300001600254500001500270520117800285592002801463650004301491650001501534650001401549650000901563650001101572650001701583650002001600650002801620650002101648650005201669650004201721650001601763653001001779700001701789700001801806700001801824700001401842700001701856773009301873856008101966852000902047655001202056IND60120787320221118103208.0150211e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012078732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-014-0466-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, W. -W.10aIdentification of nitric oxide responsive genes in the floral buds of Litchi chinensis  ap. 115-122.  a2019-12-04  aLitchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is an important tropical and subtropical evergreen woody fruit tree, and it has been shown that nitric oxide (NO) could promote litchi flowering. NO responsive genes of litchi (cv. Nuomici) primordia were identified through a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) library screen. We obtained 1 563 expressed sequences tags (ESTs) that were enriched in the NO treated inflorescence primordia. We then used a reverse Northern analysis to identify 728 true NO responsive ESTs, the sequences of which have been further analyzed. They represent 70 litchi unique genes that could be classified into 9 categories: 14 % of them were involved in transport facilitation, 7 % in transcription regulation, 9 % in stress response, 7 % in sugar metabolism, 9 % in secondary metabolism, 10 % in intracellular signalling, and 44 % in other metabolism, whereas 11 % were genes with unknown functions, and 7 % were genes with no hit found. Next, we performed a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to determine the expression of selected candidate genes during a time-course of NO treatment and of normal floral tissue development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ametabolism 3aflowering 3abuds 3asugars 3anitric oxide 3astress response 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aLitchi chinensis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3afruit trees 0agenes1 aChen, H. -B.1 aLu, Xiao-Yun,1 aRahman, M.

In order to further improve its gas separation performance, different polymers containing ethylene oxide (EO) groups are incorporated into the Pebax1657 matrix to form mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Liquid-like nanoparticle organic hybrid materials (NOHM-I-HPE, “I” stands for “ionic bond” and “HPE” refers to polyetheramine (“PE”) with a high (“H”) ether group content), which are made of polyetheramine chains tethered onto functionalized silica nanoparticles, have shown high solubility of CO₂. In this study, the homogenous NOHM-I-HPE/Pebax1657 MMMs with different NOHM-I-HPE loadings are prepared and investigated. The results indicate that the addition of NOHM-I-HPE leads to a decrease in glass transition temperature of Pebax1657 and an increase in EO content of the MMMs. Influences of NOHM-I-HPE content on CO₂, N₂ and CH₄ permeations are investigated at 23 °C and 1 bar. For the NOHM-I-HPE loading ranging from 0 to 60 wt%, solubility coefficients of the MMMs for CO₂ greatly increase from 1.16 to 3.84 cm³ (STP)/(cm³·bar), while those for CH₄ and N₂ only increase from 0.078 to 0.094 cm³ (STP)/(cm³·bar) and from 0.013 to 0.026 cm³ (STP)/(cm³·bar), respectively. Although the CO₂/N₂ selectivity slightly decreases with an increase in the NOHM-I-HPE loading, the CO₂/CH₄ selectivity is improved in the newly developed NOHM-I-HPE/Pebax1657 MMMs. These results indicate that the NOHM-I-HPE/Pebax1657 MMMs are very promising candidates for selective CO₂ separation for various energy related applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aethylene oxide 3aglass transition temperature 3amethane 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3apolymers 3asilica 3asolubility 0aNOHM-I-HPE 0aPebax1657 0aMixed matrix membrane 0aCO2 separation1 aFang, Wenjuan1 aLuo, Jianquan1 aGao, Ming1 aWan, Yinhua1 aZhang, Suojiang1 aZhang, Xiangping1 aPark, Ah-Hyung Alissa0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 584 p.79-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.04.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012200160300002000282520122400302592002801526650001301554650001401567650002301581650001701604650001101621650001201632650002101644650001901665650001401684650001101698650001901709650001701728650001501745700002101760773010201781856007501883852000901958655001201967IND60576638620221121222617.0170806e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057663862DNAL7 a10.1021/la302418x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolmachev, D.

The interactions between the superficial CP and BC crystal layers have been simulated. Two crystalline CP structures (i.e., hydroxyapatite (HAP) and whitlockite) with two morphologies (plate-shaped and rod-shaped) were considered. Electrostatics has been found to be the major contributor to the adhesion of the CP crystallites and BC nanofibers, and the formation of interfacial hydrogen bonds makes a minor contribution to the interaction energy. It has also been found that, in general, the energy gain resulting from whitlockite–BC binding is greater than that for HAP–BC binding, and the binding of the rod-shaped crystallites of whitlockite with BC is the most profitable. The energy loss and entropy gain upon replacement of the BC–water and CP–water contacts by the BC–CP contacts have been estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acellulose 3achemical structure 3acrystallites 3aenergy 3aentropy 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydroxyapatite 3amechanics 3amixing 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3ananofibers1 aLukasheva, N.

Methods other than handling individual pigs will be required to achieve the necessary rapidity. Suitable and practical on-farm methods will require depopulating large numbers of pigs at a time outside confinement buildings. The process must be easily implemented with readily available materials and equipment, while providing for the safety and well-being of personnel. Carbon dioxidegas (CO₂) is the means of choice, and this study analyzed the methods and requirements for delivering the gas into large volume truck bodies, corrals, dumpsters or other such chambers that may be used. The issues studied included: How the gas should be introduced to achieve the needed spatial distribution; whether plenums are required in the chambers; and the importance of sealing all chamber cracks and edges except around the top cover to limit CO₂ dilution and leakage. Analysis was done using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, and primary results were verified experimentally. The CFD findings and experimental results are compared, and recommendations are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputer software 3adisease outbreaks 3aequipment 3afluid mechanics 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3aoccupational health and safety 3aswine 3aswine diseases1 aMorrow, William1 aMeyer, Robert1 aBaird, Craig1 aHalbert, Burt0 tAgriculture.g2013 Sept. 25, v. 3, no. 4 p.599-612dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture30405993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009400164300001600258520167800274592002801952650001101980650001101991650001402002650002302016650001402039650001002053650001702063650002502080650001702105650003102122650001102153650002802164650002002192650001402212650002202226700001702248773009802265856008102363852000902444655001202453IND50070641620221118102920.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007064162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-013-0528-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaber, Moosa10aEffects of methoxyfenozide and pyridalyl on the larval ectoparasitoid Habrobracon hebetor  ap. 685-693.  aHabrobracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is an ectoparasitoid that is used for inundative biological control of various lepidopteran insect pests. Lethal and sublethal effects of two biorational insecticides, methoxyfenozide and pyridalyl, were evaluated on H. hebetor under laboratory conditions. The adults were exposed to dry insecticide residues that were applied on glass plates. Bioassays showed that the LC₅₀values of methoxyfenozide and pyridalyl were 155 and 1,226 μg a.i./ml, respectively. The LT₅₀values of methoxyfenozide and pyridalyl were 2.1 and 3.3 days, respectively. The effects of methoxyfenozide and pyridalyl on larvae were tested using a dip method with field-recommended concentrations of either insecticide. The emergence rates were reduced by 24.4 and 29.3 % for methoxyfenozide and pyridalyl treatments, respectively. In order to assess the sublethal effects of low-lethal concentrations of methoxyfenozide and pyridalyl, adult wasps were exposed to the LC₃₀concentration of each insecticide, and demographic parameters of live wasps were recorded. Exposure of adults to low-lethal concentrations (LC₃₀) negatively affected the fecundity, fertility, and sex ratio, and also the intrinsic rate of increase (rₘ), finite rate of increase (λ), generation time (T), and doubling time (DT). The longevity and net reproductive rate (R₀) of H. hebetor were not affected by sublethal exposure to these insecticides. The results showed that despite low acute toxicities of both insecticides on larval and adult stages of H. hebetor, they may negatively affect the population of the parasitoid and interfere in IPM programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBracon 3aadults 3abioassays 3abiological control 3afecundity 3aglass 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide residues 3ainsecticides 3aintegrated pest management 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amethoxyfenozide 3asex ratio 3asublethal effects1 aAbedi, Zahra0 tJournal of pest science.g2013 Dec., v. 86, no. 4 p.685-693dSpringer-Verlagx1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-013-0528-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245009100175300001600266520126800282592002801550650002701578650002001605650002201625650001301647650001101660650002201671650001701693700002601710773013501736856008201871852000901953655001201962IND60646827120221120022431.0190614e20130925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064682712DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture30406132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitecraft, Michele A.10aCasting a Wider Net: Understanding the “Root” Causes of Human-Induced Soil Erosion  ap. 613-628.  aAlthough science has helped us to identify and measure the threat of soil erosion to food production, we need to cast a wider net for effective solutions. Honest assessment suggests, in fact, that this kind of eco-agri-cultural issue exceeds the traditional boundaries of scientific interest. The issue of soil erosion spills out so many ways that it demands a holistic interdisciplinary approach. In this paper we explore a systems “in context” approach to understanding soil erosion built upon the interplay of Aristotle’s virtues of episteme, techne, and phronesis. We model the synergy of collaboration, where diverse ways of knowing, learning and being in the world can offer proactive soil conservation strategies—those that occur from the inside-out—instead of reactive policies, from the outside-in. We show how positivist scientific attitudes could well impede conservation efforts insofar as they can inhibit educational pedagogies meant to reconnect us to nature. In so doing, we make the ultimate argument that disparate fields of knowledge have much to offer each other and that the true synergy in solutions to soil erosion will come from the intimate interconnectedness of these different ways of knowing, learning and being in the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3afood production 3aissues and policy 3alearning 3amodels 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion1 aJr., Bruce E.

Co(II) or Co(III) can activate PAA to produce acetyloxyl (CH₃C(O)O•) and acetylperoxyl (CH₃C(O)OO•) radicals with little •OH radical formation, and Co(II)/Co(III) is cycled. For the first time, this study determined the reaction rates of PAA with Co(II) (kPAA,Cₒ₍II₎ = 1.70 × 10¹ to 6.67 × 10² M–¹·s–¹) and Co(III) (kPAA,Cₒ₍III₎ = 3.91 × 10⁰ to 4.57 × 10² M–¹·s–¹) ions over the initial pH 3.0–8.2 and evaluated 30 different aromatic organic compounds for degradation by Co/PAA. In-depth investigation confirmed that CH₃C(O)OO• is the key reactive species under Co/PAA for compound degradation. Assessing the structure–activity relationship between compounds’ molecular descriptors and pseudo-first-order degradation rate constants (k′PAA• in s–¹) by Co/PAA showed the number of ring atoms, EHOMO, softness, and ionization potential to be the most influential, strongly suggesting the electron transfer mechanism from aromatic compounds to the acetylperoxyl radical. The radical production and compound degradation in Co/PAA are most efficient in the intermediate pH range and can be influenced by water matrix constituents of bicarbonate, phosphate, and humic acids. These results significantly improve the knowledge regarding the acetylperoxyl radical from PAA and will be useful for further development and applications of PAA-based AOPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3acobalt 3adisinfectants 3aelectron transfer 3ahardness 3aionization 3aoxidation 3apH 3aperacetic acid 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3astructure-activity relationships 3atechnology1 aDu, Penghui1 aLiu, Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6787-24311 aLuo, Cong1 aZhao, He1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0162-73881 aHuang, Ching-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3786-094X0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Mar. 18, v. 54, no. 8 p.5268-5278dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c003563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011100173300001600284520199900300592002802299650001202327650001102339650002502350650001702375650001102392650002702403650002902430650000902459650001302468650002402481650001202505650001602517650001402533650001102547650001002558650001602568653004502584653003302629653001902662653002202681653002002703700002702723700002202750773009802772856008702870852000902957655001202966IND60576112320221119180921.0180830e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057611232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanusi, Yinka S.10aThermo-economic analysis of integrated membrane-SMR ITM-oxy-combustion hydrogen and power production plant  ap. 626-640.  aThe demand for hydrogen has greatly increased in the last decade due to the stringent regulations enacted to address environmental pollution concerns. Natural gas reforming is currently the most mature technology for large-scale hydrogen production. However, it is usually associated with greenhouse gas emissions. As part of the strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, new designs need to be developed to integrate hydrogen production facilities that are based on natural gas reforming with carbon capture facilities. In this study, we carried out energy, exergy and economic analysis of hydrogen production in a steam methane reforming reactor integrated with an oxy-combustion plant for co-production of power and hydrogen. The results show that the overall system efficiency and hydrogen production efficiency monotonically increase with increasing the combustor exit temperature (CET), increasing the amount of hydrogen extracted and decreasing the auxiliary fuel added to the system. The optimal thermo-economic operating conditions of the system were obtained as reformer pressure of 15bar, auxiliary fuel factor of 0.8 and hydrogen extraction factor of 0.6. The production cost of hydrogen using the proposed system, under these optimal operating conditions, is within the range suggested by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Further analysis shows that the capital cost of the membrane-air separation unit (ITM) has the major share in the total investment cost of the system and constitutes 37% of the total capital cost of the system at the CET of 1500K. The exergy analysis, at the optimal conditions, shows that the major exergy destruction components are the combustor, the exhaust gas condenser, the membrane-steam methane reformer and the heat recovery steam generator with 19.5%, 8.1% 6.3%, and 6.3% of the fuel exergy destroyed, respectively. The proposed system is economically feasible at hydrogen purchase price of $30/GJ and natural gas price of $10/GJ or less.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon 3aeconomic feasibility 3aenergy costs 3aexergy 3agenerators (equipment) 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3anatural gas 3apollution 3aprices 3asteam 3atemperature 0aMembrane-steam methane reforming (M-SMR) 0aIon transport membrane (ITM) 0aOxy-combustion 0aEconomic analysis 0aExergy analysis1 aMokheimer, Esmail M.A.1 aHabib, Mohamed A.0 tApplied energy.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 204 p.626-640dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013500156300002000291520148600311592002801797650001501825650002501840650002201865650001601887650001901903650001201922650001801934650001601952700001601968700002401984700002402008700002102032700001802053700002202071700001702093773010202110856007502212852000902287655001202296IND60576638820221118173112.0170806e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057663882DNAL7 a10.1021/la302435g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yao-Da10aUnderstanding the Interfacial Properties of Nanostructured Liquid Crystalline Materials for Surface-Specific Delivery Applications  ap. 13485-13495.  aNonlamellar liquid crystalline dispersions such as cubosomes and hexosomes have great potential as novel surface-targeted active delivery systems. In this study, the influence of internal nanostructure, chemical composition, and the presence of Pluronic F127 as a stabilizer, on the surface and interfacial properties of different liquid crystalline particles and surfaces, was investigated. The interfacial properties of the bulk liquid crystalline systems with coexisting excess water were dependent on the internal liquid crystalline nanostructure. In particular, the surfaces of the inverse cubic systems were more hydrophilic than that of the inverse hexagonal phase. The interaction between F127 and the bulk liquid crystalline systems depended on the internal liquid crystalline structure and chemical composition. For example, F127 adsorbed to the surface of the bulk phytantriol cubic phase, while for monoolein cubic phase, F127 was integrated into the liquid crystalline structure. Last, the interfacial adsorption behavior of the dispersed liquid crystalline particles also depended on both the internal nanostructure and the chemical composition, despite the dispersions all being stabilized using F127. The findings highlight the need to understand the specific surface characteristics and the nature of the interaction with colloidal stabilizer for understanding and optimizing the behavior of nonlamellar liquid crystalline systems in surface delivery applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical composition 3acrystal structure 3adispersions 3ahydrophilicity 3aliquids 3ananomaterials 3astabilizers1 aLarson, Ian1 aBarnes, Timothy J.,1 aPrestidge, Clive A.1 aAllen, Stephanie1 aChen, Xinyong1 aRoberts, Clive J.1 aBoyd, Ben J.0 tLangmuir.g2012 Sept. 18, v. 28, no. 37 p.13485-13495dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla302435g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009600165300001600261520215100277592002802428650002102456650002402477650001702501650001202518650002002530650001602550650001002566650001002576650001602586650001402602650002102616650001402637650001402651650001402665650001902679650002202698650001702720650001702737651001202754651001902766651001902785700003202804700001802836700001702854700002302871700001802894700002002912773011302932856008403045852000903129655001203138IND60549489620221120220537.0160908e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054948962DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-06-13-0156-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrabke, Anja10aCharacterization of Iprodione Resistance in Botrytis cinerea from Strawberry and Blackberry  ap. 396-402.  aGray mold, caused by the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, is one of the most destructive diseases of strawberry. Control of the disease in commercial fields is largely dependent on the application of fungicides, including the dicarboximide iprodione. Single-spore isolates were collected from strawberry fields in Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina and subjected to an assay using conidial germination that distinguished sensitive (S) isolates from isolates with various levels of resistance to iprodione. Of the 245 isolates, 1 was highly resistant (HR), 5 were moderately resistant (MR), and 43 had low resistance (LR) to iprodione. LR and MR strains were found in the Florida population and in 9 of 11 locations from North Carolina and South Carolina, indicating that resistance was widespread but accounted for only a relatively small percentage of the B. cinerea population. Sequence analysis of the target gene bos1, which codes for a class III histidine kinase, revealed that the MR phenotype was associated with Q369P and N373S mutations and that the LR phenotype was associated with either a I365S or a I365N mutation. The I365S and I365N mutations were also present in five additionally included HR isolates from North Carolina and South Carolina blackberry fields and one HR isolate from a Virginia strawberry field but no mutation or mutation combinations in bos1 were uniquely associated with the HR phenotype. Expression analysis of bos1 in S and HR isolates did not reveal convincing evidence of the gene's involvement in HR resistance either. The six HR isolates had three different phenotypes with respect to their sensitivity to fludioxonil; two were S, two were LR, and two were MR. The fludioxonil LR and MR isolates were also resistant to tolnaftate, an indication of multidrug efflux pump activity. These data suggest that, in addition to point mutations in bos1, drug efflux pump activity and potentially a third mechanism of resistance may be contributing to the iprodione HR phenotype. Detached fruit studies showed that field rates of Rovral 4 Flowable (iprodione) did not control iprodione MR and HR isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aFragaria virginiana 3ablackberries 3aconidia 3adisease control 3afludioxonil 3afungi 3agenes 3agermination 3agray mold 3ahistidine kinase 3aiprodione 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3apoint mutation 3asequence analysis 3astrawberries 3atransporters 3aFlorida 3aNorth Carolina 3aSouth Carolina1 aFernández-Ortuño, Dolores1 aAmiri, Achour1 aLi, Xingpeng1 aPeres, Natália A.1 aSmith, Powell1 aSchnabel, Guido0 tPhytopathology.g2014 Apr., v. 104, no. 4 p.396-402dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-06-13-0156-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245005900202300001200261520157300273592002801846650001201874650001401886650002601900650002601926650003101952650000901983650001301992650002002005650002502025650001602050650001902066650001502085650000902100700002402109773014002133856008202273852000902355655001202364IND60593235020221119180037.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059323502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3797-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukae, Kengo1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7090-619610aApplication of Passive Sampler for Ammonia Gas in Soil  ap. 145.  aThe emissions of ammonia (NH₃) from soil have accelerated rapidly and have affected both vegetation and the atmosphere. It is thus necessary to investigate not only the amounts of NH₃ gas released from the soil surface but also the dynamics of NH₃ gas in the soil. Active sampling and diffusive sampling have been adopted to measure the components of soil air. However, gas aspiration for active sampling inevitably collects a wide range of soil gases. We examined the application of passive sampling to NH₃ gas measurements in soil and compared the outcome to active sampling results. In laboratory experiments, the performance of the present passive sampler in moist soil was investigated. When immersed in solution, the passive sampler collected gas released from the solution, depending on the vapor pressure of the volatile substance. In laboratory experiments measuring NH₃ gas in soil, there were no significant differences among the values measured by passive sampler at each measurement point. Thus, we concluded that the passive sampler can accurately measure NH₃ gas in soil. In field experiments, the average NH₃ gas concentrations were 43 ppb in urea-added soil and 1 ppb in control soil. The relative standard deviation of NH₃ concentrations in urea-added soil was large. This result is expected because soil characteristics can change under the influence of ambient environmental factors such as wind, rain, and temperature. In other words, the spatial differences in NH₃ emissions were reflected in the passive sampler measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aemissions 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3alaboratory experimentation 3arain 3asoil air 3asoil properties 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 3avegetation 3awind1 aTakenaka, Norimichi0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2018 May, v. 229, no. 5 p.145-145dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-018-3797-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245015000162300001800312500001900330520134200349592002801691650002001719650002001739650002201759650001601781650000901797650002101806650001501827650001301842650002601855650001001881650001601891650001201907650002101919700001901940700001501959700001501974700001501989700001602004700001902020700005802039700005602097773013902153856007902292852000902371655001202380IND60689350320221122032957.0200421e20200323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068935032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c003592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Menglin10aProbing Mechanisms for the Tissue-Specific Distribution and Biotransformation of Perfluoroalkyl Phosphinic Acids in Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio)  ap. 4932-4941.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigated the tissue-specific accumulation and biotransformation of 6:6 and 8:8 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (PFPiA) in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) during 90 d exposure and 30 d depuration in water in the laboratory. Both 6:6 and 8:8 PFPiAs could quickly accumulate in the carp, and 6:6 PFPiA displayed higher bioaccumulation potential than 8:8 PFPiA. The highest concentrations of PFPiAs were observed in the blood, while the lowest were found in the muscle. The equilibrium dialysis experiment indicated that both PFPiAs had higher binding affinities with the proteins in the fish serum than in liver, which was supported by the molecular docking analysis. The results also indicated that 6:6 PFPiA had higher binding affinities with the serum and liver proteins than 8:8 PFPiA. These results suggested that the tissue-specific distribution of PFPiAs was highly dependent on the binding affinities with the specific proteins. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments consistently indicated that PFPiAs experienced biotransformation and produced perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acids (PFPAs), and biotransformation of 8:8 PFPiA was more active than 6:6 PFPiA. It was worth noting that perfluorohexanonate and perfluorooctanoic acids were identified in fish as metabolites after long-term exposure to PFPiAs for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3abioaccumulation 3abiotransformation 3ablood serum 3acarp 3achronic exposure 3adepuration 3adialysis 3aenvironmental science 3aliver 3ametabolites 3amuscles 3aperfluorocarbons1 aDong, Fengfeng1 aYi, Shujun1 aZhu, Yumin1 aZhou, Jian1 aSun, Binbin1 aShan, Guoqiang1 aFeng, Jianfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4003-94581 aZhu, Lingyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9318-79400 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Mar. 23, v. 54, no. 8 p.4932-4941dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c003593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01609naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009100170300001400261500001400275520045600289536009200745592002800837650001800865650001400883650001600897651001300913653002400926653001500950653001500965653002500980700001701005700001901022773011701041856008001158852000901238655001201247IND60718423420221121044759.0201124e20201116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071842342DNAL7 a10.3897/evolsyst.4.598932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellinen, Markku J.12aA new species of Sacada Walker, 1862 from Thailand (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae, Pyralinae)  ap. 71-77.  aNAL-light  aA new species of Sacada from northern Thailand is described: S.chaehomensissp. nov.

Members of the CuNb₁₋ₓTaₓO₃ (0 < x ≤ 0.25) solid solution have been synthesized via high temperature solid-state methods. The structure of CuNbO₃ was found to be Cu-deficient Cu₀.₉₆₅NbO₃ after heating in air at 250 °C for 3 hours, i.e., under similar conditions as those used to prepare it as a polycrystalline film. Powder X-ray diffraction techniques confirmed the purity of each composition up to x ≤ 0.25 and the lattice parameters were refined as the molar ratio of Nb(v) and Ta(v) was varied (a = 9.499 to 9.506 Å, b = 8.439 to 8.451 Å, c = 6.768 to 6.781 Å and β = 90.847 to 90.694°). An increase in the amount of Ta(v) yielded a small blue shift of the bandgap size from ∼1.89 eV to ∼1.97 eV for CuNb₁₋ₓTaₓO₃ from x = 0 to 0.25. Polycrystalline films of each member of the CuNb₁₋ₓTaₓO₃ solid solutions produced relatively comparable p-type photocurrents of up to −0.5 mA cm⁻², while the stability of the cathodic photocurrent also remained similar with increasing Ta(v) content. Mott–Schottky analysis of CuNb₁₋ₓTaₓO₃ showed that the conduction band edge of −1.5 (vs. SHE) provides a sufficient overpotential (∼800 mV) to drive the reduction of water to hydrogen gas at the surface. The capability of the solid solutions to drive hydrogen production was confirmed through suspended particle photocatalysis. Further characterization of the CuNb₀.₉₁Ta₀.₀₉O₃ composition included scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses. These data show that Cu(i) is oxidized to Cu(ii) as CuNb₁₋ₓTaₓO₃ is heated in air. Thus, the formation of Cu(ii) rich regions at the surface, together with the Ta(v) content, are found to play important roles in the stability and magnitude of the cathodic photocurrents produced under visible-light irradiation. Importantly, these results demonstrate that solid solution compositions can be used in films for solar energy conversion, notwithstanding their inherent atomic disorder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3achemical composition 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3aelectric current 3aenergy conversion 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3anutrient deficiencies 3aphotocatalysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 3asolid solutions 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aStuart, Sean1 aChung, Ching-Chang1 aDougherty, Daniel B.1 aJones, Jacob L.1 aMaggard, Paul A.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 4, no. 8 p.3115-3126dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta06609c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245009200156300002000248520117600268592002801444650001601472650002301488650002101511650001101532650001301543650001301556650002401569650000901593650001201602650001101614650001101625700002101636773013401657856007801791852000901869655001201878IND60586604620221117043729.0171214e20171213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058660462DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b104252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Hao10aBiomimetics of [NiFe]-Hydrogenase: Nickel- or Iron-Centered Proton Reduction Catalysis?  ap. 18065-18070.  aThe [NiFe] hydrogenase (H2ase) has been characterized in the Ni-R state with a hydride bridging between Fe and Ni but displaced toward the Ni. In nearly all of the synthetic Ni-R models reported so far, the hydride ligand is either displaced toward Fe, or terminally bound to Fe. Recently, a structural and functional [NiFe]-H2ase mimic (Nat. Chem. 2016, 8, 1054−1060) was reported to produce H₂ catalytically via EECC mechanism through a Ni-centered hydride intermediate like the enzyme. Here, a comprehensive DFT study shows a much lower energy route via an E[ECEC] mechanism through an Fe-centered hydride intermediate. Although catalytic H₂ production occurs at the potential corresponding to the complex’s second reduction, a third electron is needed to induce the second proton addition from the weak acid. The first two-electron reductions and a proton addition produce a semibridging hydride with a short Fe–H bond like other structured [NiFe]-biomimetics, but this species is not basic enough to add another proton from the weak acid without the third electron. The calculated mechanism provides insight into the origin of this structure in the enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3aenergy 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airon 3aligands 3amodels 3anickel1 aHall, Michael B.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Dec. 13, v. 139, no. 49 p.18065-18070dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b104253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245015000163300002000313520147000333592002801803650001401831650001201845650001701857650001301874650002201887700002001909700001301929700001201942700005801954773013802012856008002150852000902230655001202239IND60750023720221117233724.0210910e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075002372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c061782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Mengjiao10aK⁺, Sr²⁺-Triggered Phase Transitions from Chiral Thermotropic Liquid Crystalline to G-Quadruplex CTLC with Circularly Polarized Luminescence  ap. 19570-19579.  aA convenient method to prepare luminescently thermotropic liquid crystalline (TLC) with chiral centers is established by combining cationic Gemini surfactants, CₙH₂ₙ₊₁(CH₃)₂N⁺(CH₂)₂N⁺(CH₃)₂CₙH₂ₙ₊₁·Br₂ (n–2–n·2Br, n = 10, 12, 14, and 16, respectively) and guanosine 5′-monophosphate disodium salt (GMP). Under thermally annealing, the complexes of surfactant-GMP (n-GMP) self-assemble into TLCs with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performance, except for 10-GMP. The phase structure and CPL handedness in TLCs can be regulated by changing the alkyl chain length of n–2–n·2Br. Columnar tetragonal (Colₜ) mesophase of 12-GMP exhibits right-handed CPL (R-CPL) emission, while chiral smectic C (SmC*) phases containing 14- or 16-GMP display left-handed CPL (L-CPL) emission. The introduction of K⁺ or Sr²⁺ triggers n-GMP to be G-quadruplexes with identical chirality and luminescence, and further regulates the phase structure and CPL property. TLCs can be transformed to be columnar rectangular (Colᵣ) or Colₜ phases with R-CPL emission. We find that the mesogenic units feature the same chiral moiety can realize R- and L-CPL emitting, and prepare the tunable CPL-active LCs through natural biomolecules. These results deepen our understanding of chiral luminescence mesogens and G-quadruplex structures, providing the new insight for the fabrication of nondoped LC materials with CPL performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguanosine 3aliquids 3aluminescence 3amoieties 3aoptical isomerism1 aWong, Shiu-Fai,1 aQi, Ping1 aFan, Qi1 aHao, Jingcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9760-96770 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 125, no. 35 p.19570-19579dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c061783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245013500179300001600314520173200330592002802062650003802090650001102128650002102139650001402160650001102174650001302185650002502198650002002223650002002243650002102263650003202284650001202316650001402328650001802342650001802360650001002378700002602388700002502414700002302439773011302462856008402575852000902659655001202668IND60549489720221120220245.0160908e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054948972DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-06-13-0157-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColetta-Filho, Helvecio D.10aTemporal Progression of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ Infection in Citrus and Acquisition Efficiency by Diaphorina citri  ap. 416-421.  aOver the last decade, the plant disease huanglongbing (HLB) has emerged as a primary threat to citrus production worldwide. HLB is associated with infection by phloem-limited bacteria (‘Candidatus Liberibacter’ spp.) that are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri. Transmission efficiency varies with vector-related aspects (e.g., developmental stage and feeding periods) but there is no information on the effects of host–pathogen interactions. Here, acquisition efficiency of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ by D. citri was evaluated in relation to temporal progression of infection and pathogen titer in citrus. We graft inoculated sweet orange trees with ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’; then, at different times after inoculation, we inspected plants for HLB symptoms, measured bacterial infection levels (i.e., titer or concentration) in plants, and measured acquisition by psyllid adults that were confined on the trees. Plant infection levels increased rapidly over time, saturating at uniformly high levels (≈10⁸ copy number of 16S ribosomal DNA/g of plant tissue) near 200 days after inoculation—the same time at which all infected trees first showed disease symptoms. Pathogen acquisition by vectors was positively associated with plant infection level and time since inoculation, with acquisition occurring as early as the first measurement, at 60 days after inoculation. These results suggest that there is ample potential for psyllids to acquire the pathogen from trees during the asymptomatic phase of infection. If so, this could limit the effectiveness of tree rouging as a disease management tool and would likely explain the rapid spread observed for this disease in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 3aCitrus 3aDiaphorina citri 3aPsyllidae 3aadults 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acrop production 3adisease control 3agreening disease 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aoranges 3apathogens 3aplant tissues 3aribosomal DNA 3atrees1 aDaugherty, Matthew P.1 aFerreira, Cléderson1 aLopes, João R.

To understand the controls and drivers that influence the uptake of these tools and to evaluate the effectiveness of a co-innovation approach in improving their (tools) uptake, a team of biophysical (hydrologists) and social researchers undertook a pilot study in an irrigation scheme in the South Island of NZ. Co-innovation offers a multi-directional, multi-level, multi-actor approach, in which input from stakeholders is valued in every part of the process, from problem definition to solution adoption. In this study, we focused on the adaptive aspect of co-innovation that allows stakeholders to periodically review their actions and respond to it in a way that is inclusive others’ views and reflective of feedback received. The pilot study activities were analysed retrospectively to develop a systemic view to the implementation of a co-innovation-based multi-stakeholder hydrology project. While implementing a co-innovation approach, five chronologically-distinct yet overlapping phases emerged in the project: 1. concept development, where the hydrologists came up with the research idea and seed concept; 2. trust building, where researchers (hydrologists and social) interacted with key on-farm stakeholders in developing and implementing the research idea into a pilot field study; 3. knowledge synthesis, where researchers collected on-farm biophysical and behavioural data to record practice change; 4. extended outreach, where stakeholders, including researchers, devised pathways to sustain the lessons learned and practices changed, and disseminated the learnings to the wider irrigation community; and 5. project legacy, where the researchers, after the development of the seed concept into a practice change, evolved an exit strategy. Apart from core research activities, such as data collection on irrigation water use and changes in irrigation scheduling practices, each one of the five phases included actions that were unique to that phase as well as to achieving the wider pilot study goal of improving water use efficiency. This paper discusses the learnings from these phases, including insights, and key identifiers and indicators of pilot study progression during each phase, which may serve as an example to other biophysical studies that propose to employ co-innovation-based multi stakeholder approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afarmers 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3aoutreach 3aresearchers 3astakeholders 3awater use efficiency 3aNew Zealand 0aIrrigation 0aWeather forecast 0aCo-innovation 0aCo-learning 0aStakeholder management1 aJongmans, C.1 aBewsell, D.1 aElley, G.0 tAgricultural water management.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 212 p.181-192dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.08.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009000168300001600258520150500274592002801779650001401807650002301821650003401844650001701878650002701895650002201922653002601944653004001970653003102010700001502041700001402056700001402070700001802084773011202102856008502214852000902299655001202308IND60643010620221120021405.0201209e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064301062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2019.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lihong10aSulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) membrane for quinone-based organic flow batteries  ap. 246-253.  aOver the past few years, organic flow batteries have gained immense attention owing to their potential for large-scale energy storage applications and modifiable properties. Organic redox couples usually involve only one type of counter-ion for ion exchange membranes, and hence provide opportunities to use low-cost membranes in organic flow batteries. In this study, we prepared a sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (sPEEK) membrane for application in acidic flow batteries of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonic acid/anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid. The proton conductivity of the prepared sPEEK membrane was 50% lower than that of Nafion-212 membrane. However, the Coulombic efficiency of the sPEEK cell was similar to that of Nafion cell, and the voltage efficiency was 0.99%–2.66% higher than that of Nafion cell at different current densities. The cell using the sPEEK membrane also exhibited long-term stability, retaining 96.93% reversible capacity after 100 charge/discharge cycles at the current density of 100 mA cm⁻². The results of symmetric cell cycling indicated that the decay of reversible capacity in this organic flow battery system was mainly due to the instability of organic compounds in the positive electrolyte, which was also confirmed by the self-discharge measurements of the sPEEK cell. These results demonstrate that the sPEEK membrane is highly suitable for organic flow batteries. These results will be helpful for realizing cost-effective energy storage systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolytes 3aion-exchange membranes 3aorganic compounds 0aIon exchange membrane 0aSulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) 0aOrganic redox flow battery1 aZhang, Shu1 aLi, Enzhu1 aZhao, Lin1 aZhang, Shuren0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 584 p.246-253dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245012700203300002000330520077200350592002801122653001801150653002801168653001101196653000801207653001401215700001801229700001601247700001801263700001801281700001901299700001801318700002001336700001701356700002101373773019401394856007901588852000901667655001201676IND60518047120221122015305.0160406e20160322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051804712DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15182601132doi7 aPMC48127152pmcid7 a269662332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Jia-Wei10aUnfolded protein response regulates yeast small GTPase Arl1p activation at late Golgi via phosphorylation of Arf GEF Syt1p  ap. E1683-E1690.  aSignificance The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular response to stress caused by accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPases are key regulators of membrane traffic in the Golgi complex. In yeast, Arf guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) Syt1p activates the Arf-like protein Arl1 at late Golgi, thereby recruiting golgin Imh1p, but how Syt1p GEF activity is regulated is largely unknown. We demonstrate that UPR signaling regulated phosphorylation of Syt1, which is critical for Arl1p activation, recruitment of golgin protein Imh1p to the Golgi, and Syt1p interaction with Arl1. These findings reveal a previously unsuspected relationship between the UPR and Golgi transport.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGolgi complex 0aADP ribosylation factor 0aGTPase 0aUPR 0aER stress1 aTang, Pei-Hua1 aWang, I-Hao1 aLiu, Chia-Lun1 aChen, Wen-Hui1 aTsai, Pei-Chin1 aChen, Kuan-Yu1 aChen, Kuan-Jung1 aYu, Jiarong,1 aLee, Fang-Jen S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2016 Mar. 22, v. 113, no. 12 p.E1683-E1690dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15182601133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245009200206300001600298520136600314592002801680650001001708650002101718650001501739650002201754650001101776650001301787650002601800700001601826700001701842700001501859700001901874700001901893700001801912700001501930773009001945856008502035852000902120655001202129IND60777946420221119093711.0220628e20220830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077794642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xueyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1099-352310aSynthesis of graphene interlayer diamond films for enhanced electrochemical performance  ap. 602-611.  aBoron doped polycrystalline diamond (BDD) films have shown great potential in electrochemical applications. However, the high background current and poor signal-to-noise ratio, caused by the crystal defects produced during the growth process, limit its application. This paper reports the controllable synthesis of a diamond/graphene/diamond (DGD) sandwich structure. The graphene interlayer is designed to act as a high-speed tunnel for the electronic transmission, and the outer diamond layers can completely maintain its inherent excellent features. This sandwich structure can effectively avoid the negative impact of surface non-diamond carbon relative to material properties, and obtain a wider electrochemical window (3.65 V) and a lower background current (about 0.4 μA cm⁻²). At the same time, this DGD electrode exhibits fast heterogeneous electron transfer in both the inner (Fe(CN)₆⁻³/⁻⁴) and outer (Ru(NH₃)₆⁺²/⁺³) redox systems. By changing the preparation process of the middle G layer, the growth process of the G layer and its influence on the energy band and electrochemical performance of the electrode are analyzed in detail. In general, the DGD sandwich structure methodology paves a novel route for designing high-performance conductive diamond electrodes and holding great promise in electrochemical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3agraphene 3asignal-to-noise ratio1 aWang, Yibao1 aGai, Zhigang1 aZhang, Mei1 aLiu, Shousheng1 aGuo, Fengxiang1 aYang, Nianjun1 aJiang, Xin0 tCarbon.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 196 p.602-611dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245018000205300001600385520137000401592002801771650002901799650002501828650002401853650002501877650001601902650001601918650001101934650002001945650001601965650002001981650000902001650001702010650001702027650001402044650001002058650002302068650002402091650001402115650002102129650001502150650001502165650001702180650001402197650002102211650002902232650001202261650002902273650001002302653002202312653001702334700005102351700001202402700001702414700001802431773011202449856008202561852000902643655001202652IND60671763620221119081522.0200523e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067176362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Changyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9424-333110aEmodin ameliorates metabolic and antioxidant capacity inhibited by dietary oxidized fish oil through PPARs and Nrf2-Keap1 signaling in Wuchang bream (Megalobrama amblycephala)  ap. 842-851.  aDietary lipids and fatty acids are involved in cell metabolism and animal physiological regulation. However, oxidized lipids could induce oxidative stress and disorder normal growth and physiological health in fish. A 12-week rearing experiment with 6% fish oil (6F), 6% oxidized fish oil (6OF) and emodin supplemented diets (6F + E, 6OF + E) was conducted to evaluate the protective mechanism of emodin on oxidized fish oil stress in Megalobrama amblycephala. Results indicate that, under oxidized fish oil stress, emodin rescued the growth performance inhibition, improved special growth ratio (SGR), and reduced feed conversion ratio (FCR) and hepatosomatic index (HSI); rescued intestine histological impairment, ameliorated the structural expansion and membrane damage of mitochondria in intestine cells, and increased the length and intensity of intestinal villus. Moreover, emodin enhanced serum immune and antioxidant enzyme activity, increased metabolic activity through PPARs signaling, increased antioxidant capacity through PPARs and Nrf2-Keap1 signaling based on the transcriptional expression of specific genes. These results indicate emodin could be used as an effective immunostimulant to protect organism form oxidative stress induced by dietary oxidized lipid. This may provide insights for oxidized lipid prevention in aquaculture production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegalobrama amblycephala 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood serum 3adietary fat 3aemodin 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acids 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish culture 3afish feeding 3afish oils 3agenes 3agrowth performance 3ahepatosomatic index 3ahistology 3aimmunostimulants 3aintestines 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphysiological regulation 3arearing 3atranscription (genetics) 3avilli 0aOxidized fish oil 0aAmelioration1 aLiu, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9537-45521 aXu, Pao1 aGe, Xianping1 aZhang, Huimin0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Nov., v. 94 p.842-851dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005300152245010300205300001300308520100600321592002801327650002501355650001801380650001701398650001601415650001601431650001601447650002701463650004101490650000901531650002201540650001501562650001401577650001801591650001001609650001501619650002101634650001801655650001201673650001401685650001301699650002101712650001501733653000701748653000701755653001201762653000801774653000801782653000701790653000701797653000801804653000701812653000801819653000801827653000801835653000801843653002201851653002801873653002101901653001701922653001201939653001001951700001601961773009701977856008702074852000902161655001202170IND60542412220221120102659.0190402e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054241222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeb, Alam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6849-376X10aSea buckthorn seed oil protects against the oxidative stress produced by thermally oxidized lipids  ap. 6-12.  aThermally oxidized vegetable ghee was fed to the rabbits for 14days with specific doses of sea buckthorn seed oil (SO).

Sea buckthorn oil was found to reduce the toxic effects and degenerative changes in the liver and thus provides protection against the thermally oxidized lipids induced oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3afatty acid composition 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aghee 3ahematologic tests 3ahematology 3ahistology 3alinoleic acid 3aliver 3aoleic acid 3aoxidative stress 3apalmitic acid 3arabbits 3aseed oils 3atoxicity 3atriacylglycerols 3avegetables 0aSO 0aOG 0aGC–MS 0aLDL 0aHDL 0aPV 0aAV 0aFFA 0aHb 0aRBC 0aHCT 0aMCV 0aMCH 0aSea buckthorn oil 0aOxidized vegetable ghee 0aOxidative stress 0aSerum lipids 0aRabbits 0aLiver1 aUllah, Sana0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 186 p.6-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01959naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245006100205300002000266520069900286592002800985650001101013650001901024650002501043650002001068650001601088650001701104651001501121651001401136700005301150700005201203700001801255700005901273700002301332773014201355856007901497852000901576655001201585IND60613897320221116161603.0180918e20180823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061389732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b005622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Chuyang Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7932-646210aPotable Water Reuse through Advanced Membrane Technology  ap. 10215-10223.  aRecycling water from municipal wastewater offers a reliable and sustainable solution to cities and regions facing shortage of water supply.

The effects of initial sulphur concentration, contact time and adsorption temperature on the removal efficiency were studied. Changes to the adsorbents before and after the adsorption were characterized by ICP-AES, XRD, N₂ physisorption, SEM, and TEM. The highest sulphur adsorption capacity of 60.98 mgS g⁻¹ for CuAgY was achieved at 323 K. The equilibrium data were well fitted by the Sips model and the kinetics of the adsorption process could be described by the pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic parameters were obtained from the models and indicated that the adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic. Modeling results also showed that the Marquardt's Percent Standard Deviation (MPSD) and the Sum of the Squares of the Errors (SSE) provided the best fitting results for isotherm and kinetic models, respectively. In addition, it was found that CuAgY could maintain 84.5% of the capacity for sulphur after twice regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abatch systems 3acyclohexanes 3agasoline 3aheat production 3akinetics 3amodels 3anitrogen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astandard deviation 3asulfur 3atemperature 3athiophene 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeolites1 aWang, Rijie1 aNan, Yue1 aLiu, Fei1 aYang, Xiaoxia0 tRSC advances.g2017 Nov. 06, v. 7, no. 81 p.51528-51537dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra11443e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01762naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008400164300001600248520081600264592002801080650000801108650001401116650002601130650001101156650001801167700002201185700001701207700001701224773012401241856007401365852000901439655001201448IND60663071020221122001248.0190909e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066307102DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ib00183g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrisafuli, F.

We propose a model to explain the behavior of the persistence length as a function of the drug concentration, extracting the binding data from pure mechanical measurements. Such analysis has allowed us to show that cisplatin binds cooperatively to the DNA molecule. In addition, DNA compaction by the action of the drug was also observed under our experimental conditions by studying the kinetics of some mechanical properties such as the radius of gyration and the end-to-end distance, e.g. Crisafuli et al., Integr.

This practice provides a supplementary source of organic sorbents for compounds released into soils. However, effects of accumulated straw materials on sorption of compounds in soils remain poorly understood. Here we report that straw materials accumulated in soils display changing chemical structure and properties during decomposition, the majority of which distribute in exponential growth or decay manners with decomposition extents of materials. Sorption of straw materials toward 40 commonly used pesticides and antibiotics takes a compromise of decreasing crystalline index and increasing water absorption capacity of the sorbent materials during decomposition. This tradeoff in sorption leads to case-specific sorption trends of organic compounds in soils with straw return practice, following a composite linear sorption model of mixed soils and straw materials. The predictive model shows that relatively hydrophobic, hydrogen bond acceptor-rich chemicals (about 22.5% of the 40 compounds) display decreasing sorption capacity in organic matter-rich and/or relatively acidic soils with straw return. This finding may contradict the notion that crop straw return usually increases sorption and decreases leaching of compounds in soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3acorn straw 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3asorbents 3asorption 3awater binding capacity 0aStraw decomposition 0aStraw residues 0aOrganic contaminants 0aSorption 0aLeaching1 aLi, Qian1 aQiao, Xianliang1 aChen, Jingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5756-33361 aCai, Xiyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5011-19860 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 418 p.126213-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012000171520159200291592002801883650001701911650002801928650002601956650001101982650001201993650001902005650001802024650001102042650002802053650001102081650000902092650002302101650001402124650001702138650001402155650001702169650001002186653002402196653002302220653002802243653001702271700001802288700002702306700001502333700002202348773011002370856008602480852000902566655001202575IND60790430920221121171728.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079043092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2022.1083562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTējōvati, A.,10aIn vitro acaricidal activity of Piper longum L. against amitraz resistant Rhipicephalus microplus (Acari: Ixodidae)  aThe cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus Canestrini (Acari: Ixodidae) is one of the most important tick species severely affecting health and causes huge losses to dairy industry. Chemical acaricides are mainly applied for tick control but development of resistance, environmental pollution and contamination of milk and meat products with residues has led to exploration alternative eco-friendly tick control strategies. The dried fruits of Piper longum L. (Indian long pepper, Thippali or Pippali) generally used as ﬂavoring agent have also been shown to have insecticidal property. Different concentrations (0.625%–10%) of alcoholic and aqueous extracts of Piper longum L. were prepared and evaluated for acaricidal activity against amitraz resistant R. microplus adult and larval stages. Against larval stages a dose-dependent mortality response was recorded for both extracts and higher acaricidal property was exhibited by the alcoholic extract with LC₅₀ and LC₉₅ (95% CL) values of 0.488% (0.48–0.49) and 1.39% (1.35–1.44), respectively. Similarly, against adult engorged females, ethanolic extract showed higher acaricidal property with LC₅₀ and LC₉₅ (95% CL) values of 4.67% (4.61–4.74) and 12.38% (12.05–12.73), respectively. Significant (p < 0.05) reduction was recorded in reproductive index of ticks treated and but no effect on hatchability of eggs was recorded in treated groups. The present study establishes acaricidal activity of P. longum fruit extracts against both larval and adult stages of amitraz resistant population of cattle tick.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPiper longum 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aacaricidal properties 3aadults 3aamitraz 3adairy industry 3adose response 3afruits 3ainsecticidal properties 3alarvae 3ameat 3amilk contamination 3amortality 3aparasitology 3apollution 3atick control 3aticks 0aAcaricidal activity 0aAmitraz resistance 0aRhipicephalus microplus 0aPiper longum1 aSaini, S.P.S.1 aSiṅgha, Harakīrata,1 aRath, S.S.1 aSingh, Nirbhay K.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2022 Oct., v. 241 p.108356-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2022.1083563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245008500211300001600296520130700312592002801619653002301647653003401670653001701704653002201721653001401743653003201757700002301789700002301812700001701835773007801852856008301930852000902013655001202022IND60555043620221118153318.0161103e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055504362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2016.08.0022doi7 aPMC49938582pmcid7 a275448832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBetlazar, Calina14aThe impact of high and low dose ionising radiation on the central nervous system  ap. 144-156.  aResponses of the central nervous system (CNS) to stressors and injuries, such as ionising radiation, are modulated by the concomitant responses of the brains innate immune effector cells, microglia. Exposure to high doses of ionising radiation in brain tissue leads to the expression and release of biochemical mediators of ‘neuroinflammation’, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to tissue destruction. Contrastingly, low dose ionising radiation may reduce vulnerability to subsequent exposure of ionising radiation, largely through the stimulation of adaptive responses, such as antioxidant defences. These disparate responses may be reflective of non-linear differential microglial activation at low and high doses, manifesting as an anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory functional state. Biomarkers of pathology in the brain, such as the mitochondrial Translocator Protein 18kDa (TSPO), have facilitated in vivo characterisation of microglial activation and ‘neuroinflammation’ in many pathological states of the CNS, though the exact function of TSPO in these responses remains elusive. Based on the known responsiveness of TSPO expression to a wide range of noxious stimuli, we discuss TSPO as a potential biomarker of radiation-induced effects.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIonizing radiation 0aReactive oxygen species (ROS) 0aAntioxidants 0aNeuroinflammation 0aMicroglia 0aTranslocator Protein (TSPO)1 aMiddleton, Ryan J.1 aBanati, Richard B.1 aLiu, Guo-Jun0 tRedox Biology.g2016 Oct., v. 9 p.144-156dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245010500208300002000313520087300333592002801206653002501234653002001259653001201279653002401291700001801315700002101333700001601354700002401370700002501394700001601419700001901435700001901454700001801473773019401491856007901685852000901764655001201773IND60518047420221122033946.0160406e20160322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051804742DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15192921132doi7 aPMC48127172pmcid7 a269576052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalaleeva, Marina10aDual function of C/D box small nucleolar RNAs in rRNA modification and alternative pre-mRNA splicing  ap. E1625-E1634.  aSignificance C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (SNORDs) are abundant, short, nucleoli-residing, noncoding RNAs that guide the methyltransferase fibrillarin to perform 2′- O -methylation of target RNAs. We identified 29 SNORDs present in a fibrillarin-containing fraction as well as a fibrillarin-free fraction enriched in spliceosomes. One of these SNORDs, SNORD27 , directs rRNA methylation and regulates alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) of E2F7 pre-mRNA, a transcriptional repressor of cell cycle-regulated genes. SNORD27 likely regulates E2F7 pre-mRNA AS by masking splice sites through base pairing. This previously unidentified function of SNORDs increases the number of factors regulating AS, a critical step in the expression of the vast majority of human genes, and highlights a potential coupling between AS, cell cycle, proliferation, and ribosome biogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 0aalternative splicing 0agene regulation 0asnoRNAs 0apre-mRNA processing1 aPages, Amadis1 aMatuszek, Zaneta1 aHidmi, Sana1 aAgranat-Tamir, Lily1 aKorotkov, Konstantin1 aNevo, Yuval1 aEyras, Eduardo1 aSperling, Ruth1 aStamm, Stefan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2016 Mar. 22, v. 113, no. 12 p.E1625-E1634dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15192921133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009300165300001600258520112700274592002801401650001301429650002301442650002401465650002101489650001501510650001601525650002701541650001901568650001501587650001001602650001401612650001401626650002301640650001001663650001601673650002001689650001001709650002101719650002201740650001601762700001801778700001801796700002401814700002201838773012601860856008201986852000902068655001202077IND60614198520221118103046.0181011e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061419852DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136180500902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukhin, V.

They represent widespread eurybiont species and do not include any specialized mycetobionts. The communities formed by them have a host preference and green algae are their basic and obligate component, while other organisms are facultative components. Basidiocarps in which mycetobionts include heterocytic cyanoprokaryotes (Anabaena sp., Calothrix parietina, Hassallia byssoidea, Nostoc commune, N. punctiforme, Nostoc sp., and Scytonema ocellatum) are capable of molecular nitrogen fixation. Its activity is 0.044–0.903 mg of C₂H₄/m²/h in the basidiocarps of Bjerkandera adusta, Cerrena unicolor, Gloeophyllum sepiarium, and Trametes ochracea and 0.001–0.008 mg of C₂H₄/m²/h in the basidiocarps of Onnia leporina, Phellinus chrysoloma, Ph. tremulae, and Trametes pubescens.

A central focus of the analyses is given by metal ion acidity within the respective solvent complexes. For this purpose, a recently developed model for estimating the pK of the auto-protolysis reaction 2NH₃ → NH₄⁺ + NH₂⁻ is transferred to assessing the ‘local’ pK of ammonia molecules coordinating a metal ion. On this basis, we identify Mᴵ/ᴵᴵ(NH₃)ₙ⁺/⁺⁺ complexes (M = Na⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺ with n = 6 and M = Ca²⁺ with n = 8, respectively) as predominant species unless extremely ammono-basic conditions are imposed. On the other hand, the trivalent Al³⁺ and Ga³⁺ species were found to favor [Al(NH₂)₃(NH₃)₂]⁰ and [Ga(NH₂)₄]⁻ complexes, respectively. The negatively charged complexes dominate over a wide range of pH for gallium ion solvation in ammonia, whilst [Al(NH₂)₄(NH₃)₂]⁻ complexes require moderately ammono-basic solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aaluminum 3aammonia 3aammonium 3acalcium 3agallium 3aliquids 3amagnesium 3ametal ions 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3apH 3apotassium 3asodium 3asolvents0 tRSC advances.g2017 Nov. 24, v. 7, no. 85 p.54063-54067dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra11462a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006400145245008600209300002000295520150500315592002801820650001801848650001601866650001901882650000901901650002601910650002501936650002901961650002201990651001502012700002302027700002602050700002302076773014302099856007902242852000902321655001202330IND60613897520221116161557.0180918e20180904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061389752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b009082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Christa M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3012-600210aClimate Change Mitigation, Air Pollution, and Environmental Justice in California  ap. 10829-10838.  aClimate change mitigation policies can have significant co-benefits for air quality, including benefits to disadvantaged communities experiencing substantial air pollution. However, the effects of these mitigation policies have rarely been evaluated with respect to their influence on disadvantaged communities. Here we assess the air pollution and environmental justice implications of California’s cap-and-trade mitigation program through analysis of (1) the sources of air pollution in disadvantaged communities, (2) emissions-reduction offset usage under the cap-and-trade program, and (3) the relationship between reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and reductions in co-pollutant emissions. Our analysis suggests that the cap-and-trade program has limited impacts, including limited disproportionate impacts, on air quality in disadvantaged communities. The sources of most air pollution in these communities have not been subject to the cap-and-trade program, and the use of emissions-reduction offsets is only marginally higher in disadvantaged communities than in other communities. Furthermore, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions imply smaller proportional reductions in co-pollutant emissions. While climate policies lead to important air quality co-benefits in some contexts, especially through reduced coal usage, targeted air quality policies and regulations may be more effective for reducing air pollution in disadvantaged communities in California and throughout the state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aclimate change 3acoal 3aenvironmental markets 3aenvironmental policy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3apollution control 3aCalifornia1 aKissel, Kendall A.1 aField, Christopher B.1 aMach, Katharine J.0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Sept. 04, v. 52, no. 18 p.10829-10838dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b009083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245011600206300001800322506007600340520119300416592002801609506003701637650001501674650002401689650001001713650002201723650001901745650002101764650000901785650001301794650001801807650003101825650002801856650001101884650001701895650001601912650003701928700001801965700001601983700001901999773017302018856007902191852000902270655001202279IND60173682520221207054251.0150603e20130521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017368252DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13071521102doi7 aPMC36667172pmcid7 a236503742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiley, Devin T.10aTranscytosis and brain uptake of transferrin-containing nanoparticles by tuning avidity to transferrin receptor  ap. 8662-8667.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReceptor-mediated transcytosis across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) may be a useful way to transport therapeutics into the brain. Here we report that transferrin (Tf)-containing gold nanoparticles can reach the brain parenchyma from systemic administration in mice through a receptor-mediated transcytosis pathway. This transport is aided by tuning the nanoparticle avidity to Tf receptor (TfR), which is correlated with nanoparticle size and total amount of Tf decorating the nanoparticle surface. Nanoparticles of both 45 nm and 80 nm diameter reach the brain parenchyma, and their accumulation there (visualized by silver enhancement light microscopy in combination with transmission electron microscopy imaging) is observed to be dependent on Tf content (avidity); nanoparticles with large amounts of Tf remain strongly attached to brain endothelial cells, whereas those with less Tf are capable of both interacting with TfR on the luminal side of the BBB and detaching from TfR on the brain side of the BBB. The requirement of proper avidity for nanoparticles to reach the brain parenchyma is consistent with recent behavior observed with transcytosing antibodies that bind to TfR.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3aendothelial cells 3aimage analysis 3alight microscopy 3amice 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3aphysiological transport 3asilver 3atherapeutics 3atransferrin 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWebster, Paul1 aGale, Aaron1 aDavis, Mark E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 May 21, v. 110, no. 21 p.8662-8667dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13071521103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014300171520155100314592002801865650001601893650001501909650001201924650001901936650001701955650001301972650001101985650001201996650002402008650002302032650001502055650001902070650001702089650001902106650001602125653003602141653002802177653002002205653004802225653003002273700001602303700001802319700001702337700001902354700002402373700005802397773011502455856008602570852000902656655001202665IND60739207220221123011120.0210904e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073920722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeung, Chi Shun10aInsights into unexpected photoisomerization from photooxidation of tribromoacetic acid in aqueous environment using ultrafast spectroscopy  aHaloacetic acids are carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DPBs) and their photo-decomposition pathways, especially for those containing bromine and iodine, are not fully understood. In this study, femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy experiments were introduced for the first time to investigate the photochemistry of tribromoacetic acid. The fs-TA experiments showed that a photoisomerization intermediate species HOOCCBr₂−Br (iso-TBAA) was formed within several picoseconds after the excitation of TBAA. The absorption wavelength of the iso-TBAA was supported by time-dependent density calculations. With the Second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory, the structures and thermodynamics of the OH-insertion reactions of iso-TBAA were elucidated when water molecules were involved in the reaction complex. The calculations also revealed that the isomer species were able to react with water with its reaction dynamics dramatically catalyzed by the hydrogen bonding network. The proposed water catalyzed OH-insertion/HBr elimination mechanism predicted three major photoproducts, namely, HBr, CO and CO₂, which was consistent with the photolysis experiments with firstly reported CO formation rate and mass conversion yield as 0.096 min⁻¹ and 0.75 ± 0.1 respectively. The spectroscopic technique, numerical tool and disclosed mechanisms provided insights on photodecomposition and subsequent reactions of polyhalo-DPBs contain heavy atom(s) (e.g., Br, I) with water, aliphatic alcohols or other nucleophiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aabsorption 3abromine 3acarbon dioxide 3adisinfection 3ahydrogen 3aiodine 3aisomers 3amathematical theory 3aphotoisomerization 3aphotolysis 3aphotooxidation 3aspectroscopy 3athermodynamics 3awavelengths 0aSolvent-assisted dehalogenation 0aDisinfection byproducts 0aHaloacetic acid 0aUltrafast transient absorption spectroscopy 0aDensity functional theory1 aTSE, Ho-Yin1 aLau, Chun Yin1 aGuan, Jianyu1 aHuang, Jinqing1 aPhillips, David Lee1 aLeu, Shao-Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7262-14530 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 418 p.126214-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245003400161300001600195520164600211592002801857650001501885650001801900650002301918650001001941650002201951650001101973700002001984773012602004856007402130852000902204655001202213IND60663071320221122001336.0190909e20120821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066307132DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ib00188h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFenz, Susanne F.10aGiant vesicles as cell models  ap. 982-995.  aTremendous progress has been made in recent years in understanding the working of the living cell, including its micro-anatomy, signalling networks, and regulation of genes. However, an understanding of cellular phenomena using fundamental laws starting from first principles is still very far away. Part of the reason is that a cell is an active and exquisitely complex system where every part is linked to the other. Thus, it is difficult or even impossible to design experiments that selectively and exclusively probe a chosen aspect of the cell. Various kinds of idealised systems and cell models have been used to circumvent this problem. An important example is a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV, also called giant liposome), which provides a cell-sized confined volume to study biochemical reactions as well as self-assembly processes that occur on the membrane. The GUV membrane can be designed suitably to present selected, correctly-oriented cell-membrane proteins, whose mobility is confined to two dimensions. Here, we present recent advances in GUV design and the use of GUVs as cell models that enable quantitative testing leading to insight into the working of real cells. We briefly recapitulate important classical concepts in membrane biophysics emphasising the advantages and limitations of GUVs. We then present results obtained over the last decades using GUVs, choosing the formation of membrane domains and cell adhesion as examples for in-depth treatment. Insight into cell adhesion obtained using micro-interferometry is treated in detail. We conclude by summarising the open questions and possible future directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophysics 3acell adhesion 3achemical reactions 3agenes 3amembrane proteins 3amodels1 aSengupta, Kheya0 tIntegrative biology.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 4, no. 9 p.982-995dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ib00188h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012300162300002000285520134100305592002801646650001501674650002301689650001301712650001501725653002401740653001901764653002401783653002401807653001601831700002001847700001701867700001501884773012801899856007802027852000902105655001202114IND60528906420221118160228.0160717e20160504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052890642DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b127172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jong Won10aTernary Blend Composed of Two Organic Donors and One Acceptor for Active Layer of High-Performance Organic Solar Cells  ap. 10961-10967.  aTernary blends composed of two donor absorbers with complementary absorptions provide an opportunity to enhance the short-circuit current and thus the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells. In addition to complementary absorption of two donors, ternary blends may exhibit favorable morphology for high-performance solar cells when one chooses properly the donor pair. For this purpose, we develop a ternary blend with two donors (diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymer (PTDPP2T) and small molecule ((TDPP)₂Ph)) and one acceptor (PC₇₁BM). The solar cell made of a ternary blend with 10 wt % (TDPP)₂Ph exhibits higher PCE of 7.49% as compared with the solar cells with binary blends, PTDPP2T:PC₇₁BM (6.58%) and (TDPP)₂Ph:PC₇₁BM (3.21%). The higher PCE of the ternary blend solar cell is attributed mainly to complementary absorption of two donors. However, a further increase in (TDPP)₂Ph content in the ternary blend (>10 wt %) decreases the PCE. The ternary blend with 10 wt % (TDPP)₂Ph exhibits well-developed morphology with narrow-sized fibrils while the blend with 15 wt % (TDPP)₂Ph shows phase separation with large-sized domains, demonstrating that the phase morphology and compatibility of ternary blend are important factors to achieve a high-performance solar cell made of ternary blends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3aseparation 0aorganic solar cells 0aternary blends 0abulk heterojunction 0aabsorption property 0amiscibility1 aChoi, Yoon-suk,1 aAhn, Hyungju1 aJo, Won Ho0 tACS applied materials .g2016 May 04, v. 8, no. 17 p.10961-10967dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b127173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245014300209520143400352592002801786650001101814650002401825650001301849650001701862650001401879650001201893650001901905650002601924650001101950650003501961650001801996650001602014650001802030650002302048653002402071653002802095653002902123653002102152653003302173700005702206700001702263700001702280700001702297700001802314700001702332773011402349856008602463852000902549655001202558IND60739207420221123024344.0211106e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073920742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhiliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8612-123010aThermal cotreatment of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash with sewage sludge for PCDD/Fs decomposition and reformation suppression  aThermal treatment of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (FA) is an effective method to detoxicate FA and produce secondary material with good utilization properties, but the high temperature induced migration of carbon, chlorine, and catalytic metals from FA to flue gases can result in a considerable reformation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Herein, two typical fly ashes were thermally cotreated with sewage sludge (SS), respectively, and the decomposition and reformation of PCDD/Fs were systematically investigated. Thermal treatment effectively decomposed PCDD/Fs in all samples to a low level well meeting the reutilization criterion of 50 ng WHO-TEQ g⁻¹. Cleavage of the oxygen bridge was identified as the primary decomposition pathway. Compared to mono-treating FA, cotreating FA with SS resulted in a better CaO-Al₂O₃-SiO₂ ternary system for vitrification and effectively suppressed the reformation of PCDD/Fs in off-gases with inhibition efficiencies up to 96%. Based on the variation of chemical speciation of N, P, and S in SS after thermal treatment, SS appeared to be a S-N-containing inhibitor which passivated catalytic metals to suppress PCDD/Fs synthesis. The better suppression on de novo pathway than on chlorophenol-route identified by monitoring PCDD/F-fingerprints evolution further verified the suppression mechanism of passivating catalytic metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical speciation 3achlorine 3adibenzofuran 3aevolution 3afly ash 3aheat treatment 3amunicipal solid waste 3aoxygen 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3asewage sludge 3atemperature 3avitrification 3awaste incineration 0aPCDD/F-fingerprints 0aReformation suppression 0aS-N-containing inhibitor 0aCatalytic metals 0aChlorophenol-route congeners1 aLin, Xiaoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1690-136X1 aZhang, Sheng1 aXiangbo, Zou1 aLi, Xiaodong1 aLu, Shengyong1 aYan, Jianhua0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 416 p.126216-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04269naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245015100201300001800352500002000370520198900390592002802379596005202407596005202459596005102511596005102562596005102613596005102664596005102715596005102766596006502817596004602882596004502928650002202973650001202995650001903007650001203026650001603038650001403054650001703068650001903085650001603104650001103120650001403131650002403145650002503169650002503194650000903219650000903228650001303237700002103250700002103271700002603292700006203318700002003380700002203400773012103422856007903543852000903622655001203631IND60648737920221117160125.0190701e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064873792DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.131462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIler, Amy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3354-759310aReproductive losses due to climate change‐induced earlier flowering are not the primary threat to plant population viability in a perennial herb  ap. 1931-1943.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite a global footprint of shifts in flowering phenology in response to climate change, the reproductive consequences of these shifts are poorly understood. Furthermore, it is unknown whether altered flowering times affect plant population viability. We examine whether climate change‐induced earlier flowering has consequences for population persistence by incorporating reproductive losses from frost damage (a risk of early flowering) into population models of a subalpine sunflower (Helianthella quinquenervis). Using long‐term demographic data for three populations that span the species’ elevation range (8–15 years, depending on the population), we first examine how snowmelt date affects plant vital rates. To verify vital rate responses to snowmelt date experimentally, we manipulate snowmelt date with a snow removal experiment at one population. Finally, we construct stochastic population projection models and Life Table Response Experiments for each population. We find that populations decline (λₛ < 1) as snowmelt dates become earlier. Frost damage to flower buds, a consequence of climate change‐induced earlier flowering, does not contribute strongly to population declines. Instead, we find evidence that negative effects on survival, likely due to increased drought risk during longer growing seasons, drive projected population declines under earlier snowmelt dates. Synthesis. Shifts in flowering phenology are a conspicuous and important aspect of biological responses to climate change, but here we show that the phenology of reproductive events can be unreliable measures of threats to population persistence, even when earlier flowering is associated with substantial reproductive losses. Evidence for shifts in reproductive phenology, along with scarcer evidence that these shifts actually influence reproductive success, are valuable but can paint an incomplete and even misleading picture of plant population responses to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB 75-15422cDivision of Environmental Biology  aDEB 78-07784cDivision of Environmental Biology  aDEB-0238331cDivision of Environmental Biology  aDEB-0922080cDivision of Environmental Biology  aDEB-1145588cDivision of Environmental Biology  aDEB-1354104cDivision of Environmental Biology  aDEB-1543651cDivision of Environmental Biology  aDEB-9408382cDivision of Environmental Biology  aCOFUND Marie Curie FellowshipcCOFUND Marie Curie Fellowship  aBSR 81-08387cNational Science Foundation  aIBN-9814509cNational Science Foundation 3aHelianthus annuus 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aflower buds 3aflowering 3afrost injury 3agrowing season 3alife tables 3amodels 3aphenology 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation viability 3areproductive success 3arisk 3asnow 3asnowmelt1 aCompagnoni, Aldo1 aInouye, David W.1 aWilliams, Jennifer L.1 aCaraDonna, Paul J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3517-90901 aAnderson, Aaron1 aMiller, Tom E.

The mechanisms involved in the dark chilling-induced inhibition of photosynthesis were explored further in a chilling tolerant (Highveld Top) and sensitive (PAN809) soybean genotype in experiments where low soil temperatures were present (whole plant chilling, WPC) or absent (shoot-localised chilling, SC). Initially (after three nights of chilling) both the WPC and SC treatments induced the same symptoms in PAN809. These symptoms could thus be ascribed to chilling stress effects on the shoots. Typical symptoms included reduced CO₂ assimilation capacity, inhibition of photosystem II function and lower chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBPase) and sucrose-phosphate-synthase (SPS) activity. When the nodulated root systems of PAN809 were also exposed to low temperatures (WPC treatment), additional constraints gradually developed, which were not observed in Highveld Top. Novel evidence is provided showing that the response in PAN809 is influenced by whether whole-plant or shoot-localised dark chilling occurs and that cFBPase is specifically targeted resulting in severe inhibition of CO₂ assimilation capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aphotosystem II 3aroot systems 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil temperature 3asoybeans1 avan Heerden, Philippus D.R.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2011 Dec., v. 74 p.261-271dElsevier B.V.x0098-84727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2011.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014900170520115500319592002801474650001301502650002401515650001601539650001001555650001901565650001901584650001901603650002001622653001701642653001801659653002101677653001301698700001401711700001601725700001701741700005601758700001901814700001501833700001201848700001901860773011401879856008601993852000902079655001202088IND60739207520221121223855.0211106e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073920752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Chun-Hui10aEfficient photocatalytic H2 evolution and Cr(VI) reduction under visible light using a novel Z-scheme SnIn4S8/CeO2 heterojunction photocatalysts  aSemiconductor photocatalysis technology is a promising method for hydrogen production and water pollution treatment. Here, the SnIn₄S₈/CeO₂ (SISC) composites were fabricated by a stirring and calcination method, and the mass ratio of SnIn₄S₈ to CeO₂ was optimized. The 50 wt% SISC heterojunction photocatalyst has the highest visible light catalytic activity. The degradation rate of hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) is 98.8% in 75 min of light irradiation, which is 2.48 times that of pure CeO₂. Besides, the 50 wt% SISC composite photocatalyst also has the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency (0.6193 mmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹), which exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity than pure CeO₂ and SnIn₄S₈. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the Z-scheme heterojunction structure between CeO₂ and SnIn₄S₈, which can effectively separate and transfer photo-generated charges, thereby reducing the recombination of photo-generated carriers. We hope this work can provide ideas for constructing Z-scheme heterojunction structures and improving photocatalytic activity under visible light.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3awater pollution 0aSnIn4S8/CeO2 0aH2 production 0aCr(VI) reduction 0aZ-scheme1 aChen, Yao1 aXu, Xin-Jie1 aLi, Xue-Yang1 aWen, Xiao-Ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6450-72441 aLiu, Zong-Tang1 aXing, Rong1 aGuo, He1 aFei, Zheng-Hao0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 416 p.126217-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147242015400166245015400320300001800474520135400492592002801846650002901874650001601903650000801919650001301927650001001940650001201950650001101962650001801973650001501991650001202006650002002018650002502038650001502063651001202078700002002090700002202110700002002132700001802152700002402170700002502194700001902219773009702238856004802335852000902383655001202392IND50070762720221121065538.0131120e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007076272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-013-1043-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKidmose, Jacob10aFocused groundwater discharge of phosphorus to a eutrophic seepage lake (Lake Væng, Denmark): Implications for lake ecological state and restoration10aFocused groundwater discharge of phosphorus to a eutrophic seepage lake (Lake Væng, Denmark): implications for lake ecological state and restoration  ap. 1787-1802.  aA study on Lake Væng in Denmark demonstrates a high potential for loading of phosphorous via groundwater to seepage lakes. Groundwater discharges are displayed as an important source of phosphorous to a lake due to: (1) high concentrations in the aquifer just below the lake, and (2) the main flow paths through the aquifer-lakebed interface either being overland flow through a seepage face, or focused in zones with very high discharge rates. In-lake springs have measured discharge of up to 7.45 m3 per m2 of lakebed per day. These findings were based on seepage meter measurements at 18 locations, stable isotope (δ18O) analyses, temperature profiles and mapping of ice cover distribution. Groundwater-lake interaction was modelled with a 2D conceptual flow model (MODFLOW) with hydrogeology interpreted from catchment multi electrode profiling, on-lake ground-penetrating radar, well logging and borehole data. Discharge was found to be much focused and opposite to expected increase away from the shoreline. The average total phosphorus concentration in discharging groundwater sampled just beneath the lakebed was 0.162 mg TP/l and thereby well over freshwater ecological thresholds (0.043-0.612, median = 0.117 mg TP/l). The study illustrates a direct link between groundwater and lake chemistry. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aground-penetrating radar 3agroundwater 3aice 3aisotopes 3alakes 3alogging 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3aphosphorus 3aseepage 3asprings (water) 3atemperature profiles 3awatersheds 3aDenmark1 aNilsson, Bertel1 aEngesgaard, Peter1 aFrandsen, Mette1 aKaran, Sachin1 aLandkildehus, Frank1 aSøndergaard, Martin1 aJeppesen, Erik0 tHydrogeology journal.g2013 Dec., v. 21, no. 8 p.1787-1802dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-013-1043-7  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008900158300002000247520073200267592002800999650002201027650001101049650004901060650002201109650001601131650001201147650001201159650001301171650002201184700001501206700002001221700001801241700001701259700001301276700001901289773012401308856007401432852000901506655001201515IND60642238920221118123402.0190506e20171212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064223892DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra11512a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Honghui10aEngineering the metal-binding loop at a type 1 copper center by circular permutation  ap. 56093-56098.  aCupredoxins are electron transfer proteins with a single type 1 copper center. A metal-binding loop in the protein harbors 3 of the copper ligands. Previous research has altered the sequence and length of the loop, changing the spectroscopic properties and reduction potentials of cupredoxins. It remains elusive whether the loop is flexible enough to tolerate long sequences. In this work we extended the loop to infinity by performing circular permutation on azurin, a typical cupredoxin. The mutant protein, Az-loop was characterized by absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and X-ray crystallography. The results further confirm the flexibility of the metal-binding loop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acopper 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aengineering 3aligands 3amutants 3aproteins 3aspectral analysis1 aSu, Binbin1 aZhang, Tongtong1 aHuang, Aiping1 aLiu, Haiping1 aYu, Yang1 aWang, Jiangyun0 tRSC advances.g2017 Dec. 12, v. 7, no. 88 p.56093-56098dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra11512a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013100167300001600298520149700314592002801811650002601839650002101865650000801886650001601894650001201910650001501922650000901937651001601946651001301962700002301975773010101998856008102099852000902180655001202189IND60439638520221122004652.0151024e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043963852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-006-0218-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, Dana R.10aInvertebrate community and stream substrate responses to woody debris removal from an ice storm-impacted stream system, NY USA  ap. 477-488.  aWe assessed the influence of ice-storm-derived debris dams on aquatic macroinvertebrates and stream substrates in a high-gradient watershed in the eastern Adirondack Mountains of New York State. Using a modification of electrofishing techniques, invertebrates were collected once before (June 2000) and once after (June 2001) wood removal from the downstream reach in each of six pairs of reaches (second and third-order streams). Stream substrates were also mapped in 2000 and 2001 to evaluate shifts in dominant substrates within a reach following wood removal. The following metrics were used to compare the invertebrate communities before and after wood removal: genera similarity, Shannon–Weiner equitability, taxa richness, dominant taxon, percent dominance and functional feeding group relative abundance. The changes in removal reaches were evaluated relative to changes in upstream reference reaches using a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) design and analysis. Stream substrates did not change significantly in response to wood removal, although a trend toward coarser substrates was observed following removal. Following wood removal, the relative proportion of grazers increased upstream and downstream from removed dams in all streams; however, comparisons of other metrics indicated no significant response to removal. Invertebrate responses to wood removal were lower than expected, perhaps due to the presence of abundant boulder-formed pools in this high gradient system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic invertebrates 3adams (hydrology) 3aice 3amethodology 3astreams 3awatersheds 3awood 3aAdirondacks 3aNew York1 aKraft, Clifford E.0 tHydrobiologia.g2006 Sept., v. 568, no. 1 p.477-488dKluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0218-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008600174300002000260500001900280520135900299592002801658650000801686650001501694650001101709650001501720650001001735650000901745650001901754650002101773650000701794650001301801650001101814700005301825700005501878773011701933856008402050852000902134655001202143IND60712088420221120194804.0201009e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071208842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c021222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushalkar, Mehal P.10aPromoting DNA Adsorption by Acids and Polyvalent Cations: Beyond Charge Screening  ap. 11183-11195.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAdsorbing DNA oligonucleotides onto nanoparticles is the first step in developing DNA-based biosensors, drug delivery systems, and smart materials. Since DNA is a polyanion, it is repelled by negatively charged nanoparticles, which constitute the majority of commonly used nanomaterials. Adding salt such as NaCl to screen charge repulsion is a standard method of promoting DNA adsorption. However, Na⁺ does not supply additional attractive forces. In addition, adding a high concentration of NaCl can cause the aggregation of nanomaterials. In this feature article, we mainly summarize the methods developed in our laboratory to promote DNA adsorption by lowering the pH and by adding polyvalent metal ions, especially transition-metal ions. Various materials including noble metals (gold, silver, and platinum), 2D materials (graphene oxide, MoS₂, WS₂, and MXene), polydopamine, and several metal oxides are discussed. In general, low pH can protonate DNA bases and nanoparticle surfaces, reducing charge repulsion and even leading to attraction, although DNA folding at low pH can sometimes be detrimental to adsorption. Polyvalent metal ions can bridge additional interactions to achieve otherwise impossible adsorption. On the basis of the current understanding, a few future research directions are proposed to further improve DNA adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadsorption 3aanions 3abiosensors 3adrugs 3agold 3agraphene oxide 3aoligonucleotides 3apH 3aplatinum 3asilver1 aLiu, Biwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7357-98751 aLiu, Juewen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5918-93360 tLangmuir.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 36, no. 38 p.11183-11195dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c021223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015500162300001600317520136500333592002801698596005901726596008601785596008401871650003601955650002201991650002902013650002602042650001602068650002702084650002502111650002002136650002402156650002302180650003202203650001902235650001802254650001802272650001002290700001402300700002102314700001402335700001702349700001802366700001702384700001502401773013002416856008102546852000902627655001202636IND60614199120221118103039.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061419912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-018-0084-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Fang10aConstitutive expression of antimicrobial peptide PR-39 in transgenic mice significantly enhances resistance to bacterial infection and promotes growth  ap. 409-422.  aUse of huge amounts of antibiotics in farm animal production has promoted the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which poses a serious threat to public health. Therefore, alternative approaches are needed to reduce or replace antibiotic usage in the food animal industry. PR-39 is a pig-derived proline-rich antimicrobial peptide that has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and a low propensity for development of resistance by microorganisms. To test whether ubiquitous expression of PR-39 in transgenic (TG) mice can increase resistance against bacterial infection, we generated TG mice that ubiquitously express a pig-derived antimicrobial peptide PR-39 and analyzed their growth and resistance to infection of the highly pathogenic Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) isolated from swine. The growth performance was significantly increased in TG mice compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates. After the APP challenge, TG mice exhibited a significantly higher survival rate and significantly lower tissue bacterial load than WT littermates. Furthermore, the tissue lesion severity that resulted from APP infection was milder in TG mice than that in their WT littermates. This study provides a good foundation for the development of PR-39-expressing TG animals, which could reduce the use of antibiotics in the farm animal industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a31601911cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2014A030310500cDepartment of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province, China  a2015TX01N081cDepartment of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province, China 3aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 3aanimal production 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacterial infections 3agene expression 3agenetic engineering 3agrowth performance 3alivestock and meat industry 3amicrobial load 3apublic health 3asurvival rate 3aswine1 aDong, Rui1 aZhao, Chengcheng1 aLiu, Dewu1 aZheng, Enqin1 aSong, Changxu1 aWu, Zhenfang1 aLi, Zicong0 tTransgenic research.g2018 Oct., v. 27, no. 5 p.409-422dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl53275x0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-018-0084-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01574naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245008800152300001600240520063200256592002800888650002200916650001200938650002600950650001700976650002600993700002601019700002001045773012401065856007401189852000901263655001201272IND60663071820221122021508.0190909e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066307182DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ib20015e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jun10aInvestigation of in vivo microtubule and stress fiber mechanics with laser ablation  ap. 471-479.  aLaser ablation has emerged as a useful technique to study the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton in living cells.

Differences in localization and degree of post‐translational modifications of proteins including phosphorylations are of tremendous interest due to the anticipated role in molecular regulatory processes. Because of their particular low abundance in prokaryotes, identification and quantification of protein phosphorylation is traditionally performed by either comparison of spot intensities on two‐dimensional gels after differential phosphoprotein staining or gel‐free by stable isotope labeling, sequential phosphopeptide enrichment and following LC‐MS analysis. In the current work, we combined in a proof‐of‐principle experiment these techniques using ¹⁴N/¹⁵N metabolic labeling with succeeding protein separation on 2D gels. The visualization of phosphorylations on protein level by differential staining was followed by protein identification and determination of phosphorylation sites and quantification by LC‐MS/MS. This approach should avoid disadvantages of traditional workflows, in particular the limited capability of peptide‐based gel‐free methods to quantify isoforms of proteins. Comparing control and stress conditions allowed for relative quantification in protein phosphorylation in Bacillus pumilus exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Altogether, we quantified with this method 19 putatively phosphorylated proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus pumilus 3adifferential staining 3aelectrophoresis 3agels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphopeptides 3aphosphoproteins 3apost-translational modification 3aprokaryotic cells 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aproteomics 3astable isotopes1 aDewald, Carolin1 aOtto, Andreas1 aBüttner, Knut1 aHecker, Michael1 aBecher, Dörte0 tElectrophoresis.g2018 Jan., v. 39, no. 2 p.334-343dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2017002203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001400190245022900204300001600433520204800449592002802497653000802525653000802533653000902541653001202550653000802562653000902570653000902579653000802588653000902596653000902605653000802614653001002622653000802632653000802640653000902648653000702657653000902664653000802673653000802681653001402689653001602703653002202719653001302741700002002754700001702774700001502791773007802806856008302884852000902967655001202976IND60555044220221118153352.0161103e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055504422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2016.08.0122doi7 aPMC50111672pmcid7 a275724182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chuan10aQuercetin affects glutathione levels and redox ratio in human aortic endothelial cells not through oxidation but formation and cellular export of quercetin-glutathione conjugates and upregulation of glutamate-cysteine ligase  ap. 220-228.  aEndothelial dysfunction due to vascular inflammation and oxidative stress critically contributes to the etiology of atherosclerosis. The intracellular redox environment plays a key role in regulating endothelial cell function and is intimately linked to cellular thiol status, including and foremost glutathione (GSH). In the present study we investigated whether and how the dietary flavonoid, quercetin, affects GSH status of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and their response to oxidative stress. We found that treating cells with buthionine sulfoximine to deplete cellular GSH levels significantly reduced the capacity of quercetin to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidant production. Furthermore, incubation of HAEC with quercetin caused a transient decrease and then full recovery of cellular GSH concentrations. The initial decline in GSH was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in glutathione disulfide (GSSG). To the contrary, GSSG levels, which were less than 0.5% of GSH levels at baseline (0.26±0.01 vs. 64.7±1.9nmol/mg protein, respectively), decreased by about 25% during incubation with quercetin. As a result, the GSH: GSSG ratio increased by about 70%, from 253±7 to 372±23. These quercetin-induced changes in GSH and GSSG levels were not affected by treating HAEC with 500µM ascorbic acid phosphate for 24h to increase intracellular ascorbate levels. Incubation of HAEC with quercetin also led to the appearance of extracellular quercetin-glutathione conjugates, which was paralleled by upregulation of the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1). Furthermore, quercetin slightly but significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) catalytic and modifier subunits. Taken together, our results suggest that quercetin causes loss of GSH in HAEC, not because of oxidation but due to formation and cellular export of quercetin-glutathione conjugates. Induction by quercetin of GCL subsequently restores GSH levels, thereby suppressing LPS-induced oxidant production.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAAP 0aBSO 0aBPDS 0aDCFH-DA 0aGCL 0aGCLC 0aGCLM 0aGSH 0aGSSG 0aHAEC 0aIAA 0aLC-MS 0aLPS 0aMRM 0aMRP1 0aNO 0aNrf2 0ap38 0aROS 0aQuercetin 0aGlutathione 0aEndothelial cells 0aOxidants1 aZhang, Wei-Jian1 aChoi, Jaewoo1 aFrei, Balz0 tRedox Biology.g2016 Oct., v. 9 p.220-228dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2016.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009300167300001800260520141200278592002801690650001101718650001901729650001501748650003701763650001201800650001201812650002001824650002401844700002301868700002001891700002101911700001901932700001801951700002101969773009401990856008502084990002302169852000902192655001202201IND60098274220221119082921.0141104e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009827422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPike, Tanya10aTruncated MEK1 is required for transient activation of MAPK signalling in G2 phase cells  ap. 1423-1428.  aThe primary endpoint of signalling through the canonical Raf–MEK–ERK MAP kinase cascade is ERK activation. Here we report a novel signalling outcome for this pathway. Activation of the MAP kinase pathway by growth factors or phorbol esters during G2 phase results in only transient activations of ERK and p90RSK, then suppression to below control levels. A small peak of ERK and p90RSK activation in early G2 phase cells was identified, and inhibition of this delayed entry into mitosis. The previously identified, proteolytically cleaved form of MEK1 termed tMEK (truncated MEK1), is also induced with G2 phase MAPK pathway activation. We demonstrate that addition of recombinant mutants of MEK1 with an N-terminal truncation similar to that of tMEK also inhibited ERK and p90RSK activations and delayed progression into mitosis. Only catalytically inactive forms of tMEK were capable of these effects, but surprisingly, phosphorylation on the activating Ser218/222 sites was also required. A lack of MEK1 or ability to accumulate tMEK resulted in the absence of the feedback inhibition of ERK and p90RSK activations. tMEK is a novel output from the canonical MAP kinase signalling pathway, acting in a MAPK signalling-regulated dominant negative manner to inhibit ERK and p90RSK activations, acting as a dampening mechanism to reduce the magnitude or duration of MAPK pathway signalling in G2/M phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aesters 3agrowth factors 3ainterphase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitosis 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction1 aWidberg, Charlotte1 aGoodall, Andrew1 aPayne, Elizabeth1 aGiles, Nichole1 aHancock, John1 aGabrielli, Brian0 tCellular signalling.g2013 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.1423-1428dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.03.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013400172300002000306520165700326592002801983650001102011650002002022650001002042650003702052650001402089650002102103650001802124650002602142700003002168700002502198700002702223700002002250773013002270856008102400852000902481655001202490IND60569629520221118234736.0170608e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056962952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7841-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuruta, Lilian Rumi10aGenetic analyses of Per.C6 cell clones producing a therapeutic monoclonal antibody regarding productivity and long-term stability  ap. 10031-10041.  aGenetic characterization of protein-producing clones represents additional value to cell line development. In the present study, ten Per.C6 clones producing a Rebmab100 monoclonal antibody were selected using two cloning methods: six clones originated from limiting dilution cloning and four by the automated colony picker ClonePix FL. A stability program was performed for 50 generations, including 4 batches distributed along the timeframe to determine specific productivity (Qp) maintenance. Four stable clones (two from limiting dilution and two from ClonePix FL) were further evaluated. The relative mRNA expression levels of both heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) genes were verified at generations 0, 30–35, and 50–55 of the stability program. At generations 0 and 30–35, LC gene expression level was higher than HC gene, whereas at generation 50–55, the opposite prevailed. A high correlation was observed between Qp and HC or LC mRNA expression level for all clones at each generation analyzed along the continuous culture. The mRNA stability study was performed at steady-state culture. The LC gene displayed a higher half-life and lower decay constant than HC gene, accounting for the higher observed expression level of LC mRNA in comparison to HC mRNA. Clone R6 was highlighted due its high Qp, mRNA expression levels, and mRNA stability. Besides the benefits of applying genetic characterization for the selection of stable and high-producing clones, the present study shows for the first time the correlation between Qp and HC or LC expression levels and also mRNA stability in clones derived from human cell line Per.C6(®).  aPublisher supplied data 3aclones 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahalf life 3ahuman cell lines 3amessenger RNA 3amonoclonal antibodies1 aLopes dos Santos, Mariana1 aYeda, Fernanda Perez1 aOkamoto, Oswaldo Keith1 aMoro, Ana Maria0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.10031-10041dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7841-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245010500213300001800318506007600336520148800412592002801900506003701928650003101965650002701996650001602023650002202039650001002061650003002071650001302101650002902114700002302143700002302166700002202189700002602211700002402237700002102261773014502282856008202427852000902509655001202518IND60590050920221207074455.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059005092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-8767-12doi7 aPMC58472252pmcid7 a293923862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorshkova, NatalyaV.10aMu-driven transposition of recombinant mini-Mu unit DNA in the Corynebacterium glutamicum chromosome  ap. 2867-2884.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA dual-component Mu-transposition system was modified for the integration/amplification of genes in Corynebacterium. The system consists of two types of plasmids: (i) a non-replicative integrative plasmid that contains the transposing mini-Mu(LR) unit bracketed by the L/R Mu ends or the mini-Mu(LER) unit, which additionally contains the enhancer element, E, and (ii) an integration helper plasmid that expresses the transposition factor genes for MuA and MuB. Efficient transposition in the C. glutamicum chromosome (≈ 2 × 10⁻⁴ per cell) occurred mainly through the replicative pathway via cointegrate formation followed by possible resolution. Optimizing the E location in the mini-Mu unit significantly increased the efficiency of Mu-driven intramolecular transposition–amplification in C. glutamicum as well as in gram-negative bacteria. The new C. glutamicum genome modification strategy that was developed allows the consequent independent integration/amplification/fixation of target genes at high copy numbers. After integration/amplification of the first mini-Mu(LER) unit in the C. glutamicum chromosome, the E-element, which is bracketed by lox-like sites, is excised by Cre-mediated fashion, thereby fixing the truncated mini-Mu(LR) unit in its position for the subsequent integration/amplification of new mini-Mu(LER) units. This strategy was demonstrated using the genes for the citrine and green fluorescent proteins, yECitrine and yEGFP, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aGram-negative bacteria 3achromosomes 3aenhancer elements 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aplasmids 3atransposition (genetics)1 aLobanova, JuliyaS.1 aTokmakova, IrinaL.1 aSmirnov, SergeyV.1 aAkhverdyan, ValeriiZ.1 aKrylov, AlexanderA.1 aMashko, SergeyV.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Mar., v. 102, no. 6 p.2867-2884dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-8767-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009200174300002000266520139300286592002801679650001801707650002301725650001801748650001901766650002201785650002001807650001501827650001301842650002601855650001401881650002601895650004201921650002101963650001401984650001301998650001102011650001502022650001402037650001802051650001102069650001502080650002502095650000902120651001102129700003502140700001902175700002802194700002402222700002302246773013002269856008102399852000902480655001202489IND60569629620221118234638.0170608e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056962962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7839-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, Daniel Derrossi10aBacterial communities involved in sulfur transformations in wastewater treatment plants  ap. 10125-10135.  aThe main sulfate-reducing (SRB) and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) in six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located at southern Brazil were described based on high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rDNA. Specific taxa of SRB and SOB were correlated with some abiotic factors, such as the source of the wastewater, oxygen content, sample type, and physical chemical attributes of these WWTPs. When the 22 families of SRB and SOB were clustered together, the samples presented a striking distribution, demonstrating grouping patterns according to the sample type. For SOB, the most abundant families were Spirochaetaceae, Chromatiaceae, Helicobacteriaceae, Rhodospirillaceae, and Neisseriaceae, whereas, for SRB, were Syntrophaceae, Desulfobacteraceae, Nitrospiraceae, and Desulfovibriaceae. The structure and composition of the major families related to the sulfur cycle were also influenced by six chemical attributes (sulfur, potassium, zinc, manganese, phosphorus, and nitrogen). Sulfur was the chemical attribute that most influenced the variation of bacterial communities in the WWTPs (λ = 0.14, p = 0.008). The OTUs affiliated to Syntrophus showed the highest response to the increase of total sulfur. All these findings can contribute to improve the understanding in relation to the sulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing communities in WWTPs aiming to reduce H₂S emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromatiaceae 3aDesulfobacteraceae 3aNeisseriaceae 3aNitrospiraceae 3aRhodospirillaceae 3aSpirochaetaceae 3aSyntrophus 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3aemissions 3aenvironmental factors 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aribosomal DNA 3asulfur 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3azinc 3aBrazil1 ade Andrade, Pedro Avelino Maia1 aDurrer, Ademir1 aAndreote, Fernando Dini1 aCorção, Gertrudes1 aBrandelli, Adriano0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.10125-10135dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7839-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001500191245009000206300001700296506007600313520102300389592002801412506003701440650000801477650001601485650001701501650001401518650001301532650002201545650002301567650002401590650002101614650001401635650001101649650001201660650001201672650001401684650001501698650000901713650001501722650001801737650002001755650002601775653001001801653001001811653003101821653002601852653001401878653001401892653001401906700002201920700001801942700005301960773010602013856008502119852000902204655001202213IND60671764620221207065530.0200628e20191003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067176462DNAL7 a314441052pmid7 aPMC67780432pmcid7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2019.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jinjun10aEvolution of Inosine-Specific Endonuclease V from Bacterial DNase to Eukaryotic RNase  ap. 44-56.e3.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEndonuclease V (EndoV) cleaves the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to a deaminated adenosine (inosine). Although highly conserved, EndoV homologs change substrate preference from DNA in bacteria to RNA in eukaryotes. We have characterized EndoV from six different species and determined crystal structures of human EndoV and three EndoV homologs from bacteria to mouse in complex with inosine-containing DNA/RNA hybrid or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Inosine recognition is conserved, but changes in several connecting loops in eukaryotic EndoV confer recognition of 3 ribonucleotides upstream and 7 or 8 bp of dsRNA downstream of the cleavage site, and bacterial EndoV binds only 2 or 3 nt flanking the scissile phosphate. In addition to the two canonical metal ions in the active site, a third Mn²⁺ that coordinates the nucleophilic water appears necessary for product formation. Comparison of EndoV with its homologs RNase H1 and Argonaute reveals the principles by which these enzymes recognize RNA versus DNA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aLewis bases 3aactive sites 3aadenosine 3abacteria 3acrystal structure 3adeoxyribonucleases 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3ainosine 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3amice 3aphosphates 3aribonucleases 3aribonucleotides 3asubstrate specificity 0aRNase 0aDNase 0aribonucleotide recognition 0aadenosine deamination 0ametal ion 0acatalysis 0aevolution1 aSamara, Nadine L.1 aKuraoka, Isao1 aYang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3591-21950 tMolecular cell.g2019 Oct. 03, v. 76, no. 1 p.44-56.e3dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002400135245007300159300001500232520111600247592002801363650001601391650001801407650001301425650000901438650003101447650001901478700001701497700002401514700002301538700002601561700003001587700001501617773015201632856007001784856010501854852000901959655001201968IND60783163620221118234101.0220716e20220406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078316362DNAL7 a10.3791/635442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMir, Seyed Mohammad10aImaging-guided bioreactor for generating bioengineered airway tissue  ap. e63544.  aRepeated injury to airway tissue can impair lung function and cause chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Advances in regenerative medicine and bioreactor technologies offer opportunities to produce lab-grown functional tissue and organ constructs that can be used to screen drugs, model disease, and engineer tissue replacements. Here, a miniaturized bioreactor coupled with an imaging modality that allows in situ visualization of the inner lumen of explanted rat trachea during in vitro tissue manipulation and culture is described. Using this bioreactor, the protocol demonstrates imaging-guided selective removal of endogenous cellular components while preserving the intrinsic biochemical features and ultrastructure of the airway tissue matrix. Furthermore, the delivery, uniform distribution, and subsequent prolonged culture of exogenous cells on the decellularized airway lumen with optical monitoring in situ are shown. The results highlight that the imaging-guided bioreactor can potentially be used to facilitate the generation of functional in vitro airway tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioreactors 3alung function 3amedicine 3arats 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aultrastructure1 aChen, Jiawen1 aPinezich, Meghan R.1 aO’Neill, John D.1 aGuenthart, Brandon A.1 aVunjak-Novakovic, Gordana1 aKim, Jinho0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 Apr. 06, , no. 182 p.e63544-e63544dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/635443Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63544/imaging-guided-bioreactor-for-generating-bioengineered-airway-tissue  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245013100195300001800326520152100344592002801865650001401893650002401907650001001931650001701941650002301958650001601981650001101997650003002008650001502038650001802053650003902071650004002110650001702150650004902167650001202216650004902228650002802277650001402305650003002319650003402349650003902383700002302422700002402445700002302469700001802492700002502510700002402535700002902559700002002588700001902608700003002627773011202657856005502769852000902824655001202833IND4465569820221120091709.0120727e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446556982DNAL7 a214184992pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02463.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores, Gilberto E.10aMicrobial community structure of hydrothermal deposits from geochemically different vent fields along the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge  ap. 2158-2171.  aTo evaluate the effects of local fluid geochemistry on microbial communities associated with active hydrothermal vent deposits, we examined the archaeal and bacterial communities of 12 samples collected from two very different vent fields: the basalt‐hosted Lucky Strike (37°17′N, 32°16.3′W, depth 1600–1750 m) and the ultramafic‐hosted Rainbow (36°13′N, 33°54.1′W, depth 2270–2330 m) vent fields along the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Using multiplexed barcoded pyrosequencing of the variable region 4 (V4) of the 16S rRNA genes, we show statistically significant differences between the archaeal and bacterial communities associated with the different vent fields. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays of the functional gene diagnostic for methanogenesis (mcrA), as well as geochemical modelling to predict pore fluid chemistries within the deposits, support the pyrosequencing observations. Collectively, these results show that the less reduced, hydrogen‐poor fluids at Lucky Strike limit colonization by strict anaerobes such as methanogens, and allow for hyperthermophilic microaerophiles, like Aeropyrum. In contrast, the hydrogen‐rich reducing vent fluids at the ultramafic‐influenced Rainbow vent field support the prevalence of methanogens and other hydrogen‐oxidizing thermophiles at this site. These results demonstrate that biogeographical patterns of hydrothermal vent microorganisms are shaped in part by large scale geological and geochemical processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobes 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3ageochemistry 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprediction 3aribosomal RNA 2aArchaeaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBiodiversity 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aGeology 2aHydrothermal Ventsxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSeawaterxchemistryxmicrobiology.1 aCampbell, James H.1 aKirshtein, Julie D.1 aMeneghin, Jennifer1 aPodar, Mircea1 aSteinberg, Joshua I.1 aSeewald, Jeffrey S.1 aTivey, Margaret Kingston1 aVoytek, Mary A.1 aYang, Zamin K.1 aReysenbach, Anna‐Louise0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2011 Aug., v. 13, no. 8 p.2158-2171dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02463.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245010200152300001800254520171700272592002801989650002302017650001902040650002302059650002002082650001202102650001202114650001102126650001502137650001202152650001402164650001102178650001402189650001502203650002202218650001102240650001202251650002302263650001302286700002302299700001402322700003302336773012302369856007502492852000902567655001202576IND60534855320221118161653.0160803e20130507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053485532DNAL7 a10.1021/es305240n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Hao10aPredicting Copper Toxicity to Different Earthworm Species Using a Multicomponent Freundlich Model  ap. 4796-4803.  aThis study aimed to develop bioavailability models for predicting Cu toxicity to earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus, Aporrectodea longa, and Eisenia fetida) in a range of soils of varying properties. A multicomponent Freundlich model, complying with the basic assumption of the biotic ligands model, was used to relate Cu toxicity to the free Cu²⁺ activity and possible protective cations in soil porewater. Median lethal concentrations (LC50s) of Cu based on the total Cu concentration varied in each species from soil to soil, reaching differences of approximately a factor 9 in L. rubellus, 49 in A. longa and 45 in E. fetida. The relative sensitivity of the earthworms to Cu in different soils followed the same order: L. rubellus > A. longa > E. fetida. Only pH not other cations (K⁺, Ca²⁺, Na⁺, and Mg²⁺) were found to exert significant protective effects against Cu toxicity to earthworms. The Freundlich-type model in which the protective effects of pH were included, explained 84%, 94%, and 96% of variations in LC50s of Cu (expressed as free ion activity) for L. rubellus, A. longa, and E. fetida, respectively. Predicted LC50s never differed by a factor of more than 2 from the observed LC50s. External validation of the model showed a similar level of precision, even though toxicity data for other soil organisms and for different endpoints were used. The findings of the present study showed the possibility of extrapolating the developed toxicity models for one earthworm species to another species. Moreover, the Freundlich-type model in which the free Cu²⁺ activity and pH in soil porewater are considered can even be used to predict toxicity for other soil invertebrates and plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAporrectodea longa 3aEisenia fetida 3aLumbricus rubellus 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3acations 3acopper 3aearthworms 3aligands 3amagnesium 3amodels 3apotassium 3aprediction 3aprotective effect 3asodium 3asoil pH 3asorption isotherms 3atoxicity1 aVijver, Martina

S.12aA single‐nucleotide polymorphism‐based approach for rapid and cost‐effective genetic wolf monitoring in Europe based on noninvasively collected samples  ap. 295-305.  aNoninvasive genetics based on microsatellite markers has become an indispensable tool for wildlife monitoring and conservation research over the past decades. However, microsatellites have several drawbacks, such as the lack of standardisation between laboratories and high error rates. Here, we propose an alternative single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)‐based marker system for noninvasively collected samples, which promises to solve these problems. Using nanofluidic SNP genotyping technology (Fluidigm), we genotyped 158 wolf samples (tissue, scats, hairs, urine) for 192 SNP loci selected from the Affymetrix v2 Canine SNP Array. We carefully selected an optimised final set of 96 SNPs (and discarded the worse half), based on assay performance and reliability. We found rates of missing data in this SNP set of <10% and genotyping error of ~1%, which improves genotyping accuracy by nearly an order of magnitude when compared to published data for other marker types. Our approach provides a tool for rapid and cost‐effective genotyping of noninvasively collected wildlife samples. The ability to standardise genotype scoring combined with low error rates promises to constitute a major technological advancement and could establish SNPs as a standard marker for future wildlife monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adogs 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahairs 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonitoring 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aurine 3awildlife 3awolves 3aEurope1 avonHoldt, Bridgett1 aCocchiararo, Berardino1 aHarms, Verena1 aBayerl, Helmut1 aKühn, Ralph1 aFörster, Daniel W.1 aFickel, Jörns,1 aRoos, Christian1 aNowak, Carsten0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2015 Mar., v. 15, no. 2 p.295-305dBlackwell Pub.x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.123073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245017800171300001400349520200400363592002802367650001902395650001802414650003002432650001802462650001102480650001502491650001702506650001602523653004802539653001502587653003102602653002002633653004602653700001702699700001702716700001602733700001402749700001402763700001602777773011402793856008702907852000902994655001203003IND60592684220221116214337.0181207e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059268422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yiqiang10aLow-grade heat utilization by supercritical carbon dioxide Rankine cycle: Analysis on the performance of gas heater subjected to heat flux and convective boundary conditions  ap. 39-54.  aThe design and optimization of gas heater in supercritical carbon dioxide Rankine cycles faces some challenges, among which an urgent one is the effect of thermal boundary condition on the performance of gas heater. This work focused on performance comparison and effects of major operating parameters under two most common thermal boundary conditions regarding to low-grade heat sources, by employing a modified Shear-Stress Transport model where a variable turbulent Prandtl formulation was incorporated. Results show that in the pseudo-critical region thermal boundary condition obviously affected the performance of supercritical carbon dioxide gas heater. Compared with the uniform heat flux condition, at convective boundary condition impairment occurred in both the local enhancement at high mass flux and local deterioration at low mass flux, due to the self-regulation in local heat input. A nearly uniform thermal field under convective boundary condition was achieved by increasing the mass flux of heat source fluid, while increasing the inlet temperature of source fluid was ineffective to that end. Opposite to constant-property fluid heater, flow arrangement dramatically affected axial profiles of local heat transfer coefficient while had a much weaker effect on local heat flux in supercritical gas heater. Temperature distribution of supercritical carbon dioxide along the heater was insensitive to the flow arrangement. Further studies reveal that thermal boundary effect was closely related to the buoyancy effect. Thermal boundary condition has a minimal effect on heat transfer of supercritical carbon dioxide when buoyancy effect is negligible. Under heavy influence of buoyancy, thermal boundary effect was obvious in the form of much weaker local deterioration under convective boundary. Finally, the Jackson Nusselt correlation was found applicable to the prediction of overall heat transfer rate under convective boundary condition, with relative deviations within ±15%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aprediction 3ashear stress 3atemperature 0aSupercritical carbon dioxide Rankine cycles 0aGas heater 0aThermal boundary condition 0aBuoyancy effect 0aSelf-regulation under convective boundary1 aYao, Yecheng1 aLi, Zhouhang1 aTang, Guoli1 aWu, Yuxin1 aWang, Hua1 aLü, Junfu,0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 162 p.39-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01867naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245010200202300001400304500002000318520082300338592002801161596003201189650001101221650002201232650001601254650001701270650001101287650001201298773015501310856007901465852000901544655001201553IND60681310920221118062756.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068131092DNAL7 a10.1111/1467-8489.123382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dandan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3443-994614aThe evolution of the wage gap between rural migrants and the urban labour force in Chinese cities  ap. 55-81.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn increasing earning gap between rural migrants and urban residents has recently aroused public concern about rising urban poverty asscociated with migration of rural people into Chinese cities. To address the issue, this paper explores the possibility of wage assimilation for rural migrants towards their urban counterparts and its determinants between 1999 and 2009, by applying an economic assimilation model to analyse a repeated cross‐sectional data for seven Chinese cites at the individual level. The results show that rural migrants' earnings do not assimilate to their urban counterparts, although the situation improves gradually over time. This implies that institutional and policy barriers impede the assimilation process of rural migrants, which supports the call for further labour market reforms.  aPublisher supplied data  cPoverty and Economic Policy 3acities 3aissues and policy 3alabor force 3alabor market 3amodels 3apoverty0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2020 Jan., v. 64, no. 1 p.55-81dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl55734x1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.123383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245007100207520164400278592002801922650001001950650001701960650001401977650002501991650001402016650001402030650001102044650002702055650001902082650002402101650002402125653001002149653001802159653003802177653002702215700006102242700002002303773012102323856008302444852000902527655001202536IND60748299420221118035339.0211029e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074829942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1037492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizobe, Fumiaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3998-137110aRisk Factors for Jockey Falls in Japanese Thoroughbred Flat Racing  aJockey safety is of paramount importance from welfare perspective and public perception. This retrospective case-control study aims to identify risk factors associated with jockey falls (JF) in flat races of Japan Racing Association (JRA). JF in 715,210 race starts by 74,328 horses at 10 racecourses from 2003 to 2017 were reviewed. Data were extracted from a database maintained by JRA and from official accident reports issued by race stewards. Seventeen possible risk factors were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, to identify those significantly associated with JF. A total of 992 JF incidents were recorded, with an incidence rate of 1.39 falls per 1,000 starts (95% CI: 1.30–1.48). 6 risk factors were significantly associated with JF. Odds increased with horses that sustained catastrophic musculoskeletal injury (CMI) (OR: 203; CI: 169–241; P < 0.001). Increased odds were also associated with dirt track surfaces (OR: 1.99; CI: 1.74–2.29; P < 0.001), apprentice jockeys (OR: 1.43; CI: 1.21–1.68; P < 0.001), smaller track sizes (OR: 1.41; CI: 1.24–1.61; P < 0.001), larger fields (OR: 1.25; CI: 1.07–1.47; P = 0.005), and longer race distances (OR per 200 m: 1.05; CI: 1.01–1.09; P = 0.02). Since CMI was identified as a major contributing factor for JF, measures to minimize CMI may lead to improvement of jockey safety. The increased odds associated with apprentice jockeys may indicate the importance of jockey education and training. For jockey safety, proper staffing of medical professionals especially for races on dirt, smaller track, larger fields, and longer distances is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aThoroughbred 3aaccidents 3acase-control studies 3adatabases 3aeducation 3ahorses 3amusculoskeletal system 3apublic opinion 3aregression analysis 3aveterinary medicine 0aHorse 0aJockey safety 0aMultivariable logistic regression 0aMusculoskeletal injury1 aTakahashi, Yūji,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2139-61421 aKusano, Kanichi0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 Nov., v. 106 p.103749-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1037493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01424naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245009900152300001800251520046700269592002800736650002200764650002600786650001700812700001900829700001900848700001800867700002200885773013100907856007501038852000901113655001201122IND60538850020221118024617.0160815e20130522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053885002DNAL7 a10.1021/ja402727d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Gang10aSuperprotonic Conductivity in a Highly Oriented Crystalline Metal–Organic Framework Nanofilm  ap. 7438-7441.  aThe electrical properties of a highly oriented crystalline MOF nanofilm were studied.

The Operators' Views  ap. 53-67.  aPrevious research studying university–industry relationships suggests the existence of a traditional approach to cooperation and reciprocal support between these two entities. At the other end, little, if any, research has been conducted exploring relationships between universities or institutions with teaching hospitality management and the hospitality industry, particularly small hospitality enterprises. Fundamentally, there is a distinct lack of knowledge pertaining to industry attitudes and perceptions of these hospitality management programs, their students, and the cooperative services they might provide in assisting small hospitality enterprises in their day-to-day operations. The present study seeks to gain insights on these issues by studying small hospitality operators' views. Data were collected among 21 small hospitality enterprises located in different southern U.S. states via face-to-face and telephone interviews. While fewer than half of the respondents saw specific ways of engaging universities, for instance, working on (student work) internships or helping students gain working experience, the general tone among respondents suggests lack of awareness and knowledge of the potential ways institutions could assist operations. While the expectation might be one of symbiosis, the findings point to a clearly dysfunctional relationship between small hospitality enterprises and the university hospitality programs that exist to serve their need.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abusiness enterprises 3ahospitality industry 3ainterviews 3astudents 3asymbiosis 3auniversities 3aUnited States 0auniversity–industry relationships 0asmall hospitality enterprises 0aassistance 0aoperators' views1 aO'Neill, Martin A.0 tJournal of foodservice business research.g2011 Feb. 16, v. 14, no. 1 p.53-67dTaylor & Francis Groupx1537-80397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15378020.2011.548224  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009100160300001800251520131200269592002801581650001901609650002101628650002201649650002001671650001501691650000901706650001501715650001001730650001901740650001801759650001601777650001101793650002101804650001501825650003001840650002701870650001401897650001301911650001601924700002001940700001701960700002001977700002501997700002002022773012302042856007502165852000902240655001202249IND60534855520221118161655.0160803e20130507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053485552DNAL7 a10.1021/es305265x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKupryianchyk, D.10aIn situ Treatment with Activated Carbon Reduces Bioaccumulation in Aquatic Food Chains  ap. 4563-4571.  aIn situ activated carbon (AC) amendment is a new direction in contaminated sediment management, yet its effectiveness and safety have never been tested on the level of entire food chains including fish. Here we tested the effects of three different AC treatments on hydrophobic organic chemical (HOC) concentrations in pore water, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, and fish (Leuciscus idus melanotus). AC treatments were mixing with powdered AC (PAC), mixing with granular AC (GAC), and addition–removal of GAC (sediment stripping). The AC treatments resulted in a significant decrease in HOC concentrations in pore water, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, macrophytes, and fish. In 6 months, PAC treatment caused a reduction of accumulation of polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) in fish by a factor of 20, bringing pollutant levels below toxic thresholds. All AC treatments supported growth of fish, but growth was inhibited in the PAC treatment, which was likely explained by reduced nutrient concentrations, resulting in lower zooplankton (i.e., food) densities for the fish. PAC treatment may be advised for sites where immediate ecosystem protection is required. GAC treatment may be equally effective in the longer term and may be adequate for vulnerable ecosystems where longer-term protection suffices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeuciscus idus 3aactivated carbon 3abenthic organisms 3abioaccumulation 3aecosystems 3afish 3afood chain 3afoods 3ahydrophobicity 3ainvertebrates 3amacrophytes 3amixing 3anutrient content 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atoxicity 3azooplankton1 aRakowska, M.

The method is demon strated by its application to a series of samples of fibers that have been swollen to varying degrees by immersion in different solvents and transferred by solvent exchange to ben zene. The extent of reaction is related to the swelling power of the immersion liquid and to the assumed microfibrillar structure of the fiber wall. About 14% of the hydroxyl groups are found to be accessible in water swollen cotton fibers while 0.9% are accessible in the same fibers dried from water. The measurement of accessibility of cellulose to a reagent of moderate molecular size and under conditions which do not affect the sample accessibility offers advantages over alternative methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acellulose 3afabrics 3alint cotton 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3asolvents 3aswelling (materials) 3atextile fibers1 aRobertson, A.A.0 tTextile research journal.g1967 May, v. 37, no. 5 p.400-408dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517567037005103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245019500170300001600365520155800381592002801939650001501967650002401982650002502006650002102031650001402052650004302066650001602109650001102125650002302136650001302159650001502172650001402187650002402201650001702225650001102242700002602253700002402279700001802303700002302321700001902344700002102363700003302384773010602417856008102523852000902604655001202613IND60441784920221121033946.0151027e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044178492DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-015-9474-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlessington, Tyann14aThe Use of Low-Dose Electron-Beam Irradiation and Storage Conditions for Sprout Control and their Effects on Xanthophylls, Antioxidant Capacity, and Phenolics in the Potato Cultivar Atlantic  ap. 609-618.  aLow-dose electron-beam (e-beam) irradiation and storage conditions were evaluated for effectiveness in sprout control and their influence on health-promoting compounds in the potato cultivar Atlantic. Tubers were subjected to zero and 200 Gy and stored at either 4 °C or ambient temperature for 0, 10, 20, 75, and 110 days before evaluation. Xanthophyll content (Xan), antioxidant capacity (AOC), and phenolic content (PC) were quantified by spectrophotometric absorbance; xanthophyll and phenolic compounds were quantified with HPLC-DAD analysis. Tubers held at ambient conditions during storage lost weight and were visibly dehydrated. Tubers exposed to irradiation did not sprout; non-irradiated tubers sprouted, regardless of storage temperature. The exterior layer of tubers had greater total Xan, AOC, and PC than the interior layer, regardless of treatment. Storage time was the most influential factor, affecting Xan, AOC, and PC content. AOC, PC, and chlorogenic acid content increased within the first 10 days of storage, then declined with extended storage. Initially, the AOC and PC increased in irradiated tubers when compared to non-irradiated samples; however, little to no differences were observed once tubers were held in storage. Some exterior layer samples experienced an increase in Xan and PC during the later stages of storage and was believed to be associated with a concentration effect due to dehydration. E-beam irradiation inhibited sprouting during storage and prominent potato health promoting compounds were retained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidant activity 3achlorogenic acid 3acultivars 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airradiation 3alutein 3aphenolic compounds 3apotatoes 3ashelf life 3asprouting 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atubers1 aScheuring, Douglas C.1 aNzaramba, M.

Ten animals (nine donkeys and one horse) suffered from traumatized infected or non-infected wounds were used in this study. The visible signs of wound infection were evaluated in six cases, while the other four cases were admitted with fresh recent wounds. Animals were topically treated once a day in and day out and monitored for three weeks. It was observed that, the macroscopic wound contraction percents in animals treated with green Zinc oxide Nanoparticles gel in 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks were 45%, 76%, and 93.6% respectively. While, those which treated with chemical Zinc oxide Nanoparticles gel were 40.4%, 67.2%, and 90.6% respectively. The study revealed that, green Zinc oxide Nanoparticles gel accelerated the wound healing and cleared the wound infection faster when compared to chemical Zinc oxide Nanoparticles gel. It was concluded that, topical green Zinc oxide Nanoparticles gel can significantly accelerate the process of wound healing and clear the wound infections in wounded equine from clinical field cases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agels 3ahorses 3azinc oxide 0agreen zno-nps 0agel 0awound healing 0alawsonia inermis extract 0aclinical efficacy 0aequine1 aAbdel-Hady, Abdel-Nasser A.A.1 aEbnalwaled, Khaled1 aMorad, Samy A.F.1 aSoliman, Ahmed A.0 tSVU- International Journal of Veterinary Sciences.g2019 Mar., v. 3, no. 1 p.66-79dSouth Valley UniversitywJournal:27888x2535-18777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21608/svu.2020.21254.10403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006300172300001600235520187700251592002802128650002702156650002702183650001402210650003002224650001302254650001102267650001202278650002002290650001502310650001402325650001702339653002502356653001902381653001602400653001902416653001402435773015802449856008602607852000902693655001202702IND60111878720221120074402.0190214e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011187872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManser, Marta B.10aSemantic communication in vervet monkeys and other animals  ap. 491-496.  aThe research field of semantic communication in animals was initiated by the study on alarm calls of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus (then known as Cercopithecus aethiops) by Seyfarth, Cheney and Marler (Animal Behaviour, 1980, 28, 1070–1094). Based on observations of alarm call production and playback experiments in the natural habitat of the monkeys, Seyfarth, Cheney and Marler provided evidence that the alarm calls designated predators as external referents and conveyed sufficient information to listeners to make distinct adaptive responses in the absence of the stimulus. Their interpretation that ‘these calls show semantic properties, potentially based on the formation of internal perceptual concepts’ contrasted with the existing consensus of the time, which saw animal signals as ‘affective’, providing information only about the internal motivational state of the signaller and/or the signaller's likely behaviour. This study, particularly its semantic approach, was hugely influential in revitalizing the discussion of what animal calls ‘mean’, specifically how they are interpreted in the minds of the animals, and ultimately acted as the impetus for the construction of the ‘functionally referential’ framework in animal communication. Although this semantic approach has been criticized in terms of anthropomorphizing animal communication, understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms is a crucial component of deconstructing animal communication systems and hence we can greatly profit from such a research trajectory. Applying linguistic concepts to animal vocal communication has opened up an enormous research field regarding the continuity between animal vocalizations and human language, integrating different disciplines including animal behaviour, comparative psychology, neurobiology, linguistics and philosophy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercopithecus aethiops 3aantipredatory behavior 3acognition 3acommunications technology 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3amonkeys 3aneurophysiology 3aphilosophy 3apredators 3avocalization 0aanimal communication 0ahuman language 0alinguistics 0arepresentation 0asemantics0 tAnimal behaviour.g2013 Sept., v. 86, no. 3 p.491-496dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245013100159300001600290520113100306592002801437650003701465650002701502650002301529650001601552650001401568650002301582650001001605650002001615650001301635650001401648650003201662650002601694650001901720650002701739650001901766650001201785650001001797650001001807653002701817653001801844653001901862653003401881653002201915700001301937700001101950700001301961700001401974700001401988700001502002773010802017856008002125852000902205655001202214IND60478531220221119025917.0160112e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047853122DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.43.2015.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, X.L.10aCytogenetic and molecular identification of a new wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium addition line with resistance to powdery mildew  ap. 353-363.  aThinopyrum intermedium , which has many useful traits, is valuable for wheat breeding. A new wheat- Thinopyrum addition line, SN100109, was developed from the progeny of common wheat cultivar Yannong 15 and Th. intermedium . It was resistant to most races of Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt), which caused powdery mildew in wheat, and its reactions were different from the reactions of gene Pm40 and Pm43 . Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and molecular marker analysis were used to identify the genomic composition of SN100109. GISH results showed that SN100109 was a wheat- Th. intermedium disomic addition line containing one pair of J chromosomes, and the resistance gene was located on the alien additional chromosomes of SN100109. And four molecular markers BE425942 , BF482714 , Xgdm93 and BV679214 which were assigned to homologous group 2, were specific molecular markers of the additional chromosomes. All the results indicated that SN100109 contained one pair of 2J chromosomes. SN100109 can be used as a novel germplasm source for introducing powdery mildew resistance genes to wheat in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3aThinopyrum intermedium 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3agermplasm 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ain situ hybridization 3aplant breeding 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apowdery mildew 3aprogeny 3araces 3awheat 0aThinopyrum intermedium 0aaddition line 0apowdery mildew 0agenomic in situ hybridization 0amolecular markers1 aLi, X.F.1 aHe, F.1 aHu, L.Q.1 aBao, Y.G.1 aGao, J.R.1 aWang, H.G.0 tCereal research communications.g2015 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.353-363dAkadémiai Kiadóx1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.43.2015.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100003100156245007600187300001800263520132200281592002801603650002001631650001501651650002101666650003101687650002201718650002301740650001801763650001501781650001301796650002001809700003201829700004001861700003801901700003201939773013201971856004002103852000902143655001202152IND4468840920221119182247.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446884092DNAL7 a229269242pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.58602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado‐García, Mariana10aHalophilic hydrolases as a new tool for the biotechnological industries  ap. 2575-2580.  aHalophilic micro‐organisms are able to survive in high salt concentrations because they have developed diverse biochemical, structural and physiological modifications, allowing the catalytic synthesis of proteins with interesting physicochemical and structural properties. The main characteristic of halophilic enzymes that allows them to be considered as a novel alternative for use in the biotechnological industries is their polyextremophilicity, i.e. they have the capacity to be thermostable, tolerate a wide range of pH, withstand denaturation and tolerate high salt concentrations. However, there have been relatively few studies on halophilic enzymes, with some being based on their isolation and others on their characterisation. These enzymes are scarcely researched because attention has been focused on other extremophile micro‐organisms. Only a few industrial applications of halophilic enzymes, principally in the fermented food, textile, pharmaceutical and leather industries, have been reported. However, it is important to investigate applications of these enzymes in more biotechnological processes at both the chemical and the molecular level. This review discusses the modifications of these enzymes, their industrial applications and research perspectives in different biotechnological areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermented foods 3ahydrolases 3aleather industry 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprotein synthesis 3asalt concentration 2aBiotechnology 2aHydrolases 2aIndustry 2aSalt Tolerance.1 aValdivia‐Urdiales, Blanca1 aAguilar‐González, Cristóbal Noe1 aContreras‐Esquivel, Juan Carlos1 aRodríguez‐Herrera, Raúl0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 Oct., v. 92, no. 13 p.2575-2580dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5860  aDNAL 7aarticle03964naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013400178500001900312520221500331592002802546650003002574650002502604650002702629650001502656650001802671650002202689650002102711650002802732650002302760650001202783650001802795650002202813650003102835650001502866650001302881650001502894650001402909653002302923653002602946653001902972700002702991700003903018700001703057700001903074700002703093700002203120700002003142700001803162700002003180773010303200856008603303852000903389655001203398IND60719387120221120154325.0210108e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071938712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.1056882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Marín, Paula10aProteomic analysis and biochemical alterations in marine mussel gills after exposure to the organophosphate flame retardant TDCPP  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are (re-)emergent environmental pollutants increasingly being used because of the restriction of other flame retardants. The chlorinated OPFR, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) is among those of highest environmental concern, but its potential effects in the marine environment have rarely been investigated. We exposed a widely used sentinel marine mussel species, Mytilus galloprovincialis, to 10 μg L⁻¹ of TDCPP during 28 days and studied: (i) the kinetics of bioaccumulation and elimination of the compound, (ii) the effect on two molecular biomarkers, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, and (iii) proteomic alterations in the gills, following an isobaric labeling quantitative shotgun proteomic approach, at two exposure times (7 and 28 days). Uptake and elimination of TDCPP by mussels were very fast, and the bioconcentration factor of this compound in mussels was 147 L kgww⁻¹, confirming that this compound is not very bioaccumulative, as predicted by its chemical properties. GST activity was not affected by TDCPP exposure, but AChE activity was inhibited by TDCPP at both 7 and 28 days of exposure. Proteomic analysis revealed subtle effects of TDCPP in mussel gills, since few proteins (less than 2 % of the analysed proteome) were significantly affected by TDCPP, and effect sizes were low. The most relevant effects detected were the up-regulation of epimerase family protein SDR39U1, an enzyme that could be involved in detoxification processes, at both exposure times, and the down-regulation of receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase N2-like (PTPRN2) after 7 days of exposure, which is involved in neurotransmitter secretion and might be related to the neurotoxicity described for this compound. Exposure time rather than TDCPP exposure was the most important driver of protein abundance changes, with 33 % of the proteome being affected by this factor, suggesting that stress caused by laboratory conditions could be an important confounding factor that needs to be controlled in similar ecotoxicology studies.

Micro-electrophoresis method by applying DC electric field, was utilized to different mixtures containing asphaltene to determine its electric charge. It was observed that in the case of using n-heptane and its mixture with toluene (heptol), the asphaltene particles were showed to be positively charged however for toluene itself, they expressed no tendency toward the electrodes.While it is expected that larger asphaltene aggregates carry higher electric charge, the results contradictorily showed that they are mainly governed by gravity rather than electro-static force and that “aggregation” reduces the charge density of asphaltene particles.Using a digital microscope equipped with image processing software, the average net electric charge of each asphaltene molecule was calculated to be 5.62×10-28Cmolecule or3.51×10-9ēmolecule. As this value is much less than 1ē, it can be concluded that asphaltene molecules do not possess intrinsic electric charge and the apparent charge is mostly induced through the medium, generated by rearrangement of asphaltene molecular structure. Thereafter, based on calculated charge and considering governing forces (gravity, friction and electric force), the electrophoretic mobility of asphaltene particles in dynamic mode was mathematically modeled and verified under different electric field intensities. The results illustrated satisfactory agreement with the obtained experimental data. Knowing the asphaltene electric charge, the magnitude of streaming potential can be calculated, subsequently the model will be able to predict the velocity ranges at which colloidal asphaltene flocculation is possibly avoided.Finally the effect of flow rate, electric potential and solvent composition was investigated on electrophoretic mobility. It was found that, the higher the fluid flow rate, the greater is the mobility. However, increasing the electric potential resulted in electrophoretic mobility reduction of asphaltene particles. Moreover, critical increase of electrophoretic mobility was observed for n-heptane contents of more than 50 wt.% in heptol, which refers to the onset point of asphaltene nano-aggregates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aimage analysis 3aelectrophoresis 3acolloids 3amodels 3aheptane 3afriction 3agravity 3asolvents 3acomputer software 3atoluene 3aasphaltenes 3achemical structure 3aflocculation 0aElectrophoretic mobility 0aAsphaltene aggregation 0aAsphaltene charge density 0aelectric potential 0aDC electric field1 aAbolghasemi, Erfan1 aHosseini, Ali1 aAyatollahi, Shahab1 aDehghani, Farzaneh0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 541 p.68-77dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245020000153506002800353520154100381592002801922506003701950650002401987650001702011650001802028650001302046650001202059650001302071650000902084650002002093650001202113650001402125650001102139650001402150650001002164650001502174651001402189653002802203653002902231653002102260653002402281700001202305700001702317700002102334773012902355856007502484852000902559655001202568IND60764596920221215143324.0170720e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076459692DNAL7 a10.5994/jei.2.1.612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarindah10aParasitoid larva-pupa Tetrastichus howardi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) pada Pluttella xylostella L.

The parasitoid was <em>Teratichus howardi</em> (Hyminoptera: Eulophidae). The percentage of parasitism was dependent of the altitude of cabbage plantation and developmental stage of crop. The percent of parasitism could reach 82% when parasitized larvae sampled in cabbage plant and the crop stage. Parasitism was also higher at the medium lowland rather than it was that the upland. <em>T. howardi</em> is a gregrarious larval-pupa endoparasitoid. The life cycle of <em>T. howardi</em> was 14-16 days. The longevity of male and female was influenced by the availability of hosts or the change of mating. The longevity of mated female which was offered some host is 14-21 days, but the longevity of mated female without hosts was 38-56 days. The mated male parasitoid lived from 1 to 4 days, but they lived 12-16 days when they were not mated. One female could lay some cluster of egg varied from 35-60 eggs cluster or from 142 to 235 eggs during the lifespan. One eggs cluster consist of ±4 eggs. The parasitoid laid one or two clusters of egg per host. Parasitoid laid eggs soon after mating at day one from eclosion until day 19<sup>th</sup>. Four to 28 Parasitoids could emerge from one host.

Inhibition of the fibril growth is considered a promising therapeutic approach. However, the majority of the existing inhibitors are either unspecific or work at high micromolar concentrations. Earlier, we created a protein-based inhibitor of α-synuclein fibril growth that consists of an α-synuclein moiety and a bulky group. It specifically binds to α-synuclein fibril ends and blocks them by creating steric hindrance to subsequent monomer binding.In this work, we prepared a series of inhibitors with modified α-synuclein moieties and bulky groups of different structure, size, and position. We studied the structure-activity relationship of these inhibitors and optimized them by improving affinity to the fibril end and blocking efficiency. The inhibitors were tested in a Thioflavin T-based kinetic assay, and their affinity to the fibril ends was measured by fluorescence anisotropy. We showed that decrease in electrostatic repulsion between inhibitor and fibril end improved the inhibitor efficiency. Inhibitors with rigid β-sheet-rich bulky groups bind to fibril ends stronger than monomeric α-synuclein and therefore have a high inhibition efficiency, showing a linear correlation between Kd and IC₅₀.We determined which properties of inhibitor molecules are the most important for good performance and found that the inhibitor affinity to the fibril end is a key feature that determines its inhibition efficiency. Applying this knowledge, we improved existing inhibitors and reached IC₅₀ value of 300 nM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aamyloid 3aanisotropy 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amoieties 3aneurons 3astructure-activity relationships 3atherapeutics 0aInhibitor 0aAggregation 0aKinetics 0aDissociation constant 0aaa 0aAS 0aIC50 0aKd 0aPD1 aPriss, Anastasiia1 aYushchenko, Dmytro A.1 aShvadchak, Volodymyr V.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Feb. 14, v. 432, no. 4 p.967-977dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006500149245010400214520169800318592002802016650002002044650001202064650001502076650001302091650001602104650000702120650001702127650001502144650001402159650001702173650001302190650001802203650002202221651001102243651001302254653002102267653002802288653001402316653001802330653002002348700006102368700006102429700006502490700006402555700006202619700006402681700006302745700006202808700005902870700006502929700005902994773009203053856008403145852000903229655001203238IND60745112220221119005127.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074511222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2021.1259042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuchi-Melo, Lilian S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3926-247610aBrazilian vs. Paraguayan streams: Differences in water quality in a cross-border subtropical region  aMonitoring programs are among the first steps to develop robust management strategies, especially in international transboundary waters. Understanding how water quality parameters are impacted by different types of land use promotes a baseline for stakeholders to define the best governance for the management of water resources. Seeking to provide this type of information, we sampled 24 streams – 12 in Brazil and 12 in Paraguay – in February, April, July, September, and November 2019. We determined water quality parameters, grouped into three categories: morphometric, physical and chemical, and nutrients. We explored differences in water quality parameters between countries, and over a one-year sampling. We also tested whether Brazilian and Paraguayan streams are impacted by agriculture, urbanization, and forest cover. Finally, we performed a partial RDA to test the influence of land use on water quality parameters and controlled spatial autocorrelation by including spatial variables (dbMEM) as a condition. Most of the water quality parameters showed significant differences between countries; only turbidity, and pH, presented significant differences between countries and sampling periods, and only water temperature varied significantly along the year. We did not find evidence that different types of land use are causing physical and chemical variance in Brazilian and Paraguayan streams (R² = 0.06, p = 0.68). In conclusion, the results evidenced that the main differences in the water quality parameters occur between countries. Based on the results, transboundary governance can use these data to implement integrated water resources management cooperation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aforests 3agovernance 3aland use 3amorphometry 3apH 3astakeholders 3asubtropics 3aturbidity 3aurbanization 3avariance 3awater quality 3awater temperature 3aBrazil 3aParaguay 0aItaipu reservoir 0aEnvironmental variables 0aLandscape 0aTransboundary 0aLotic ecosystem1 ado Amaral, Bianca1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6543-11171 aTavares, Diego A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9198-11711 aBartozek, Elaine C.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6454-39581 ade Souza, Jussara E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6145-671X1 aPereira, Luiz H.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9435-63471 aAuricchio, Marina R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8210-94291 ada Silva, Marina X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1495-35881 aToyama, Natalie P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3999-93601 aNunes, Pablo H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1637-64461 aLambrecht, Richard W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0343-21941 aPeres, Cleto K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0217-35840 tLimnologica.g2021 Sept., v. 90 p.125904-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2021.1259043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05402naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007800167500001900245520366400264592002803928650001403956650001903970650001203989650001604001650001604017650001104033650001604044650002104060650001504081650001404096650002504110650002404135650002304159650001304182650001004195653002304205653000904228653002104237653002204258700002204280700002604302700002004328700002204348700002304370700001704393700002304410700002904433700002704462700002004489700002304509700001704532700001604549700002404565773010504589856008504694852000904779655001204788IND60727093920221119065400.0210401e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072709392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2021.1064032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Giehae10aPrenatal phthalate exposures and executive function in preschool children  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrenatal phthalate exposure has been linked with altered neurodevelopment, including externalizing behaviors and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the implicated metabolite, neurobehavioral endpoint, and child sex have not always been consistent across studies, possibly due to heterogeneity in neurodevelopmental instruments. The complex set of findings may be synthesized using executive function (EF), a construct of complex cognitive processes that facilitate ongoing goal-directed behaviors. Impaired EF can be presented with various phenotypes of poor neurodevelopment, differently across structured conditions, home/community, or preschool/school. We evaluated the relationship between prenatal phthalate exposure and comprehensive assessment of preschool EF.Our study comprised 262 children with clinically significant/subthreshold ADHD symptoms and 78 typically developing children who were born between 2003 and 2008 and participated in the Preschool ADHD Substudy, which is nested within a population-based prospective cohort study, the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort (MoBa). Twelve phthalate metabolites were measured from urine samples that their mothers had provided during pregnancy, at 17 weeks’ gestation. All children, at approximately 3.5-years, took part in a detailed clinical assessment that included parent-and teacher-rated inventories and administered tests. We used instruments that measured constructs related to EF, which include a parent-and teacher-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool (BRIEF-P) and three performance-based tests: A Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment (NEPSY), Stanford-Binet intelligence test V (SB5), and the cookie delay task (CDT). The standard deviation change in test score per interquartile range (IQR) increase in phthalate metabolite was estimated with multivariable linear regression. We applied weighting in all models to account for the oversampling of children with clinically significant or subthreshold symptoms of ADHD. Additionally, we assessed modification by child sex and potential co-pollutant confounding.Elevated exposure to mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) during pregnancy was associated with poorer EF, across all domains and instruments, in both sex. For example, an IQR increase in MBzP was associated with poorer working memory rated by parent (1.23 [95% CI: 0.20, 2.26]) and teacher (1.13 [0.14, 2.13]) using BRIEF-P, and administered tests such as SB5 (no-verbal: 0.19 [0.09, 0.28]; verbal: 0.13 [0.01, 0.25]). Adverse associations were also observed for mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) and mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), although results varied by instruments. EF domains reported by parents using BRIEF-P were most apparently implicated, with stronger associations among boys (e.g., MnBP and inhibition: 2.74 [1.77, 3.72]; MiBP and inhibition: 1.88 [0.84, 2.92]) than among girls (e.g., MnBP and inhibition: −0.63 [−2.08, 0.83], interaction p-value: 0.04; MiBP and inhibition: −0.15 [−1.04, 0.74], interaction p-value: 0.3). Differences by sex, however, were not found for the teacher-rated BRIEF-P or administered tests including NEPSY, SB5, and CDT.Elevated mid-pregnancy MBzP, MiBP, and MnBP were associated with more adverse profiles of EF among preschool-aged children across a range of instruments and raters, with some associations found only among boys. Given our findings and accumulating evidence of the prenatal period as a critical window for phthalate exposure, there is a timely need to expand the current phthalate regulations focused on baby products to include pregnancy exposures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3acohort studies 3acookies 3aenvironment 3ainventories 3amemory 3ametabolites 3aneurodevelopment 3aphthalates 3apregnancy 3aprenatal development 3aregression analysis 3astandard deviation 3ateachers 3aurine 0aExecutive function 0aMoBa 0aButyl-phthalates 0aBenzyl-phthalates1 aVillanger, Gro D.1 aDrover, Samantha S.M.1 aSakhi, Amrit K.1 aThomsen, Cathrine1 aNethery, Rachel C.1 aZeiner, Pål1 aKnudsen, Gun Peggy1 aReichborn-Kjennerud, Ted1 aØvergaard, Kristin R.1 aHerring, Amy H.1 aSkogan, Annette H.1 aBiele, Guido1 aAase, Heidi1 aEngel, Stephanie M.0 tEnvironment international.g2021 Apr., v. 149 p.106403-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1064033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008000173300001600253520172500269592002801994650002502022650002002047650001202067650001102079650002202090650001202112650002302124650001202147650002602159650001502185650001702200653002502217653001602242653003502258653001702293653002502310653001502335653002202350653002602372700001802398700002002416700002302436773015802459856008602617852000902703655001202712IND60111879020221122061156.0190214e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011187902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttisano, Alfredo10aOosorption and migratory strategy of the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus  ap. 651-657.  aMigration evolves as a response to seasonally unfavourable environments but plasticity in reproductive physiology is another avenue by which insects can respond to resource-poor conditions. We investigated the relationship between individual variation in migratory propensity and the level of response to poor conditions modulated by the female reproductive physiology. We tested the hypothesis that, compared to migrants, residential behaviour is associated with a higher degree of phenotypic plasticity in oosorption, an adaptive physiological mechanism that allows females to recoup resources from undeveloped oocytes. Reallocation from reproduction to survival would allow females to skip migration and to cope with unfavourable environments. If this plasticity is evolved, we further predicted it would vary between as well as within populations. We examined variation associated with migratory behaviour in females from four populations of the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, using a behavioural assay to categorize females as either migrant or resident and observing the differences in oosorption between these groups. As expected, food availability, source population and wing length influenced the propensity for migratory flight, and food availability influenced levels of oosorption. We also found support for our key prediction that resident females are characterized by higher levels of ovarian oosorption than migrant females. Our study provides support for a physiological difference between migrant and resident females and suggests the presence of both physiological and behavioural tactics that interact with the potential for migration to provide adaptation to seasonally challenging environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncopeltus fasciatus 3aanimal behavior 3afemales 3aflight 3afood availability 3ainsects 3amigratory behavior 3aoocytes 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprediction 3areproduction 0aconditional strategy 0aflight mill 0ainsect reproductive physiology 0amilkweed bug 0aOncopeltus fasciatus 0aoosorption 0apartial migration 0aphenotypic plasticity1 aTregenza, Tom1 aMoore, Allen J.1 aMoore, Patricia J.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2013 Sept., v. 86, no. 3 p.651-657dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245014000170300001600310520126700326592002801593650002301621650002201644650002501666650002501691650002201716650001901738650002201757650002301779650002301802650002201825650002601847650002201873650002801895650002801923650001001951650001601961650001701977650001601994651001102010653002502021653002102046653002202067653001102089700001702100700001402117700001902131700001602150700001602166773012802182856008102310852000902391655001202400IND60478531520221119025922.0200514e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047853152DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.43.2015.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShala-Mayrhofer, V.10aOccurrence of Fusarium head blight and mycotoxins as well as morphological identification of Fusarium species in winter wheat in Kosovo  ap. 438-448.  aWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important cereal crop in Kosovo and a major component of population food. Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat is an economically very significant disease. FHB leads to various losses in quality like reduced germination of seeds, reduced baking quality and reduced nutritional quality through mycotoxin contamination. In 2010 and 2011 the incidence and identity of the Fusarium spp. infecting wheat in Kosovo as well as mycotoxin contamination was investigated. The results of two years research work show that the incidence of FHB on winter wheat in 2010 was low (<6%). In the year 2011 the disease incidence was clearly higher (up to 31%). Based on morphological characters, F. graminearum was the most frequently Fusarium sp. identified on wheat kernels in the year 2010 (100%) and 2011 (98%). Less frequently isolated species included F. cerealis (<1%) and F. avenaceum (<1%). Wheat flour samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and found to be contaminated with a variety of mycotoxins, most importantly deoxynivalenol and zearalenone. This is the first report on the incidence as well as on the identification of Fusarium species isolated from naturally infected winter wheat in Kosovo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium avenaceum 3aFusarium cerealis 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aTriticum aestivum 3adeoxynivalenol 3adisease incidence 3adisease occurrence 3afood contamination 3afungal morphology 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobial contamination 3apathogen identification 3aseeds 3awheat flour 3awinter wheat 3azearalenone 3aKosovo 0aFusarium head blight 0aFusarium species 0aTriticum aestivum 0aKosovo1 aMarjakaj, R.1 aVarga, E.1 aBerthiller, F.1 aMusolli, A.1 aLemmens, M.0 tCereal research communications.g2015 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.438-448dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000058x1788-91707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.43.2015.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245010700206300001800313506007600331520090700407592002801314506003701342650002201379650002201401650002401423650001701447650002101464650001201485650001601497650000901513650002801522650001801550650001701568650001501585650001401600650001801614650002201632700002001654700003101674700002301705773009601728856008101824852000901905655001201914IND60441785220221207052847.0151027e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044178522DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-015-0294-52doi7 aPMC46241342pmcid7 a283244002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalihu, Aliyu10aAgricultural residues for cellulolytic enzyme production by Aspergillus niger: effects of pretreatment  ap. 1101-1106.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDifferent agricultural residues were considered in this study for their ability to support cellulolytic enzyme production by Aspergillus niger.

The reaction time has a great influence on the secondary structure of CuS, and the CuS nanosheet grown in situ on the carbonized cloth with lamellar structure possesses good dispersibility when the reaction time is 4h, which could provide more active sites to facilitate electrochemical reaction. Besides, due to the synergistic effect of pseudo capacitance of CuS and double layer capacitance of carbonized cloth, the CuS/carbonized cotton (CSCC-4) shows not only great specific capacitance (4176 mF cm⁻² at current density of 2 mA cm⁻²) but also outstanding cycle stability (15.1% loss of initial capacitance over 5000 cycles). Moreover, it is worth noted that the symmetrical flexible SC based on CSCC-4 electrodes accomplishes a great energy density, which reaches to 0.74 Wh cm⁻² at power density of 4.35 W cm⁻² and maintains 0.26 Wh cm⁻² at power density of 21.9 W cm⁻².  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acapacitance 3acotton 3adispersibility 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3ahot water treatment 3amicroparticles 3ananosheets 3asulfides 3asynergism 0aFlower-like CuS microsphere 0aCarbonized cloth 0aBinder-free electrode 0aOne-step hydrothermal method 0aFlexible supercapacitor1 aJin, Kaili1 aZhou, Man1 aFan, Zhuizhui1 aZhao, Hong1 aZhao, Yaping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7891-88291 aLi, Xiaoyan1 aCai, Zaisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5648-93300 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 575 p.75-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011800163300001600281520162100297592002801918650002201946650001301968650002401981650001902005650002302024650001202047650002002059650001802079650003102097650002802128650001002156650001602166651001002182651001002192653003102202653001402233653002202247653002202269653002502291773010802316856008002424852000902504655001202513IND60478531620221119025927.0160112e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047853162DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.43.2015.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, H.10aSpecific median flour particle size distribution of Japanese common wheats; comparison with Chinese common wheats  ap. 459-469.  aFlour particle size distribution is a major factor affecting the milling behavior in common wheats (Triticum aestivum L.). Also, a previous study has revealed a relationship between flour yield and median flour particle size of Japanese wheats. However, the genetic base of Japanese common wheat is narrow and will need to be broadened. Therefore, in order to help develop the genetic resource for higher flour yields in Japanese wheat breeding, the flour yield of one hundred and seventy Chinese common wheats were investigated in relation to the median flour particle size and the flour particle size distribution patterns as determined by laser diffraction. The results showed significant differences in the median flour particle size and distribution patterns of Chinese wheats and the Japanese wheats that had been analyzed in a previous study. In particular, 45% of Chinese wheats were categorized as hard wheats, but only 4% as soft wheats. In contrast, the previously analyzed Japanese wheat proportions were 20% and 25%, respectively. The results show that analysis of median flour particle size distribution by laser diffraction is a simple but effective tool for measuring and selecting the good flour milling quality in Chinese wheat genetic resources. In addition, the major differences between the Japanese and Chinese wheats highlighted in this study occurred despite the fact that it is well known that Chinese common wheats contributed to modern Japanese wheat varieties. The differences may be explained by either the founder effect or by a selective bottleneck in Japanese wheat genetic resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abreeding 3adivergent evolution 3afounder effect 3agenetic background 3amilling 3amilling quality 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aplant genetic resources 3awheat 3awheat flour 3aChina 3aJapan 0amedian flour particle size 0asoft type 0abreeding material 0abottleneck effect 0aChinese common wheat0 tCereal research communications.g2015 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.459-469dAkadémiai Kiadóx1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.43.2015.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011200168300001600280520078800296592002801084650001601112650001301128650001001141650002701151650002001178650001601198653002301214653002401237653000901261653002601270700001501296700001501311700001701326700001501343700001701358773010601375856008601481852000901567655001201576IND60630766820221119063106.0190213e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063076682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBykov, A.G.10aDilational surface elasticity of spread monolayers of pulmonary lipids in a broad range of surface pressure  ap. 137-144.  aA new approach to the analysis of nonlinear surface dilational rheological properties was developed with the aim to enlarge the accessible range of surface pressures. The dilational surface elasticity of spread monolayers of DPPC, cholesterol, DMEA and their mixtures was determined in the region of low surface tensions (less than 10 mN/m) corresponding to the state of pulmonary surfactants at the lung interface. The dilational surface elasticity of pure DPPC monolayer proved to be high (∼200 mN/m) up to the collapse.

In this study, we investigated the protective effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and betaine (BET) against ABM-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in rats. Forty rats were divided into five groups, receiving either oral saline solution (normal control), oral ABM at a dose of 2 mg/kg BW (1/5 LD50), CAPE (10 μmol/kg BW intraperitoneally) followed by ABM, or BET supplementation at a dose of 250 mg/kg BW followed by ABM administration, while group V rats received a combination of i.p. CAPE and oral BET in the same doses before receiving ABM. Biochemical analysis showed that ABM administration significantly (p < 0.05) increased serum levels of aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and cholesterol, as well as serum creatinine and urea. Compared to the control group, ABM-intoxicated rats had significantly (p < 0.05) higher tissue concentrations of nitric oxide and malondialdehyde, as well as lower tissue glutathione concentration, total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant enzymatic activity (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase). Histopathological examination of hepatic and renal tissues of ABM-intoxicated rats showed acute inflammatory and necrotic changes. Pretreatment with CAPE and/or BET reversed the biochemical and histopathological alterations of ABM on the liver and kidneys. Therefore, CAPE and BET (alone or in combination) could be promising protective agents against ABM-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Future studies should confirm our findings and evaluate the other molecular effects are involved in the combination chemoprotection of CAPE and BET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabamectin 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abetaine 3ablood serum 3acaffeic acid 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alethal dose 50 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3anephrotoxicity 3anitric oxide 3aprotective effect 3arats 3asodium chloride 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 3atransaminases 3aurea1 aAbdellatief, SuhairA.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 June, v. 25, no. 16 p.15909-15917dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1786-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245005600171300001600227520095900243592002801202650002201230650001901252650001001271650002401281650003101305650001101336650002001347650002501367650002601392650001901418650002801437650001301465650001001478651000901488653001901497653002001516653002001536700002001556700002001576700002001596700001501616773012801631856008101759852000901840655001201849IND60478531720221119025957.0200514e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047853172DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.43.2015.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhaffari Nejad, S.A.10aTolerance of some wheat varieties to boron toxicity  ap. 384-393.  aBoron (B) toxicity is an important problem in low rainfall and highly alkaline soils of central and southern part of Iran.

The experimental results show that the polyethers (with molecular weights of 8400, 12,600 and 14,600) are efficient surfactants for heavy oil emulsification and viscosity reduction. To illustrate the mechanisms, we carried out the study of interfacial properties by interfacial tension and dilational rheology measurements. The experimental results show that the resins and asphaltenes in heavy oil have strong interfacial activity. The adsorption of active components will form interfacial film with certain intensity, which may help to form stable W/O emulsion. On the other hand, the adsorption of polyethers will reduce interfacial tension and form sub-layer construction at higher concentration, which leads to the formation of elastic interfacial layer with a certain strength. For the mixed systems of active components with polyethers, the mixed interfacial layers show almost the same properties just as polyethers used alone, demonstrating that the interfacial layers will be occupied mainly by polyether molecules. The water-soluble polyether with suitable molecular structure will form strong interfacial film, which may be helpful for forming stable O/W emulsion and reducing viscosity of heavy oil obviously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aasphaltenes 3achemical structure 3acolloids 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3amolecular weight 3aoils 3aresins 3arheology 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3aviscosity 3awater solubility 0aHeavy oil components 0aPolyether 0aInterfacial dilational rheology 0aEmulsion 0aViscosity reducing1 aCao, Xu-long1 aGuo, Lan-Lei1 aGuo, Zhao-Yang1 aLiu, Miao1 aZhang, Lei1 aZhang, Lu1 aZhao, Sui0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 541 p.117-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.01.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014100169520120500310592002801515650002501543650002401568650000901592650001401601650001101615650002001626650001101646650002701657650001001684650002301694650001001717650001801727650002201745650001801767650001501785650001801800650003201818650001701850650002201867653001601889653001601905700001801921700001801939700002201957773011801979856008302097852000902180655001202189IND60678214920221122011241.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067821492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2019.1015512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinkovič, Lovro10aMilling fractions fatty acid composition of common (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) and tartary (Fagopyrum tataricum (L.)

Gaertn) buckwheat harvested in two consecutive years. Fatty acid composition for different milling fractions was determined as methyl esters using gas chromatography. Nine fatty acids were determined: lauric (12:0), myristic (14:0), palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (16:1), stearic (18:0), oleic (C18:1; n-9), linoleic (C18:2; n-6), α-linolenic (C18:3; n-3) and arachidic (20:0) acid. The highest relative content was determined for linoleic acid (from 35.54 to 47.57%), followed by oleic acid (from 20.96 to 40.76%) and palmitic acid (from 13.86 to 26.42%). The total fatty acid content was the highest in bran (up to 62.64 g/kg), followed by whole grains (up to 22.93 g/kg), light flour (up to 9.69 g/kg) and hulls (up to 5.87 g/kg). Saturated fatty acid content was the highest in the hulls and the lowest in the bran. Polyunsaturated fatty acid content was the highest in light flour. High positive correlations were found between saturated fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms or less.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aFagopyrum tataricum 3abran 3abuckwheat 3acarbon 3adodecanoic acid 3aesters 3afatty acid composition 3aflour 3agas chromatography 3ahulls 3alinoleic acid 3amilling fractions 3amyristic acid 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3astearic acid 3awhole grain foods 0aWhole grain 0aLight flour1 aKokalj, Doris1 aVidrih, Rajko1 aMeglič, Vladimir0 tJournal of stored products research.g2020 Jan., v. 85 p.101551-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2019.1015513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007700167300001400244520065100258592002800909650001400937650002600951650000800977650001300985650001700998650001701015650001701032650001701049650001601066650001401082650001001096650003001106650002001136653002201156653002501178653001801203700002101221700002101242700002101263700002701284700001401311700002201325773011801347856008301465852000901548655001201557IND60625990920221116163642.0190405e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062599092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2018.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNervo, Tiziana10aChronic Endometritis in Subfertile Mares With Presence of Chlamydial DNA  ap. 91-94.  aWhen endometritis becomes chronic in mares, infertility can follow. Among various causative agents, many bacteria are involved, and mono- or mixed-infections are common. In our study, 50 mares with a previous history of subfertility were subjected to clinical and ultrasonographic examination of the reproductive tract, and samples were collected for cytology, histology, bacteriology, and polymerase chain reaction for Chlamydia spp detection. The aim of this work was to highlight the presence of Chlamydia abortus in chronic endometritis of subfertile mares. Endometrial chronic lesions were detected in five of six Chlamydia-positive animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia 3aChlamydophila abortus 3aDNA 3abacteria 3abacteriology 3acell biology 3achlamydiosis 3aendometritis 3aendometrium 3ahistology 3amares 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aultrasonography 0aMare subfertility 0aChronic endometritis 0aChlamydia spp1 aNebbia, Patrizia1 aBertero, Alessia1 aRobino, Patrizia1 aStella, Maria Cristina1 aRota, Ada1 aAppino, Simonetta0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2019 Feb., v. 73 p.91-94dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2018.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245004900208300001800257506007600275520101000351592002801361506003701389650002401426650001801450650001901468650001901487650001301506650001301519650002201532650001601554700002301570700002401593700002701617700002501644700001901669700002201688700001801710700002001728700002101748700002301769700002601792773010001818856008601918852000902004655001202013IND60577297320221207125917.0170807e20150908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057729732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b018222doi7 aPMC49212422pmcid7 a263051512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, Nia C.10aDye Encapsulation in Polynorbornene Micelles  ap. 9707-9717.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe encapsulation efficiency of high-Tg polynorbornene micelles was probed with a hydrophobic dye 2,6-diiodoboron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY). Changes in the visible absorption spectra of aggregated versus monomeric dye molecules provided a probe for assessing encapsulation. Polynorbornene micelles are found to be capable of loading up to one BODIPY dye per ten polymers. As the hydrophilic block size increased in the polymeric amphiphiles, more of the dye was incorporated within the micelles. This result is consistent with the dye associating with the polymer backbone in the shell of the micelles. The encapsulation rate varied significantly with temperature, and a slight dependence on micellar morphology was also noted. Additionally, we report a 740 μs triplet lifetime for the encapsulated BODIPY dye. The lifetime is the longest ever recorded for a BODIPY triplet excited state at room temperature and is attributed to hindered triplet–triplet annihilation in the high-viscosity micellar shell.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aambient temperature 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3apolymers 3aspectral analysis 3asurfactants1 aDoyle, Samantha

However, causal factors underlying these loci were largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify potential causal methylation-mRNA regulation chains for RA. We identified differentially expressed mRNAs and methylations and conducted summary statistic data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis to detect potential causal mRNAs and methylations for RA. Then causal inference test (CIT) was performed to determine if the methylation-mRNA pairs formed causal chains. We identified 11,170 mRNAs and 24,065 methylations that were nominally associated with RA. Among them, 197 mRNAs and 104 methylations passed the SMR test. According to physical positions, we defined 16 cis methylation-mRNA pairs and inferred 5 chains containing 4 methylations and 4 genes (BACH2, MBP, MX1 and SYNGR1) to be methylation→mRNA→RA causal chains. The effect of SYNGR1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells on RA risk was found to be consistent in both the in-house and public data. The identified methylations located in CpG Islands that overlap promoters in the 5′ region of the genes. The promoter regions showed long-range interactions with other enhancers and promoters, suggesting a regulatory potential of these methylations. Therefore, the present study provided a new integrative analysis strategy and highlighted potential causal methylation-mRNA chains for RA. Taking the evidences together, SYNGR1 promoter methylations most probably affect mRNA expressions and then affect RA risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunology 3arheumatoid arthritis 3arisk 0aMethylation 0aGene expression 0aMendelian randomization 0aCausal inference1 aZhang, Yong-Hong1 aLei, Shu-Feng0 tMolecular immunology.g2021 Mar., v. 131 p.89-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245006700172300002200239520113500261592002801396650004301424650003101467650001101498650001901509650001601528650001601544650001401560650001401574650002101588650001701609650001601626650001501642650001701657650002101674650000901695653002101704653002301725653001501748653003001763653001201793653002701805653001901832653001801851653001601869700002101885700002801906700001901934700001701953700002001970700001501990700001402005700001902019700001602038700001502054700002002069700002902089700003202118700002102150700002102171700002002192700002202212700001902234700001802253700002202271700002302293700002702316700002102343700002102364700001902385773010302404856008302507852000902590655001202599IND60745112620221118174157.0211009e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074511262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenrick, Bethany M.10aBifidobacteria-mediated immune system imprinting early in life  ap. 3884-3898.e11.  aImmune-microbe interactions early in life influence the risk of allergies, asthma, and other inflammatory diseases. Breastfeeding guides healthier immune-microbe relationships by providing nutrients to specialized microbes that in turn benefit the host’s immune system. Such bacteria have co-evolved with humans but are now increasingly rare in modern societies. Here we show that a lack of bifidobacteria, and in particular depletion of genes required for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) utilization from the metagenome, is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation early in life. In breastfed infants given Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001, which expresses all HMO-utilization genes, intestinal T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 cytokines were silenced and interferon β (IFNβ) was induced. Fecal water from EVC001-supplemented infants contains abundant indolelactate and B. infantis-derived indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) upregulated immunoregulatory galectin-1 in Th2 and Th17 cells during polarization, providing a functional link between beneficial microbes and immunoregulation during the first months of life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aasthma 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3acoevolution 3acytokines 3agalectins 3aimmunomodulation 3ainflammation 3ainterferons 3aintestines 3ametagenomics 3aoligosaccharides 3arisk 0ahuman immunology 0asystems immunology 0amicrobiome 0aimmune system development 0aneonate 0anewborn immune systems 0amass cytometry 0atranscriptome 0aneonatology1 aRodriguez, Lucie1 aLakshmikanth, Tadepally1 aPou, Christian1 aHenckel, Ewa1 aArzoomand, Aron1 aOlin, Axel1 aWang, Jun1 aMikes, Jaromir1 aTan, Ziyang1 aChen, Yang1 aEhrlich, Amy M.1 aBernhardsson, Anna Karin1 aMugabo, Constantin Habimana1 aAmbrosiani, Ylva1 aGustafsson, Anna1 aChew, Stephanie1 aBrown, Heather K.1 aPrambs, Johann1 aBohlin, Kajsa1 aMitchell, Ryan D.1 aUnderwood, Mark A.1 aSmilowitz, Jennifer T.1 aGerman, J.

Sampling from the heated oils (at 170 °C) was performed each 3 h during a 36-h period. Changes in the ATR–FTIR spectra of the oil samples in the range of 4000–550 cm⁻¹ were followed as a function of heating time. MCR-ALS was utilized to resolve the concentration and spectral profiles of three detected kinetic components. Three variations in resolved concentration profiles were related to the thermal-deduction of triacylglycerol of unsaturated acid, appearance of hydroperoxides form of triacylglycerols and generation of secondary oxidation products. The kinetic profiles of these species were dependent on the type of oil. The proposed method can define a new way to monitor the oils’ quality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHelianthus annuus 3achemometrics 3acooking fats and oils 3acorn 3afrying 3ahydroperoxides 3aoxidation 3atriacylglycerols1 aHemmateenejad, Bahram1 aJavidnia, Katayoun1 aYousefinejad, Saeed0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2017 Mar., v. 54, no. 3 p.659-668dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2502-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009000173300001800263520166200281592002801943650001101971650001301982650001101995650000902006650001502015650001902030650002602049650001102075650001202086650001102098650000802109700002302117700001702140700002102157700001802178700002202196700001802218700002102236700001802257700001702275700002502292773010002317856008602417852000902503655001202512IND60577297420180109000000.0170807e20150908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057729742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b019352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrůša, Stanislav10aHighly Sensitive Detection of Surface and Intercalated Impurities in Graphene by LEIS  ap. 9628-9635.  aLow-energy ion scattering (LEIS) is known for its extreme surface sensitivity, as it yields a quantitative analysis of the outermost surface as well as highly resolved in-depth information for ultrathin surface layers. Hence, it could have been generally considered to be a suitable technique for the analysis of graphene samples. However, due to the low scattering cross section for light elements such as carbon, LEIS has not become a common technique for the characterization of graphene. In the present study we use a high-sensitivity LEIS instrument with parallel energy analysis for the characterization of CVD graphene transferred to thermal silica/silicon substrates. Thanks to its high sensitivity and the exceptional depth resolution typical of LEIS, the graphene layer closure was verified, and different kinds of contaminants were detected, quantified, and localized within the graphene structure. Utilizing the extraordinarily strong neutralization of helium by carbon atoms in graphene, LEIS experiments performed at several primary ion energies permit us to distinguish carbon in graphene from that in nongraphitic forms (e.g., the remains of a resist). Furthermore, metal impurities such as Fe, Sn, and Na located at the graphene–silica interface (intercalated) are detected, and the coverages of Fe and Sn are determined. Hence, high-resolution LEIS is capable of both checking the purity of graphene surfaces and detecting impurities incorporated into graphene layers or their interfaces. Thus, it is a suitable method for monitoring the quality of the whole fabrication process of graphene, including its transfer on various substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ahelium 3airon 3amonitoring 3aneutralization 3aquantitative analysis 3asilica 3asilicon 3asodium 3atin1 aProcházka, Pavel,1 aBábor, Petr1 aŠikola, Tomáš1 ater Veen, Rik1 aFartmann, Michael1 aGrehl, Thomas1 aBrüner, Philipp1 aRoth, Dietmar1 aBauer, Peter1 aBrongersma, Hidde H.0 tLangmuir.g2015 Sept. 08, v. 31, no. 35 p.9628-9635dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b019353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007400166300002200240520110800262592002801370650000801398650000801406650001801414650001001432650001301442650001301455650001801468650001401486650001301500653003101513653001601544653001601560653002001576653000801596653001001604653001001614653001701624653001301641700001801654700002101672700001701693700002301710700002001733700002001753700002401773700002001797700001901817700001701836700001701853700001701870700002101887700001601908700002301924700002001947700001401967700001501981700001401996700002402010700001802034700001902052700002102071700001602092700001402108700001402122700002302136700002302159700001902182700002102201700001902222700001802241700002202259700002302281773010302304856008302407852000902490655001202499IND60745112720221118174123.0211009e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074511272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Sydney X.10aPharmacologic modulation of RNA splicing enhances anti-tumor immunity  ap. 4032-4047.e31.  aAlthough mutations in DNA are the best-studied source of neoantigens that determine response to immune checkpoint blockade, alterations in RNA splicing within cancer cells could similarly result in neoepitope production. However, the endogenous antigenicity and clinical potential of such splicing-derived epitopes have not been tested. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacologic modulation of splicing via specific drug classes generates bona fide neoantigens and elicits anti-tumor immunity, augmenting checkpoint immunotherapy. Splicing modulation inhibited tumor growth and enhanced checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on host T cells and peptides presented on tumor MHC class I. Splicing modulation induced stereotyped splicing changes across tumor types, altering the MHC I-bound immunopeptidome to yield splicing-derived neoepitopes that trigger an anti-tumor T cell response in vivo. These data definitively identify splicing modulation as an untapped source of immunogenic peptides and provide a means to enhance response to checkpoint blockade that is readily translatable to the clinic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aT-lymphocytes 3adrugs 3aepitopes 3aimmunity 3aimmunotherapy 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 0aimmune checkpoint blockade 0aneoantigens 0aneoepitopes 0aimmunopeptidome 0aPD1 0aPRMTs 0aRBM39 0aRNA splicing 0asplicing1 aDe Neef, Emma1 aThomas, James D.1 aSabio, Erich1 aRousseau, Benoît,1 aGigoux, Mathieu1 aKnorr, David A.1 aGreenbaum, Benjamin1 aElhanati, Yuval1 aHogg, Simon J.1 aChow, Andrew1 aGhosh, Arnab1 aXie, Abigail1 aZamarin, Dmitriy1 aCui, Daniel1 aErickson, Caroline1 aSinger, Michael1 aCho, Hana1 aWang, Eric1 aLü, Bin,1 aDurham, Benjamin H.1 aShah, Harshal1 aChowell, Diego1 aGabel, Austin M.1 aShen, Yudao1 aLiu, Jing1 aJin, Jian1 aRhodes, Matthew C.1 aTaylor, Richard E.1 aMolina, Henrik1 aWolchok, Jedd D.1 aMerghoub, Taha1 aDiaz, Luis A.1 aAbdel-Wahab, Omar1 aBradley, Robert K.0 tCell.g2021 July 22, v. 184, no. 15 p.4032-4047.e31dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010800164300001600272500001900288520116300307592002801470650001401498650001001512650001601522650001801538650001501556650001701571650001001588650000901598650002601607650001301633650001401646653002201660653003101682653001601713700001401729700001401743700001501757700002001772700005401792773010101846856008501947852000902032655001202041IND60727094420221119065453.0210423e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072709442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2020.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Jian10aMicroarray gene expression profiling provides insights into functions of TIPE2 in HBV-related apoptosis  ap. 137-143.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein-8 like-2 (TNFAIP8L2, TIPE2), a member of TNFAIP8 family, functions as a regulator in inflammation. Our previous studies showed that TIPE2 can negatively regulate HBV-specific CD8⁺ T lymphocyte functions. But the effect of TIPE2 on the apoptosis of HBV-infected hepatocytes which is very important for eliminating viruses remains unclear. Using gene expression microarray analysis, we find that TIPE2 deficiency can regulate the expression of apoptotic genes in liver tissues from HBV hydrodynamic injection (HI) mouse model. TIPE2 protein was detected in TUNEL staining positive hepatocytes in HBV-infected C57 mice. Interestingly, the TIPE2 expressed hepatocytes were just the HBV infected cells. Furthermore, TIPE2 upregulates the mRNA levels of FasL, Bim and TNFRsF1b which promote cells death, when TIPE2 was transfected into HepG2 cells in vitro. As a result, TIPE2 overexpression cells showed a higher number of apoptotic cells and increased level of cleavage caspase3 compared to controls. Those results indicate that TIPE2 participates in HBV infection by regulating apoptosis of virus-infected hepatocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3adeath 3ahepatocytes 3ahydrodynamics 3aimmunology 3ainflammation 3aliver 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 0aTNFAIP8L2 (TIPE2) 0aMicroarray gene expression 0aHepatitis B1 aZhang, Na1 aLiu, Ying1 aZhang, Lei1 aGao, Chengjiang1 aLiu, Suxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0307-119X0 tMolecular immunology.g2021 Mar., v. 131 p.137-143dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245010700210300001600317506007600333520110000409592002801509506003701537650002101574650004401595650002701639650002601666650001501692650003101707650002901738650001001767650001301777650001101790650001801801650001601819650001501835650001501850650003701865650003701902650001901939700002401958700002401982700002002006700001802026773009402044856008102138852000902219655001202228IND60441785820221207052825.0151027e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044178582DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-015-0302-92doi7 aPMC46241502pmcid7 a283244062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandit, Raksha S.10aCurcumin nanoparticles: physico-chemical fabrication and its in vitro efficacy against human pathogens  ap. 991-997.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurcumin is one of the polyphenols, which has been known for its medicinal use since long time. Curcumin shows poor solubility and low absorption, and therefore, its use as nanoparticles is beneficial due to their greater solubility and absorption. The main aim of the present study was the formation of curcumin nanoparticles (Nano curcu), evaluation of their antibacterial activity against human pathogenic bacteria and formulation of Nano curcu-based cream. We synthesized Nano curcu by sonication method. The synthesis of Nano curcu was assessed for their solubility in water and by UV–visible spectrophotometry. Further, the nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking and analysis, and zeta potential analysis. In vitro antibacterial activity of Nano curcu was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cream containing Nano curcu was found to be effective against human bacterial pathogens and hence can be used for treatment of bacterial diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aabsorption 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aantibacterial properties 3acream 3acurcumin 3ahumans 3ananoparticles 3apolyphenols 3asolubility 3asonication 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential1 aGaikwad, Swapnil C.1 aAgarkar, Gauravi A.1 aGade, Aniket K.1 aRai, Mahendra0 t3 Biotech.g2015 Dec., v. 5, no. 6 p.991-997dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-015-0302-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009800169300002200267520116900289592002801458650002401486650001401510650001401524650001401538650001101552650001601563650001401579650001401593650002601607650002301633650002001656650001601676650001401692650001301706650002901719653001301748653002001761653001601781653002101797653001301818653001801831653002301849653001301872700002001885700002001905700001701925700001801942700001701960700001601977700002601993700002002019700001802039700002202057700002302079700002602102700001902128700001902147700002402166700001602190700002102206700002502227700001502252700001702267700002002284700002702304773010302331856008302434852000902517655001202526IND60745112820221118174205.0211009e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074511282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWimmers, Florian14aThe single-cell epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to influenza vaccination  ap. 3915-3935.e21.  aEmerging evidence indicates a fundamental role for the epigenome in immunity. Here, we mapped the epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to influenza vaccination in humans at the single-cell level. Vaccination against seasonal influenza induced persistently diminished H3K27ac in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), which was associated with impaired cytokine responses to Toll-like receptor stimulation. Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis revealed an epigenomically distinct subcluster of monocytes with reduced chromatin accessibility at AP-1-targeted loci after vaccination. Similar effects were observed in response to vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. However, this vaccine also stimulated persistently increased chromatin accessibility at interferon response factor (IRF) loci in monocytes and mDCs. This was associated with elevated expression of antiviral genes and heightened resistance to the unrelated Zika and Dengue viruses.

Ethnobotanical survey of bananas was conducted in six districts of East Java, Indonesia i.e. Pasuruan, Probolinggo, Banyuwangi, Lumajang, Jember and Malang during 2012-2015. Seventy-nine local cultivar names were recorded in the six districts, including local Javanese names and some possible synonyms among the cultivars. Four genomic groups are represented: AA (13), AAA (16), AAB (24) and ABB (16); 10 specimens are uncertain AA/AAA/AAB. Banana cultivar names given by local communities mostly reflect distinct morphological or perceptual characteristics, as well as uses, although some of the names do not refer to appearance or anything at all. Some cultivars were restricted to particular regions. Bananas play important roles in East Javanese socio-economic and cultural life. All parts of the plant are used: for food, fodder, domestic materials, fibers, shelters, ornamentals, medicines, in rituals and ceremonial events and other miscellaneous uses. Banana plants have deep philosophical meaning; their characteristics are associated with the process of life and provide lessons on life ethics. Conservation of local banana cultivars is needed in the face of negative impacts of commercialism. In-situ/on-farm conservation of bananas is a suitable strategy. Conserving the diverse species and varieties of bananas is necessary to maintain their adaptability and resilience to resist biotic and abiotic stresses.

Because of the structural noncentrosymmetry, TiO₂-based and lead-containing perovskite-type photocatalysts exhibit excellence in both stability and ferroelectricity to facilitate charge separation state. To extend their visible light activity, we use molten salts synthesis methodology to prepare Pb₂Bi₄Ti₅O₁₈ perovskites with various nanoscale morphologies and evaluated their visible light-driven photocatalytic activity for NO removal. The results show that perovskite Pb₂Bi₄Ti₅O₁₈ samples exhibit excellent stability as well as display over 50% NO removal efficiency under visible light in contrast to no more than 15% for commercial P25. A set of radical scavengers were used to probe the reaction mechanism. A bond-valence method was used to calculate the direction and magnitude of the dipole moments of the asymmetric unit in the structure. We revealed that the photocatalytic Pb₂Bi₄Ti₅O₁₈ possesses distorted units in which the dipole-induced internal fields promote the charge separation, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. Because this novel photocatalytic NO removal is a solid–gas reaction in which the lead content is secured in solid phase, this work finds a suitable application for Pb-containing perovskite photocatalysts with great industrial interests and add a new fundamental coordination for better photocatalysts-by-designing.  aPublisher supplied data 3afree radical scavengers 3alead 3anitric oxide 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aprocess design 3areaction mechanisms 3aredox reactions 3asalts1 aDong, Guohui1 aMa, Yichi1 aJin, Si1 aWang, Chuanyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7146-115X1 aXu, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3343-72630 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 56, no. 11 p.2908-2916dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.6b047063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009200168300001800260520196500278592002802243650001702271650001302288650001302301650001902314650001202333650002402345650001602369650001902385650001502404650001602419700001602435700001302451700001502464773010002479856008602579852000902665655001202674IND60577297720221119013227.0170807e20150908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057729772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b020112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Chuanjin10aNumerical Simulations of the Digital Microfluidic Manipulation of Single Microparticles  ap. 9636-9645.  aSingle-cell analysis techniques have been developed as a valuable bioanalytical tool for elucidating cellular heterogeneity at genomic, proteomic, and cellular levels. Cell manipulation is an indispensable process for single-cell analysis. Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an important platform for conducting cell manipulation and single-cell analysis in a high-throughput fashion. However, the manipulation of single cells in DMF has not been quantitatively studied so far. In this article, we investigate the interaction of a single microparticle with a liquid droplet on a flat substrate using numerical simulations. The droplet is driven by capillary force generated from the wettability gradient of the substrate. Considering the Brownian motion of microparticles, we utilize many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD), an off-lattice mesoscopic simulation technique, in this numerical study. The manipulation processes (including pickup, transport, and drop-off) of a single microparticle with a liquid droplet are simulated. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects on the manipulation processes from the droplet size, wettability gradient, wetting properties of the microparticle, and particle–substrate friction coefficients. The numerical results show that the pickup, transport, and drop-off processes can be precisely controlled by these parameters. On the basis of the numerical results, a trap-free delivery of a hydrophobic microparticle to a destination on the substrate is demonstrated in the numerical simulations. The numerical results not only provide a fundamental understanding of interactions among the microparticle, the droplet, and the substrate but also demonstrate a new technique for the trap-free immobilization of single hydrophobic microparticles in the DMF design. Finally, our numerical method also provides a powerful design and optimization tool for the manipulation of microparticles in DMF systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3afriction 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3amethodology 3amicroparticles 3aproteomics 3awettability1 aPal, Souvik1 aLi, Zhen1 aMa, Yanbao0 tLangmuir.g2015 Sept. 08, v. 31, no. 35 p.9636-9645dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b020113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245013600212520118800348592002801536650002601564650002001590650001501610650002401625650001601649650002101665650001101686650001301697650001801710650002001728650001601748650002101764650002801785650002101813650001701834650001601851650001901867650002301886650002801909650001101937653001901948653003401967653002302001700005902024700006102083700001902144700002002163700002202183700002302205700006202228773012202290856008102412852000902493655001202502IND60678215420221120201108.0200221e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067821542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1088662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatrignani, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6688-263810aPotential of Yarrowia lipolytica and Debaryomyces hansenii strains to produce high quality food ingredients based on cricket powder  aThis research was aimed at producing, by the use of Yarrowia lipolytica and Debaryomyces hansenii strains, cricket powder hydrolysates endowed with high food safety, functionality, sensory and technological properties to be further used as food ingredients. The hydrolysates were characterised, in comparison to a control, by a reduced chitin content and higher contents of antimicrobial substances (acetic acid, short chain fatty acids, chitosan, and GABA) and health-promoting molecules (arachidonic and linolenic acids, GABA, AABA, and BABA). Additionally, in the cricket powder hydrolysates, a major release of free amino acids was detected, highlighting the high matrix digestibility. The hydrolysates obtained by the use of GRAS yeasts were characterised by the presence of many volatile molecules and specific amino acids typical of ripened and fermented foods that can impart good sensory properties. In this study, the ability of each tested strain, based on their physiological and metabolic features in the system taken into consideration, was shown to give rise to cricket-based hydrolysates characterised by specific physicochemical, sensory and functional fingerprints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aGRAS substances 3aOrthoptera 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3aacetic acid 3aarachidonic acid 3achitin 3achitosan 3adigestibility 3afermented foods 3afood safety 3afree amino acids 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahealth promotion 3ahydrolysates 3aingredients 3alinolenic acid 3asensory properties 3ashort chain fatty acids 3ayeasts 0aCricket powder 0aInsect-based food ingredients 0aYeast hydrolysates1 aParrotta, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7996-37981 aDel Duca, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5981-520X1 aVannini, Lucia1 aCamprini, Lucia1 aDalla Rosa, Marco1 aSchlüter, Oliver,1 aLanciotti, Rosalba1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1592-46740 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Feb., v. 119 p.108866-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1088663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010100171300001600272520120200288592002801490650002701518650002901545650002601574650002001600650002601620650002901646650001301675650001101688650001201699650001201711650001401723650001601737653002801753653001901781653001301800653002901813653002001842700002001862700002101882773015701903856008602060852000902146655001202155IND60111879820221122045709.0190214e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011187982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArce, Andres N.10aAntimicrobial secretions and social immunity in larval burying beetles, Nicrophorus vespilloides  ap. 741-745.  aOffspring of many animals develop in environments in which they are exposed to high densities of potentially harmful bacteria. For example, larvae of the carrion beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides face significant challenges from the bacteria they encounter during their development on decomposing vertebrate carcasses. We tested the idea that larvae secrete antimicrobial compounds during development to defend themselves against microbial exposure. We first showed that larval secretion of active antimicrobials peaked during the early stages of development. As has been found previously for parental secretions, larval secretions were active against Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria, indicating that they might be based on lysozyme-like compounds. Finally, consistent with this antibacterial activity, we showed that larval survival declined significantly when challenged with lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not when challenged with a lysozyme-susceptible strain of the same species. These results demonstrate that Nicrophorus larvae are not simply passive recipients of social immunity derived from their parents, but that they are active participants in its production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aNicrophorus vespilloides 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanimal behavior 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibacterial properties 3aimmunity 3alarvae 3aparents 3aprogeny 3asecretion 3avertebrates 0aantimicrobial secretion 0acarrion beetle 0alysozyme 0aNicrophorus vespilloides 0asocial immunity1 aSmiseth, Per T.1 aRozen, Daniel E.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2013 Oct., v. 86, no. 4 p.741-745dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245016900173300001800342520111000360592002801470650002301498650002001521650001701541650001301558650001801571650002101589650002601610650001901636650001901655650001901674650001101693650003301704650001501737650002301752700002601775700006001801773017101861856008002032852000902112655001202121IND60600865120221120124531.0180704e20170329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060086512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b047082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantonja-Blasco, Laura10aInfluence of Chain Microstructure on Liquid–Liquid Phase Structure and Crystallization of Dual Reactor Ziegler–Natta Made Impact Propylene–Ethylene Copolymers  ap. 3270-3282.  aThe relationship between ethylene content, phase structure, crystallization behavior, and the inferred mechanical performance has been studied in five impact copolymers with overall ethylene content between 8 and 11 mol %. Thermal characterization data and crystallization kinetics of impact polypropylene copolymers (IPC) do not scale with content of ethylene. Emphasis is given to understand the correlation between heterophasic morphology assessed by scanning electron microscopy and polarized optical microscopy and the properties of the crystalline propylene–ethylene copolymer component extracted via fractionation. As the mass fraction of the rubber component is equivalent for all IPC, the scaling between ethylene content and increased droplet size is explained by the observed differences in dynamics of the crystalline ethylene–propylene copolymer molecules during the liquid–liquid phase separation step. On this basis, a correlation is inferred between cocrystallization and compatibility of the components that make the observed multiphase morphologies and the IPC mechanical behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallization 3adroplet size 3aethylene 3afractionation 3alight microscopy 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3apolypropylenes 3aprocess design 3arubber 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseparation 3athermal properties1 aRungswang, Wonchalerm1 aAlamo, Rufina G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3061-499X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Mar. 29, v. 56, no. 12 p.3270-3282dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.6b047083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009400176300001600270520093000286592002801216650001701244650001401261650001701275650002401292650001201316650001201328650004401340650003101384650001301415650001301428650001701441653003701458653001801495653001301513653002501526653001401551653001201565700002201577700002101599700002601620700002701646700002001673700005401693773010601747856008701853852000901940655001201949IND60643039820221120173044.0200705e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064303982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRottreau, Taylor J.10aNMR cryoporometry of polymers: Cross-linking, porosity and the importance of probe liquid  ap. 256-263.  aThe morphology of cross-linked polymers plays an important role in their physical and chemical properties. NMR cryoporometry allows for the investigation of these structures over different length scales, through appropriate choice of probe liquid. The different structures of two different polymeric samples, one a cross-linked polymer hydrogel, the other a pore-expanded ion-exchange polymer, are analysed here. The ability for NMR cryoporometry to analyse both polymeric materials in the swollen state is successfully demonstrated, as is the importance of probe-liquid choice for the analysis of different regions of the pore structure. In both cases, water is used to identify populations of pores smaller than ca. 5 nm. The use of t-butanol and menthol reveals the presence of additional mesoporous structures in the ion-exchange resin as well as the responsiveness of the pore structure to the liquid used to swell it.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3ahydrogels 3aion exchange 3aion exchange resins 3aliquids 3amenthol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aporous media 0aNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 0aCryoporometry 0aPolymers 0aIon-exchange polymer 0at-Butanol 0aMenthol1 aParkes, George E.1 aSchirru, Manuela1 aHarries, Josephine L.1 aGranollers Mesa, Marta1 aTopham, Paul D.1 aEvans, Rob1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1471-201X0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 575 p.256-263dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245010100214300001800315506007600333520148300409592002801892506003701920650001801957650002901975650001502004650001802019650003402037650003702071650001902108650001802127650001402145650001602159650002002175650002702195650001402222650002102236650002002257650001902277650000902296650001302305650002902318650001602347700002202363700001902385700001902404700001802423700001602441700002402457773009602481856008102577852000902658655001202667IND60441786020221207052603.0151027e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044178602DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-015-0305-62doi7 aPMC46241332pmcid7 a283244082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbu El-Heba, Ghada A.10aImpact of cis-acting elements’ frequency in transcription activity in dicot and monocot plants  ap. 1007-1019.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe production of new cultivars via recombinant DNA technology is important in applied agriculture. Promoters play fundamental roles in successful transformation and gene expression. Fragments of the upstream regulatory region of the movement protein gene of the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV; two fragments) and Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus (WmCSV, two fragments) and one fragment of the coat protein putative promoter of TYLCV (CPTY-pro) were isolated to assess their abilities to drive expression in monocot and dicot plants. We used bioinformatic analyses to identify tentative motifs in the fragments. The five promoter fragments were isolated, fused with the GUS reporter gene, and transformed into tomato, watermelon, and rice plantlets via Agrobacterium infiltration. GUS expression driven by each putative promoter was analysed using histochemical and fluorometric analyses. In both dicots and the monocots, the highest level of GUS expression was obtained using a truncated regulatory region from TYLCV (MMPTY-pro) followed by a truncated regulatory region from WmCSV (MMPWm-pro). However, the corresponding full-length fragments from TYLCV and WmCSV showed essentially equivalent expression levels in the fluorometric GUS assay compared with the enhanced Cauliflower mosaic virus e35S-pro. In addition, CPTY-pro showed no expression in either the dicots or the monocot. This study demonstrated that MMPTY-pro and MMPWm-pro may be useful as plant promoters.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrobacterium 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aLiliopsida 3aMagnoliopsida 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3aWatermelon chlorotic stunt virus 3abioinformatics 3acoat proteins 3acultivars 3afluorometry 3agene expression 3agenetic transformation 3aplantlets 3apromoter regions 3arecombinant DNA 3areporter genes 3arice 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics) 3awatermelons1 aHussein, Gihan M.1 aFahmy, Inas F.1 aAbdou, Sara M.1 aFaisal, Asmaa1 aTaha, Omnia1 aAbdallah, Naglaa A.0 t3 Biotech.g2015 Dec., v. 5, no. 6 p.1007-1019dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-015-0305-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010700164300001800271520230200289592002802591650001302619650001502632650002902647650002702676650001902703650002502722650001302747650002202760650002002782650001802802650001702820650001302837650002002850650001902870650001302889650001602902650001502918650001302933650001902946700001602965700001902981700001703000700002003017700002103037773010003058856008603158852000903244655001203253IND60577297820221119013157.0170807e20150908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057729782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b020382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Jie10aVersatile and Rapid Postfunctionalization from Cyclodextrin Modified Host Polymeric Membrane Substrate  ap. 9665-9674.  aSurface modification has long been of great interest to impart desired functionalities to the bioimplants. However, due to the limitations of recent technologies in surface modification, it is highly desirable to explore novel protocols, which can advantageously and efficiently endow the inert material surfaces with versatile biofunctionalities. Herein, to achieve versatile and rapid postfunctionalization of polymeric membrane, we demonstrate a new strategy for the fabrication of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) modified host membrane substrate that can recognize a series of well-designed guest macromolecules. The surface assembly procedure was driven by the host–guest interaction between adamantane (Ad) and β-CD. β-CD immobilized host membrane was fabricated via two steps: (1) epoxy groups enriched poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membrane was first prepared via in situ cross-linking polymerization and subsequently phase separation; (2) mono-6-deoxy-6-ethylenediamine-β-CD (EDA-β-CD) was then anchored onto the surface of the epoxy functionalized PES membrane to obtain PES-CD. Subsequently, three types of Ad-terminated polymers, including Ad-poly(styrenesulfonate-co-sodium acrylate) (Ad-PSA), Ad-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (Ad-PEG), and Ad-poly(methyl chloride-quaternized 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (Ad-PMT), were separately assembled onto the β-CD immobilized surfaces to endow the membranes with anticoagulant, antifouling, and antibacterial capability, respectively. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) measurements were carried out to explore the anticoagulant activity. The antifouling capability was evaluated via protein adsorption and platelet adhesion measurements. Moreover, Staphyllococcous aureus (S. aureus) was selected as model bacteria to evaluate the antibacterial ability of the functionalized membranes. The results indicated that well-regulated blood compatibility, antifouling capability, and bactericidal activity could be achieved by the proposed rapid postfunctionalization on polymeric membranes. This approach of versatile and rapid postfunctionalization is promising for the preparation of multifunctional polymeric membrane materials to meet with various demands for the further applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3aanticoagulant activity 3aanticoagulants 3aartificial membranes 3abacteria 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3ablood platelets 3acell adhesion 3acrosslinking 3aepoxides 3aethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aprothrombin 3aseparation 3athrombin 3athromboplastin1 aLiu, Xinyue1 aZhang, Shuqing1 aCheng, Chong1 aNie, Chuanxiong1 aZhao, Changsheng0 tLangmuir.g2015 Sept. 08, v. 31, no. 35 p.9665-9674dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b020383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245015700175300002000332520134300352592002801695650001801723650001801741650001501759650002101774650001001795650001101805650000901816650001901825650001301844650001601857700002101873700002801894700002801922700002701950773016901977856008102146852000902227655001202236IND60596664920221118191844.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059666492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1819-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitorino, HectorAguilar10aEvaluation of iron loading in four types of hepatopancreatic cells of the mangrove crab Ucides cordatus using ferrocene derivatives and iron supplements  ap. 15962-15970.  aThe mangrove crab Ucides cordatus is a bioindicator of aquatic contamination. In this work, the iron availability and redox activity of saccharide-coated mineral iron supplements (for both human and veterinary use) and ferrocene derivatives in Saline Ucides Buffer (SUB) medium were assessed. The transport of these metallodrugs by four different hepatopancreatic cell types (embryonic (E), resorptive (R), fibrillar (F), and blister (B)) of U. cordatus were measured. Organic coated iron minerals (iron supplements) were stable against strong chelators (calcein and transferrin). Ascorbic acid efficiently mediated the release of iron only from ferrocene compounds, leading to redox-active species. Ferrous iron and iron supplements were efficient in loading iron to all hepatopancreatic cell types. In contrast, ferrocene derivatives were loaded only in F and B cell types. Acute exposition to the iron compounds resulted in cell viability of 70–95%, and to intracellular iron levels as high as 0.40 μmol L⁻¹ depending upon the compound and the cell line. The easiness that iron from iron metallodrugs was loaded/transported into U. cordatus hepatopancreatic cells reinforces a cautionary approach to the widespread disposal and use of highly bioavailable iron species as far as the long-term environmental welfare is concerned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aascorbic acid 3acell lines 3achelating agents 3acrabs 3ahumans 3airon 3airon compounds 3aminerals 3atransferrin1 aOrtega, Priscila1 aPastrana Alta, RoxanaY.1 aZanotto, FlaviaPinheiro1 aEspósito, BrenoPannia0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 June, v. 25, no. 16 p.15962-15970dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1819-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014700172300001600319500001500335520195400350592002802304650001102332650001802343650001002361650001802371650001602389650001402405650001502419650001102434650002102445650002502466650002502491650001102516650001602527650002002543651001202563653001802575653001602593653000902609653001602618653001702634653001802651700002102669700002202690700002502712773010502737856008602842852000902928655001202937IND60539825820221121125623.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053982582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiebe, Andrew J.13aAn approach to improve direct runoff estimates and reduce uncertainty in the calculated groundwater component in water balances of large lakes  ap. 655-670.  a2019-12-06  aGroundwater is important in the overall water budget of a lake because it affects the quantity and quality of surface water and the ecological health of the lake. The water balance equation is frequently used to estimate the net groundwater flow for small lakes but is seldom used to determine net groundwater flow components for large lakes because: (1) errors accumulate in the calculated groundwater term, and (2) there is an inability to accurately quantify the direct runoff component. In this water balance study of Lake Pyhäjärvi (155km2) in Finland, it was hypothesized a hydrograph separation model could be used to estimate direct runoff to the lake and, when combined with a rigorous uncertainty analyses, would provide reliable net groundwater flow estimates. The PART hydrograph separation model was used to estimate annual per unit area direct runoff values for the watershed of the inflowing Yläneenjoki River (a subwatershed of the lake) which were then applied to other physically similar subwatersheds of the lake to estimate total direct runoff to the lake. The hydrograph separation method provided superior results and had lower uncertainty than the common approach of using a runoff coefficient based method. The average net groundwater flow into the lake was calculated to be +43mm per year (+3.0% of average total inflow) for the 38 water years 1971–2008. It varied from −197mm to 284mm over that time, and had a magnitude greater than the uncertainty for 17 of the 38years. The average indirect groundwater contribution to the lake (i.e., the groundwater part of the inflowing rivers) was 454mm per year (+32% of average total inflow) and demonstrates the overall importance of groundwater. The techniques in this study are applicable to other large lakes and may allow small net groundwater flows to be reliably quantified in settings that might otherwise be unquantifiable or completely lost in large uncertainties.  aPublisher supplied data 3arivers 3asubwatersheds 3alakes 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3aequations 3ahydrograph 3amodels 3agroundwater flow 3auncertainty analysis 3aenvironmental health 3arunoff 3agroundwater 3asurface quality 3aFinland 0aDirect runoff 0aUncertainty 0aLake 0aGroundwater 0aWater budget 0awater balance1 aConant, Brewster1 aRudolph, David L.1 aKorkka-Niemi, Kirsti0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Dec., v. 531 p.655-670dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013900167500001900306520159300325592002801918650001301946650001201959650001701971650002601988650002402014650002202038650002502060650003002085650002202115650001902137650002102156650001802177650001302195650001802208650002902226650001302255650002202268650002502290650002502315650002102340650001202361650002102373650001502394651001002409653001702419653002602436653003202462653003102494653001902525653004602544700001802590700001702608700001502625700001302640700001702653700001302670700001702683773010802700856008402808852000902892655001202901IND60719388120221120222750.0210215e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071938812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2020.1048682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shaojun10aAcceleration of soil N2O flux and nitrogen transformation during tropical secondary forest succession after slash-and-burn agriculture  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe responses of soil nitrous oxide (N₂O) fluxes to tropical forest development are not well documented. We linked the characteristics of N₂O fluxes with community composition, N cycling, inorganic nitrogen (N) pools, as well as other soil variables during tropical secondary forest succession after slash-and-burn agriculture in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China. During succession, from Mallotus paniculatus to Syzygium oblatum communities, N₂O emissions increased from 390.8 ug N m⁻² h⁻¹ to 671.6 ug N m⁻² h⁻¹, where the greatest value occurred during the wet season. The increased soil water content following forest succession explained 71–90 % of the N₂O emissions, while decreased soil temperature only contributed 66–70 % to the emissions. Net N mineralization and nitrification increased along the secondary succession of tropical forests, which was positively and nonlinearly correlated with variations in the inorganic nitrogen pool. The variations in N₂O fluxes were positively correlated with net N mineralization and nitrification, ammonia and nitrate N, and microbial biomass, but negatively associated with bulk density of soils and C:N ratio of the litter and soil. Our data suggested that a substantial acceleration of soil N₂O flux was mainly determined by the increasing availability of inorganic N stimulated by the improved litter quality (low C:N ratio), as well as elevated gravimetric water content, and net N mineralization and nitrification during the spontaneous succession of secondary tropical forests after slash-and-burn agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSyzygium 3aammonia 3abulk density 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acommunity structure 3aforest succession 3aforestry development 3agravimetric water content 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3aresearch 3asecondary forests 3asecondary succession 3ashifting cultivation 3asoil temperature 3atillage 3atropical forests 3awet season 3aChina 0aN2O emission 0aNitrogen availability 0aNet nitrogen mineralization 0aNet nitrogen nitrification 0aSlash-and-burn 0aSpontaneous succession of tropical forest1 aZuo, Qianqian1 aCao, Qianbin1 aWang, Ping1 aYang, Bo1 aZhao, Shuang1 aCao, Run1 aChen, Minkun0 tSoil & tillage research.g2021 Apr., v. 208 p.104868-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.1048683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245014700178300001600325520123800341592002801579650001301607650002901620650002801649650002101677650001301698650001301711650002001724650001601744650001701760653002201777653002001799653001801819653001501837653002901852700002501881700002201906700003201928700002501960700002401985700002702009700002302036700002302059700002102082773010602103856008702209852000902296655001202305IND60643039920221120162931.0200705e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064303992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsadov, Ziyafaddin H.10aSurface properties and premicellar aggregation behavior of cationic gemini surfactants with mono- and di-(2-hydroxypropyl)ammonium head groups  ap. 212-221.  aNovel cationic gemini surfactants - pentanediyl-1,5-bis[mono(2-hydroxypropyl) alkylammonium] dibromide and pentanediyl-1,5-bis[di(2-hydroxypropyl) alkylammonium] dibromide {in the abbreviation form - CₙC₅Cₙ[iso-Pr(OH)] and CₙC₅Cₙ[iso-Pr(OH)]₂; alkyl - CₙH₂ₙ₊₁ with n = 8, 9, 12 and 16} were synthesized. Surface tension, electroconductivity and dynamic light scattering methods were applied to study aggregation properties of these surfactants in aqueous medium. By tensiometric method it was established that, at two studied concentrations in water, the synthesized gemini surfactants form aggregates. This occurs well below the critical micelle concentrations (CMC) of these surfactants. The influence of the length of the surfactants alkyl chain and the number of the 2-hydroxypropyl fragments in the head group on the surface activity parameters and binding degree of the counterion has been studied. By dynamic light scattering method, the impact of the number of the 2-hydroxypropyl groups in the gemini surfactants with C₁₂–chain on the micelles sizes at the concentrations higher than CMC has been investigated. It was revealed that the synthesized surfactants possess an antimicrobial property.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aantimicrobial properties 3aelectrical conductivity 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3amoieties 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3atensiometers 0aGemini surfactant 0aSurface tension 0aMicellization 0aAdsorption 0aAntimicrobial properties1 aAhmadova, Gulnara A.1 aRahimov, Ravan A.1 aHashimzade, Seyid-Zeynab F.1 aNasibova, Shafiga M.1 aIsmailov, Etibar H.1 aSuleymanova, Samira A.1 aMuradova, Sevda A.1 aAsadova, Nahida Z.1 aZubkov, Fedor I.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 575 p.212-221dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04152naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024001700134024002300151024003700174024002300211024004000234024002500274040001800299100006000317245011500377500001500492506007600507506003100583520156600614592002802180596006002208596007902268506003702347650002302384650003002407650002502437650001102462650002702473650001602500650002002516650002302536650001902559650002202578650002002600650001502620650001902635650001902654650001502673650002302688650001102711650002902722650002502751650001102776651003202787651001002819653001502829653001802844700002002862700006002882700002202942700002202964700003002986700002303016700002003039773012303059856008403182856011403266961001703380852000903397655001203406IND60719388220221207134808.0210215e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071938822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2020.1048692chorus7 a3727922aris7 a10113/71938822hdl7 a10.1016/j.still.2020.1048692doi7 a3727922seq_no_1157 a3096-13000-009-00D2aris_project_no7 a4329152aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, Joseph A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7203-714210aNet positive soil water content following cover crops with no tillage in irrigated semi-arid cotton production  agolden set  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aConservation management practices such as no-tillage and cover cropping can reduce soil erosion, enhance soil biological activity, increase water capture and storage, and sequester C. Cover crops, however, utilize stored soil water during the winter months, and the water depletion is thought to have negative impacts on the subsequent cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crop in semi-arid ecoregions where water resources are limited. The objective of this research was to quantify the long-term impacts of conservation tillage and cover crop use on volumetric water content of soil in an irrigated cotton production system. Soil water was measured in a long-term (established 1998) conservation system in Lamesa, TX and water dynamics during the 2015–2017 growing seasons are presented here. Volumetric water content was reduced by cover crops prior to their termination but was replenished by spring precipitation and deficit irrigation prior to planting cotton. A stepwise regression analysis was used to determine changes in soil water at depth. In each of the study years, soil water increased more with no-tillage following cover crop termination and decreased less during cotton growth than the conventionally tilled system. Cotton water use efficiency was not significantly different between treatments in any year. Results from this study challenge the concept that winter cover crops result in reduced in-season soil water in irrigated systems, a supposition that has limited adoption of conservation tillage and cover crop use on the Texas High Plains.  aPublisher supplied data  cCotton Incorporateddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006481  cNatural Resources Conservation Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000091710 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aconventional tillage 3acotton 3acover crop termination 3acover crops 3acrop production 3adeficit irrigation 3agrowing season 3airrigated farming 3airrigated soils 3ano-tillage 3asemiarid soils 3asemiarid zones 3asoil depth 3asoil water regimes 3aspring 3avolumetric water content 3awater use efficiency 3awinter 3aHigh Plains (United States) 3aTexas 0aSoil water 0aNeutron probe1 aLewis, Katie L.1 aRitchie, Glen L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8695-04181 aDelaune, Paul B.,1 aKeeling, J.

The spread and transmission of pathogens due to consuming unsafe water culminate in waterborne diseases and increased number of deaths worldwide. Recently, the application of nanotechnology for water purification, and in particular the use of antibacterial nanoparticles (NPs) to control microbial contaminations, has received considerable interest. In this study, antibacterial chitosan–silver nanoparticles (CS/AgNPs) were enzymatically grafted on cork matrixes to design a water purification point-of-use device. The antibacterial efficiency of the constructed filtering system was further evaluated against water severely contaminated with Escherichia coli (∼10⁷ CFU/mL). The system was tested in two operating filtration modes with varied water residence times. The antibacterial nanocomposite decreased the water bacterial contamination by 4 and 5 log CFU/mL when performing a series of continuous short disinfection cycles of 15 min residence time (experiment I). Nevertheless, complete bacteria removal was achieved only after increasing the water residence time in the filters up to 8 h (experiment II). Durability of the system was demonstrated via performing five disinfection cycles after which the hybrid CS/AgNPs remained on the cork surface. Importantly, the antibacterial nanocomposite prevented bacteria attachment and proliferation during all cycles of the disinfection process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3abacterial contamination 3acork 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3adurability 3afilters 3afiltration 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apathogens 3aprocess design 3apurification methods 3awater purification 3awater supply 3awaterborne diseases1 aPetkova, Petya1 aMargalef-Marti, Rosanna1 aVives, Marc1 aAguilar Revelo, Lorena,1 aGallegos, Angel1 aFrancesko, Antonio1 aPerelshtein, Ilana1 aGedanken, Aharon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1243-29571 aMendoza, Ernest1 aCasas-Zapata, Juan Carlos1 aMorató, Jordi1 aTzanov, Tzanko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8568-11100 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 56, no. 13 p.3599-3606dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.6b047213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002800188245012300216300001600339506007600355520106100431592002801492506003701520650002401557650000901581650002001590650001001610650002801620650001001648650001101658650001101669700002601680700001801706773011201724856008101836852000901917655001201926IND60575789220221207073611.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057578922DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2526-72doi7 aPMC53342402pmcid7 a282986952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFauzi, Noor Akhmazillah13aAn insight on the relationship between food compressibility and microbial inactivation during high pressure processing  ap. 802-809.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper investigates the effect of high pressure liquid food compressibility on S. cerevisae inactivation. Honey with various adjusted sugar with different values of compressibility was selected as a model food. S. cerevisiae cells in different honey concentrations (0–80°Brix), 600 MPa (at ambient temperature) showed an increasing resistance to inactivation with increasing °Brix. D-values of S. cerevisiae at 200, 400 and 600 MPa, for 20 min/80°Brix were 136.99 ± 7.97, 29.24 ± 6.44 and 23.47 ± 0.86 min, respectively. These D-values resulted the Z ₚ -value of 526 ± 39 MPa. A significant correlation (p < 0.05) of cell reduction, °Brix and compressibility was found. Cell reduction in high pressure-treated samples varied linearly with °Brix suggesting that the baroprotective effect of the food was not solely due to sugar content, but also due to its compressibility. This research could have significant implications on the success of HPP (high pressure processing) preservation of foods containing high sugar content.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aambient temperature 3abrix 3acompressibility 3afoods 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ahoney 3amodels 3asugars1 aFarid, Mohammed Mehdi1 aSilva, Filipa0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2017 Mar., v. 54, no. 3 p.802-809dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2526-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245015200209300001600361500001500377506007600392520127700468592002801745506003701773650002201810650001201832650001801844650001301862650001901875650001601894650001301910650001301923650002201936650001701958650002201975650001401997650001802011650001102029650001102040650003702051650002302088650002002111650001502131650002202146650002002168650001302188653001602201700001802217773009402235856008102329852000902410655001202419IND60441786420221207052742.0151027e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044178642DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-015-0303-82doi7 aPMC46241382pmcid7 a283244112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamthania, Mohit10aScreening and structure-based modeling of T-cell epitopes of Nipah virus proteome: an immunoinformatic approach for designing peptide-based vaccine  ap. 877-882.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIdentification of Nipah virus (NiV) T-cell-specific antigen is urgently needed for appropriate diagnostic and vaccination. In the present study, prediction and modeling of T-cell epitopes of Nipah virus antigenic proteins nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein, L protein, W protein, V protein and C protein followed by the binding simulation studies of predicted highest binding scorers with their corresponding MHC class I alleles were done. Immunoinformatic tool ProPred1 was used to predict the promiscuous MHC class I epitopes of viral antigenic proteins. The molecular modelings of the epitopes were done by PEPstr server. And alleles structure were predicted by MODELLER 9.10. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were performed through the NAMD graphical user interface embedded in visual molecular dynamics. Epitopes VPATNSPEL, NPTAVPFTL and LLFVFGPNL of Nucleocapsid, V protein and Fusion protein have considerable binding energy and score with HLA-B7, HLA-B*2705 and HLA-A2MHC class I allele, respectively. These three predicted peptides are highly potential to induce T-cell-mediated immune response and are expected to be useful in designing epitope-based vaccines against Nipah virus after further testing by wet laboratory studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNipah henipavirus 3aalleles 3aT-lymphocytes 3apeptides 3auser interface 3avaccination 3aepitopes 3aproteome 3aprotein structure 3anucleocapsid 3aimmunoinformatics 3ascreening 3aglycoproteins 3aenergy 3amodels 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amolecular dynamics 3aimmune response 3aprediction 3adisease diagnosis 3aphosphoproteins 3avaccines 0aNipah virus1 aSharma, D.

We exposed hermit crabs to sublethal concentrations of copper, a common contaminant in coastal ecosystems. When hermit crabs engage in shell fights over empty gastropod shells they adopt two distinct roles. Attackers initiate the fight and perform bouts of vigorous shell fighting, while defenders remain withdrawn into their shells until the encounter is resolved. This role asymmetry means that the two opponents make different strategic decisions during the contest and we utilized an experimental design that allowed us to assess the effect of copper exposure independently on each role. We found that exposure of attackers to copper reduced the number of fights that were initiated, leading to fewer fights in total where the defender was evicted. Of attackers that did fight, those that were exposed to copper were also less likely to evict the defender, but this effect varied with the size difference between the crabs. During the fight, copper exposure caused attackers to rap less vigorously. When defenders were exposed to copper, however, this had no effect on the defender's chance of resisting eviction. Thus, we show for the first time that exposure to a contaminant can alter the outcome of asymmetric contests via differential effects on each of the two roles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3acopper 3acrabs 3aecosystems 3aexperimental design 3ashelling 0aanthropogenic impact 0acopper 0adecision making 0ahermit crab 0aPagurus bernhardus 0apollutant1 aPipe, Richard K.1 aFisher, Andrew1 aBriffa, Mark0 tAnimal behaviour.g2013 Oct., v. 86, no. 4 p.773-781dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013800173300001600311520158500327592002801912650003401940650002101974650002101995650002602016650002902042650002502071650001202096650001802108650002802126650001002154650001602164650002102180650001102201650002302212650002102235650003702256650001402293650001002307650001302317650002102330650002502351651002102376653001702397653001102414653001702425653000902442653003702451653001802488653000902506653000802515653000802523653000702531653000702538653000702545653000802552653000802560700002402568700002702592700001902619700001802638700002602656700001802682700002002700700001602720773010302736856008602839852000902925655001202934IND60625991820221116161248.0190207e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062599182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2018.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUpadhyay, Prabhat10aEvaluation of antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of a novel Himalayan plant Reinwardtia indica dumort: Scientifically unexplored  ap. 326-334.  aReinwardtia indica (Lineceae) is a medicinal plant cultivated in the Himalayan region. It is effectively used in folk medicines for the treatment of various health complications. In the present study, the shade dried leaves and stem were extracted in three different solvents such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, and hydro-alcoholic. The antioxidant efficacy of these extracts was confirmed by using different in vitro assays: DPPH free radical scavenging, superoxide radical scavenging, lipid peroxidation, metal ion chelating capability and reducing power determination. Total phenol content was maximum in hydro alcoholic extract of leaf (540.37 mg per g of gallic acid equivalents) and stem (330.51 mg per g of gallic acid equivalents) while flavonoid content was maximum in ethanolic extract of leaf (305 mg per gram of rutin equivalents) and ethyl acetate extract of stem (170.6 mg per gram of rutin equivalents). The antioxidant activity of these extracts was positively correlated with their total phenol and flavonoid content. Among all tested extracts, ethanolic extract of leaf exhibit maximum zone of inhibition against all tested clinical isolates of bacterial (E. coli 11.00 ± 1.73 mm, P. aeurogenosa 11.67 ± 0.58 mm and S. aureus 10.33 ± 1.53 mm) and fungal (C. albicans 11.33 ± 1.10 mm) pathogens, while ethyl acetate extracts of the leaf and stem showed minimum inhibitory concentration against all tested microorganisms. Thus, R. indica extracts can be used as potent natural antioxidant having antifungal and antibacterial action.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afree radical scavengers 3afungi 3agallic acid 3ain vitro studies 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amedicinal plants 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apathogens 3arutin 3asolvents 3asuperoxide anion 3atraditional medicine 3aHimalayan region 0aAnti-oxidant 0aPhenol 0aFree radical 0aDPPH 0aMinimum inhibitory concentration 0aAntibacterial 0aDPPH 0aMIC 0aLPO 0aRP 0aTF 0aTP 0aMDA 0aROS1 aMishra, Sunil Kumar1 aMishra, Awadhesh Kumar1 aKumar, Pradeep1 aPandey, Nidhi1 aTiwari, Kavindra Nath1 aTilak, Ragini1 aPurohit, Suresh1 aDubey, G.P.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2019 Feb., v. 127 p.326-334dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006600156300001600222520132200238592002801560650003401588650002001622650001201642650001601654650001301670650001301683650001201696650001901708650001301727650001501740650000901755650001701764650001001781650002701791650001901818650001201837650001501849650001401864650001201878650001401890650001401904653000801918653001901926653002401945653001601969653002201985700002102007700001802028700001902046700002102065773010502086856007302191852000902264655001202273IND60515593320221122234735.0160316e20120620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051559332DNAL7 a10.1139/b2012-0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkof, Suzana10aPloidy and sex expression in monoecious hop (Humulus lupulus)  ap. 617-626.  aHumulus lupulus L. is a dioecious perennial plant, cultivated for its female inflorescences. Spontaneously arising monoecious hop plants, carrying male and female flower types on a specific plant, occasionally occur in the progeny of certain hop crosses. We assessed the ploidy of 58 monoecious plants, progenies of various crosses of diploid parents, to provide additional data on hop monoeciousy. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that a high percentage (41.4%) were triploid. An inheritance analysis of parental alleles using six codominant SSR markers demonstrated a primarily paternal origin (84.2%) of unreduced gametes as the cause of triploidy in monoecious plants. All triploids had predominantly male flowers with a few female cones; this phenotype was found only within this ploidy group. All other monoecious plants were diploid, except for one genotype with the highest nuclear DNA content, which showed an aneuploidic number of chromosomes (21). Male hops showed the lowest nuclear DNA amount, as measured by DAPI and propidium iodide fluorochromes. The estimated AT frequency placed hop among species with a high AT content, which was slightly higher in male than in female plants (63.0% vs. 62.5%). The results are discussed in relation to the occurance of ploidy and sex expression in monoecious hop.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aHumulus lupulus 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3acrossing 3adiploidy 3afemales 3aflow cytometry 3agenotype 3agerm cells 3ahops 3amale flowers 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anuclear genome 3aparents 3aperennials 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3apropidium 3atriploidy 0ahop 0aflow cytometry 0anuclear DNA content 0aSSR markers 0aunreduced gametes1 aCerenak, Andreja1 aJakse, Jernej1 aBohanec, Borut1 aJavornik, Branka0 tBotany.g2012 June 20, v. 90, no. 7 p.617-626dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b2012-0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245012900215300001600344506007600360520139600436592002801832506003701860650003301897650001601930650002901946650001301975650002201988650001502010650001602025650001202041650001802053650002502071650002702096650002302123650001102146700002302157700002202180700003202202773011202234856008102346852000902427655001202436IND60575789420221207073620.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057578942DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-016-2484-52doi7 aPMC53342192pmcid7 a282986752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoñi, María Gabriela10aLactic acid as potential substitute of acetic acid for dissolution of chitosan: preharvest application to Butterhead lettuce  ap. 620-626.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChitosan must be dissolved in acid solution to activate its antimicrobial properties. The objectives of present study were to determine whether acetic and lactic acids used to dissolve chitosan would influence its effectiveness to control the native microflora of Butterhead lettuce at harvest and during postharvest storage (7–8 °C, 5 days). Chitosan was applied as a SINGLE DOSE (14, 10, 7, 3 or 0 days previous to harvest) or in SUCCESSIVE DOSES (at 14 + 10 + 7+3 + 0 days prior to harvest). Although chitosan in acetic acid showed antimicrobial activity, treated plants showed dried brown stains which significantly reduced sensorial quality. Chitosan in lactic acid applied in a SINGLE DOSE at harvest or in SUCCESSIVE DOSES reduced microbial counts of all populations at harvest without affecting sensorial quality. After postharvest storage, lettuce treated with SUCCESSIVE APPLICATIONS of chitosan in lactic acid presented significant reductions in the microbial populations compared with untreated sample (−2.02 log in yeast and molds, −1.83 log in total coliforms, −1.4 log CFU g⁻¹ in mesophilic bacteria and −1.1 log in psychrophilic bacteria). In conclusion, replacement of acetic by lactic acid did not affect the antimicrobial activity of chitosan, reducing microbial counts at harvest and after postharvest storage without affecting sensorial quality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactuca sativa var. capitata 3aacetic acid 3aantimicrobial properties 3achitosan 3acoliform bacteria 3aharvesting 3alactic acid 3alettuce 3amolds (fungi) 3apreharvest treatment 3apsychrophilic bacteria 3asensory properties 3ayeasts1 aTomadoni, Bárbara1 aRoura, Sara Inés1 aMoreira, María del Rosario0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2017 Mar., v. 54, no. 3 p.620-626dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-016-2484-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245012200158300001400280520120300294592002801497650002501525650001101550650001201561651001001573653002501583653003301608653002301641653002101664653002901685653001001714700002401724700002401748700002101772773014101793856007801934852000902012655001202021IND60480820520221118051452.0200117e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048082052DNAL7 a10.3920/JCNS2010.x1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jiqin14aThe moderating role of competitive strategy in relating firm performance to quality management and government support  ap. 59-76.  aOne of the main concerns in companies is quality management and its relationship to firm performance. Recently a growing interest in research is the important role of the business environment in the competitive strategy choices of companies. By proposing a conceptual framework for a general model that explains the quality management practices-firm performance link and the business environment-firm performance link, we test the moderating role of competitive strategy in the two links empirically. A survey was conducted of 229 pork-processing firms in the emerging economy of China. We find that specific quality management practices contributing to higher performance include in-company quality management, supplier quality management, employee involvement in quality management and process management, while quality design and customer quality management are not included. Findings also indicate that the business environment (government support in our research) has a positive relationship to firm performance. Competitive strategy only strengthens the relationship between firm performance and quality design, process management, supplier quality management and customer quality management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3amodels 3asurveys 3aChina 0acompetitive strategy 0aquality management practices 0agovernment support 0afirm performance 0apork processing industry 0aChina1 aOmta, S.W.F.

Rooting occurred on a half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing indole-3-butyric acid. The rooted plants were acclimatized and transferred to field conditions. The genetic fidelity of the regenerated plants was confirmed using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. An Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation protocol was developed for Terminalia by varying several factors which influence T-DNA delivery.

The obtained Au@C-Co₃O₄ possessed hierarchically porous structure, abundant active sites, excellent conductivity, and durability, all of which can significantly improve the analysis performance of the biosensor. Meanwhile, the fabricated electrode based on the porous Au@C-Co₃O₄ showed remarkable electrocatalytic performance towards H₂O₂ with a limit of detection of 19 nM and ultra-high sensitivity of 7553 μA mM⁻¹ cm⁻², even when the Au content in the composite was as low as 0.85 wt%. This novel biosensor was successfully used to monitor H₂O₂ concentration released from living cells, and the results can be used to identify cancer cells, thus advancing the use of transition metal oxides in the field of biosensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3acobalt oxide 3adetection limit 3adurability 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3apyrolysis 0aCo3O4 0aAu nanoparticles 0aNonenzymatic biosensor 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aLiving cells1 aChen, Yonglei1 aNiu, Xiaoying1 aPan, Congjie1 aChen, Hongli,1 aChen, Xingguo0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Oct. 30, v. 118 p.36-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03982naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245007900179520229800258592002802556650003002584650001502614650001302629650003002642650001202672650001402684650001302698650001502711650001902726650002102745650001302766650001502779650001102794650001402805650002202819650001002841650001302851650002302864651001102887653002602898653002802924653001602952700003902968700004203007700004503049700003603094700003403130700002603164700002803190773011603218856008503334852000903419655001203428IND60748296420221118035326.0211123e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074829642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1196452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordeiro, Natielle Gomes14aThe role of environmental filters in Brazilian savanna vegetation dynamics  aClimate, topography and edaphic characteristics are important factors for plant community dynamics when considering spatial and temporal scales. Efforts on vegetation dynamics in tropical regions are mostly focused on forests, with far less attention dedicated to open vegetation ecosystems. This study aimed to understand how demographic rates (based on models and maps) are affected by climate, soil and terrain variables in the Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado, which is a hotspot for the world biodiversity conservation. To do so, we used forest inventory data collected from 354 plots (10 × 100 m) distributed in the savanna of Minas Gerais State, southeast of Brazil, in the years of 2005–2006 and 2010–2011. Next, we calculated the rates of mortality, recruitment, net change in number of individuals, basal area loss and gain, and net change in basal area for the plots. We used the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to model the demographic rates in function of climate, soil and terrain variables obtained from the WorldClim 2, Harmonized World Soil Database and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), respectively. The models presented good performance with coefficient of determination (R²) values ranging from 0.68 to 0.84, mean absolute error (MAE) between 0.32 and 0.96%.year⁻¹, and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 60 a 160%. The recruitment was higher than mortality, and the basal area gain was greater than the basal area loss, resulting in positive net change rates. The most important variables for the model and best predictors of vegetation dynamics rates of Brazilian savanna were the terrain variables, since they encompass characteristics such as soil water content, erosion, altitudes and slope. We showed that the gain in number of individuals and basal area were greater at low regions, that is, near drainage lines and with higher humidity. The losses in number of individuals and basal area were higher in boundary regions of the savanna vegetation, that is, regions of higher altitude and consequently, low humidity. Therefore, our findings provide support for conservation and management strategies of the biome, since from the vegetation dynamics drivers identification, we may identify priority areas as well as the vegetation vulnerability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity conservation 3acerrado 3adatabases 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3aforest ecology 3aforest inventory 3ahumidity 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amortality 3aplant communities 3aradar 3asavannas 3asoil water content 3aBrazil 0aEnvironment variables 0aRandom Forest algorithm 0aRecruitment1 aPereira, Kelly Marianne Guimarães1 aTerra, Marcela de Castro Nunes Santos1 aSilveira, Eduarda Martiniano de Oliveira1 aOliveira, Ivy Mayara Sanches de1 aAcerbi Júnior, Fausto Weimar1 avan den Berg, Eduardo1 aMello, José Márcio de0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 500 p.119645-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1196453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013100161300001600292520156900308592002801877650001201905650001101917650001601928650001201944650001201956650001101968650002001979650001001999650001102009650001902020650001902039650002202058650001102080650001102091650001702102650001302119651001902132700002602151700002802177700002202205700001802227773011902245856007402364852000902438655001202447IND60137934120221120050448.0150525e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013793412DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.120852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarbuzov, Mihail10aPublic approval plus more wildlife: twin benefits of reduced mowing of amenity grass in a suburban public park in Saltdean, UK  ap. 107-119.  aWe examined the effects of reduced mowing on wildflower bloom and flower‐visiting insects in the Saltdean Oval, a 6 ha suburban public park in Saltdean, UK. In 2012, a novel management regime was initiated in which approximately half the grass area was left uncut, with the plan being to mow it once per year in autumn. In spring 2013, we set up four blocks, with each block subdivided into four 30 × 5 m strips treated under different mowing regimes: (a) regular mowing every 2 weeks all spring and summer, (b) regular mowing until 2 June, (c) regular mowing until 5 July, and (d) no mowing. The abundance of both flowers and flower‐visiting insects increased significantly with reduced mowing, being ca. 3 and 5 times greater in (d) than (a), respectively, with (b) and (c) intermediate. Mowing intensity, however, had a weak effect on wildflower species richness, which was only lower in (a). A 1 km bee, butterfly, and moth transect walk, 500 m within the long grass part of the park and 500 m within the short, recorded ca. 50× greater insect abundance in the long grass. A questionnaire of public opinion found that 97% of park visitors favoured encouraging insects and wildflowers. In terms of enjoyment of the park, 26% said that it had increased, 64% said that it stayed the same, and 10% said that it decreased. These results present an encouraging example of a potential win–win situation in urban land management change, where the interests of humans and wildlife are aligned, thereby making the goals of conservation easier to achieve.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aautumn 3abutterflies 3aflowers 3agrasses 3ahumans 3aland management 3amoths 3amowing 3apublic opinion 3aquestionnaires 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asummer 3awild flowers 3awildlife 3aUnited Kingdom1 aFensome, Katherine A.1 aRatnieks, Francis L.

These interactions have typically been investigated by comparisons between fasted and sated individuals. In this study, temporal changes in implicit attention to food were assessed in relation to natural, spontaneous changes in appetite occurring before and after an anticipated midday meal. Non-fasted adults performed an emotional blink of attention (EBA) task at intervals, before and after consuming preferred, pre-selected sandwiches to satiety. Participants were required to detect targets within a rapid visual stream, presented after task-irrelevant food (preferred or non-preferred sandwiches, or desserts) or non-food distractor images. All categories of food distractor preferentially captured attention even when appetite levels were low, but became more distracting as appetite increased preprandially, reducing task accuracy maximally as hunger peaked before lunch. Postprandially, attentional capture was markedly reduced for images of the specific sandwich type consumed and, to a lesser extent, for images of other sandwich types that had not been eaten. Attentional capture by images of desserts was unaffected by satiation. These findings support an important role of selective visual attention in the guidance of motivated behaviour. Naturalistic, meal-related changes in appetite are accompanied by changes in implicit attention to visual food stimuli that are easily detected using the EBA paradigm. Preprandial enhancement of attention capture by food cues likely reflects increases in the incentive motivational value of all food stimuli, perhaps providing an implicit index of wanting. Postprandial EBA responses confirm that satiation on a particular food results in relative inattention to that food, supporting an important attentional component in the operation of sensory-specific satiety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3adesserts 3ahunger 3alunch 3amotivation 3asatiety 3astreams 3atemporal variation 0aHunger 0aSatiation 0aMotivation 0aCognition 0aAttentional bias1 aGiesbrecht, Timo1 aThomas, Anna M.1 aKirkham, Tim C.0 tAppetite.g2018 June 01, v. 125 p.24-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001600172245012200188300001600310500001500326520120700341592002801548650002101576650002901597650001301626650001101639650002501650650001101675650001801686650001801704650001501722650002701737650003401764650003801798650004601836650002201882650003301904650003501937650005301972653001802025700001602043700001902059700001202078700001502090700001602105700001502121773008302136856008902219852000902308655001202317IND4466498320221118030439.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446649832DNAL7 a222450772pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Linlin10aRemoval of silver nanoparticles in simulated wastewater treatment processes and its impact on COD and NH₄ reduction  ap. 248-252.  a2019-12-06  aThe increasing utilization of silver nanoparticles in industrial and consumer products has raised concern to wastewater treatment utilities due to its antimicrobial activity. In this work, the removal of citrate stabilized silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) during the wastewater treatment processes and its impact on treatment performance were examined. During simulated primary clarification, over 90% of the Ag-NPs remained in the wastewater, indicating that the majority of silver nanoparticles in sewage would enter the subsequent treatment units. During sequencing batch reactor processes, silver nanoparticles were effectively removed in each cycle throughout the 15-d experimental duration. Continuous input of silver nanoparticles into the wastewater did not significantly alter chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. NH₄ removal was reduced at the beginning of the SBR experiment but quickly recovered at the later stage of the experiment. This study demonstrated that in the near future it is unlikely that citrate-stabilized Ag-NPs released into sewage will cause significant adversary effects on the COD and NH₄ removal of activated sludge processes in municipal wastewater treatment plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aantimicrobial properties 3acitrates 3asewage 3awastewater treatment 3asilver 3abatch systems 3ananoparticles 3awastewater 3achemical oxygen demand 2aAmmoniaxanalysisxchemistry. 2aBiological Oxygen Demand Analysis 2aMetal Nanoparticlesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSewagexchemistry 2aSilverxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 0aclarification1 aLi, Kaiyang1 aDing, Yuanzhao1 aLi, Yan1 aChen, Jian1 aWu, Xiaolei1 aLi, Xiqing0 tChemosphere.g2012 Apr., v. 87, no. 3 p.248-252dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013200170300001400302520181800316592002802134650001902162650002102181650002002202650001502222650002202237650001302259650001502272650001802287650001502305650001102320650001402331650000902345650001502354650002202369650001902391653000802410653000802418653000702426653000802433653000902441653000902450653000702459653000802466653000702474653001002481653000702491653001002498653000802508700005802516700002702574700001602601700002002617773009302637856008402730852000902814655001202823IND60592681720221116214257.0190401e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059268172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Tamara R.10aChanges in eating behavior and plasma leptin in children with obesity participating in a family-centered lifestyle intervention  ap. 81-89.  aThe goal of childhood obesity lifestyle interventions are to positively change body composition, however it is unknown if interventions also modulate factors that are related to energy intake. This study aimed to examine changes in eating behaviors and plasma leptin concentrations in overweight and obese children participating in a 1-year family-centered lifestyle intervention. Interventions were based on Canadian diet and physical activity (PA) guidelines. Children were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: Control (Ctrl; no intervention), Standard treatment (StnTx: 2 servings milk and alternatives/day (d), 3x/wk weight-bearing PA), or Modified treatment (ModTx: 4 servings milk and alternatives/day; daily weight-bearing PA). Study visits occurred every 3-months for 1-y; interventions were held once a month for 6-months with one follow-up visit at 8-months. Ctrl received counselling after 1-y. Caregivers completed the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) and reported on diet and activity. Plasma leptin were measured from morning fasted blood samples. Seventy-eight children (mean age 7.8 ± 0.8 y; mean BMI 24.4 ± 3.3 kg/m2) participated; 94% completed the study. Compared to baseline, at 6-months StnTx reduced Emotional Overeating and Desire to Drink scores (p < 0.05) while Food Responsiveness scores were reduced in both StnTx and ModTx (p < 0.05). At 1-year, scores for Desire to Drink in StnTx remained reduced compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Plasma leptin concentrations were significantly lower in ModTx at 6-months compared to baseline (p < 0.05). This study resulted in intervention groups favorably changing eating behaviors, supporting the use family-centered lifestyle interventions using Canadian diet and PA recommendations for children with obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3acaregivers 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acounseling 3aenergy intake 3aguidelines 3aleptin 3alifestyle 3amilk 3aovereating 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 0aBAZ 0a%BF 0aBL 0aBMI 0aCEBQ 0aCtrl 0aFM 0aFMI 0aLM 0aModTx 0aPA 0aStnTx 0a%Δ1 aHazell, Tom J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8135-45181 aVanstone, Catherine A.1 aRodd, Celia1 aWeiler, Hope A.0 tAppetite.g2018 June 01, v. 125 p.81-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245009500209500001900304506007600323520148800399592002801887506003701915650002201952650001301974650001101987650001601998650000902014650001302023650001902036650001202055650001302067650001302080650001202093653002702105700003002132700001902162700001902181773009302200856008502293852000902378655001202387IND60690841920221207123550.0200508e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069084192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e012112doi7 aPMC63656202pmcid7 a308399312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilbas, B.S.10aLaser processing of Ti6Al4V alloy: wetting state of surface and environmental dust effects  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLaser processing of Ti6Al4V alloy surface, via repetitive pulses, is realized incorporating the nitrogen assisting gas. The texture characteristics of the surface and wetting state are analyzed. The free energy of the laser treated surface is estimated. The influence of the dust particles on the treated and untreated surfaces is examined. The solution formed due to water condensate on the dust particles is evaluated. The adhesion of the mud dried solution on the treated and untreated surfaces is assessed through determining the tangential force required for the removal of the solution from the surface. The findings demonstrate that the high power laser repetitive pulse heating results in formation of the hieratically distributed micro/nano pillars on the workpiece surface. The wetting state of the processed surface remains hydrophilic because of the large gap size between the micro/nano pillars. The free energy of the laser textured surface is similar to that obtained for the TiN coated surfaces, which is because of the nitride compounds developed during the processing. The dried liquid solution strongly adheres at the surface and the force needed for removing the dried liquid solution is almost four times of the friction force at the surface. The liquid solution gives rise to locally scattered shallow pit sites on as received surface. This phenomenon does not occur for the laser treated surface, which is related to the passive layer developed on the surface.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGibbs free energy 3aadhesion 3aalloys 3acondensates 3adust 3afriction 3ahydrophilicity 3aliquids 3anitrides 3anitrogen 3atexture 0aMechanical engineering1 aCauhdarī, Hādī ʻAlī,1 aAl-Sharafi, A.1 aAl-Qahtani, H.0 tHeliyon.g2019 Feb., v. 5, no. 2 p.e01211-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e012113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013400163300001600297520080500313592002801118650001001146650001201156650001801168650001001186650001601196650001601212700002201228700002701250700002101277700002401298700002101322773011901343856007401462852000901536655001201545IND60137934520221120054025.0150525e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013793452DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.120952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheffield, Cory S.13aAn artificial nesting substrate for Osmia species that nest under stones, with focus on Osmia inermis (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)  ap. 189-192.  aSeveral megachilid bees are excellent crop pollinators, and many species show potential for management as they nest in pre‐existing cavities in artificial substrates. Some species, particularly in the Osmiini, however, have nesting habits not conducive to conventional trap‐nesting. Here we report on an artificial nest for species of Osmia bees which normally build nests on the underside of stones. The Holarctic species Osmia inermis accepted overturned terracotta saucers as nesting sites, with 10% of the saucers occupied in the fall of 2011. These saucers are inexpensive and available in many sizes, facilitating further scientific study of this, and other species. Implications of using artificial nests for managing this bee for crop pollination, and for its conservation, are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOsmia 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3apollination 3apollinators1 aWilkes, Margie A.1 aChristopher Cutler, G.1 aHermanutz, Luise1 aSchonrogge, Karsten1 aPacker, Laurence0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2015 Mar., v. 8, no. 2 p.189-192dRoyal Entomological Societyx1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.120953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245016800151300001600319500002000335520188200355592002802237596005902265596005902324596005202383596005202435596005102487650001002538650001502548650001602563650001002579650002402589650001202613650001002625650001802635650001302653650002002666650001302686650002302699650001002722650001202732650002102744650001202765650001702777650001202794700001102806700001202817700001102829700001302840700001102853700001302864700005102877773013202928856007303060852000903133655001203142IND60681308220221119231405.0200115e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068130822DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.144942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, K.10aEffects of dietary calcium pyruvate on gastrointestinal tract development, intestinal health and growth performance of newly weaned piglets fed low‐protein diets  ap. 355-365.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: This study was carried out to investigate the effects of dietary calcium pyruvate supplementation on growth performance and intestinal health of weaned piglets fed low‐protein diets. METHODS AND RESULTS: After a 7‐day adaptation period, 60 individually housed piglets (Duroc × Yorkshire‐Landrace) weaned at 28 days of age were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments (20 pigs/treatment) for 28 days: control diet (20·0% crude protein [CP]), low‐protein diet (15·5% CP), and experimental (15·5% CP + 1·8% calcium pyruvate). At the end of the experiment, six piglets from each diet group were slaughtered and blood and tissue samples were collected. Compared with the control group, feeding piglets with 15·5% CP decreased the daily body weight gain; lengths of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum; and weights of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum (P < 0·05), while 15·5% CP + 1·8% calcium pyruvate supplementation removed those differences (P > 0·05). Compared with the control group, the diarrhoea incidence and relative richness of Firmicutes in the colon contents of piglets in both the 15·5% CP and 15·5% CP + 1·8% calcium pyruvate groups was decreased. The relative richness of Bacteriodetes in the colon contents of piglets was higher in the 15·5% CP + 1·8% calcium pyruvate group than in the control and 15·5% CP groups (P < 0·05). CONCLUSION: Calcium pyruvate supplementation for four weeks removed the negative effects of a low‐protein diet on the gastrointestinal tract development and daily body weight gain of weaned piglets. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study showed that supplementing a low‐protein diet with calcium pyruvate, an effective alternative metabolic fuel to amino acids, was beneficial in improving the intestinal health and maximizing the growth of newly weaned piglets.  aPublisher supplied data  a31872370cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31772610cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0500504cNational Science and Technology  a2018YFD0501000cNational Science and Technology  acstc2018jcyjAX0025cNatural Science Foundation 3aDuroc 3aFirmicutes 3aamino acids 3ablood 3abody weight changes 3acalcium 3acolon 3acrude protein 3adiarrhea 3adietary calcium 3aduodenum 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3ajejunum 3alow protein diet 3apiglets 3apyruvic acid 3astomach1 aLi, Y.1 aSun, W.1 aAn, R.1 aTang, Z.1 aWu, L.1 aChen, H.1 aSun, Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3839-037X0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 Feb., v. 128, no. 2 p.355-365dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.144943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04865naa a2201141 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016300169520202800332592002802360650001802388650002102406650001202427650001502439650001002454650001402464650001002478650001402488650002202502650001702524650001802541650001002559650001202569650001202581650002102593650001402614650001202628650001602640650006302656650001102719650003302730650001202763650001402775650001202789653001002801653000802811653000902819653000902828653000802837653000802845653000802853653000902861653000902870653000902879653000902888653000802897653000802905653000702913653000702920653000902927653000802936653000902944653000802953653000802961653000802969653000902977653001302986653000802999653000803007653001103015653001103026653001303037653000803050653001203058653000803070653002303078653002203101653002503123700001703148700001103165700001803176700001503194700001803209700001703227700001603244700001603260700001703276700001503293700001303308700001803321700001603339700001303355700001403368700001303382700001203395700001503407700001603422700005403438700001803492773010703510856008503617852000903702655001203711IND60748296820221118035451.0210911e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074829682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1092152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Senzhao10aN130, N175 and N207 are N-linked glycosylation sites of duck Tembusu virus NS1 that are important for viral multiplication, viremia and virulence in ducklings  aDuck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has caused acute egg-drop syndrome in egg-laying ducks. DTMUV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) contains three potential predicted N-linked glycosylation sites at residues 130, 175 and 207. In this study, we found that mutations at these sites affect the molecular weight of recombinant NS1, as assessed by western blot assays; however, the mutations do not affect their subcellular localization in the cytoplasm, as assessed by colocalization assays. Four recombinant viruses substituting the asparagine (N) residues at N130, N175, N207 or N130/N175/N207 of NS1 with alanine (A) residues were generated using rDTMUV-i, an infectious cDNA clone of the DTMUV CQW1 strain. Deglycosylation assays of the mutant virus NS1 were performed using endoglycosidases Endo H or PNGase F treatment in both mammalian and avian cells. The NS1-WT, NS1-N130A, NS1-N175A and NS1-N207A showed a shift in migration to 37 kDa after digestion with both endoglycosidases, which further confirmed that N130, N175 and N207 were the glycosylation sites of DTMUV NS1. Compared to the parental rDTMUV, the single mutants impaired viral multiplication in vitro, while the nonglycosylated virus rDTMUV-NS1-N130A/N175A/N207A showed a 5-fold to 178-fold decrease in viral titers and smaller plaque sizes. Notably, all mutant viruses were still highly virulent to duck embryos, but the embryos inoculated with rDTMUV-NS1-N130A/N175A/N207A started to die on the fourth day, which exhibited a prolonged time to death compared to that of rDTMUV. Moreover, rDTMUV-NS1-N130A/N175A/N207A was attenuated in vivo, showing no mortality and producing significantly lower viral titers in heart, spleen, kidney, brain and thymus as well as 2-fold to 3-fold lower viremia at 3 and 5 days post infection. Overall, our results indicated that N130, N175 and N207 are N-linked glycosylation sites of DTMUV NS1, which play crucial roles in viral multiplication, viremia and virulence in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTembusu virus 3aWestern blotting 3aalanine 3aasparagine 3abrain 3acytoplasm 3adeath 3adigestion 3aegg drop syndrome 3aglycosidases 3aglycosylation 3aheart 3akidneys 3amammals 3amolecular weight 3amortality 3amutants 3aoviposition 3apeptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase 3aspleen 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3aviremia 3avirulence 3aviruses 0aDTMUV 0aNS1 0aDENV 0aZIKV 0aJEV 0aYFV 0aWNV 0aUSUV 0aMVEV 0aSLEV 0aTBEV 0aLIV 0aORF 0aER 0aMW 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aNBCS 0aIFA 0amAb 0aBSA 0aDAPI 0aSDS-PAGE 0aHRP 0aCPE 0aTCID50 0aEndo H 0aPNGase F 0aSPF 0aRT-qPCR 0aPFU 0aDuck Tembusu virus 0aNS1 glycosylation 0aViral multiplication1 aWang, Xiaoli1 aHe, Yu1 aNiuyuetaohua,1 aGuo, Jiaqi1 aWang, Mingshu1 aJia, Renyong1 aZhu, Dekang1 aLiu, Mafeng1 aZhao, Xinxin1 aYang, Qiao1 aWu, Ying1 aZhang, Shaqiu1 aHuang, Juan1 aMao, Sai1 aOu, Xumin1 aGao, Qun1 aSun, Di1 aLiu, Yunya1 aZhang, Ling1 aChen, Shun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7488-10371 aCheng, Anchun0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2021 Oct., v. 261 p.109215-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1092153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245018300208506007600391520082400467592002801291506003701319650002301356650002301379650001801402650001901420650002001439650001201459650003101471650002201502650003301524650001801557650001401575653007501589653004401664653004001708653001401748653003901762700001701801700001501818700001501833700001601848700001501864700001801879700001901897700001501916700001401931700001701945700001301962700001201975700002101987773011002008856008502118852000902203655001202212IND60682222920221207125512.0200318e20200319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068222292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1516352doi7 aPMC70620352pmcid7 a321533062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiahui10aRadiosynthesis and preliminary evaluation of 11C-labeled 4-cyclopropyl-7-(3-methoxyphenoxy)-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[e] [1,2,4] thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide for PET imaging AMPA receptors  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) belong to the family of ionotropic transmembrane receptors for glutamate (iGluRs) that are implicated in the pathology of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

Kavi10aDiscovery of putative novel viruses in the transcriptomes of endangered plant species native to India and China  aViruses are abundant entities that infect almost every living organism. In recent years, Next Generation Sequencing coupled with bioinformatic analyses is widely adopted for identification of known and unknown viruses in a plant sample. In the present study, nine putative novel viruses were discovered from public domain transcriptome datasets of five endangered plant species by de novo assembly of reads using CLC and SPAdes followed by BLAST analysis. Of the identified viruses, ten coding-complete and five partial genomic segments were recovered. Based on phylogeny and BLAST analysis, the identified viruses were putatively assigned to various plant viral genera except dactylorhiza hatagirea benylike virus that probably represents a new group of plant virus. The methodology followed can be adopted for the discovery of novel viruses in plant species with little genomic information. Viral genome sequences recovered in the study will serve as a valuable resource for further characterization of identified viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3aendangered species 3agenes 3agenomics 3aindigenous species 3aphylogeny 3atranscriptome 3aviral genome 3aviruses 3aChina 3aIndia 0aaa 0aASbLV 0aASHOKA 0aBCV2 0aCcDPV1 0aCcDPV2 0aCP 0aCPsV 0aDhBLV 0aDhDPV 0aDhOV 0aGBCV 0aGlaMPV 0aGlMV 0aGpPV 0aJTT 0aML 0aMP 0aNCBI 0aNGS 0anr 0ant 0aPeCV 0aRdRp 0aRefSeq 0aSNP 0aSRA 0aStPV 0aTgCV 0aTN 0a+ve ssRNA 0a−ve ssRNA 0aVirus 0aEndangered 0aPlant 0aVirome 0aTranscriptome 0aPublic domain1 aKalaivanan, N.S.1 aBaranwal, V.K.0 tGene.g2021 June 20, v. 786 p.145626-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2021.1456263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245015600155300001600311500002000327520192300347592002802270650002202298650004402320650002202364650002902386650001702415650001002432650003702442650001902479650001402498650001002512650002102522650002402543650001302567650001802580650000702598650003302605650003702638650003702675650001902712700001702731700001702748700002402765700002102789700001402810700002402824700006102848773013202909856007303041852000903114655001203123IND60681308320221119231506.0200115e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068130832DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.144982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmran, B.A.10aNovel mycosynthesis of cobalt oxide nanoparticles using Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404—optimization, characterization and antimicrobial activity  ap. 438-457.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: Investigate the capability of Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 to mycosynthesize Co₃O₄‐NPs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mycelial cell‐free filtrate of A. brasiliensis ATCC 16404 was applied for mycosynthesis of Co₃O₄‐NPs. The preliminary indication for the formation of Co₃O₄‐NPs was the change in colour from yellow to reddish‐brown. One‐factor‐at a time‐optimization technique was applied to determine the optimum physicochemical conditions required for the mycosynthesis of Co₃O₄‐NPs and they were found to be: 72 h for reaction time, pH 11, 30°C, 100 rev min⁻¹ for shaking speed in the darkness using 4 mmol l⁻¹ of CoSO₄.7H₂O and 5·5% of A. brasiliensis dry weight mycelium (w/v). The mycosynthesized Co₃O₄‐NPs were characterized using various techniques: spectroscopy including UV/Vis spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential measurement, energy‐dispersive X‐ray analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X‐ray diffraction; and vibrating sample magnetometry and microscopy including field emission scanning electron microscopy and high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy. Spectroscopic techniques confirmed the formation of Co₃O₄‐NPs and the microscopic ones confirmed the shape and size of the mycosynthesized Co₃O₄‐NPs as quasi‐spherical shaped, monodispersed nanoparticles with a nano size range of 20–27 nm. The mycosynthesized Co₃O₄‐NPs have excellent magnetic properties and exhibited a good antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic micro‐organisms. CONCLUSION: Ferromagnetic Co₃O₄‐NPs with considerable antimicrobial activity were for the first time mycosynthesized. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of fungi as potential bionanofactories for mycosynthesis of nanoparticles is relatively a recent field of research with considerable prospects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantimicrobial properties 3acobalt oxide 3acolor 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aferromagnetism 3afiltrates 3afungi 3alight scattering 3amagnetic properties 3amycelium 3ananoparticles 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential1 aNassar, H.N.1 aYounis, S.A.1 aEl‐Salamony, R.A.1 aFatthallah, N.A.1 aHamdy, A.1 aEl‐Shatoury, E.H.1 aEl‐Gendy, N.Sh.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5154-71240 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 Feb., v. 128, no. 2 p.438-457dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.144983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04553naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016400173300001600337520260600353592002802959650002502987650001103012650002103023650001303044650001603057650001603073650001603089650001903105650001603124650001303140650002503153650001303178650001803191650002403209650001703233650001003250650001003260650002603270650001703296650001503313650001903328650002003347650000903367653001203376653002903388653001603417653002803433700003003461700002603491700002203517700002703539700002003566700002403586700002303610700001603633700002403649700002303673773010103696856008503797852000903882655001203891IND60662975620221122041706.0200210e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066297562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2019.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeza-Herrera, C.A.14aThe Opuntia effect upon the out-of-season embryo implantation rate in goats: Corpus luteal number, corpus luteal diameter and serum progesterone concentrations  ap. 201-206.  aWe evaluated the possible effect of targeted supplementation of protein enriched Opuntia megacantha Salm-Dyck cladodes, the flat leaf-like stem of cactus species, upon corpus luteum number (CLN), corpus luteum diameter (CLD), serum progesterone concentrations (P4) and embryo implantation rate (EIMPL) in anestrous goats exposed to sexually active males. During the non-breeding season (May-Jun, 25°LN), anestrus Alpine-Saanen-Nubian × Criollo adult goats (n = 45) homogeneous regarding live weight (LW, kg) and body condition score (BCS, units) were randomly assigned to the supplement treatments: 1). Protein-enriched Opuntia (PEO;n = 15; 43.8 ± 1.5 kg LW, 2.48 ± 0.10 BCS; 29.8% CP, 2.2 Mcal ME kg⁻¹), 2). Non-enriched Opuntia (NEO; n = 15; 43.8 ± 1.5 kg LW, 2.47 ± 0.10 units BCS; 6.4% CP, 2.1 Mcal ME kg⁻¹), compared with 3). Control (CONT; n = 15; 45.41 ± 1.5 kg LW, 2.54 ± 0.10 units BCS). Both NEO and PEO goats were individually supplemented with cladodes (160 g d⁻¹; 0900–1000 h) and then goats grazed in a marginal rangeland (1000–1800 h). PEO was bio-fortified in a fermentation bioreactor (1% of Scaromices cereveciae, + 1% urea + 0.1% of ammonium sulphate). Three transrectal ultrasonographic scans (US) were performed during the supplement adaptation period (20d) to confirm the goat´s anovulatory status and then (May 20) exposed to males during a 10d breeding period. A 4th-US quantified CLN and CLD 20 d post-male introduction (PMI), while a 5th-US evaluated EIMPL (47 d, PMI); supplementation lasted up to June 30. No differences (P > 0.05) in LW and BCS occurred either at the onset (44.38 ± 1.5 kg, 2.49 ± 0.10 units) or at the end (45.03 ± 1.5 kg, 2.60 ± 0.20 units) of the experiment, neither concerning P4-average (3.73 ± 1.6 ng mL⁻¹) nor related to the treatment x time interaction. Although no differences in the reproductive response (P > 0.05) regarding CLN, CLD and EIMPL occurred in the PEO and NEO, an amplified response (P < 0.05) was observed in the PEO-group compared to the CONT goats [CLN: 1.33, 0.71 & 0.43 ± 0.7 units; CLD: 1.66, 0.92 & 0.61 ± 0.30 mm; and EIMPL: 86, 53 & 18 ± 14%, respectively]. Targeted supplementation with protein-enriched Opuntia cladodes (i.e. the “Opuntia Effect”) during the conception-to-implantation period to anestrous goats exposed to males increased out-of-season reproductive outcomes; this strategy could be potentially important to uphold the sustainability of goat production systems under semiarid conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3aadults 3aammonium sulfate 3aanestrus 3aanovulation 3abioreactors 3ablood serum 3abody condition 3abody weight 3abreeding 3acacti and succulents 3acladodes 3acorpus luteum 3aembryo implantation 3afermentation 3agoats 3amales 3aproduction technology 3aprogesterone 3arangelands 3asemiarid zones 3aultrasonography 3aurea 0aOpuntia 0aTargeted supplementation 0aMale effect 0aReproductive efficiency1 aSantamaría-Estrada, C.E.1 aFlores-Hernández, A.1 aCano-Villegas, O.1 ala Peña, C.

Neves (2007) developed a simple method (CHAINPLAN) to help in the process of developing a strategic plan for a food chain, which has been applied to chains in various countries. The objective of this paper is to report the results of a new application of (part of) this method: to the sugarcane chain in Brazil. As this chain has an important trade association (UNICA – Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association) for coordination of collective actions, the paper focuses on two specific steps: the mapping and quantification of the chain; and the elaboration of the strategic plan. The chain mapping and quantification procedure, which is the second step of the method, quantifies an industry's contribution to the country's GDP, as well as to job creation, tax generation, and the distribution of economic activities. In relation to the sugarcane chain in Brazil, it was found that the sugar-energy sector GDP in 2008 was US$ 28.15 billion, equivalent to 2% of the total Brazilian GDP. The estimated total value of sales of the various links that comprise the sugarcane chain reached US$ 86.8 billion. Completion of step 2 of the CHAINPLAN method allows the chain's agents to conduct a macro-environmental and internal analysis of the chain to identify strategic projects (collective actions) to improve the chain's competitiveness. This step was also carried out on the Brazilian sugarcane chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3abioenergy 3acollective action 3aenergy crops 3aenvironmental factors 3afood chain 3aplanning 3asales 3asugar industry 3asugarcane 3atrade 3aBrazil 0achain mapping 0achain quantification 0achain planning and management 0asugarcane chain1 aTrombin, Vinícius Gustavo,1 aConejero, Marco Antonio0 tJournal on chain and network science.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 10, no. 3 p.193-206dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:21449x1875-09317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/JCNS2010.x1863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012400159300001800283520131600301592002801617650001701645650001701662650002701679650001101706650001501717650001701732650001101749650001901760650001701779650001801796650001501814650003701829650002001866650001101886650000901897650001301906650002001919700002001939700002601959773012301985856007502108852000902183655001202192IND60534853120170613000000.0160803e20130507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053485312DNAL7 a10.1021/es304964b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesalme, Dorine10aChallenges in Tracing the Fate and Effects of Atmospheric Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Deposition in Vascular Plants  ap. 3967-3981.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous organic pollutants that raise environmental concerns because of their toxicity. Their accumulation in vascular plants conditions harmful consequences to human health because of their position in the food chain. Consequently, understanding how atmospheric PAHs are taken up in plant tissues is crucial for risk assessment. In this review we synthesize current knowledge about PAH atmospheric deposition, accumulation in both gymnosperms and angiosperms, mechanisms of transfer, and ecological and physiological effects. PAHs emitted in the atmosphere partition between gas and particulate phases and undergo atmospheric deposition on shoots and soil. Most PAH concentration data from vascular plant leaves suggest that contamination occurs by both direct (air-leaf) and indirect (air-soil-root) pathways. Experimental studies demonstrate that PAHs affect plant growth, interfering with plant carbon allocation and root symbioses. Photosynthesis remains the most studied physiological process affected by PAHs. Among scientific challenges, identifying specific physiological transfer mechanisms and improving the understanding of plant-symbiont interactions in relation to PAH pollution remain pivotal for both fundamental and applied environmental sciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aGymnospermae 3aatmospheric deposition 3acarbon 3afood chain 3ahuman health 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aplant tissues 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk assessment 3ashoots 3asoil 3atoxicity 3avascular plants1 aBinet, Philippe1 aChiapusio, Geneviève0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 May 07, v. 47, no. 9 p.3967-3981dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes304964b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009900158500001400257520130800271592002801579650001901607650002001626650001401646650001501660650002501675650001201700650001101712650001001723650001501733650001601748650002601764650001901790700001701809700001601826700001801842700002301860773012901883856007402012852000902086655001202095IND60715377620221123013105.0201026e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071537762DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122033702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jianming 10aSalient Ship Detection via Background Prior and Foreground Constraint in Remote Sensing Images  aNAL-light  aAutomatic ship detection in complicated maritime background is a challenging task in the field of optical remote sensing image interpretation and analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel and reliable ship detection framework based on a visual saliency model, which can efficiently detect multiple targets of different scales in complex scenes with sea clutter, clouds, wake and islands interferences. Firstly, we present a reliable background prior extraction method adaptive for the random locations of targets by computing boundary probability and then generate a saliency map based on the background prior. Secondly, we compute the prior probability of salient foreground regions and propose a weighting function to constrain false foreground clutter, gaining the foreground-based prediction map. Thirdly, we integrate the two prediction maps and improve the details of the integrated map by a guided filter function and a wake adjustment function, obtaining the fine selection of candidate regions. Afterwards, a classification is further performed to reduce false alarms and produce the final ship detection results. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on two public available datasets demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method against four advanced baseline methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclassification 3adata collection 3adetection 3aextraction 3aimage interpretation 3aislands 3amodels 3apaper 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aquantitative analysis 3aremote sensing1 aZhi, Xiyang 1 aZhang, Wei 1 aRen, Longfei 1 aBruzzone, Lorenzo 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 12, no. 20dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122033703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245012700212500001900339506007600358520133200434592002801766506003701794650002101831650001801852650002001870650002301890650002001913650001101933650001701944650002001961650001001981650001001991653001702001653001802018653001502036700002302051700001802074700002202092700002202114700002002136700005702156773009302213856008502306852000902391655001202400IND60690842120221207124149.0200508e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069084212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e014092doi7 aPMC64511692pmcid7 a309974272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkther, Jobaida10aEstablishing a novel assay system for measuring renin concentration using cost effective recombinant ovine angiotensinogen  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlasma renin can predict future cardiovascular events as well as the prevalence of chronic renal disease in hypertensive subjects. Ovine angiotensinogen (oANG) is a better substrate for measuring renin concentration through activity assay. Recombinant oANG expressed in Escherichia coli cells can be utilized as the substrate while measuring plasma renin. We aim to establish an immunoassay for measuring renin concentration at picomolar level using recombinant oANG.Recombinant oANG was expressed in E. coli cells and purified to homogeneity. Various concentrations (0–1.5 pM) of recombinant human renin standard were prepared and incubated with recombinant oANG. Renin activity was determined by angiotensin-I specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.About 4.5 mg of purified recombinant oANG was obtained from 0.5 L of E. coli culture. The Michaelis constant and turnover number of human renin with recombinant oANG were 0.16 μM and 0.51 s⁻¹, respectively. A linear relationship was obtained when renin activity was plotted as a function of renin concentration using recombinant oANG as the renin substrate. Picomolar amounts of renin can be measured from known renin activity using this method.This study established a novel assay system for measuring renin at picomolar level using cost effective recombinant oANG.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aangiotensin I 3aangiotensinogen 3acost effectiveness 3aenzyme kinetics 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3akidney diseases 3arenin 3asheep 0aBiochemistry 0aBiotechnology 0aImmunology1 aNabi, A.H.M.

This study investigates whether obesity in childhood and adolescence is already associated with altered GMA, and whether an inpatient weight loss program affects GMA. Sixty children with obesity (OBE) and 27 normal-weight children (NW) (12.9 &plusmn; 1.7 years; 51% female) were compared for their GMA at rest, after a stress test, and after a drink-to-full water load test. A continuous electrogastrogram (EGG) was recorded and analyzed with respect to gastric slow waves and tachygastric activity. OBE were examined upon admission (T1) and before discharge (T2) following an inpatient weight loss program; NW served as control group. Compared to NW, children with obesity showed flattened GMA as indicated by lower tachygastric reactivity after stress and water load test at T1. Data of OBE did not differ between T1 and T2. EGG parameters were associated neither with sex, age, and BMI nor with subjective stress and food intake. Children with obesity show impaired gastric myoelectrical reactivity in response to a stress and water load test compared to normal-weight controls, which does not change during an inpatient weight loss program.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acomorbidity 3adigestive system diseases 3afemales 3afood intake 3aweight loss1 aSauer, Helene1 aHoring, Bjoern1 aValitutti, Francesco1 aMazurak, Nazar1 aZipfel, Stephan1 aStengel, Andreas1 aEnck, P.,1 aMack, Isabelle0 tNutrients.g2018 May 31, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100606993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009400166300001600260520154300276592002801819650002501847650001401872650001101886650002901897650002601926650001001952650001301962650001301975650002101988650001502009650001302024650001102037650002202048650001802070650001402088650001802102700002002120700002402140700002202164700002102186773011802207856007402325852000902399655001202408IND60137934820221120063208.0150525e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013793482DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.120992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKietzka, Gabriella J.10aLandscape ecological networks are successful in supporting a diverse dragonfly assemblage  ap. 229-237.  aEcological networks (ENs) are able to mitigate the negative effects of commercial forestry on terrestrial biodiversity, yet this remains untested for the aquatic fauna. Understanding the anthropogenic and natural variables that drive dragonfly diversity at the landscape and habitat scales, allows the design and implementation of ENs that minimise biodiversity loss across production landscapes. Here, we determine the relative contribution of anthropogenic disturbances and natural environmental variables to dragonfly assemblages within ENs. Sixty sites, of various freshwater body types, were sampled for adult dragonflies across ENs in a commercial forestry landscape. Overall, species richness was significantly influenced by river width, water turbidity, water depth and the presence of invasive plants. Nevertheless, overall species composition was influenced by water body type, flow rate and substrate type. Further differences were found when analyses were conducted separately for Anisoptera and Zygoptera. Counter‐intuitively, anthropogenic disturbances had less effect on dragonfly species richness and composition than did natural environmental variables, emphasising the importance of conserving natural heterogeneity. Overall, dragonfly diversity can be successfully conserved in ENs provided that conservation planning incorporates appropriate local scale variables. These results also suggest that impacts on water quality and dragonfly diversity are minimised by well‐designed ENs within this production landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aZygoptera 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3aforestry 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3asurface water 3aturbidity 3awater quality1 aPryke, James S.1 aSamways, Michael J.1 aLeather, Simon R.1 aSahlén, Göran,0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2015 May, v. 8, no. 3 p.229-237dRoyal Entomological Societyx1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.120993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245012300203300001600326500001900342520148500361592002801846596003301874650002501907650002701932650002601959650002001985650001602005650002002021650001602041650001402057650002002071650001702091650002802108650001102136650001402147650000702161650001502168650001502183650001702198650001502215650001402230700002202244700001702266700001602283773011802299856008202417852000902499655001202508IND60676495420221120021616.0191119e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067649542DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-019-00687-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagci, Ufuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1511-246510aProbiotic characteristics of bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from human milk and colostrum  ap. 735-750.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs potential probiotic traits of human milk-isolated bacteria have increasingly been recognized, this study aimed to evaluate the probiotic properties of bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from human milk and colostrum. Among 118 human milk- and colostrum-isolated lactic cocci, only 29 were identified as Enterococcus. Of these, only four Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibited bacteriocigenic activity against several pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes. These isolates exhibited high acid (up to pH 3.0) and bile tolerance (0.5% oxgall) in simulated gastrointestinal conditions, demonstrating their ability to survive through the upper gastrointestinal tract. All of the E. faecium strains were shown to be sensitive to most of the antibiotics including vancomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin, and erythromycin, while they were resistant to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. None of the strains showed any virulence (gelE, agg2, clyA, clyB, clyM) and antibiotic resistance genes (vanA, vanB, ermB, tetM, and aac(6′)-le-aph(2″)-la). In addition, all the strains were able to assimilate cholesterol, ranging between 25.2–64.1% and they exhibited variable adherence (19–36%) to Caco-2 cells. Based on the overall results of this in vitro study, four of the E. faecium strains isolated from human milk and colostrum can be considered as promising probiotic candidates; however, further in vivo evaluations are required.  aPublisher supplied data  a4753cHacettepe ?niversitesi 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aantibiotic resistance 3abile resistance 3abreast milk 3achloramphenicol 3acholesterol 3acolostrum 3adigestive tract 3aerythromycin 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3akanamycin 3apH 3aprobiotics 3arifampicin 3atetracycline 3avancomycin 3avirulence1 aOzmen Togay, Sine1 aTemiz, Ayhan1 aAy, Mustafa0 tFolia microbiologica.g2019 Nov., v. 64, no. 6 p.735-750dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl18090x0015-56327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-019-00687-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04205naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245009600206300001400302520209100316592002802407650003202435650002202467650001302489650002702502650002402529650002502553650002602578650001802604650002602622650001602648650001602664650002602680650001502706650001202721650001902733650000902752650002502761651001302786653002802799653001102827653001502838653002302853653002802876653001902904653000802923653000802931653000802939653000802947653000802955653000802963653000702971653000702978653000802985653000802993653000803001653000803009653000903017653000803026653000803034653000703042700001903049700002803068700006303096700006103159700002703220773010703247856008403354852000903438655001203447IND60592682020221116214520.0190401e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059268202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wai Yew1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6829-852610aParent-child feeding practices in a developing country: Findings from the Family Diet Study  ap. 90-97.  aGiven the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity in Malaysia, examination of family environmental factors is warranted. Reviews from developed countries report inconsistent findings on the relationship between parental-child feeding practices and child weight-related health outcomes. The current study aimed to examine parent-child feeding practices by familial-child characteristics in Malaysia.The Family Diet Study was conducted with urban Malay families and included a child aged 8–12 years and their main carer(s). Seven domains of parent-child feeding practices were assessed using the child feeding questionnaire and familial demographics, including socio-economic status, child anthropometry and dietary intake were collected. Inferential statistics were used to explore the relationships between variables.Of the 315 families enrolled, 236 completed all measures, with the majority of parent-reporters being mothers (n = 182). One-third of the children were classified as overweight/obese. Three domains of parent-child feeding practices had median scores of 4.0 out of 5.0 [concern about child overweight (CCO) (Interquartile range (IQR): 3.3, 4.7); pressure-to-eat (PTE) (IQR: 3.3, 4.5) and food monitoring (IQR: 3.0, 5.0)]. The domain of ‘perceived child overweight’ was positively associated with child age (r = 0.45, p < 0.001). Children who were overweight (F = 37.4; p < 0.001) and under-reported energy intake (F = 13.1; p = 0.001) had higher median scores for the parental perception of risk of child being overweight. Median scores for the CCO and PTE domains were significantly higher in low-income families (F = 7.87; F = 9.75; p < 0.05, respectively).Malay parents in this present study are concerned about their child's weight, particularly for those overweight. Family size, household income, and child weight status significantly influence parent-child feeding practices. Further research examining the cultural context of family environmental factors related to childhood obesity is warranted within Malaysia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropometric measurements 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3ademographic statistics 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3adiet study techniques 3aenergy intake 3aenvironmental factors 3afamily size 3afood intake 3alow income households 3amonitoring 3amothers 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3asocioeconomic status 3aMalaysia 0aChild feeding practices 0aFamily 0aDemography 0aBody weight status 0aEnergy intake reporting 0aDietary intake 0aBMI 0aCCO 0aFDS 0aIQR 0aMON 0aNDR 0aNW 0aOW 0aPCO 0aPFR 0aPPO 0aPTE 0aREST 0aRNI 0aRSS 0aUW1 aBurrows, Tracy1 aMacDonald-Wicks, Lesley1 aWilliams, Lauren T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7860-03191 aCollins, Clare E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3298-756X1 aChee, Winnie Siew Swee0 tAppetite.g2018 June 01, v. 125 p.90-97dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008300171300001400254520164700268592002801915650001901943650001001962650001501972653001901987653001702006653001402023653001102037653002302048653002902071700002102100700001902121773012302140856008302263852000902346655001202355IND60610531120221120112614.0180828e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061053112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSollberger, Silja10aPredictors of visual attention to climate change images: An eye-tracking study  ap. 46-56.  aAttentional engagement with climate change is an important precondition for intentional climate-friendly behavior. However, not much is known about the determinants of an individuals' implicit willingness to attend to this global problem. This study investigates two potentially relevant predictors of implicit attention to climate change: a) pro-environmental orientation as a trait factor and b) experimentally induced stress as a state factor. We expected positive effects of pro-environmental orientation and negative effects of stress.Seventy-one male participants with either high or low pro-environmental orientation were randomly assigned to a stress or control condition. Afterwards, they viewed a series of climate change images and negative control images, which were presented simultaneously with positive and neutral distractors. Attentional deployment to the different stimulus categories was assessed using eye-tracking technology.Participants with high pro-environmental orientation spent more time looking at climate change as well as other negative images, compared to participants with low pro-environmental orientation. This result suggests that pro-environmental individuals might be characterized by a general propensity to attend to negative information. Furthermore, stress reduced attentional deployment to both climate change and negative control images, which might indicate decreased interest in self-transcendent problems and/or increased efforts of emotion regulation under stress. In summary, these findings constitute first evidence for trait and state predictors of attentional engagement with climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3amales 3apsychology 0aClimate change 0aEye-tracking 0aAttention 0aStress 0aEmotion regulation 0aTrier Social Stress Test1 aBernauer, Thomas1 aEhlert, Ulrike0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2017 Aug., v. 51 p.46-56dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012500168300001600293520172700309592002802036650001902064650002402083650001102107650001502118650001502133650001402148650002302162650001202185650001102197650001202208651001002220700006102230700001902291773009502310856008402405852000902489655001202498IND60592682120221116214245.0190401e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059268212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2018.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeda, Wakako10aWho eats with family and how often? Household members and work styles influence frequency of family meals in urban Japan  ap. 160-171.  aFamily commensality, or meals eaten together with family members, is a key practice to understand the socio-cultural organization of eating and family lives. Yet empirical evidence is limited outside of western societies, which have different household structures, work styles, and socio-cultural constructions of the practice. This study examined frequencies of family commensality based on 242 surveys of Japanese adults aged between 20 and 85 in two metropolitan areas. Results showed that family commensality is less frequent not only among those living alone, but also among those living with only non-partners including adult children, parents, and non-family members, than among those living with partners. Full-time employment was associated with late dinner times on weekdays. Later weekday dinner times were strongly associated with reduced frequency of dinners together. Late dinners have become commonplace among full-time workers in postwar Japan, and the peak dinner time in Japan occurs later than in other developed countries. Thus, work and lifestyle constraints impacting schedules appear to influence the frequency of family commensality. Our results suggest that frequencies of family commensality are influenced by co-residents and work styles of participants rather than household sizes. The idea that reduction of household size drives reduction of family commensality may be biased by previous studies conducted in western countries where most people reside in either single or nuclear households. Our study highlights complex determinants of family commensality, beyond presence of other household members, and demonstrates a need for rigorous investigation of family commensality across cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult children 3adeveloped countries 3adinner 3aemployment 3ahouseholds 3alifestyle 3ametropolitan areas 3aparents 3apeople 3asurveys 3aJapan1 aMelby, Melissa K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1766-54661 aIshikawa, Yuta0 tAppetite.g2018 June 01, v. 125 p.160-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010500165300001300270520107200283592002801355650001401383650002901397650001101426650001301437653003101450653002301481653001401504653001101518653001001529700001801539700001901557773012201576856008301698852000901781655001201790IND60610531320221120122558.0180828e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061053132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Heesup10aCognitive, affective, normative, and moral triggers of sustainable intentions among convention-goers  ap. 1-13.  aGiven that little research has considered cognitive, affective, normative, and moral drivers altogether in accounting for individuals' eco-friendly decisions, the present study addressed this omission in the convention industry by demonstrating the vital impact of such factors on attendees' environmentally responsible decision-making processes.

Here, the 3336-bp full-length cDNA of TH was isolated from Z. tau, a notorious horticultural pest infesting fruits and vegetables. qRT-polymerase chain reaction revealed that ZtTH transcripts were highly abundant at the time of pupal tanning and during adult emergence and were expressed in the midgut, integument and head of molting larvae. The pupation and eclosion rates gradually decreased when the 1st-instar larvae were fed diets containing higher concentrations of the TH inhibitor 3-iodo-tyrosine (3-IT). Moreover, pupal weights were significantly decreased, and abnormal uncolored phenotypes were observed after 20 mg/g 3-IT was incorporated into the diet. In addition, the suppression of TH function (mediated by RNA interference) led to a decrease in TH mRNAs and eclosion rates, accompanied by less-pigmented phenotypes. There was a severe impairment of larval-pupal cuticle tanning, leading to pupae with less yellowish pigment or that were completely white and transparent, when we injected 2 μL of 24.4 mM or 73.27 mM 3-IT into 3rd-instar larvae or prepupae. These results suggest that TH is an important enzyme for the normal growth and pupal pigmentation of Z. tau and that TH is a potential gene target for use in the control of Z. tau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aZeugodacus tau 3aadults 3acomplementary DNA 3aeclosion 3afruits 3ahead 3ahorticulture 3ainsects 3aintegument 3alarvae 3amessenger RNA 3amidgut 3amolting 3apests 3aphenotype 3apigmentation 3aprepupae 3apupae 3apupation 3asclerotization 3atyrosine 3-monooxygenase 3avegetables 0aTyrosine hydroxylase 0aSclerotization 0aPigmentation 0a3-iodo-tyrosine 0aPhenotypes 0aTranscriptional levels1 aZhang, Qi-Wen1 aIdrees, Atif1 aLin, Jia1 aSong, Xue-Sen1 aJi, Qing-E1 aDu, Ying-Gang1 aZheng, Min-Lin1 aChen, Jia-Hua0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2019 May, v. 231 p.11-19dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12506x1096-49597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2019.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012200159500001400281520129000295592002801585650001101613650001201624650001501636650000901651650001801660650001101678650001601689650002901705650001401734650001601748650001401764650001901778650001901797650001501816650001101831650002301842650001501865700002201880700002101902700002101923700002401944700002301968700001601991700002102007700002102028773012902049856007402178852000902252655001202261IND60715377920221123023701.0201026e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071537792DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122033802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChunHock, Sim 12aA New Remote Sensing Method to Estimate River to Ocean DOC Flux in Peatland Dominated Sarawak Coastal Regions, Borneo  aNAL-light  aWe present a new remote sensing based method to estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux discharged from rivers into coastal waters off the Sarawak region in Borneo. This method comprises three steps. In the first step, we developed an algorithm for estimating DOC concentrations using the ratio of Landsat-8 Red to Green bands B4/B3 (DOC (μM C) = 89.86 ·e0.27·(B4/B3)), which showed good correlation (R = 0.88) and low mean relative error (+5.71%) between measured and predicted DOC. In the second step, we used TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation data to estimate river discharge for the river basins. In the final step, DOC flux for each river catchment was then estimated by combining Landsat-8 derived DOC concentrations and TMPA derived river discharge. The analysis of remote sensing derived DOC flux (April 2013 to December 2018) shows that Sarawak coastal waters off the Rajang river basin, received the highest DOC flux (72% of total) with an average of 168 Gg C per year in our study area, has seasonal variability. The whole of Sarawak represents about 0.1% of the global annual riverine and estuarine DOC flux. The results presented in this study demonstrate the ability to estimate DOC flux using satellite remotely sensed observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorneo 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3aarea 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3acorrelation 3adissolved organic carbon 3aestuaries 3aexhibitions 3apeatlands 3aremote sensing 3ariparian areas 3ariver flow 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3awatersheds1 aCherukuru, Nagur 1 aMujahid, Aazani 1 aMartin, Patrick 1 aSanwlani, Nivedita 1 aWarneke, Thorsten 1 aRixen, Tim 1 aNotholt, Justus 1 aMüller, Moritz,0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 12, no. 20dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122033803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008800166300001400254520186000268592002802128650001502156650001202171650001802183650001802201650001002219650001802229650002102247650001402268650001802282650001402300650001102314650001302325650001402338650001002352650001002362650001302372653002002385653002102405653002202426653001002448653001902458700007002477700001602547700001902563700001902582700001702601700005602618773009302674856008402767852000902851655001202860IND60592682220221116214309.0190401e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059268222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeo, Pey Sze10aSimilar taste-nutrient relationships in commonly consumed Dutch and Malaysian foods  ap. 32-41.  aThree recent studies showed that taste intensity signals nutrient content. However, current data reflects only the food patterns in Western societies. No study has yet been performed in Asian culture. The Malaysian cuisine represents a mixture of Malay, Chinese and Indian foods. This study aimed to investigate the associations between taste intensity and nutrient content in commonly consumed Dutch (NL) and Malaysian (MY) foods. Perceived intensities of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, umami, saltiness and fat sensation were assessed for 469 Dutch and 423 Malaysian commonly consumed foods representing about 83% and 88% of an individual's average daily energy intake in each respective country. We used a trained Dutch (n = 15) and Malaysian panel (n = 20) with quantitative sensory Spectrum™ 100-point rating scales and reference solutions, R1 (13-point), R2 (33-point) and R3 (67-point). Dutch and Malaysian foods had relatively low mean sourness and bitterness (<R1), but higher mean sweetness, saltiness and fat sensation (between R1 and R2). Mean umami taste intensity of Malaysian foods (15-point) was higher than that of Dutch foods (8-point). Positive associations were found between sweetness and mono- and disaccharides (R2 = 0.67 (NL), 0.38 (MY)), between umami and protein (R2 = 0.29 (NL), 0.26 (MY)), between saltiness and sodium (R2 = 0.48 (NL), 0.27 (MY)), and between fat sensation and fat content (R2 = 0.56 (NL), 0.17(MY)) in Dutch and Malaysian foods (all, p < 0.001). The associations between taste intensity and nutrient content are not different between different countries, except for fat sensation-fat content. The two dimensional basic taste-nutrient space, representing the variance and associations between tastes and nutrients, is similar between Dutch and Malaysian commonly consumed foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitterness 3acuisine 3adisaccharides 3aenergy intake 3afoods 3alipid content 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3arating scales 3asaltiness 3asodium 3asourness 3asweetness 3ataste 3aumami 3avariance 0aTaste intensity 0aNutrient content 0aCommonly consumed 0aFoods 0aCross-cultural1 avan Langeveld, Astrid W.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2747-15101 aPol, Korrie1 aSiebelink, Els1 ade Graaf, Cees1 aYan, See Wan1 aMars, Monica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2010-10390 tAppetite.g2018 June 01, v. 125 p.32-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245008200163520181800245592002802063650002102091650002502112650001202137650001802149650001402167650001202181650002202193650001802215650001502233650002102248651001002269653002902279653002302308653002502331700001702356700001602373700001602389700001302405700001602418773011602434856008402550852000902634655001202643IND60748297320221118035515.0220205e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074829732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1071272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Yali10aEnvironmental impact of grain virtual water flows in China: From 1997 to 2014  aThe mismatching of grain production and consumption in space causes grain virtual water flow. Previous studies focused on the important role of virtual water trade in regional food security and its impact on water resource consumption, while this study focuses on the impact of virtual water flow on the environment. In this paper, two indexes of gray water footprint and carbon footprint were selected by footprint evaluation method to study the influence of virtual water flow on regional environment. The results show that the scale of grain virtual water flow gradually expanded, and the amount of virtual water flow increased from 67.14 Gm³ to 129.87 Gm³ from 1997 to 2014. The gray water footprint at a national scale showed a fluctuating trend, with obvious differences in temporal and spatial distribution. In addition, the total carbon footprint at the national scale increased from 290.2 Mton in 1997–430.4 Mton in 2014, basically showing a continuous increase trend. Provinces with larger gray water footprints are basically converted into import areas, and the total national gray water footprint reduced 64.74 Gm³. Meanwhile, the carbon footprint of the grain export region and import region changed significantly. Among the export areas, such as the Northeast region and the Huang-Huai-Hai region, the carbon footprint had an obvious downward trend. On the other hand, the carbon footprint of the import region in the south due to increasing of grain production to meet their own needs showed an increasing trend. Although virtual water flow reduced the gray water footprint and carbon footprint nationally, it increased the local environmental pressure on the export area. This study would be helpful in forming better water management policy and alleviating regional environment pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3aenvironmental impact 3aexports 3afood security 3agreywater 3aimports 3aissues and policy 3avirtual water 3awater flow 3awater management 3aChina 0aGrain virtual water flow 0aEnvironment impact 0aGray water footprint1 aLuan, Xiaobo1 aSun, Shikun1 aWang, Yubao1 aWu, Pute1 aWang, Xinyu0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 256 p.107127-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1071273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009200166520126400258592002801522650001301550650001801563650001001581650002301591650002301614650002401637650002501661650001201686650001301698650001201711650001901723650001101742653004201753653002601795653002401821653005001845700002001895700002201915700006201937773011001999856008502109852000902194655001202203IND60682223520221120130553.0200318e20200319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068222352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1516532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Fabao10aImproved synthetic route for the GluN2-specific NMDA receptor glycine site agonist AICP  a(R)-2-Amino-3-(4-(2-ethylphenyl)-1H-indole-2-carboxamido)propanoic acid (AICP) is a N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor glycine site agonist with unprecedented high potency in the low nanomolar range, and a GluN2 subunit-dependent pharmacological profile in terms of potency and agonist efficacy (Jessen et al., 2017 [1]). Here, we report a scalable, practical and cost-efficient synthetic route for AICP, which is an improvement compared to the previously reported route. This improved synthetic route includes a versatile diphenylmethylester (DPM) protection for the amino acid moiety, which can be widely used in the synthesis of other amino acid ligands. Further functional evaluation of AICP at the different ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) classes demonstrates that high affinity binding of AICP to the orthosteric binding site is selective for NMDA receptors over AMPA and kainate receptors. Furthermore, high affinity binding of AICP is not observed at GluN3A, GluN3B, and GluD2 subunits, which also bind glycine and d-serine. Thus, the new approach described here enables scalable synthesis of AICP for the use as a pharmacological tool compound to study the involvement of neuronal NMDA receptor subtypes in normal brain function and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3abinding sites 3abrain 3achemical reactions 3acost effectiveness 3aglutamate receptors 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aligands 3amoieties 3aneurons 3apropionic acid 3aserine 0aEthyl 4-bromo-1H-indole-2-carboxylate 0aAmino acid protection 0aSubunit selectivity 0aTwo-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology1 aRouzbeh, Nirvan1 aHansen, Kasper B.1 aClausen, Rasmus P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9466-94310 tTetrahedron letters.g2020 Mar. 19, v. 61, no. 12 p.151653-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1516533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245011100213300001900324506007600343520110700419592002801526506003701554650001001591650001001601650001201611650002001623650001501643650002401658650002701682650003001709653003001739653001101769653000901780653001101789653001001800653002201810653000901832653002601841653001801867653001901885700002201904700002401926700002601950700002301976700002301999773010802022856008402130852000902214655001202223IND60630188620221207113637.0190206e20190207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063018862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2018.11.0132doi7 aPMC63757272pmcid7 a305954342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCagnetta, Roberta10aNoncanonical Modulation of the eIF2 Pathway Controls an Increase in Local Translation during Neural Wiring  ap. 474-489.e5.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLocal translation is rapidly regulated by extrinsic signals during neural wiring, but its control mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the extracellular cue Sema3A induces an initial burst in local translation that precisely controls phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α via the unfolded protein response (UPR) kinase PERK. Strikingly, in contrast to canonical UPR signaling, Sema3A-induced eIF2α phosphorylation bypasses global translational repression and underlies an increase in local translation through differential activity of eIF2B mediated by protein phosphatase 1. Ultrasensitive proteomics analysis of axons reveals 75 proteins translationally controlled via the Sema3A-p-eIF2α pathway. These include proteostasis- and actin cytoskeleton-related proteins but not canonical stress markers. Finally, we show that PERK signaling is needed for directional axon migration and visual pathway development in vivo. Thus, our findings reveal a noncanonical eIF2 signaling pathway that controls selective changes in axon translation and is required for neural wiring.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3aaxons 3aenzymes 3aphosphorylation 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 3atranslation (genetics) 3aunfolded protein response 0aunfolded protein response 0aSema3A 0aPERK 0aeIF2α 0aeIF2B 0alocal translation 0aaxon 0aretinal ganglion cell 0aaxon guidance 0aaxon branching1 aWong, Hovy Ho-Wai1 aFrese, Christian K.1 aMallucci, Giovanna R.1 aKrijgsveld, Jeroen1 aHolt, Christine E.0 tMolecular cell.g2019 Feb. 07, v. 73, no. 3 p.474-489.e5dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011100156300001800267520094200285592002801227650001501255650001901270650001201289650001501301650001101316650003101327650001401358700001901372700002501391700001901416700001701435700002401452700002201476773013101498856007501629852000901704655001201713IND60538848220221118024715.0160815e20130522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053884822DNAL7 a10.1021/ja401429x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Dong-Xu10aTunable Rare-Earth fcu-MOFs: A Platform for Systematic Enhancement of CO2 Adsorption Energetics and Uptake  ap. 7660-7667.  aA series of fcu-MOFs based on rare-earth (RE) metals and linear fluorinated/nonfluorinated, homo/heterofunctional ligands were targeted and synthesized. This particular fcu-MOF platform was selected because of its unique structural characteristics combined with the ability/potential to dictate and regulate its chemical properties (e.g., tuning of the electron-rich RE metal ions and high localized charge density, a property arising from the proximal positioning of polarizing tetrazolate moieties and fluoro-groups that decorate the exposed inner surfaces of the confined conical cavities). These features permitted a systematic gas sorption study to evaluate/elucidate the effects of distinctive parameters on CO₂–MOF sorption energetics. Our study supports the importance of the synergistic effect of exposed open metal sites and proximal highly localized charge density toward materials with enhanced CO₂ sorption energetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aligands 3ametal ions 3ametals 3aphysicochemical properties 3asynergism1 aCairns, Amy J.1 aBelmabkhout, Youssef1 aWojtas, Lukasz1 aLiu, Yunling1 aAlkordi, Mohamed

The colonization intensity of B. subtilis in rhizosphere is a key factor for improving their effectiveness of field application. In this study, we developed a rapid and sensitive method for detecting B. subtilis in rhizosphere via TaqMan qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: The primers/probe set targeting gyrB gene could successfully distinguish B. subtilis from its close‐related species. Both the TaqMan qPCR and ddPCR methods exhibited a good linear relationship in the sensitivity assay, suggesting the developed method was specific, effective and reliable. Finally, the two methods were used to detect the colonization dynamic of B. subtilis within Arabidopsis rhizosphere. Both of them showed a consistent trend compared with the traditional cultivation‐based and microscopy‐based methods. CONCLUSIONS: The TaqMan qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) methods we developed could be used to rapidly detect B. subtilis in rhizosphere. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The TaqMan qPCR and ddPCR methods developed in this study can be applied to rapid quantitative detection of B. subtilis populations, and will be helpful to evaluate their effectiveness of field application.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801790cNational Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0201106cNational key research and development plan 3aArabidopsis 3aBacillus subtilis 3adroplets 3agenes 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere1 aYu, Hengguo1 aWang, Qi1 aCheng, Yifeng1 aDing, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2710-50510 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 Feb., v. 128, no. 2 p.518-527dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.144813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245016000167520204700327592002802374650002102402650002002423650001602443650001502459650002402474650002102498650001602519650001902535650001402554650002002568650001202588650001902600650001902619650001902638650002102657650001702678650002502695653002902720653001002749700001702759700001702776700001902793700002802812700001602840700001602856773011602872856008402988852000903072655001203081IND60748297520221118035520.0210926e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074829752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1071292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Junlin10aAmeliorative roles of biochar-based fertilizer on morpho-physiological traits, nutrient uptake and yield in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) under water stress  aBiochar-based fertilizers increase soil fertility, nutrient uptake, and crop yield. However, the response of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) growth to biochar-based fertilizer under water stress and the associated mechanisms are not well-understood. In this study, a two-year pot experiment using a split-plot design was performed to investigate the effect of biochar-based fertilizer (BF₀, 0 t ha–¹; BF₀.₇₅, 0.75 t ha–¹; BF₁.₅, 1.5 t ha–¹) on morpho-physiological traits, total N and K uptake, water use, and yield in peanut and soil N and K availability under water treatments (WW, well-watered; MS, moderate water stress; SS, severe water stress). In the WW and MS treatments, application of biochar-based fertilizer increased main stem height, leaf area, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, total N and K uptake, water use efficiency, and yield in peanut, and soil N and K availability, relative to BF₀. The combination of moderate water stress and 0.75 t ha–¹ biochar-based fertilizer (IMSBF₀.₇₅ treatment) had 28.3% (2016) and 22.8% (2017) higher peanut yield than the conventional practice (IWWBF₀ treatment). BF₁.₅ and BF₀.₇₅ produced similar peanut yields in all water treatments. The enhanced peanut yield with biochar-based fertilizer could be attributed to increases in main stem height, leaf area, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, and total N and K uptake. Severe water stress decreased morpho-physiological traits, total N and K uptake, and yield in peanut, while moderate water stress maintained these traits, compared to the well-watered treatment. Thus, peanuts can sustain growth under moderate water stress. Biochar-based fertilizer alleviated the adverse effect of water stress on growth, nutrient uptake, and yield in peanut. In conclusion, a biochar-based fertilizer rate of 0.75 t ha–¹ under moderate water stress (60–65% field capacity) improves growth and yield in peanut and could be recommended for peanut production in arid or semi-arid areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aadverse effects 3achlorophyll 3acrop yield 3aexperimental design 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizers 3afield capacity 3aleaf area 3anutrient uptake 3apeanuts 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil fertility 3atotal nitrogen 3awater management 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 0aBiochar-based fertilizer 0aYield1 aWang, Shujun1 aWang, Ruimin1 aChen, Yinglong1 aSiddique, Kadambot H.M.1 aXia, Guimin1 aChi, Daocai0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 257 p.107129-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1071293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016100165300001800326520138300344592002801727650001101755650003301766650003001799650001401829650001101843650001901854650001501873650001801888650001801906650001901924700001601943700002101959700001901980700002401999700001902023773010302042856008102145852000902226655001202235IND60523362420221121123614.0160615e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052336242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-016-0069-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurmus, Zehra10aQuantifying structural and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding properties of thermoplastic polyurethane–carbon nanofiber/magnetite nanocomposites  ap. 8005-8017.  aIn this study, mixed-structure carbon–magnetite nanocomposites were prepared by decorating of carbon nanofiber (CNF) surfaces with magnetite (Fe₃O₄) nanoparticles synthesized via reflux method and characterized. The compositions of CNF–Fe₃O₄ nanocomposites were varied using different amounts of CNF into the Fe₃O₄ synthesis medium as 25/75, 50/50, and 75/25 (w/w). These nanocomposites were then used as functional fillers to prepare flexible, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding composites by solution mixing method. Structural features of fillers, morphological, and electromagnetic properties of flexible composites were studied. It was found that the magnetite nanoparticles with the average size of 8–10 nm were formed and successfully covered the oxidized CNF surfaces. It was also found that the resulting CNF–Fe₃O₄ nanocomposites exhibited sufficiently high saturation magnetization (M ₛ) values compared to Fe₃O₄. These CNF–Fe₃O₄ nanocomposites were embedded into TPU phase by employing the weight percent of 20 wt%. The flexible TPU–CNF–Fe₃O₄ nanocomposite having the composition of 80–5–15 wt% showed the reflection loss (RL) value of −32 dB which signified that the composite material could absorb the 97 % of an incident electromagnetic wave at around 12.14 GHz.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aelectromagnetic interference 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3amagnetite 3amixing 3ananocomposites 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3apolyurethanes 3athermoplastics1 aDurmus, Ali1 aBektay, M.

In this method, Potentially Acid-Forming (PAF) material is covered with either Non-Acid-Forming (NAF) material or alkaline material to minimize water infiltration and/or oxygen diffusion through rock pores. The physical and chemical characteristics and thickness of the NAF material layer are critical factors affecting the successful prevention of AMD. Therefore, this study evaluated the method of NAF material layering using laboratory-scale column leaching tests. NAF layers with a ratio of 25 and 50% were used to cover PAF material containing pyrite and jarosite sourced from the Sangatta and Bengalon mining areas, East Kalimantan. The physical and chemical characteristics of leachate collected from samples watered on a weekly wet-dry cycle were analyzed by kinetic tests over a period of 23 weeks. The results showed a trend of increasing pH values and decreasing sulfate and metal concentrations in the leachate. This study shows that NAF layering is an effective method to prevent or minimize the generation of AMD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorneo 3aacid mine drainage 3aencapsulation 3ajarosite 3aleachates 3aoxygen 3apH 3apyrite 3asulfates 0aAcid mine drainage 0aEncapsulation 0aPyrite 0aJarosite 0aSoil science 0aEnvironmental engineering 0aGeochemistry 0aEnvironmental pollution 0aEnvironmental risk assessment 0aEnvironmental science1 aPalinggi, Yoseph1 aHandajani, Marisa1 aPranoto, Kris1 aAtmaja, Ananda0 tHeliyon.g2020 Nov., v. 6, no. 11 p.e05590-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e055903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009900166300001800265500002000283520166400303592002801967650002401995650001302019650001202032650001202044650002202056650001502078650001502093650001702108650001302125650003402138650001502172650001602187650001102203650001102214650001102225650002002236650002202256700001602278700001902294773010302313856007902416852000902495655001202504IND60586769320221120224646.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058676932DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.129372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatō, Yasuhiro,10aOptimal foraging by herbivores maintains polymorphism in defence in a natural plant population  ap. 2233-2243.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany species of plants and animals exhibit polymorphism for defensive traits. Adaptive foraging by natural enemies has long been hypothesized to maintain such polymorphism, but this has not been clearly demonstrated in a natural prey or host population. The purpose of this study was to address whether the brassica leaf beetle Phaedon brassicae promotes the maintenance of defence polymorphism in the trichome‐producing (hairy) and trichomeless (glabrous) morphs of Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. Here, we modelled foraging behaviours of herbivores and demography of the host plant. Then, we estimated the model parameters based on the likelihood of observed data from a natural A. halleri population. The patterns of leaf damage to hairy and glabrous plants were well explained when we presumed the optimal diet choice (ODC) by P. brassicae. The observed dynamics in the plant number and morph‐frequency were well supported by the model with the estimated parameter values. Our numerical analysis showed that the ODC by P. brassicae caused a negative frequency‐dependent selection on trichrome dimorphism. The coexistence of two morphs was allowed over a wide range of herbivory pressure and the cost of defence. These results indicate that the ODC by P. brassicae contributes to the coexistence of hairy and glabrous A. halleri. While species interaction and stochastic dispersal are both involved in polymorphism dynamics in the field, our findings suggest that the role of consumer behaviours in the maintenance of defence polymorphism may be more important than currently appreciated.

Crop genetic improvement to address environmental stresses for sustainable food production has been in high demand, especially given the current situation of global climate changes and reduction of the global food production rate/population rate. Recently, the emerging clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas)-based targeted mutagenesis has provided a revolutionary approach to crop improvement. The major application of CRISPR/Cas in plant genome editing has been the generation of indel mutations via error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA DSBs. In this study, we examined the power of the CRISPR/Cas9-based novel approach in the precise manipulation of protein domains of tomato hybrid proline-rich protein 1 (HyPRP1), which is a negative regulator of salt stress responses. We revealed that the precise elimination of SlHyPRP1 negative-response domain(s) led to high salinity tolerance at the germination and vegetative stages in our experimental conditions. CRISPR/Cas9-based domain editing may be an efficient tool to engineer multidomain proteins of important food crops to cope with global climate changes for sustainable agriculture and future food security.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020R1I1A1A01072130cNational Research Foundation of Korea (KR)  a2020M3A9I4038352cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2020R1A6A1A03044344cNational Research Foundation of Korea  aSSAC, Grant PJ01322601cThe Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program  aNBT, Grant PJ01478401cThe Program for New Plant Breeding Techniques, Rural Development Administration (RDA), Korea 3aDNA 3aclimate 3aexcision 3afood production 3afood security 3agenetic improvement 3agenome 3agermination 3ahybrids 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asustainable agriculture 3atomatoes1 aDoan, Duong Thi Hai1 aKim, Jihae1 aSong, Young Jong1 aSung, Yeon Woo1 aDāsa, Svātī,1 aKim, Eun‐Jung1 aSon, Geon Hui1 aKim, Sang Hee1 aVan Vu, Tien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6369-76641 aKim, Jae-Yean1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1180-62320 tPlant cell reports.g2021 June, v. 40, no. 6 p.999-1011dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33565x0721-77147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-020-02622-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002500193245009000218300001400308506007600322520115000398592002801548506003701576650001701613650002201630650001501652650002101667650002001688650002101708650001101729650002001740650001601760650001801776650001901794650001701813650001701830650002201847650001201869653001501881653001401896653001801910653002001928653002401948653000901972653002501981700002002006773008202026856008602108852000902194655001202203IND60564527420221207081454.0170713e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056452742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.09.0092doi7 aPMC47445732pmcid7 a263680522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharley, Phillida A.10aStanding your ground to exoribonucleases: Function of Flavivirus long non-coding RNAs  ap. 70-77.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMembers of the Flaviviridae (e.g., Dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Hepatitis C virus) contain a positive-sense RNA genome that encodes a large polyprotein. It is now also clear most if not all of these viruses also produce an abundant subgenomic long non-coding RNA. These non-coding RNAs, which are called subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) or Xrn1-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs), are stable decay intermediates generated from the viral genomic RNA through the stalling of the cellular exoribonuclease Xrn1 at highly structured regions. Several functions of these flavivirus long non-coding RNAs have been revealed in recent years. The generation of these sfRNAs/xrRNAs from viral transcripts results in the repression of Xrn1 and the dysregulation of cellular mRNA stability. The abundant sfRNAs also serve directly as a decoy for important cellular protein regulators of the interferon and RNA interference antiviral pathways. Thus the generation of long non-coding RNAs from flaviviruses, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses likely disrupts aspects of innate immunity and may directly contribute to viral replication, cytopathology and pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDengue virus 3aHepatitis C virus 3aPestivirus 3aRNA interference 3aWest Nile virus 3aexoribonucleases 3agenome 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferons 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3apathogenesis 3apolyproteins 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aFlavivirus 0aRNA decay 0aRNA stability 0aExoribonuclease 0aLong non-coding RNA 0aIRES 0aUntranslated regions1 aWilusz, Jeffrey0 tVirus research.g2016 Jan. 02, v. 212 p.70-77dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006100169300001800230500001100248520143400259592002801693650003101721650001401752650001301766650001401779650001301793650001601806650001801822650001701840650001601857650001301873650001101886650001401897650001501911650001801926650001401944650002401958650001701982650001301999700002102012773013002033856008102163852000902244655001202253IND60575445820221116222513.0171012e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057544582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-016-2422-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwuh, Jane Atesoh10aMolecular basis of mycobacterial survival in macrophages  ap. 1625-1648.  aReview  aMacrophages play an essential role in the immune system by ingesting and degrading invading pathogens, initiating an inflammatory response and instructing adaptive immune cells, and resolving inflammation to restore homeostasis. More interesting is the fact that some bacteria have evolved to use macrophages as a natural habitat and tools of spread in the host, e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and some non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Mtb is considered one of humanity’s most successful pathogens and is the causal agent of tuberculosis, while NTMs cause opportunistic infections all of which are of significant public health concern. Here, we describe mechanisms by which intracellular pathogens, with an emphasis on mycobacteria, manipulate macrophage functions to circumvent killing and live inside these cells even under considerable immunological pressure. Such macrophage functions include the selective evasion or engagement of pattern recognition receptors, production of cytokines, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, phagosome maturation, as well as other killing mechanisms like autophagy and cell death. A clear understanding of host responses elicited by a specific pathogen and strategies employed by the microbe to evade or exploit these is of significant importance for the development of effective vaccines and targeted immunotherapy against persistent intracellular infections like tuberculosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aautophagy 3abacteria 3acytokines 3ahabitats 3ahomeostasis 3aimmunotherapy 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apathogens 3aphagosomes 3apublic health 3areceptors 3asecondary infection 3atuberculosis 3avaccines1 aFlo, Trude Helen0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2017 May, v. 74, no. 9 p.1625-1648dSpringer International Publishingx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-016-2422-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010700167300001800274520091700292592002801209650001201237650001801249650001101267650001101278650001001289650003301299650001301332650001401345650001501359650001601374650001801390650001501408650001101423651000901434773017801443856007801621852000901699655001201708IND60118206620221120130509.0141126e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011820662DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.061796-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSipiczki, Matthias10aMetschnikowia laotica f.a., sp. nov., a dimorphic, pigment-producing yeast species isolated from fruit  ap. 1847-1852.  aEight strains with identical sequences of the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit rRNA genes were isolated from fallen fruits in two distant localities in Laos. These strains represent a novel dimorphic budding yeast species producing invasive pseudohyphae and a brown pigment when growing on media containing quinic acid as the sole carbon source or tryptophan as the sole nitrogen source. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the D1/D2 domains, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the 18S rRNA genes placed the novel species in the Metschnikowia clade close to Candida torresii, Metschnikowia drosophilae and Candida danieliae. The taxonomic name Metschnikowia laotica f.a., sp. nov., reflecting the geographical origin of the isolates, is proposed for the novel species.

In contrast, evidence that GABA is a signal in plants has only emerged in the last 15 years, and it was not until last year that a mechanism by which this could occur was identified—a plant ‘GABA receptor’ that inhibits anion passage through the aluminium-activated malate transporter family of proteins (ALMTs). ALMTs are multigenic, expressed in different organs and present on different membranes. We propose GABA regulation of ALMT activity could function as a signal that modulates plant growth, development, and stress response. In this review, we compare and contrast the plant ‘GABA receptor’ with mammalian GABAA receptors in terms of their molecular identity, predicted topology, mode of action, and signalling roles. We also explore the implications of the discovery that GABA modulates anion flux in plants, its role in signal transduction for the regulation of plant physiology, and predict the possibility that there are other GABA interaction sites in the N termini of ALMT proteins through in silico evolutionary coupling analysis; we also explore the potential interactions between GABA and other signalling molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agamma-aminobutyric acid receptors 3amalates 3amammals 3amechanism of action 3aplant growth 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atopology1 aTyerman, Stephen D.1 aGilliham, Matthew1 aXu, Bo0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2017 May, v. 74, no. 9 p.1577-1603dSpringer International Publishingx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-016-2415-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002000193245005800213300001600271506007600287520082700363592002801190506003701218650001001255650002001265650001601285650001901301650003101320650001801351653000801369653001501377653001101392653002401403653000901427653001001436700002701446773008401473856008601557852000901643655001201652IND60564527520221207094519.0170713e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056452752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.09.0232doi7 aPMC47444912pmcid7 a264745262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValadkhan, Saba10alncRNA-mediated regulation of the interferon response  ap. 127-136.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe interferon (IFN) response is a critical arm of the innate immune response and a major host defense mechanism against viral infections. Following microbial encounter, a series of signaling events lead to transcriptional activation of the IFN genes, which in turn leads to significant changes in the cellular transcriptome by altering the expression of hundreds of target genes. Emerging evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a major subgroup of the IFN target genes, and further, that the IFN response is subject to regulation by a large number of host- and pathogen-derived lncRNAs.

Studying beetle community structure is very helpful in understanding how shifting cultivation affects the biodiversity features compared to natural forest system. The present study examines the beetle species diversity and estimates the effects of shifting cultivation practices on the beetle assemblages in relation to change in tree species composition and soil nutrients. Scarabaeidae and Carabidae were observed to be the dominant families in the land use systems studied. Shifting cultivation practice significantly (P < 0.05) affected the beetle and tree species diversity as well as the soil nutrients as shown by univariate (one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation and regression, diversity indices) and multivariate (cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), canonical variate analysis (CVA), permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), permutational multivariate analysis of dispersion (PERMDISP)) statistical analyses. Besides changing the tree species composition and affecting the soil fertility, shifting cultivation provides less suitable habitat conditions for the beetle species. Bioindicator analysis categorized the beetle species into forest specialists, anthropogenic specialists (shifting cultivation habitat specialist), and habitat generalists. Molecular analysis of bioindicator beetle species was done using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) marker to validate the beetle species and describe genetic variation among them in relation to heterogeneity, transition/transversion bias, codon usage bias, evolutionary distance, and substitution pattern. The present study revealed the fact that shifting cultivation practice significantly affects the beetle species in terms of biodiversity pattern as well as evolutionary features. Spatiotemporal assessment of soil–plant–beetle interactions in shifting cultivation system and their influence in land degradation and ecology will be helpful in making biodiversity conservation decisions in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarabidae 3aScarabaeidae 3acluster analysis 3acommunity structure 3acorrespondence analysis 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3ainsect communities 3aland degradation 3aland use 3amitochondria 3amultivariate analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3ashifting cultivation 3asoil fertility 3asoil nutrients 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aIndia1 aMomin, Marcy D.1 aLalrotluanga, R.1 aRosangliana, David1 aGhatak, Souvik1 aZothansanga, R.1 aKumar, Nachimuthu Senthil1 aGurusubramanian, Guruswami0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Aug., v. 23, no. 16 p.16201-16229dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6782-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245004400210300001300254506007600267520141200343592002801755506003701783650002401820650002201844650001401866650001001880650001401890650002801904650001901932650002201951650002901973650001802002650002702020650001402047650002202061650001202083653001202095653001302107653001402120653001702134653002202151653002902173653002102202700002102223773008102244856008602325852000902411655001202420IND60564527720221207094514.0170713e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056452772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.10.0022doi7 aPMC47445162pmcid7 a264541882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortes, Puri10aLong noncoding RNAs in viral infections  ap. 1-11.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aViral infections induce strong modifications in the cell transcriptome. Among the RNAs whose expression is altered by infection are long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are transcripts with potential to function as RNA molecules. Infected cells may express viral lncRNAs, cellular lncRNAs and chimeric lncRNAs formed by viral and cellular sequences. Some viruses express viral lncRNAs whose function is essential for viral viability. They are transcribed by polymerase II or III and some of them can be processed by unique maturation steps performed by host cell machineries. Some viral lncRNAs control transcription, stability or translation of cellular and viral genes. Surprisingly, similar functions can be exerted by cellular lncRNAs induced by infection. Expression of cellular lncRNAs may be altered in response to viral replication or viral protein expression. However, many cellular lncRNAs respond to the antiviral pathways induced by infection. In fact, many lncRNAs function as positive or negative regulators of the innate antiviral response. Our current knowledge about the identity and function of lncRNAs in infected cells is very limited. However, research into this field has already helped in the identification of novel cellular pathways and may help in the development of therapeutic tools for the treatment of viral infections, autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders and cancer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautoimmune diseases 3achemical elements 3achimerism 3agenes 3aneoplasms 3anervous system diseases 3anon-coding RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranslation (genetics) 3aviability 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0alncRNAs 0aProviral 0aAntiviral 0aIFN response 0alncRNA processing 0aTranscription regulation 0aRNA interference1 aMorris, Kevin V.0 tVirus research.g2016 Jan. 02, v. 212 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245007800177520100500255592002801260650001801288650001001306650001501316650001501331653001701346653001801363653002001381653002201401653001001423653002401433653001801457653000901475653000901484700006001493700002001553700006701573700006101640700005901701700002501760700005701785700001801842700002101860773009401881856008601975852000902061655001202070IND60719567620221117235624.0210723e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071956762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e055962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhansaritoreh, Elmira10aEmploying DNA metabarcoding to determine the geographical origin of honey  aUnfavourable climatic conditions force Iranian beekeepers to translocate over large distances in the course of the year. However, irrespective of the main place of production, the honey is always labeled with the name of the beekeepers' hometown, which leads consequently to mislabeled products. The present study investigates the capability of DNA metabarcoding to locate the geographical origin of honey. The molecular markers (ITS2 and rbcL) allowed identification of 926 plant species in studied samples. A comprehensive review of floristic reference books specified 34 key species that could be used to successfully determine the geographical origin in 91.4% of samples. These key species were usually present in honey with tiny amounts and thus, conventional palynology might not be able to detect them. The present investigation indicates that although ITS2 is able to detect more species than rbcL, utilizing a combination of both markers provides more robust evidence of geographical origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3ahoney 3apalynology 3aprovenance 0aFood science 0aFood analysis 0aFood technology 0aMolecular biology 0aHoney 0aGeographical origin 0aMetabarcoding 0aITS2 0arbcL1 aSalmaki, Yasaman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0901-07611 aRamezani, Elias1 aAkbari Azirani, Tayebeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6565-56011 aKeller, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5716-36341 aNeumann, Katrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3989-80951 aAlizadeh, Kamaleddin1 aZarre, Shahin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9159-18001 aBeckh, Gudrun1 aBehling, Hermann0 tHeliyon.g2020 Nov., v. 6, no. 11 p.e05596-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e055963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100006100197245011400258300001600372506007600388506003100464520201800495592002802513596004502541506003702586650001202623650002002635650001302655650001002668650002502678650002602703650001402729650001802743650001402761650001302775650002502788650002202813650002802835650001102863651002402874651001802898653002802916653002402944653002502968653000902993653000803002700002303010700001803033773012003051856008803171852000903259655001203268IND60630691520221207052223.0201209e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063069152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.0272chorus7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwaney, Dennis P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1948-408710aNitrogen use efficiency and crop production: Patterns of regional variation in the United States, 1987–2012  ap. 498-511.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aNational-level summaries of crop production and nutrient use efficiency, important for international comparisons, only partially elucidate agricultural dynamics within a country. Agricultural production and associated environmental impacts in large countries vary significantly because of regional differences in crops, climate, resource use and production practices. Here, we review patterns of regional crop production, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and major inputs of nitrogen to US crops over 1987–2012, based on the Farm Resource Regions developed by the Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS). Across the US, NUE generally decreased over time over the period studied, mainly due to increased use in mineral N fertilizer above crop N requirements. The Heartland region dominates production of major crops and thus tends to drive national patterns, showing linear response of crop production to nitrogen inputs broadly consistent with an earlier analysis of global patterns of country-scale data by Lassaletta et al. (2014). Most other regions show similar responses, but the Eastern Uplands region shows a negative response to nitrogen inputs, and the Southern Seaboard shows no significant relationship. The regional differences appear as two branches in the response of aggregate production to N inputs on a cropland area basis, but not on a total area basis, suggesting that the type of scaling used is critical under changing cropland area. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is positively associated with fertilizer as a percentage of N inputs in four regions, and all regions considered together. NUE is positively associated with crop N fixation in all regions except Northern Great Plains. It is negatively associated with manure (livestock excretion); in the US, manure is still treated largely as a waste to be managed rather than a nutrient resource. This significant regional variation in patterns of crop production and NUE vs N inputs, has implications for environmental quality and food security.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3acrop production 3acropland 3acrops 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental quality 3aexcretion 3afood security 3alivestock 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrient use efficiency 3awastes 3aGreat Plains region 3aUnited States 0aNitrogen use efficiency 0aNitrogen management 0aRegional agriculture 0aNANI 0aNUE1 aHowarth, Robert W.1 aHong, Bongghi0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 635 p.498-511dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245004500168300001600213520097200229592002801201650001001229650002001239650002001259650001501279650004301294650005201337650001501389650001201404700002201416700002101438700001901459773010101478856008101579852000901660655001201669IND60573891220221122042554.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057389122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-016-2221-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBester, Rachelle10aHarbin: a quantitation PCR analysis tool  ap. 171-178.  aOBJECTIVES: To enable analysis and comparisons of different relative quantitation experiments, a web-browser application called Harbin was created that uses a quantile-based scoring system for the comparison of samples at different time points and between experiments. RESULTS: Harbin uses the standard curve method for relative quantitation to calculate concentration ratios (CRs). To evaluate if different datasets can be combined the Harbin quantile bootstrap test is proposed. This test is more sensitive in detecting distributional differences between data sets than the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The utility of the test is demonstrated in a comparison of three grapevine leafroll associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) RT-qPCR data sets. CONCLUSIONS: The quantile-based scoring system of CRs will enable the monitoring of virus titre or gene expression over different time points and be useful in other genomic applications where the combining of data sets are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3adata collection 3agene expression 3amonitoring 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviral load 3aviruses1 aPepler, Pieter T.1 aAldrich, Dirk J.1 aMaree, Hans J.0 tBiotechnology letters.g2017 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.171-178dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2221-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007300165300002000238520140300258592002801661650002301689650002201712650003701734650001501771650001901786650001401805650003501819650003401854650001001888650001601898650002101914650001301935700001901948700001801967700001201985700001801997700001602015700001502031700001802046773014902064856008102213852000902294655001202303IND60547994020221119231041.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054799402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6807-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Ming-feng10aCatalytic destruction of PCDD/Fs over vanadium oxide-based catalysts  ap. 16249-16258.  aVanadium oxide-based catalysts were developed for the destruction of vapour phase PCDD/Fs (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans). A vapour phase PCDD/Fs generating system was designed to supply stable PCDD/Fs steam with initial concentration of 3.2 ng I-TEQ Nm⁻³. Two kinds of titania (nano-TiO₂ and conventional TiO₂) and alumina were used as catalyst supports. For vanadium-based catalysts supported on nano-TiO₂, catalyst activity is enhanced with operating temperature increasing from 160 to 300 °C and then reduces with temperature rising further to 350 °C. It is mainly due to the fact that high volatility of organic compounds at 350 °C suppresses adsorption of PCDD/Fs on catalysts surface and then further inhibits the reaction between catalyst and PCDD/Fs. The optimum loading of vanadium on nano-TiO₂ support is 5 wt.% where vanadium oxide presents highly dispersed amorphous state according to the Raman spectra and XRD patterns. Excessive vanadium will block the pore space and form microcrystalline V₂O₅ on the support surface. At the vanadium loading of 5 wt.%, nano-TiO₂-supported catalyst performs best on PCDD/Fs destruction compared to Al₂O₃ and conventional TiO₂. Chemical states of vanadium in the fresh, used and reoxidized VOx(5 %)/TiO₂ catalysts at different operating temperature are also analysed by XPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3asteam 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3avanadium1 aLin, Xiao-qing1 aLi, Xiao-dong1 aYan, Mi1 aPrabowo, Bayu1 aLi, Wen-wei1 aChen, Tong1 aYan, Jian-hua0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Aug., v. 23, no. 16 p.16249-16258dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6807-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008500173300001600258520087700274592002801151650004401179650001401223650001001237650001101247650001501258650001101273650001201284650002201296650002101318650001601339650001601355653004901371653002301420653002101443653001301464653001901477700001701496700002101513700004101534773012101575856008501696852000901781655001201790IND60687581520221123025149.0200402e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068758152DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2018.15187422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHannan, Md.

Single jersey single lacoste cotton knit fabrics treated with detergent and wetting agent at 120°C temperature for 20 minutes revealed 5.8% weight loss. FTIR graphical data validated the weakening and moving out of characteristic bands of wax and pectin-based cotton impurities in the region of 1740–1200 cm⁻¹. The color differences of 1.5% and 1% dyed samples confirmed pass value (CMC ΔE ≤ 1) when treated at 105°C temperature for 20 minutes. The grading for color fastness to wash, perspiration, rubbing and light was 4–5 to 5. No deterioration in strength and morphological changes were experienced for the treated samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3ableaching 3acolor 3acotton 3adetergents 3adyeing 3afabrics 3ahydrogen peroxide 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3aweight loss 0aScouring and bleaching without NaOH and H2O2 0a105°C temperature 0a20 min duration 0aCMC ∆E 0acolor fastness1 aHaque, Papia1 aKabir, S M Fijul1 aRahman, Mizanurq(Mohammed Mizanur),0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2020 May 3, v. 17, no. 5 p.623-634dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2018.15187423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245010600156300001800262520122800280592002801508596007301536650001401609650001401623650003401637650001201671650001301683650001401696650001601710650002401726700002701750700001801777700002301795700002201818773015701840856007701997852000902074655001202083IND60772743120221119093200.0220904s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077274312DNAL7 a10.13031/trans.135342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Sarah10aHighly Efficient Biodiesel Conversion from Soybean Oil Using Liquid-Phase Plasma Discharge Technology  ap. 1129-1134.  aIn this study, the use of liquid-phase plasma discharge (LPPD) technology to accelerate the transesterification process was explored. An innovative LPPD reactor was first evaluated by varying the conductive opening size on the dielectric plate (0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 mm) coupled with five methanol to oil molar ratios (MOMR; 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and two liquid flowrates through the reactor (2.7 and 4.1 mL s-1) at a given catalyst (NaOH) to oil ratio (NaOR) of 0.8% (w/w). The optimal combination of opening size (1.0 mm), MOMR (5), and flowrate (2.7 mL s-1) was then fixed while the NaOR was varied from 0.4% to 1.2% (w/w) in 0.2% increments to determine the best NaOR for the reactor. The results showed that the best combination of the four operating parameters was an opening size of 1.0 mm, MOMR of 5, liquid flowrate of 2.7 mL s-1, and NaOR of 0.6% (w/w), with which a biodiesel conversion rate of 99.5% was obtained at an applied voltage of 1.2 kV. The transesterification reaction time was found to be only 923 ms. The developed LPPD technology has potential to position biodiesel competitively against petroleum diesel.

The unusual occurrence of this species appears to have supplanted the more regularly occurring bloom species, Noctiluca scintillans, in 2008–2009. For the first 2 weeks of the coastal Omani bloom, C. polykrikoides abundance was near monospecific proportions, with cell densities ranging from 4.6 × 10³ to 9 × 10⁶ cells L⁻¹ and very high levels of chlorophyll a (78.0 μg L⁻¹) were also recorded. The regional progression of the bloom likely began with stronger than normal upwelling along the Iranian and northern Omani coasts during the southwest monsoon in late summer, followed by discharge of unusually warm coastal plume water along the coast of Oman with the reversal of monsoonal winds in late October. The occurrence and persistence of high densities of C. polykrikoides in Oman coastal water were also significantly influenced by an elevated nutrient load and warmer than normal temperatures. Concentrations of nutrients, especially NH₄ ⁺, urea, PO₄ ³⁻, and organic nitrogen and phosphorus, were manyfold higher than observed in the year prior or since. These findings suggest that mesoscale features were important in bloom dynamics more regionally, but locally the bloom was sustained by nutrient enrichment supplemented by its mixotrophic capabilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3amonsoon season 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3asummer 3atemperature 3aurea 3aOman 3aPersian Gulf1 aPiontkovskiĭ, S.

In the batch tests, experimental parameters were studied, including solution pH, contact time, initial metal ions concentration, and temperature. Adsorption efficiency of the heavy metals was pH-dependent and the maximum adsorption was found to occur at around 5.5 for Cu, Zn, and Ni. The maximum sorption capacities calculated by applying the Langmuir isotherm were 18.68 mg/g for Cu, 16.12 mg/g for Ni, and 12.19 mg/g for Zn. The competitive adsorption studies showed that the adsorption affinity order of the three heavy metals was Cu²⁺ > Ni²⁺ > Zn²⁺. The test results using real wastewater indicated that the prepared activated carbon could be used as a cheap adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals in aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aaqueous solutions 3acopper 3azinc 3aheavy metals 3awastewater 3aadsorbents 3apH 3anickel 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3ametal ions 3aadsorption 0aions1 aElouear, Z.1 aBouzid, J.1 aOuddane, B.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Aug., v. 23, no. 16 p.15801-15806dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4400-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013900163300001800302520126600320592002801586650001301614650001601627650001301643650001401656650001101670650002101681650001501702650001101717650001401728650001601742650002401758650000801782700001501790700001601805700001501821700002501836773010301861856008101964852000902045655001202054IND60523363420221121091508.0160615e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052336342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-016-0091-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShvalya, V.10aInfluence of dopants on the thermal properties and critical behavior of the ferroelectric transition in uniaxial ferroelectric Sn2P2S6  ap. 8156-8167.  aThe thermal properties of Sn₂P₂S₆ single crystals doped with Ge, Te, and Sb have been studied in the neighborhood of the ferroelectric to paraelectric second-order phase transition by means of ac photopyroelectric calorimetry, measuring thermal diffusivity. A detailed study of the critical behavior of the transitions has been undertaken using different theoretical models to study the influence of the dopants and the physical mechanisms activated. Ge strongly favors the stereoactivity of the material, which is revealed in the increase of the critical temperature and the sharpening of the transition; this is due to the strengthening of the sp² electronic orbitals hybridization. Sb has a small influence on the stereoactivity while Te virtually none. In all cases, the ferroelectric phases are well described using the phenomenological Landau model, while for the paraelectric ones, a combination of two mechanisms is needed: first-order fluctuations of the order parameter plus the presence of charged defects, ruling out other possible mechanisms. The relative importance of the presence of these defects increases with increasing contents of Ge and Sb, while in the case of Te, there is only a slight increase with respect to the undoped sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3acalorimetry 3acrystals 3agermanium 3amodels 3aphase transition 3aphosphorus 3asulfur 3atellurium 3atemperature 3athermal diffusivity 3atin1 aOleaga, A.1 aSalazar, A.1 aStoika, I.1 aVysochanskii, Yu.

When the infected and healthy seeds were treated with ethanol series, unusual hair-like tissues were observed on surface of infected seeds. Morphology of these tissues was studied by stereo microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The hair-like tissues were observed on surface of seed coat of infected cucumber, musk melon and oriental melon and raised from the seed coats. Such tissues were not observed on seed coat of the same treated healthy cucumber and musk melon but such tissues were found as attached to seed coat of oriental melons. The width of hair-like tissues varied depend on species of genus Cucumis seeds, 2–2.5μm on musk melon and 9–10μm on oriental melon and cucumber seeds. The phenomenon was re-confirmed by RT-PCR and nested PCR assays that the seeds which had hair-like tissues on their seed coats were infected by CGMMV. Therefore, this study suggests that the hair-like tissues are a unique symptom as external morphological changes of genus Cucumis seeds induced by CGMMV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumber green mottle mosaic virus 3atesta 3acucumbers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aCucumis 3aemissions 3aethanol 3amelons 0aseeds1 aWin, Nang Kyu Kyu1 aCho, Dong-Myong1 aLee, Su-Heon1 aJung, Hee-Young0 tScientia horticulturae.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 146 p.76-80dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2012.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245009300164300002000257520147800277592002801755650001801783650001901801650001401820650003001834650001901864650001901883650001501902650000901917650001201926650001401938650001201952650001901964650001701983700005302000700006002053700006302113700003702176700001402213700006202227700005802289700006302347773014902410856007602559852000902635655001202644IND60626307920221118033343.0181220e20181123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062630792DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b098522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Melissa L.10aCO₂ Reduction Catalysts on Gold Electrode Surfaces Influenced by Large Electric Fields  ap. 17643-17655.  aAttaching molecular catalysts to metal and semiconductor electrodes is a promising approach to developing new catalytic electrodes with combined advantages of molecular and heterogeneous catalysts. However, the effect of the interfacial electric field on the stability, activity, and selectivity of the catalysts is often poorly understood due to the complexity of interfaces. In this work, we examine the strength of the interfacial field at the binding site of CO₂ reduction catalysts including Re(S-2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)₃Cl and Mn(S-2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)₃Br immobilized on Au electrodes. The vibrational spectra are probed by sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG), showing pronounced potential-dependent frequency shifts of the carbonyl stretching modes. Calculations of SFG spectra and Stark tuning rates based on density functional theory allow for direct interpretation of the configurations of the catalysts bound to the surfaces and the influence of the interfacial electric field. We find that electrocatalysts supported on Au electrodes have tilt angles of about 65–75° relative to the surface normal with one of the carbonyl ligands in direct contact with the surface. Large interfacial electric fields of 10⁸–10⁹ V/m are determined through the analysis of experimental frequency shifts and theoretical Stark tuning rates of the symmetric CO stretching mode. These large electric fields thus significantly influence the CO₂ binding site.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3adirect contact 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3agold 3aligands 3amanganese 3arhenium 3asemiconductors 3aspectroscopy1 aGe, Aimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0127-31931 aVidela, Pablo E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0742-03421 aRudshteyn, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9511-67801 aMiller, C.

Our findings suggest that a distinct retinal tropism is quite rare, representing approximately 1% of all cases of canine and feline ocular lymphoma. No breed or sex predispositions were identified. The mean age of the affected animal was 7 years (range 4–10) and 11 years (range 6–19) for dogs and cats, respectively. Nine cases (5 canine and 4 feline) were classified as diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subtype.

The fieldwork was carried out from April to July 2010. The study included observations of meltwater distribution within snow profiles in different locations and determination of its penetration time to the glacier ice surface. In addition, the variability of the snow temperature and heat transfer within the snow cover were measured. The main objective concerns the impact of meltwater on the diversity of physical characteristics of the snow cover and its melting dynamics. The obtained results indicate a time delay between the beginning of the melting processes and meltwater reaching the ice surface. The time necessary for meltwater to percolate through the entire snowpack in both, the ablation zone and the equilibrium line zone amounted to c. 12 days, despite a much greater snow depth at the upper site. An elongated retention of meltwater in the lower part of the glacier was caused by a higher amount of icy layers (ice formations and melt-freeze crusts), resulting from winter thaws, which delayed water penetration. For this reason, a reconstruction of rain-on-snow events was carried out. Such results give new insight into the processes of the reactivation of the glacier drainage system and the release of freshwater into the sea after the winter period.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArctic 0aSpitsbergen 0aHornsund 0asnow cover 0aglaciology 0ameltwater1 aLuks, Bartłomiej1 aBudzik, Tomasz0 tPolish Polar Research.g2016 June 29, v. 37, no. 2 p.193-218dDe Gruyter Openx2081-82627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/popore-2016-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012700163520143300290592002801723650005801751650001501809650001101824650001901835650002201854650002701876650001401903650001101917650001101928650001501939650001001954651001001964653002801974653002502002653001802027653003202045700001202077700001602089773011302105856008602218852000902304655001202313IND60679130120221117180711.0200210e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067913012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1196422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Can10aDriving determinants and prospective prediction simulations on carbon emissions peak for China’s heavy chemical industry  aUnprecedented huge mitigation task should be associated with profound efforts in facilitating emission reduction process over the globe. As the largest CO₂ emitting country, China has been strenuously promoting the mitigation resilient development pathways in conjunction with the 2030 carbon emission peak commitment from Nationally Determined Contribution document which submitted under the Paris Agreement. Based on the peaking objective, carbon emission in heavy chemical industry should be received most attentions in terms of its large proportion with respect to the emission sources from other sectors. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm optimized back propagation neural network (BP) model is employed to predict future carbon emission for heavy chemical industry with the timeframe of 2017–2035 on the basis of the previous data. The significant magnitude of each carbon emission driving force is acquired in terms of the absolute influence coefficient method. The results indicated that, carbon emission in heavy chemical industry and its corresponding sub-sectors could be achieved peak under the implementation of the predetermined mitigation scenarios. The proportion of carbon emission in energy processing industry, steel industry, and building material industry is accounted for a larger fraction over the cumulative carbon emission in heavy chemical industry during the simulation period upon 2035.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical industry 3aconstruction materials 3aemissions 3aenergy 3amodels 3aprediction 3asteel 3aChina 0aHeavy chemical industry 0aCarbon emission peak 0aDriving force 0aParticle swarm optimization1 aLi, Wei1 aGao, Shubin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 251 p.119642-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1196423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245014600153300001800299520206700317592002802384650001502412650002002427650002502447650003802472650001502510650001102525650001902536650001902555650002602574650001002600650001702610650001502627650001602642650001902658650001602677700001602693700001802709700001602727700001602743700001802759700001902777700001902796773009802815856007502913852000902988655001202997IND60576719020221120130421.0170806e20120306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057671902DNAL7 a10.1021/la203504h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yu10aBioadhesive Control of Plasma Proteins and Blood Cells from Umbilical Cord Blood onto the Interface Grafted with Zwitterionic Polymer Brushes  ap. 4309-4317.  aIn this work, bioadhesive behavior of plasma proteins and blood cells from umbilical cord blood (UCB) onto zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (polySBMA) polymer brushes was studied. The surface coverage of polySBMA brushes on a hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) well plate with surface grafting weights ranging from 0.02 mg/cm² to 0.69 mg/cm² can be effectively controlled using the ozone pretreatment and thermal-induced radical graft-polymerization. The chemical composition, grafting structure, surface hydrophilicity, and hydration capability of prepared polySBMA brushes were determined to illustrate the correlations between grafting properties and blood compatibility of zwitterionic-grafted surfaces in contact with human UCB. The protein adsorption of fibrinogen in single-protein solutions and at complex medium of 100% UCB plasma onto different polySBMA brushes with different grafting coverage was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibodies. The grafting density of the zwitterionic brushes greatly affects the PS surface, thus controlling the adsorption of fibrinogen, the adhesion of platelets, and the preservation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in UCB. The results showed that PS surfaces grafted with polySBMA brushes possess controllable hydration properties through the binding of water molecules, regulating the bioadhesive and bioinert characteristics of plasma proteins and blood platelets in UCB. Interestingly, it was found that the polySBMA brushes with an optimized grafting weight of approximately 0.1 mg/cm² at physiologic temperatures show significant hydrated chain flexibility and balanced hydrophilicity to provide the best preservation capacity for HSPCs stored in 100% UCB solution for 2 weeks. This work suggests that, through controlling grafting structures, the hemocompatible nature of grafted zwitterionic polymer brushes makes them well suited to the molecular design of regulated bioadhesive interfaces for use in the preservation of HSPCs from human UCB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ablood platelets 3achemical composition 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibrinogen 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aozone 3apolystyrenes 3astem cells 3atemperature 3aumbilical cord 3azwitterions1 aChang, Yung1 aHiguchi, Akon1 aShih, Yu-Ju1 aLi, Pei-Tsz1 aChen, Wen-Yih1 aTsai, Eing-Mei1 aHsiue, Ging-Ho0 tLangmuir.g2012 Mar. 06, v. 28, no. 9 p.4309-4317dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla203504h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245009300206520115200299592002801451650002001479650001501499650001601514650001901530650001301549650002001562650003001582650002201612653002001634653002101654653002001675653001701695653001501712700002001727773010501747856008501852852000901937655001201946IND60793815220221119223334.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079381522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2022.1086772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Titli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6819-446810aRecent development of stereoselective C-glycosylation via generation of glycosyl radical  aC-glycosylation through the formation of glycosyl radical is a very feasible and expedient approach for making of the C–C anomeric bond. In this light, this review article is covering selected literature from 2000 to 2022 on the synthetic development of C-glycosylation involving the generation of glycosyl radical as a crucial intermediate in a stereoselective fashion. The generation of glycosyl radical is controlled by the reaction method applying to the radical precursor. Those methods are categorized in terms of a key source of an initiator such as metal-free activation of radical precursor, photochemical induced approach, and metal-mediated approach including transition metal-mediated, lanthanide, and non-transition metal-mediated approach with brief mechanistic discussion, and stereochemical outcome of resultant C-glycosides in detail. This brief discussion accumulates the stereoselective synthesis of challenging C-linked building blocks in a more facile way via generation of glycosyl radical and those building blocks have a great role as drugs, inhibitors, glycoconjugates in the field of biological and medicinal chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglycoconjugates 3aglycosides 3alanthanides 3aphotochemistry 3aresearch 3astereochemistry 3astereoselective synthesis 3astereoselectivity 0aC-glycosylation 0aGlycosyl radical 0aStereoselective 0aConformation 0aReactivity1 aNokami, Toshiki0 tCarbohydrate research.g2022 Dec., v. 522 p.108677-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2022.1086773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012200165520072500287592002801012650001701040650001301057650002601070650001801096650000901114650001101123650001201134650002001146650002001166650001301186653003001199653002501229653002401254700001701278700001701295700002001312700002301332773010501355856008501460852000901545655001201554IND60793815420221119223524.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079381542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2022.1086802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaki, Yuta10aIsolation and characterization of high-mannose type glycans containing five or six mannose residues from hen egg yolk  aHigh-mannose type glycans play important roles in biosynthesis of glycoproteins including glycoprotein quality control system.

In this work, we isolated the M5-glycan and the M6-glycan from delipidated egg yolk and confirmed that their structures were identical to human type glycans based on rigorous NMR experiments, suggesting the potential use for semisynthesis of glycoconjugates and glycan analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3aegg yolk 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aglycoproteins 3ahens 3ahumans 3amannose 3apolysaccharides 3aquality control 3aresearch 0aHigh-mannose type glycans 0aIsolation of glycans 0aStructural analysis1 aOtani, Yuiko1 aOkamoto, Ryo1 aIzumi, Masayuki1 aKajihara, Yasuhiro0 tCarbohydrate research.g2022 Nov., v. 521 p.108680-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2022.1086803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03843naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012100160500002000281520213100301592002802432650002102460650001102481650001302492650002202505650002002527650001202547650001302559650002402572650001302596650000802609650001102617650001302628650001402641650001002655650001102665651002102676700002202697700002402719700001702743700001802760700001902778700002302797700003202820700002402852700002002876700001902896700002402915700002102939700002102960700002002981700001903001700001803020700003003038773007903068856007303147852000903220655001203229IND60523212820221123034931.0160607e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052321282DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.12132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHindell, Mark A.10aCircumpolar habitat use in the southern elephant seal: implications for foraging success and population trajectories  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the Southern Ocean, wide‐ranging predators offer the opportunity to quantify how animals respond to differences in the environment because their behavior and population trends are an integrated signal of prevailing conditions within multiple marine habitats. Southern elephant seals in particular, can provide useful insights due to their circumpolar distribution, their long and distant migrations and their performance of extended bouts of deep diving. Furthermore, across their range, elephant seal populations have very different population trends. In this study, we present a data set from the International Polar Year project; Marine Mammals Exploring the Oceans Pole to Pole for southern elephant seals, in which a large number of instruments (N = 287) deployed on animals, encompassing a broad circum‐Antarctic geographic extent, collected in situ ocean data and at‐sea foraging metrics that explicitly link foraging behavior and habitat structure in time and space. Broadly speaking, the seals foraged in two habitats, the relatively shallow waters of the Antarctic continental shelf and the Kerguelen Plateau and deep open water regions. Animals of both sexes were more likely to exhibit area‐restricted search (ARS) behavior rather than transit in shelf habitats. While Antarctic shelf waters can be regarded as prime habitat for both sexes, female seals tend to move northwards with the advance of sea ice in the late autumn or early winter. The water masses used by the seals also influenced their behavioral mode, with female ARS behavior being most likely in modified Circumpolar Deepwater or northerly Modified Shelf Water, both of which tend to be associated with the outer reaches of the Antarctic Continental Shelf. The combined effects of (1) the differing habitat quality, (2) differing responses to encroaching ice as the winter progresses among colonies, (3) differing distances between breeding and haul‐out sites and high quality habitats, and (4) differing long‐term regional trends in sea ice extent can explain the differing population trends observed among elephant seal colonies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMirounga leonina 3aautumn 3abreeding 3acontinental shelf 3adata collection 3afemales 3aforaging 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aice 3aoceans 3aplateaus 3apredators 3aseals 3awinter 3aAntarctic region1 aMcMahon, Clive R.1 aBester, Marthán N.1 aBoehme, Lars1 aCosta, Daniel1 aFedak, Mike A.1 aGuinet, Christophe1 aHerraiz‐Borreguero, Laura1 aHarcourt, Robert G.1 aHuckstadt, Luis1 aKovacs, Kit M.1 aLydersen, Christian1 aMcIntyre, Trevor1 aMuelbert, Monica1 aPatterson, Toby1 aRoquet, Fabien1 aWilliams, Guy1 aCharrassin, Jean‐Benoit0 tEcosphere.g2016 May, v. 7, no. 5dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.12133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245007400174300001400248520060300262592002800865650002100893650001500914650002200929650001500951650003000966650001100996650001601007650002401023700001901047773010901066856008201175852000901257655001201266IND60598140720221121230326.0201202e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059814072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2017.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonilla-Rosso, Germán10aFunctional roles and metabolic niches in the honey bee gut microbiota  ap. 69-76.  aGut microbiota studies on diverse animals facilitate our understanding of the general principles governing microbiota–host interactions.

In this study, the tensile mechanical properties of α-graphyne nanoscroll (α-GNS) at different temperatures were systematically investigated using the reactive molecular dynamics method. It was found that the α-GNS could undergo a brittle-ductile transition as the temperature increased from 100 K to 1000 K. When the temperature was below the critical brittle-ductile transition temperature (BDTT) of ∼375 K, the α-GNS exhibited brittle behavior; however, when the temperature was above the BDTT, it exhibited ductile behavior. Dynamic analyses demonstrated that the superplastic behavior was influenced by two typical microstructures: intralayer carbon triatomic rings and interlayer carbon bonds. NEB (nudged elastic band) calculations further showed that the intralayer triatomic rings can promote plastic deformation, while the interlayer bonds retard plastic deformation by increasing the energy barrier of formation of intralayer triatomic rings. However, α-GNSs can also be made to exhibit good ductile behavior below the BDTT by introducing interlayer bonds using high-temperature annealing technology, which is mainly due to the postponed crack propagation in α-GNSs. This study could be beneficial for the design of novel 1D carbon nanomaterials with controllable brittleness and ductility.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3acarbon 3aenergy 3amolecular dynamics 3aplastic deformation 3atemperature1 aSong, Bo1 aZhang, Cun1 aChen, Shaohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5277-453X0 tCarbon.g2022 May, v. 191 p.98-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245010400212300001600316520160300332592002801935650004401963650002302007650002202030650002102052650001502073650001502088650001202103650001902115650001802134650002402152650001502176650001702191650002302208650001702231650001702248650001202265653001502277653001602292653002202308653002502330653002202355653001402377700002402391700002802415700002902443773009002472856008502562852000902647655001202656IND60793815520221119223303.0221004e20230105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079381552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerafin, Jarosław1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3719-876210aDesign of highly microporous activated carbons based on walnut shell biomass for H2 and CO2 storage  ap. 633-647.  aLow-cost walnut shell-based carbons with high microporosity were prepared by simple one-step carbonization with chemical activation using KOH, exhibiting the promising potential to be a very good CO₂ and H₂ adsorbent. The physicochemical properties of the obtained carbons were characterized by N₂ and CO₂ adsorption isotherms, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and elemental analysis. The activated carbon AC-800 was characterized by a highly developed specific surface area of 1868 cm²/g and a high micropore content of 0.94 cm³/g. It highly exhibited CO₂ uptake in 1 bar was up to 9.54, 5.17, 4.33 mmol/g for 0, 25 and 40 °C, respectively. In addition, the H₂ storage capacity was 3.15 mmol/g at 40 bars. Significantly, confirmed an exceptionally high dependency of CO₂ and H₂ uptake vs micropores structure of activated carbon. AC-800 also shows good selectivity for CO₂/N₂ and fast adsorption kinetics that be easily regenerated with superior cyclic stability after multiple cycles The experimental isotherm data of activated carbon produced from walnut shells were analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Sips, and Toth isotherm equations. The fitting details showed that the multitemperature Toth equation is a powerful tool to mathematically represent CO₂ and H₂ isotherms on activated carbon. The easy way of preparation and high capture abilities endow this kind of activated carbon attractive as a promising adsorbent for CO₂ and H₂ storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonization 3aelectron microscopy 3amicropores 3aporous media 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3awalnut hulls 3awalnuts 0aH2 storage 0aCO2 capture 0aActivated carbons 0aAdsorption mechanism 0aNarrow micropores 0aNutshells1 aDziejarski, Bartosz1 aCruz Junior, Orlando F.1 aSreńscek-Nazzal, Joanna0 tCarbon.g2023 Jan. 05, v. 201 p.633-647dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245009400205300001600299520139900315592002801714650001101742650002001753650002801773650002101801650001101822650001401833650001501847650001401862653003601876653002601912653003201938653002101970700006001991700002202051700001802073700005702091700006002148700002702208700001702235700006302252773009002315856008502405852000902490655001202499IND60793815620221119223341.0220929e20230105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079381562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChida, Koki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1197-859210aBimetallic ordered carbonaceous frameworks from Co- and Cu-porphyrin bimolecular crystals  ap. 338-346.  aOrdered carbonaceous frameworks (OCFs) are unique carbon alloys, having the advantages of both organic-based nanoporous frameworks and carbon materials: well-defined ordered structures, single-atom sites, high thermal/chemical stability, and electrical conductivity. Compared with reported carbon-metal catalysts with single-atom sites, OCFs contains a large amount of single-atomic metals (∼9 wt%), making OCFs a promising platform for various applications including electrocatalysis and energy storage/conversion. However, the types of metal species incorporated into OCFs have been limited to Ni and Fe. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of OCFs with single-atomic Co- and Cu-sites from the corresponding porphyrin crystals with eight ethynyl moieties. Since the Co- and Cu-porphyrin precursors have identical molecular structures except the metal species, they form identical supramolecular crystals. Thus, it is possible to form bimetallic supramolecular crystals simply by recrystallization of these two molecules together, and the resulting bimetallic crystals can be converted into bimetallic OCFs with developed microporosity. In the frameworks of the OCFs, single-atomic Co and Cu species are homogeneously dispersed and immobilized. The metal species embedded in the OCF framework are electrochemically active, and synergetic effect of Co and Cu in close proximity is observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acrystallization 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ananopores 3aporphyrins 3asynergism 0aOrdered carbonaceous frameworks 0aMicroporous materials 0aSingle-atomic metal species 0aElectrochemistry1 aYoshii, Takeharu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1869-60211 aHiyoshi, Norihito1 aItoh, Tetsuji1 aMaruyama, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8898-70621 aKamiya, Kazuhide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6018-92771 aInoue, M.q(Masataka),1 aTani, Fumito1 aNishihara, Hirotomo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4497-42480 tCarbon.g2023 Jan. 05, v. 201 p.338-346dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245015600171300001400327520194100341592002802282596009402310650001202404650001502416650001302431650001102444650001902455650001502474651002102489700002802510700006202538773013902600856008302739852000902822655001202831IND60763643120221119160354.0220120e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076364312DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-021-01455-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Smriti10aSeven Decades of Dimensional and Mass Balance Changes on Dokriani Bamak and Chhota Shigri Glaciers, Indian Himalaya, Using Satellite Data and Modelling  ap. 37-54.  aIn the present study, dimensional (glacier area and snout position) and mass balance changes of Dokriani Bamak (central Himalaya) and Chhota Shigri (western Himalaya) glaciers have been investigated over the last seven decades using satellite data and modelling. Dimensional changes were investigated using satellite data from Corona (1968–1971), Landsat TM/ETM+ (1993–2010) and Sentinel-MSI (2020) along with limited field checks, while annual and seasonal mass balances on both the glaciers were reconstructed using a simple temperature-index model since 1950. Dokriani Bamak and Chhota Shigri glaciers showed deglaciation and retreat over 1968–2020 with limited areal and snout changes up to 1990s, and then accelerated rates in the twenty-first century, especially after ~ 2010. The mean annual glacier-wide mass balances were computed as − 0.09 ± 0.35 m w.e./y and − 0.12 ± 0.28 m w.e./y with equivalent cumulative mass wastage of − 6.33 m w.e. and − 8.61 m w.e. on Dokriani Bamak and Chhota Shigri glaciers over 1950–2020, respectively. Both the glaciers showed decadal positive mass balances over 1950–1980s followed by a limited wastage over 1980–2000, and an accelerated decadal mass wastage post-2000, in agreement with decreasing glacier velocities. As a result of an accelerated post-2000 wastage, a western tributary glacier detached from the Chhota Shigri Glacier, providing much higher deglaciation rate on Chhota Shigri Glacier compared to Dokriani Bamak Glacier. The present study revealed that mass balance exerts significant control on deglaciation and retreat of both the glaciers. Though the mass wastage patterns were roughly similar on both the glaciers, Chhota Shigri Glacier showed consistently lower terminus retreat than that of the Dokriani Bamak Glacier because of the presence of thick debris cover and local steep topographic settings around glacier snout.  aPublisher supplied data  aCRG/2020/004478cdepartment of science and technology, ministry of science and technology 3aLandsat 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3atopography 3aHimalayan region1 aGarg, Purushottam Kumar1 aAzam, Mohd.

Total iron in the mine waters is typically 10–100 mg L⁻¹, with values up to 2100 mg L⁻¹. Between 30 and 80% of the total iron occurs as solid phase, of which 20 to 80% is nano-particulate. Nano-particulate iron comprises 20 to 70% of the nominally “dissolved” (i.e. <0.45 μm) iron. Since coagulation and sedimentation are the only processes required to remove solid phase iron, these data have important implications for the generation or consumption of acidity during water treatment. In most waters, the majority of truly dissolved iron occurs as Fe(ii) (average 64 ± 22%). Activities of Fe(ii) do not correlate with pH and geochemical modelling shows that no Fe(ii) mineral is supersaturated. Removal of Fe(ii) must proceed via oxidation and hydrolysis. Except in waters with pH < 4.4, activities of Fe(iii) are strongly and negatively correlated with pH. Geochemical modelling suggests that the activity of Fe(iii) is controlled by the solubility of hydrous ferric oxides and oxyhydroxysulfates, supported by scanning and transmission electron microscopic analysis of solids. Nevertheless, the waters are generally supersaturated with respect to ferrihydrite and schwertmannite, and are not at redox equilibrium, indicating the key role of oxidation and hydrolysis kinetics on water treatment. Typically 70–100% of iron is retained in the treatment systems. Oxidation, hydrolysis, precipitation, coagulation and sedimentation occur in all treatment systems and – independent of water chemistry and the type of treatment system – hydroxides and oxyhydroxysulfates are the main iron sinks. The electrochemical data thus reveal the rationale for incomplete iron retention in individual systems and can thus inform future design criteria. The successful application of this low cost and rapid electrochemical method demonstrates its significant potential for real-time, on-site monitoring of iron-enriched waters and may in future substitute traditional analytical methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acoagulation 3acoal 3aelectrochemistry 3aferric oxide 3aferrihydrite 3ahydrochemistry 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxides 3airon 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3apH 3asolubility 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avoltammetry 3awastewater 3awater treatment1 aAplin, Andrew C.,1 aHorrocks, B.

Therefore, through a study in the region of Aragón, Spain, the main circular economy-related activities implemented by a sample of 52 businesses are classified into four levels as an approach to the change process that firms can undergo to adopt the circular economy. In summary, it can be stated that circular economy-related activities are being introduced by businesses progressively, from a minor activity to a greater number of activities, but that these activities do not respond to the incremental closure of material loops within the circular economy framework. The applied indicators enhance the knowledge on the environmental management accounting applied to the CE for the reporting and the relations with stakeholders. In addition, the measurement of the introduction of the circular economy in different businesses is relevant for practitioners and for policy makers, in response to the institutional initiatives for the promotion of the circular economy at the territorial level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3abusiness enterprises 3acircular economy 3aenvironmental management 3aissues and policy 3astakeholders 3aSpain 0aCleaner production 0aCircular economy 0aEnvironmental management accounting 0aSustainability accounting 0aRegional planning1 aPortillo-Tarragona, Pilar1 aScarpellini, Sabina1 aLlena-Macarulla, Fernando0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 247 p.119648-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1196483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010400163300001800267520170200285592002801987650001302015650002002028650001102048650001302059650002602072650001702098650001702115650001402132650001402146650002302160650001302183650001102196650002202207650001102229700002102240773014502261856007402406852000902480655001202489IND60662046520221121085630.0190904e20120727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066204652DNAL7 a10.1039/c2em10849f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaseiro, Alexandre10aVariations in wood burning organic marker concentrations in the atmospheres of four European cities  ap. 2261-2269.  aThe particulate emissions from biomass burning are a growing concern due to the recent evidence of their ubiquitous and important contribution to the ambient aerosol load. A possible strategy to apportion the biomass burning share of particulate matter is the use of organic molecular tracers. Anhydrosugars (levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan), together with two organic acids (dehydroabietic and pimaric acids), were previously reported as organic markers for particulate wood burning emissions. These five compounds were studied in four European cities (Helsinki, Copenhagen, Birmingham and Oporto), at both a Roadside and an Urban Background station, during a summer and a winter campaign in the fine (PM₂.₅) and the coarse (PM₁₀–₂.₅) size-fractions of the ambient aerosol. Levoglucosan concentrations were highest in the city of Oporto. In winter, levoglucosan was more present in the fine fraction but in summer, concentrations were similar in both size fractions. Levoglucosan concentrations in the fine size fraction were higher in winter, but no seasonal differences were observed for the coarse size fraction. The lack of difference between the Roadside and Urban Background levoglucosan concentrations points towards a regional nature of this type of pollution. Wood burning was estimated to contribute to about 3.1% of the winter PM₁₀ mass in Oporto, and to 3.7% in Copenhagen. Mannosan followed the trends exhibited by levoglucosan. The ratio between the levoglucosan and mannosan concentrations allowed determination of a preference for softwood over hardwood in all four cities. Galactosan, pimaric acid and dehydroabietic acid were found to be minor compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abiomass burning 3acities 3ahardwood 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3apimaric acid 3apollution 3aroadsides 3aseasonal variation 3asoftwood 3asummer 3atracer techniques 3awinter1 aOliveira, Cesar,0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2012 July 27, v. 14, no. 8 p.2261-2269dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2em10849f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03630naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012900169300001600298520166600314592002801980650002502008650001802033650002202051650002502073650001702098650001502115650002402130650000702154650002102161650002502182650003302207650001602240650001202256653001602268653001602284653001602300653001702316653003602333653001202369653000802381653000902389653000802398653000702406653000902413653000902422653000802431653000802439653000802447653000902455653001202464653000802476653000902484653001002493653001302503653001302516653001302529653000802542653000902550653000802559653001302567653001202580700002002592700001602612700002002628700001702648773011202665856008602777852000902863655001202872IND50059306920221118021236.0190408e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005930692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Khar Ling10aOptimization of enzymatic hydrolysis of palm kernel cake protein (PKCP) for producing hydrolysates with antiradical capacity  ap. 725-731.  aThe enzymatic hydrolysis of palm kernel cake protein (PKCP) with trypsin to obtain PKCP hydrolysates (PKCPH) was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). A central composite design (CCD) was used to study the influence of four independent variables, namely pH, hydrolysis temperature (°C), substrate concentration (w/v) and enzyme/substrate (w/w) ratio on the degree of hydrolysis (DH%). The hydrolysis was carried out using different combinations of four hydrolytic parameters at five levels for 6h. The CCD consisted of 24 experimental points and six replicates of the central points. The data were analyzed using Design-Expert Software. The results showed that all of the variables evaluated significantly influenced the DH% in a second polynomial model, and different combinations of parameters were generated to obtain three different levels of DH (30%, 40% and 50%), namely PKCPH 30, PKCPH 40 and PKCPH 50. The PKCPH with different DH% showed significantly different antiradical properties (p<0.05). The PKCPH 50 preparation had the lowest EC50 value for DPPH radical scavenging capacity (0.14mg/ml). In the ABTS+ radical scavenging capacity and PCL-ACW (photo chemiluminescence-antiradical capacity of water soluble substances) assays, PKCPH 50 showed the highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity value (326.67±5.77μmol TEAC/g) and ascorbic acid equivalent value (11.43±0.03μg AAE/mg) of the preparations tested. Moreover, the protein hydrolysates also exhibited a notable reducing effect in a dose-dependent manner. Optimum conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis of PKCP were established in this study to produce an antiradical agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acomputer software 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3amathematical models 3apH 3apalm kernel cake 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3atrypsin 0aAntioxidant 0aAntiradical 0aHydrolysate 0aOptimization 0aPKCP (palm kernel cake protein) 0aTrypsin 0aAAE 0aABTS 0aCCD 0aDH 0aDPPH 0aEC50 0aFCR 0aGAE 0aHCl 0aNaOH 0aPCL-ACW 0aPKC 0aPKCP 0aPKCPH 0aPKCPH 30 0aPKCPH 40 0aPKCPH 50 0aRSM 0aTEAC 0aTPC 0aTrolox® 0aRP-HPLC1 aAyob, Mohd Khan1 aSaid, Mamot1 aOsman, Md Anuar1 aIsmail, Amin0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 May, v. 43 p.725-731dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245008700177300001600264520102800280592002801308650001201336650001001348650001801358650002301376650001401399650001701413650001301430650001001443650001201453650002001465650001501485650001201500653002101512653002201533653001801555653001801573700002601591773010601617856008801723852000901811655001201820IND60625092120221120175627.0210124e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062509212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.11.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChitaka, Takunda Y.10aAccumulation and characteristics of plastic debris along five beaches in Cape Town  ap. 451-457.  aBeach accumulation surveys can be used as a proxy to estimate litter flows into the marine environment. However, litter loads can be influenced by various factors including catchment area characteristics, weather conditions and ocean water movements. This complexity is evidenced by the results of five beach surveys conducted in Cape Town in 2017. Observed average litter accumulation rates across the beaches ranged from 36 to 2961 items·day⁻¹·100 m⁻¹. Item mass ranged from 0.01–367 g, with items weighing <1 g contributing 61–85% of count. Plastic items accounted for 94.5–98.9% of total count and this prevalence appears to have increased relative to older data (1989–1994). The top ten identifiable items accounted for 40–57% of plastic debris. Nine of these were associated with foods commonly consumed on-the-go, including polystyrene packaging, snack packets and straws. A mitigation approach focused on these items may address one third to one half of marine litter sources in Cape Town.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3afoods 3amarine debris 3amarine environment 3apackaging 3apolystyrenes 3aseawater 3astraw 3asurveys 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3aweather 0aMarine pollution 0aPlastic pollution 0aBeach surveys 0aMarine litter1 aBlottnitz, Harro von,0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Jan., v. 138 p.451-457dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.11.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245011800204300001400322520197900336592002802315650001302343650001102356650001602367650001002383650001402393650001902407650001502426650001502441651002102456651001002477651001602487700006002503700001202563700001902575700002102594700002002615700002502635773013902660856008302799852000902882655001202891IND60763643320221119160819.0220120e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076364332DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-021-01452-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Ankit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0374-297X10aUpdated Glacial Lake Inventory of Indus River Basin based on High-Resolution Indian Remote Sensing Satellite Data  ap. 73-98.  aA comprehensive updated inventory of glacial lakes in the Indus River basin (up to the Indian administrative boundary) has been carried out using 157 high-resolution Indian Remote Sensing satellite images, mostly covering mountainous region of the Western Himalayas and Karakoram Ranges. Glacial lakes are classified in ten different types depending upon dam type, process of lake formation, topographic feature, and geographical position. Distribution of glacial lakes has been studied in terms of area, type, area versus type, elevation, elevation versus type, and area versus elevation at basin and subbasin levels, along with Indian administrative and transboundary region level. A total of 5335 glacial lakes ≥ 0.25 ± 0.06 ha has been inventoried in the Indus River basin covering a total water spread area of 17395.03 ± 1013.28 ha. About 4633 (86.84%) glacial lakes are with < 5 ha in size, whereas remaining lakes, i.e. 702 (13.16%), are with ≥ 5 ha in size, contributing to 34.04 ± 1.63% and 65.96 ± 1.63% of total lake area, respectively. Other glacial erosion types of lake are found to be the maximum with 2516 in number (47.16%) occupying a total lake extent of 8247.44 ± 499.21 ha at 47.42% in the basin. More than half (i.e. 52.43%) of the lakes are situated in the high altitude range of 4001–5000 m amsl and dominated by other glacial erosion type of lakes, i.e. 58.17%.

Here we report on a fluidic nanoprecipitation system (FNPS), capable of fabricating biocompatible Janus polymeric nanoparticles comprised of the FDA-approved polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). The FNPS contains dual inlets, one for each half of the particle, that insert into the precipitation stream. The system provides a one-step approach for production of Janus polymeric particles with submicrometer diameters and is likely amenable to substantial scale-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of biocompatible Janus nanoparticles that encapsulate a hydrophobic drug (paclitaxel) on one side and a hydrophilic drug (doxorubicin hydrochloride) on the other.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiameter 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3apaclitaxel 3apolymers 3asolubility1 aShe, Zhi-Gang1 aWang, Si1 aSharma, Gaurav1 aTrawick-Smith, Jeffrey W.,0 tLangmuir.g2012 Mar. 06, v. 28, no. 9 p.4459-4463dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla20421853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009400171300001500265520190500280592002802185650001202213650001102225650002402236650001302260650001502273650001102288650001902299650000902318650001402327650001502341650001502356651001802371700002302389700006202412773014002474856008302614852000902697655001202706IND60763643420221119160540.0220120e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076364342DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-021-01458-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShivamurthy, Vinay10aForecasting and Evaluation of Impacts and Risk Due to Tidal Anomalies on a Coastal Island  ap. 99-114.  aAssessment and forecasting of exposures, vulnerability and risks due to natural forces are important for the survival and adaptation of local communities. This research intends to understand the risk and impact associated with sea level rise and tidal amplitude on a coastal island located in the cyclogenesis area of the Bay of Bengal. Three scenarios were developed based on tidal amplitudes of 2 m, 4 m and 6 m, respectively, relative to the observed tide heights during extreme events. Land use analysis indicated a severe loss of natural vegetation in the last century, i.e. from 103 to 9 km² with an increase in cultivated spaces by 69 km², and in the last 8 years, post-cyclone Aila built-up spaces have increased by 4.7 km² (2012–2020). Local topography derived from stereo satellite data and the N8 connectivity bathtub model was used to determine flood inundations for various surge amplitudes. Analysis indicates the rising sea levels would inundate additional 275 ha of coastal lands, and built-up spaces would increase by 17.8 km² by 2050. Exposure assessment illustrates that during severe cyclonic events and super cyclonic events, tides engulf 27–187.7 km² landmass in the current era (2020), while by 2050, the cumulative effect of the surge and sea level rise would lead to exposure of 35.7–203.8 km² of the landscape. Risk assessment shows that during a less intense severe cyclonic event, 19.5 ha (2020) and 36.8 ha (2050) of built-up areas towards the east coast would be under high risk, whereas in extremely severe events, the built-up spaces under high risk would increase to 127 ha (2020) and 166 ha (2050) across the island. The analysis shows the importance of forecasting exposures and risks due to the variations in climate and landscapes. The frequency and intensity of low pressures cyclones in the cyclogenesis area are increasing with time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acoasts 3aexposure assessment 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3asea level 3atopography 3avegetation 3aBay of Bengal1 aNarendr, Aishwarya1 aAithal, Bharath H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4323-62540 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2022 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.99-114dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-021-01458-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245013900171520151300310536010801823592002801931650002301959650001801982650001702000650001502017650001602032650001302048650005202061650002602113650002402139650001502163650001002178650001502188650001102203650001002214650003002224650001302254650001402267650001102281651001302292653001502305653002402320653001902344653003102363653001802394700003702412700002802449700003202477700002302509700001902532700001902551700002602570773011402596856007802710852000902788655001202797IND60772164420221118081116.0220401e20220322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077216442DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.10.e696312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohd-Yusof, Nur Syafika10aFirst report on metabarcoding analysis of gut microbiome in Island Flying Fox (Pteropus hypomelanus) in island populations of Malaysia  aFlying fox (Pteropus hypomelanus) belongs to the frugivorous bats, which play a crucial role in maintaining proper functioning of an ecosystem and conservation of the environment. Bats are well-known carriers of pathogenic viruses, such as BatCov RaTG13 from the coronavirus family that share 90.55% with SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing recent global pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). However, bats’ possible role as a carrier of pathogenic bacteria is less explored. Here, using metabarcoding analysis through high-throughput sequencing, we explored the gut microbiome composition of different island populations on the east and west coasts of Peninsula Malaysia. The 16S rRNA gene in samples from Redang Island, Langkawi Island, Pangkor Island and Tinggi Island was amplified. Bacterial community composition and structure were analysed with α and β diversity metrics. A total of 25,658 operational taxonomic units at 97% similarity were assigned to eight phyla, 44 families, 61 genera and 94 species of microbes. The Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all populations. Meanwhile, the genera Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, isolated in this study, were previously found in the rectum of other fruit bats. Our analyses suggest that Redang Island and Langkawi Island have high bacteria diversity. Thus, we found geographic locality is a strong predictor of microbial community composition and observed a positive correlation between ecological features and bacterial richness.  aUniversiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia and Ministry of Education Malaysia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aDNA barcoding 3aEnterobacter 3aKlebsiella 3aPseudomonas 3aPteropus 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afoxes 3afrugivores 3afruits 3agenes 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apandemic 3apathogens 3arectum 3aMalaysia 0aFlying Fox 0aPteropushypomelanus 0agut microbiome 0ahigh-throughput sequencing 0ametabarcoding1 aAbdul-Latiff, Muhammad Abu Bakar1 aMohd-Ridwan, Abd Rahman1 aBadrulisham, Aqilah Sakinah1 aOthman, Nursyuhada1 aYaakop, Salmah1 aMd-Nor, Shukor1 aMd-Zain, Badrul Munir0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2022 Mar. 22, v. 10 p.e69631-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.10.e696313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015600160300001800316520188400334592002802218650002102246650001502267650001902282650002302301650001302324650002502337650002702362650002502389700002102414700002102435700002202456700002402478700002202502700002002524773014302544856007402687852000902761655001202770IND60662046720221121085635.0190904e20120502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066204672DNAL7 a10.1039/c2em10861e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArregui, Lucía10aAnalysis of the usefulness of biological parameters for the control of activated sludge wastewater treatment plants in an interlaboratory study context  ap. 1444-1452.  aThe quality of the sludge in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) depends on the suitable colonization of the flocs by microorganisms. Due to the functional importance of these biological constituents, several biological or biological-related parameters have been commonly used for the control of depuration efficiency. According to national and international water regulation recommendations, interlaboratory studies have a great relevance to determine which parameters are more reliable for their extensive application in routine control. However, these studies are also very useful to demonstrate consistency in results from multiple laboratories and to develop reliable and reproducible methodologies which might be necessary for protocol validation and also for accreditation issues to meet regulatory environmental requirements. The main purpose of this work was to assess the results obtained in consecutive interlaboratory assays in order to determine the concordance degree in the application of biological parameters by participating laboratories. Following the international recommendations about these studies, a common working protocol was proposed. Statistical tests indicated that Sludge Index and several routine physical–chemical analyses [V30, Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids (MLSS), Mixed Liquor Volatile Solids (MLVS) and Sludge Volumetric Index (SVI)] show low variability and therefore are suitable tools for laboratory control. Shannon Index and Sludge Biotic Index also presented low variability although a more precise protocol would be necessary, in particular the methodology to count small flagellates. The abundance and identification of protist species showed low concordance among laboratories and three factors were responsible for the low reliability of data: population density, size and morphological distinguishable characters of the specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3adepuration 3amicroorganisms 3apopulation density 3aprotists 3astatistical analysis 3atotal suspended solids 3awastewater treatment1 aLiébana, Raquel1 aRodríguez, Eva,1 aMurciano, Antonio1 aConejero, Francisco1 aPérez-Uz, Blanca1 aSerrano, Susana0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2012 May 2, v. 14, no. 5 p.1444-1452dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2em10861e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011200163300001600275500002000291520168700311592002801998650002402026650001102050650002302061650001502084650000902099650001002108650001302118650002202131650001802153700002202171700002202193700002002215773012402235856007302359852000902432655001202441IND60588037420221122010839.0180103e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058803742DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.123862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorbandt, Daniel M.14aThe effects of topical diclofenac, topical flurbiprofen, and humidity on corneal sensitivity in normal dogs  ap. 160-170.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPURPOSE: To determine the immediate and chronic effects of topical 0.1% diclofenac and 0.03% flurbiprofen on corneal sensitivity in normal canine eyes. ANIMALS STUDIED: Eighteen normal, nonbrachycephalic dogs. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, masked, crossover study was performed. To determine the immediate effects associated with treatment, the study drug was instilled into the eye every 5 min for five doses, and corneal sensitivity of treated and untreated eyes was obtained prior to treatment and every 15 min post‐treatment for 60 min. To determine the chronic effects, the study drug was instilled every 12 h for 30 days, and corneal sensitivity of treated and untreated eyes was obtained prior to treatment on days 0 and 30. A washout period of at least 30 days occurred between drug crossover. Ambient temperature and humidity were measured throughout the study. RESULTS: After multiple instillations, there was no difference in corneal sensitivity between eyes over time for diclofenac (P = 0.67) or flurbiprofen (P = 0.54), with a median sensitivity of 25 mm (1.8 g/mm²). After chronic dosing, there was no difference in corneal sensitivity between eyes over time for diclofenac (P = 0.82) or flurbiprofen (P = 0.56), with a median sensitivity of 35 mm (1.0 g/mm²). Decreasing ambient humidity was associated with an increase in sensitivity measurements (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Neither diclofenac nor flurbiprofen had an effect on corneal sensitivity after multiple‐drops or twice‐daily dosing for 30 days. Ambient humidity may have an effect on corneal sensitivity measurements, with a longer filament length eliciting a blink response at lower humidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acornea 3across-over studies 3adiclofenac 3adogs 3adrugs 3ahumidity 3along term effects 3aophthalmology1 aLabelle, Amber L.1 aMitchell, Mark A.1 aHamor, Ralph E.0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2017 Mar., v. 20, no. 2 p.160-170dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.123863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011800169300001600287500001500303520155300318592002801871650001101899650001101910650001101921650001401932650001201946650001701958650003101975650000702006650001302013650001502026650001402041651001902055653001102074700003002085700002202115700002002137700001802157700002202175700003102197700002402228700001802252700001902270773010902289856008102398852000902479655001202488IND60523213620221117165134.0160608e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052321362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-015-0448-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, Sheila M.10aSporadic hotspots for physico-chemical retention of aquatic organic carbon: from peatland headwater source to sea  ap. 491-504.  a2019-12-06  aFew studies have quantified the role of in-stream processes on net dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively) export from peatland catchments, and those that have offer conflicting evidence. In this study, we evaluated evidence for active organic matter processing under field conditions, via a coordinated campaign across four UK catchments with peatland headwaters, targeted on potential ‘hotspots’ and ‘hot moments’ of physico-chemical carbon cycling. We hypothesised that specific hotspots and hot moments would occur where waters enriched with DOC and POC sourced from headwaters are exposed to: (1) mixing with freshwaters of different pH, conductivity and metal concentrations; and (2) mixing with seawater during autumn when DOC concentrations were at their highest. We observed instances of POC removal in headwaters, and potential for rapid conversion between dissolved and particulate carbon forms and for net removal of peat-derived carbon at confluences further downstream (where observed, on the order of 52–75 % for POC, and 5–44 % for DOC). Estuary transect surveys indicated that up to 30 % of fluvial DOC can be removed under high flow conditions. However, in the majority of cases concentrations remained within the range that would be expected based on conservative transport. These findings indicate that rapid (e.g. solubility-related) processes within the river system may be important but sporadic, thus are unlikely to provide major removal pathways for peat-derived organic carbon.  aPublisher supplied data 3arivers 3amixing 3aautumn 3apeatlands 3asurveys 3acarbon cycle 3aparticulate organic carbon 3apH 3aseawater 3awatersheds 3aestuaries 3aUnited Kingdom 0acarbon1 aEvans, C.

We have previously developed a complementary polymer pair system (CPPS) that enables the activity of several enzymes to be controlled by a pair of oppositely charged polymers. However, it failed to control the activity of large and unstable α-amylase because the aggregation of the complex between anionic α-amylase and cationic poly(allylamine) (PAA) induced irreversible denaturation of the enzyme. To address this issue, we herein designed and synthesized a cationic copolymer with a poly(ethylene glycol) backbone, poly(N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEAMA-b-PEG). In contrast to PAA, α-amylase and β-galactosidase were inactivated by PEAMA-b-PEG with the formation of soluble complexes. The enzyme/PEAMA-b-PEG complexes were then successfully recovered from the complex by the addition of anionic poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc). Thus, dispersion of the complex by PEG segment in PEAMA-b-PEG clearly plays a crucial role for regulating the activities of these enzymes, suggesting that PEGylated charged polymer is a new candidate for CPPS for large and unstable enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3abeta-galactosidase 3acomposite polymers 3adenaturation 3aenzyme activity 3aethylene glycol 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyethylene glycol1 aTomita, Shunsuke1 aKudo, Shinpei1 aGanguli, Sumon1 aNagasaki, Yukio1 aShiraki, Kentaro0 tLangmuir.g2012 Mar. 06, v. 28, no. 9 p.4334-4338dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla20433123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245017800156300001600334500002000350520141100370592002801781650002201809650001901831650001301850650001701863650002301880650001301903650000901916650002201925650003101947650000901978650001201987650001301999700001502012700001702027700001702044700001602061700001802077700001802095773011502113856007302228852000902301655001202310IND60571839220221122030442.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057183922DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.122582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArribart, M.10aMagnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Adipose Tissues in the Head of a Common Dolphin (Delphinus delphis): Structure Identification and Influence of a Freezing–Thawing Cycle  ap. 204-212.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to scan the head of a common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) in order to visualize the different adipose tissues involved in echolocation functioning and to precisely delineate their anatomical topology. MRI scans were performed on the head taken from a freshly stranded carcass and repeated after a 2‐week freezing time followed by thawing. The main fatty organs of the head, that is the melon, the mandibula bulba, the bursae cantantes, and their different connections with surrounding tissues were identified and labelled. The nasal sacs, other organs of echolocation, were also identified and labelled thanks to different MRI acquisitions. The shape, the location, the type of MRI signal of each organ and of their different connections were successfully analysed on all images, and then, the images of the head fresh or after thawing were compared. No impacts of the freezing/thawing cycle on the fatty tissues of the head were identified. Different parts were distinguished in the melon on the basis of the MRI signal emitted, corresponding most likely to the internal and external melon already identified by other analytical approaches, and linked to differences in lipid composition. MRI is shown here to be a useful tool to study the functional anatomy of the organs responsible for echolocation in odontocetes, with a particularly high level of precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphinus delphis 3aadipose tissue 3adolphins 3aecholocation 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3ahead 3alipid composition 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3anose 3athawing 3atopology1 aOgnard, J.1 aGuintard, C.1 aDomergue, F.1 aHassani, S.1 aBen Salem, D.1 aJung, J.‐L.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2017 Apr., v. 46, no. 2 p.204-212dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.122583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245011000159300001400269520085600283592002801139650002301167650001201190650001601202650001101218650001301229650002401242650002601266650002101292650002301313653001101336653001101347653001501358653003101373653001201404653001301416700001501429700001501444700001701459700001601476773012101492856007701613852000901690655001201699IND60523915220221120201938.0160807e20160629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052391522DNAL7 a10.1515/sab-2016-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizera, Č.10aEffect of Length of False Banana Fibre (Ensete ventricosum) on Mechanical Behaviour under Tensile Loading  ap. 90-96.  aThe effect of gauge length of false banana fibre (Ensete ventricosum) on the tensile strength, volume energy, and modulus of elasticity under tensile loading was examined. Fibres of gauge length L₀ (mm) 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 mm were prepared and tested until rupture point at strain rate of 0.05 min⁻¹. Mathematical models describing the mechanical behaviour of the varying gauge lengths were presented. With the increasing gauge length of fibre, the tensile strength and volume energy decreased while the values of modulus of elasticity increased. The theoretical model describing the mechanical behaviour of Ensete fibre under tensile loading presented herein provides useful information for the fibres application in industry.

METHODS: Medical records of dogs diagnosed with SARD confirmed by an electroretinogram were reviewed. Breed, age, gender, and weight were recorded when available. The same data were obtained for dogs with SARD described in the veterinary literature. RESULTS: Three hundred and two dogs were included from the ophthalmology practices and 193 dogs from the veterinary literature. Sixty breeds were present in the study. Mixed‐breed dogs were the most common at 108 dogs (21.8%), followed by the Dachshund (68, 13.7%), Chinese Pug (44, 8.9%), Miniature Schnauzer (39, 7.9%), Maltese (23, 4.6%), Cocker Spaniel (22, 4.4%), Bichon Frise (18, 3.6%), Beagle (16, 3.2%), Brittany (15, 3.0%), and Pomeranian (10, 2.0%). Fifty other breeds were represented by 1–9 dogs each. The median age was 9 years (range = 10 months–16 years). The weight was known for 197 dogs. About 60.9% of dogs were less than 25 pounds, 31.5% were between 25 and 50 pounds, and 7.6% were greater than 50 pounds. Gender was recorded in 393 dogs: 217 female dogs and 176 male dogs. CONCLUSIONS: As previously reported, SARD is most common in middle‐aged to older dogs. Smaller dogs of less than 25 pounds appear overrepresented, while large/giant breed dogs of greater than 50 pounds are infrequently diagnosed. In this study, there was no statistical significance between female and male dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aBichon Frise 3aCocker Spaniel 3aDachshund 3adogs 3aelectroretinography 3afemales 3amacular degeneration 3amales 3amedical records 3amixed breeds 3aophthalmology 3aFrance1 avan der Woerdt, Alexandra1 aGaarder, James E.1 aSapienza, John S.1 aHernandez‐Merino, Elena1 aAbrams, Kenneth1 aChurch, Melanie L.1 aLa Croix, Noelle0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2017 Mar., v. 20, no. 2 p.103-106dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.123703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009200166520134400258592002801602650002201630650002201652650001201674650002301686650001101709650002301720650002201743650001101765650003701776650001301813650001301826650001301839650002201852650002401874650002101898650001401919650003301933650001901966653001501985653001302000653002202013653002102035700001802056700001602074700001902090700001802109700001302127700001602140700001702156773011302173856008602286852000902372655001202381IND60679131220221123033953.0200210e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067913122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1196652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Yaping12aA novel and efficient ammonia leaching method for recycling waste lithium ion batteries  aEffective recycling waste lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are of great economic and environmental benefits. This study proposes a novel and efficient ammonia leaching method for recovering Co and Li from waste LIBs. This method yields a Co and Li leaching rate of 91.16% and 97.57%, respectively, under the optimal conditions (NH₃·H₂O 120 g/L, NH₄HCO₃ 75 g/L, n (Na₂SO₃): n (Co) = 2:1, 353 K, 240 min). Leaching kinetics also show that the speed-limiting step in this process is the interfacial chemical reaction, and the activation energy of Co and Li is 58.45 kJ mol⁻¹ and 50.05 kJ mol⁻¹, respectively. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersion spectrum (EDS), and x-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that the morphology of waste LIB powder are irregular granular and lamellar. Under the optimal condition, however, the leaching residues are scattered particles at a smaller size and the as formed MnCO₃ particles are smooth with a uniform cubic structure. Besides, MnCO₃ and graphite in the leaching residues can be separated and recovered. After that MnCO₃ was further calcined to Mn₃O₄, a precursor for the production of new LIBs. Hence, a new and effective way for spent LIBs circular recycling is put forward, providing another choice for spent LIBs recycling industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3aammonia 3achemical reactions 3acobalt 3aecosystem services 3aelectronic wastes 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene 3aindustry 3aleaching 3alithium batteries 3amanganese carbonate 3amanganese oxides 3arecycling 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium sulfite 0aWaste LIBs 0aRecovery 0aLeaching kinetics 0aAmmonia leaching1 aMeng, Fansong1 aYi, Xiaoxia1 aShu, Jiancheng1 aChen, Mengjun1 aSun, Zhi1 aSun, Shuhui1 aXiu, Fu-Rong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 251 p.119665-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1196653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002000190245005800210300001800268506007600286520135800362592002801720506003701748650001901785650002501804650002501829650001701854650002601871650001301897650001301910650000901923650001101932650001501943700001201958700002001970700002401990700001302014773010702027856008502134852000902219655001202228IND60567789620221207103320.0170426e20170426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056778962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b004782doi7 aPMC54062742pmcid7 a279366262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Man-Cheng10aOxidative Cyclization in Natural Product Biosynthesis  ap. 5226-5333.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOxidative cyclizations are important transformations that occur widely during natural product biosynthesis. The transformations from acyclic precursors to cyclized products can afford morphed scaffolds, structural rigidity, and biological activities. Some of the most dramatic structural alterations in natural product biosynthesis occur through oxidative cyclization. In this Review, we examine the different strategies used by nature to create new intra(inter)molecular bonds via redox chemistry. This Review will cover both oxidation- and reduction-enabled cyclization mechanisms, with an emphasis on the former. Radical cyclizations catalyzed by P450, nonheme iron, α-KG-dependent oxygenases, and radical SAM enzymes are discussed to illustrate the use of molecular oxygen and S-adenosylmethionine to forge new bonds at unactivated sites via one-electron manifolds. Nonradical cyclizations catalyzed by flavin-dependent monooxygenases and NAD(P)H-dependent reductases are covered to show the use of two-electron manifolds in initiating cyclization reactions. The oxidative installations of epoxides and halogens into acyclic scaffolds to drive subsequent cyclizations are separately discussed as examples of “disappearing” reactive handles. Last, oxidative rearrangement of rings systems, including contractions and expansions, will be covered.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3acyclization reactions 3aepoxides 3ahalogens 3airon 3aoxygen 3aoxygenases1 aZou, Yi1 aWatanabe, Kenji1 aWalsh, Christopher,1 aTang, Yi0 tChemical Reviews.g2017 Apr. 26, v. 117, no. 8 p.5226-5333dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.chemrev.6b004783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245009000162300001500252520130600267592002801573650002501601650001201626650001301638650002301651650001201674650001701686650001101703650001001714650001201724650001901736650001201755650001301767651001101780653001601791653002701807653002501834653002001859700001901879700001701898773012201915856007702037852000902114655001202123IND60523915320221120191742.0160807e20160629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052391532DNAL7 a10.1515/sab-2016-00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRušarová, K.10aFactors Limiting Adoption of Technologies by Farmers in Catabola Municipality, Angola  ap. 97-104.  aThe objective of the paper is to define the factors influencing the adoption of animal traction and/or mechanical-power technology in the conditions of Catabola municipality where hand-tool technology is being used on 99.7% of the area cultivated by small farmers. Primary data collection was conducted in the period July–August 2011; semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions were the most frequent methods used. In total, 151 small-scale farmers from 9 villages participated in the survey. Ten factors influencing the dependent variable – level of technology used by farmers in combination with hiring of labour – were defined. The factors were statistically analyzed by ANOVA. The area of cultivated land and the educational level of both parents and children were found to be the factors limiting the process of animal traction or mechanical power adoption by small farmers in the Catabola municipality. In addition, a relatively high rate of child labour was observed. With the exclusion of childless families, 62.7% of small farmer families regularly use children aged 0–14 years for field operations. The results confirm that the factor of hiring extra labour is irrelevant in determining the development in technology use by small farmers in the Catabola municipality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aanimals 3achildren 3aeducational status 3afarmers 3afocus groups 3ahiring 3alabor 3aparents 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3avillages 3aAngola 0ahuman power 0ahired and child labour 0ahand-tool technology 0aanimal traction1 aMazancová, J.1 aHavrland, B.0 tScientia Agriculturae Bohemica.g2016 June 29, v. 47, no. 2 p.97-104dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23174x1805-94307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/sab-2016-00143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245020500168300001600373520172100389592002802110650001402138650002002152650001302172650001902185650001702204650001802221650002502239653001802264653002902282653002102311653002302332700002102355700001802376700001302394700001702407700001202424700005602436773009002492856005102582852000902633655001202642IND60793816420221119221314.0220921e20230105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079381642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jianyu10aNanoarchitectonics of graphene oxide with functionalized cellulose nanocrystals achieving simultaneous dual connections and defect repair through catalytic graphitization for high thermal conductivity  ap. 295-306.  aGraphene, with an extremely high intrinsic thermal conductivity of 5300 W/mK, is of special interest to meet thermal requirements in future wearable and high-power electronic devices. Generally, microscopic graphene sheets can be built into a macroscopic material by using graphene oxide (GO) as the precursor. However, both the defects on the basal plane of GO sheets and the lack of connections at their boundaries induce massive scattering of phonons and a low thermal conductivity. Herein, we solve the problem through the nanoarchitectonics of GO with nano Fe₃O₄ functionalized cellulose nanocrystals (Fe–CNC). During the assembly process, Fe–CNC were compounded with GO homogeneously and formed a composite GO/Fe–CNC film with an aligned lamellar structure. A subsequent thermal reduction at 1500 °C resulted in the generation of Fe/Fe₃C nanoparticles in the matrix of the reduced GO/Fe–CNC. During this process, the reduced GO (R-GO) sheets were dually connected by the Fe/Fe₃C nanoparticles as well as the carbonized cellulose nanocrystals. Furthermore, the defects on the R-GO are repaired by Fe through a catalytic graphitization process. Thus, the scatterings of phonons at the adjacent sheet boundaries and on the basal plane of the R-GO sheets were reduced. A flexible and light weight composite film of reduced GO/Fe–CNC with a thermal conductivity of 1958.14 W/mK was obtained. The thermal conductivity is much higher than that of a pure R-GO film (388.72 W/mK) prepared under the same conditions. This assembly process achieved dual connections and defect repairs simultaneously and it provides an avenue for the design of graphene-based films with a high thermal conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acomposite films 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3athermal conductivity 0aGraphene film 0aCatalytic graphitization 0aDual connections 0aLamellar structure1 aZhang, Xiaojiao,1 aShen, Jieqing1 aPan, Hui1 aChen, Zhixin1 aLi, Yao1 aZhu, Shenmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3145-44460 tCarbon.g2023 Jan. 05, v. 201 p.295-306dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.09.027  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015600169520164100325592002801966650002301994650002402017650001102041650001602052650001202068650001502080650001802095650002302113650002102136650002202157650001502179650001702194650002002211650003302231650002602264650001502290650001202305650001302317650003302330650001802363653003502381653002202416653003102438653003002469653002502499700001602524700001602540700001502556700001602571700002102587773011302608856008602721852000902807655001202816IND60679131320221123033932.0200210e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067913132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1196662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Lingkan10aImproving biohydrogen and biomethane co-production via two-stage dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion of the pretreated seaweed Laminaria digitata  aThe marine macro-alga Laminaria digitata is an abundant brown seaweed, which may be used as a feedstock for gaseous biofuel production via sequential dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion. Various methods, including hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP), hydrothermal dilute acid pretreatment (HTDAP), enzymolysis, and combinations thereof, were employed to depolymerize L. digitata and assess the effects on biohydrogen and biomethane yields. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed that the intact and smooth structure of the seaweed was severely damaged; some micro-pores and debris were generated after HTP (140 °C for 20 min), whilst the undegraded components remained as filamentous structures. The complex carbohydrate polymers in L. digitata constrained the catalytic effects of glucoamylase, leading to limited increase in the yield of carbohydrate monomers. With the aid of H₂SO₄ (1 v/v%) in HTP, depolymerization of biomass and its further conversion to carbohydrate monomers were significantly improved. The yield of total carbohydrate monomers after HTDAP (0.564 g/gVS) was 3.5-fold that in raw biomass; this led to an increase of 60.8% in biohydrogen yield (57.4 mL/gVS) in the first-stage dark fermentation. However, the generation of byproducts such as hydroxymethylfurfural under such harsh conditions impaired the second-stage anaerobic digestion of hydrogenogenic effluent, resulting in a 25.9% decrease in biomethane yield. HTP was considered the optimum pretreatment improving energy conversion efficiency from seaweed to gaseous biofuels by 26.7% as compared to that of the unpretreated L. digitata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaminaria digitata 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abiohydrogen 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acarbohydrates 3acatalytic activity 3adepolymerization 3aenergy conversion 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3afuel production 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amacroalgae 3amethane 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfuric acid 0aCascading bioenergy conversion 0aDark fermentation 0aBiohydrogen and biomethane 0aHydrothermal pretreatment 0aCarbohydrate monomer1 aZheng, Run,1 aLin, Richen1 aDeng, Chen1 aZhou, Junhu1 aMurphy, Jerry D.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 251 p.119666-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1196663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016400172300001400336520163100350592002801981650002402009650001202033650001702045650001102062650001102073650001602084650001402100650001902114650001002133651001302143651001202156651001202168651001302180653001702193653001802210653001002228653001602238653001702254653001602271700001902287773011402306856008602420852000902506655001202515IND60772164820221118081251.0220401e20220325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077216482DNAL7 a10.3897/afrinvertebr.63.763092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoschert, Claire10a﻿Taxonomic revision of the mydas-fly genera Eremohaplomydas Bequaert, 1959, Haplomydas Bezzi, 1924, and Lachnocorynus Hesse, 1969 (Insecta, Diptera, Mydidae)  ap. 19-75.  a﻿AbstractThe genera Eremohaplomydas Bequaert, 1959, Haplomydas Bezzi, 1924, and Lachnocorynus Hesse, 1969 (Diptera: Mydidae: Syllegomydinae) are revised.

In this work we tested the hypothesis of density-dependent individual growth of marble trout with data gathered from multi-year on-going monitoring started in 1996 in three streams (Zakojska, Gorska and Gatsnik) in the Soca and Idrijca river basins (Slovenia). As observed for other salmonid species, marble trout exhibits high plasticity in body size and growth in response to environmental conditions. Age-specific mean lengths are significantly different among the three streams. Despite this variability, the statistical analyses outlined some clear patterns. Mean lengths of marble trout cohorts aged ≥1+ are correlated with total population density in the first year of life of the cohorts; the age-specific relationship between mean length and total density is well explained by negative power curves. Length of marble trout at age 1+ is significantly correlated with length at subsequent years up to age 4+. ANCOVAs performed on the stream-specific datasets showed a significant effect of total density of marble trout on annual age-specific individual growth rates. Von Bertalanffy’s body growth models were calibrated on length–age data of Zakojska and Gorska marble trout. Our analysis shows the existence of density-dependent effects on growth of marble trout that might be crucial in regulating population dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo 3abiogeography 3abody size 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographical distribution 3agrowth models 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3astatistical analysis 3atrout 3awatersheds 3aSlovenia1 aCrivelli, Alain J.,1 aJesensek, Dusan1 aRubin, Jean-François,1 aDe Leo, Giulio A.0 tHydrobiologia.g2007 June, v. 583, no. 1 p.57-68dKluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0470-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006900171300001800240520101700258592002801275650001701303650001601320650001701336650002201353650001301375650001901388650003601407650002401443650001701467700001801484700001901502773010701521856008501628852000901713655001201722IND60567789720221117232922.0170426e20170426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056778972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b005232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoutiez, Mireille10aAminoacyl-tRNA-Utilizing Enzymes in Natural Product Biosynthesis  ap. 5578-5618.  aAminoacyl-tRNAs were long thought to be involved solely in ribosome-dependent protein synthesis and essential primary metabolism processes, such as targeted protein degradation and peptidoglycan synthesis. About 10 years ago, an aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic valanimycin was discovered in a Streptomyces strain. Far from being an isolated case, this discovery has been followed by the description of an increasing number of aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent enzymes involved in secondary metabolism. This review describes the three groups of aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent enzymes involved in the synthesis of natural products. Each group is characterized by a particular chemical reaction, and its members are predicted to share a specific fold. The three groups are cyclodipeptide synthases involved in diketopiperazine synthesis, LanB-like dehydratases involved in the posttranslational modification of ribosomal peptides, and transferases from various biosynthesis pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces 3aantibiotics 3abiosynthesis 3adiketopiperazines 3apeptides 3apeptidoglycans 3apost-translational modification 3aprotein degradation 3atransferases1 aBelin, Pascal1 aGondry, Muriel0 tChemical Reviews.g2017 Apr. 26, v. 117, no. 8 p.5578-5618dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.chemrev.6b005233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001900170245019100189300001400380520186200394592002802256650001702284650002102301650001702322650001602339650002302355650001302378650002202391650002002413650002502433650001502458650001502473650001102488650001602499650001302515650006602528650002402594650001802618650003902636650002402675650001302699650003302712650004502745650005302790650003202843650002002875700001902895700002102914773007702935856008703012852000903099655001203108IND4473210620221116154909.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447321062DNAL7 a221774792pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2011.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZerbe, Philipp10aMutational analysis of white spruce (Picea glauca) ent-kaurene synthase (PgKS) reveals common and distinct mechanisms of conifer diterpene synthases of general and specialized metabolism  ap. 30-39.  aConifer diterpene synthases (diTPSs) catalyze the multi-step cycloisomerization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate, or copalyl diphosphate, to a variety of diterpenes in general (i.e., primary) and specialized (i.e., secondary) metabolism. Despite their functional diversity, the known conifer diTPSs are structurally closely related, with variations in three conserved domains, α, β and γ. The catalytic specificity of conifer class I and class I/II diTPSs is predominantly determined by the protein environment of the C-terminal class I active site through stabilization of common and unique carbocation intermediates. Using the crystal structure of Taxus brevifolia taxadiene synthase as template, comparative modeling and mutagenesis of the class I diTPS ent-kaurene synthase from Picea glauca (PgKS) was performed to elucidate the catalytic specificity of PgKS relative to spruce diTPSs of specialized metabolism. N-terminal truncations demonstrated a role for the βγ domain in class I enzyme activity for PgKS, facilitating the closure of the class I active site upon substrate binding. Based on position, Arg476 and Asp736 in the C-terminal α domain of PgKS may contribute to this conformational transition and appear critical for catalysis. Consistent with the mechanism of other diTPSs, the subsequent ionization of a copalyl diphosphate substrate and coordination of the diphosphate group is controlled by strictly conserved residues in the DDxxD and NDIQGCKRE motif of PgKS, such as Asn656 and Arg653. Furthermore, Lys478, Trp502, Met588, Ala615 and Ile619 control the enzymatic activity and specificity of PgKS via carbocation stabilization en route to ent-kaurene. These positions show a high level of amino acid variation, consistent with functional plasticity among conifer diTPSs of different functions in general or specialized metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea glauca 3aTaxus brevifolia 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3acatalytic activity 3aconifers 3acrystal structure 3aenzyme activity 3afunctional diversity 3aionization 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3aproteins 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aDiterpenes, Kauranexbiosynthesis. 2aMolecular Structure 2aMutation 2aOrganophosphatesxmetabolism 2aPiceaxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aTaxusxgenetics1 aChiang, Angela1 aBohlmann, Jörg,0 tPhytochemistry.g2012 Feb., v. 74 p.30-39dElsevier Ltdx0031-94227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2011.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245011000203300001600313520161900329592002801948650002401976650001702000650001102017650002102028650004902049650002202098650001202120650001802132650004102150650001302191650002602204650001402230650002202244650003702266653002002303653002102323653001402344653002802358700001402386700001502400700001702415700001602432773009002448856008502538852000902623655001202632IND60793816520221119221420.0220929e20230105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079381652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-476910aPersistent free radicals on carbon nanotubes and their catalytic effect on benzoyl peroxide decomposition  ap. 473-482.  aCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) were found to exhibit a remarkable catalytic effect on the decomposition of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in ethanol at room temperature. The catalytic effects of various carbonaceous materials were investigated by UV spectroscopy. The decomposition reaction for BPO/CNT/ethanol system was studied through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and free radical trapping technique. Those results indicated the decomposition of BPO by CNTs occurred via a free-radical pathway involving benzoate radicals. The catalytic mechanism of CNTs was further investigated through electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The ESR signals with same line shape and g-value were found in multi-walled CNTs, single-walled CNTs, and oxidation product of pyrenol. The persistent free radicals (PFRs) on CNTs were essentially aryloxy radicals ([ArO]•) with spin electrons dispersed on the aromatic plane. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with larger π-conjugated structures and more aryloxy radicals exhibited a stronger electron-transfer ability. Finally, a three-step pathway for CNTs to decompose BPO was proposed: (1) formation of an asymmetric peroxide (ArO-OOCC₆H₅) via free radical exchange; (2) conversion of ArO-OOCC₆H₅ into radicals ([ArO]• and C₆H₅COO•), or ions ([ArO]⁺C₆H₅COO⁻); (3) formation of benzoic acid by hydrogen or proton abstraction. This study offered tremendous insight into the electronic structures and catalytic mechanism of CNTs, and can facilitated their development for ROS production and scavenging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abenzoic acid 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aethanol 3afree radicals 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrogen 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aquantum mechanics 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aCarbon nanotube 0aBenzoyl peroxide 0aCatalysis 0aPersistent free radical1 aYang, You1 aGuan, Yong1 aWei,cDaifu,1 aZheng, Anna0 tCarbon.g2023 Jan. 05, v. 201 p.473-482dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009400167300001100261520162300272592002801895596005901923650002001982650002602002650001202028650001602040650001302056650001502069650001402084650001102098650000902109650001502118650001002133651001002143700005702153700001702210700001902227700002302246700001802269700001602287700001802303700001402321773013202335856008302467852000902550655001202559IND60763644020221119160739.0220130e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076364402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-022-10195-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaojing10aLandslide susceptibility modeling based on remote sensing data and data mining techniques  ap. 50.  aThe main purpose of this study is to apply three advanced landslide susceptibility models (Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), forest by penalizing attributes (FPA), and functional tree (FT)) to evaluate the landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China. Firstly, 12 landslide conditioning factors were prepared based on the local geo-environmental characteristics and relevant studies, including slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), lithology, soil, distance to roads, and distance to rivers. Secondly, a landslide inventory map consisting of 279 landslides was randomly divided into training and validation datasets with the ratio of 70/30. Then, a certainty factors (CF) model was used to analyze the relationship between landslides and the classes of landslide conditioning factors, and a Chi-Squared statistic was used for contribution analysis. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-value) and some statistical parameters are used to compare and verify the three landslide susceptibility models. After comparison and validation, the FPA model should be used as the best model for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Muchuan County in this study. This study can provide valuable information for local governments or organizations to study slope stability. At the same time, the landslide susceptibility map obtained can be a tool for reference for infrastructure planning, engineering design, and disaster mitigation design in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data  a41807285cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3aforests 3ainventories 3aland use 3alandslides 3alithology 3amodels 3asoil 3atopography 3atrees 3aChina1 aHuang, Faming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4428-71331 aFan, Xuanmei1 aShahabi, Himan1 aShirzadi, Ataollah1 aBian, Huiyuan1 aMa, Xiongde1 aLei, Xinxiang1 aChen, Wei0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2022 Jan., v. 81, no. 2 p.50-50dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10195-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007900167300001600246520200200262592002802264650002202292650001802314650001002332650003102342650001002373650001202383650001402395650001602409650001102425650001602436653001302452653001402465653002402479653003202503700001702535700002102552773013302573856008402706852000902790655001202799IND60625092820221120175726.0181207e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062509282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, Alyssa10aMorphometric comparison of the Hesperornithiformes and modern diving birds  ap. 196-207.  aThe Cretaceous Hesperornithiformes are an extinct group of aquatic birds long recognized to have practiced foot-propelled diving. This specialization is seen today in a number of modern avian families (loons, grebes, cormorants, and some ducks) that have convergently derived a diving lifestyle. Historically, hesperornithiforms have usually been compared to modern loons and grebes as analogues. However, these comparisons are based on qualitative observations of skeletal morphology and have never been tested using morphometric data. Studying the morphological details underlying this functional convergence provides an opportunity to better understand the lifestyle of the extinct Hesperornithiformes, particularly in regard to adaptations for foot-propelled diving and ecological niches these birds may have occupied.This study presents a morphometric analysis of the hindlimb of hesperornithiforms and modern foot-propelled diving birds. Measurements were collected from the tarsometatarsus, tibiotarsus, and femur of eight genera of modern birds and six genera of hesperornithiforms. In order to explore variation within the data, a number of different combinations of measurements (for example, tarsometatarsus and tibiotarsus, or tibiotarsus and femur) were subjected to principal components analyses (PCA). The primary reason for investigating the data in different subsets was to increase taxonomic inclusion among the fossil specimens, where missing data was the largest impediment to the study.Results of this study show that hesperornithiforms rarely shared morphospace with loons or grebes, but more often did share morphospace with cormorants and diving ducks. Therefore, loons and grebes may not serve as the most appropriate analogue for the Hesperornithiformes. Use of these sorts of analyses, in conjunction with detailed morphological work, may enhance our understanding of the evolution of complex ecological strategies and niche partitioning among birds and other organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aPhalacrocorax 3aducks 3aecological differentiation 3afemur 3afossils 3alifestyle 3amorphometry 3aniches 3awater birds 0aMesozoic 0aEvolution 0aHesperornithiformes 0aFoot-propelled diving birds1 aWu, Yun-Hsin1 aChiappe, Luis M.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 513 p.196-207dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005500167300001600222520087300238592002801111650001601139650002001155650002401175650001901199650002401218650002101242650002201263650001901285700005901304700006101363773011101424856008201535852000901617655001201626IND60598141720221121220642.0201202e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059814172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2018.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowes, Stuart C10aCorrelative microscopy for structural microbiology  ap. 132-138.  aUnderstanding how microbes utilize their environment is aided by visualizing them in their natural context at high resolution.

The magnetic properties and antitumor activities of 1 have also been studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aaqueous solutions 3acations 3ahydrogen bonding 3amagnetic properties 3asynthesis 3athermal analysis 0aantitumor activity 0apolyoxometalate 0asandwich-type 0asupramolecule1 aMiao, Xisong1 aWang, Hai1 aWu, Yongmei1 aLi, Jun1 aLü, Jing,1 aZhou, Qingyan1 aJu, Hongping0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2016 July 1, v. 71, no. 7 p.783-788dDe GruyterwJournal:23182x1865-71177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2015-02023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100001700164245017100181300001600352520146800368592002801836650002301864650001101887650002501898650001001923650001501933650002101948650002201969650001801991650001302009650001002022650001202032650001902044650003302063650002502096650001502121650002802136650002302164650001902187651001002206651001802216651001002234700002002244773008702264856007902351852000902430655001202439IND60080540620221123031841.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008054062DNAL7 a239560392pmid7 a10.1111/1744-7917.120422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiang10aInvasion history of Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Fujian, China based on mitochondrial DNA and its implications in development of a control strategy  ap. 493-498.  aOne of the most invasive species worldwide, Solenopsis invicta Buren, has been described in China since 2003. Recent studies have suggested that China populations are the result of introductions from the USA; however, detailed molecular studies need to be performed in order to understand the expansion and potential multiple introductions from other countries into China. As there were populations of red imported fire ant, S. invicta in different areas and with different methods of introduction, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene was used as a marker from 12 populations in four cities in Fujian Province, China, to determine the relationship of invasion among these populations. The three most common haplotypes previously describe in invasive populations of S. invicta: H5, H22 and H36, were found in Fujian. However, frequencies in each city were different. For instance, three populations from Longyan city which invaded with waste plastics, shared haplotype H5. Populations from Xiamen city and Jinjiang city which dispersed with nursery stock, sward and scrap leather, shared haplotype H22. The population from Nanyan village of Xinluo district, Longyan city, bore haplotype H36. Mitochondrial data reveals that the invasion history of S. invicta in Fujian Province is complex, including multiple invasions probably from other provinces within China. Security measures to prevent S. invicta spreading within China are as important as from overseas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolenopsis invicta 3acities 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ainvasive species 3amitochondrial DNA 3anursery stock 3aplastics 3asward 2aAnimals 2aAntsxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aGenetics, Population 2aHaplotypes 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aIntroduced Species 2aPhylogeography 3aChina 3aUnited States 0aChina1 aHou, You‐Ming0 tInsect science.g2014 Aug., v. 21, no. 4 p.493-498dBlackwell Pubx1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.120423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245009000158300001600248520156400264592002801828596005501856650001601911650002201927650002401949650002501973700001801998773015502016856007702171852000902248655001202257IND60772739920221119093627.0220714s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077273992DNAL7 a10.13031/trans.134192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Junwei10aParameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis of ORYZA_V3 Model Using the GLUE Method  ap. 941-949.  aThe Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method is one of the popular methods for parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis, although it has been criticized for some drawbacks in numerous studies. In this study, we performed an uncertainty analysis for the ORYZA_V3 model using the GLUE method integrated with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). Different likelihood measures were examined to understand the differences in derived posterior parameter distributions and uncertainty estimates of the model predictions based on a variety of observations from field experiments. The results indicated that the parameter posterior distributions and 95% confidence intervals (95CI) of model outputs were very sensitive to the choice of likelihood measure, as well as the weights assigned to observations at different dates and to different observation types within a likelihood measure. Performance of the likelihood measure with a proper likelihood function based on normal distribution of model errors and the combining method based on mathematical multiplication was the best, with respect to the effectiveness of reducing the uncertainties of parameter values and model predictions. Moreover, only the means and standard deviations of observation replicates were enough to construct an effective likelihood function in the GLUE method. This study highlighted the importance of using appropriate likelihood measures integrated with multiple observation types in the GLUE method.

The anthocyanin was extracted by a maceration method for 72 hours using methanol, and a total extract yield was 21.56% or 1.803 mg/L. Flavonoid and phenol tests showed positive results indicated by the formation of red and black colours. The anthocyanins showed maximum absorption at 578 nm for phosphate buffer and 575 nm for tris HCl buffer solution. The sensor fabrication was performed using a mixture of pectin and chitosan solutions with a ratio of 3:7. The anthocyanin was mixed into the solution with various concentrations. The sensor has an optimum sensitivity at the anthocyanin concentration of 0.05 mg/L (phosphate buffer) in the pH range of 7.0-9.5 and 0.025 mg/L (Tris HCl buffer) with a narrower pH range of 6.0-7.5. This sensor produced higher sensitivity, a wider linear range, and good linearity when it was exposed in 0.03M PBS. Reproducibility test with a relative standard deviation percentage (% RSD) was 9.20. The sensor showed a stable response after 5 minutes exposed to PBS solution, and it can be used to measure pH within the 20th day. The optimized optical pH sensor has been successfully developed as a urea optical biosensor by immobilizing urease on its surface. The biosensor showed a linear response in a series of 10-1-10-10 M urea concentrations and has good linearity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aabsorption 3aanthocyanins 3abiosensors 3achitosan 3aelectrolytes 3aflowers 3amaceration 3amethanol 3apH 3apectins 3aphenol 3aphosphates 3astandard deviation 3aurea 3aurease 0aanthocyanin 0acatharanthus roseus optical ph sensor 0apolyelectrolyte pectin-chitosan 0aurea biosensor1 aSAFITRI, EKA1 aSUHUD, KHAIRI1 aNazaruddin,1 aGINTING, BINAWATI1 aSUSILAWATI1 aSALEHA, SITTI1 aMURNIANA1 aNAZARUDDIN, SALSABILLA LATANSA0 tJurnal Natural (Aceh).g2021 Oct., v. 21, no. 3 p.135-141dUniversitas Syiah KualawJournal:27755x2541-40627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.24815/jn.v21i3.228513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011000168300001600278520086400294592002801158650001201186650002801198650001901226650002101245650001101266650001301277650001101290650001601301650001501317650001601332650000901348650001201357700002401369773012501393856008101518852000901599655001201608IND60575443420221116222355.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057544342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-016-1242-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavares, Ricardo10aPredicting the Poaceae pollen season: six month-ahead forecasting and identification of relevant features  ap. 647-656.  aIn this paper, we approach the problem of predicting the concentrations of Poaceae pollen which define the main pollination season in the city of Madrid. A classification-based approach, based on a computational intelligence model (random forests), is applied to forecast the dates in which risk concentration levels are to be observed. Unlike previous works, the proposal extends the range of forecasting horizons up to 6 months ahead. Furthermore, the proposed model allows to determine the most influential factors for each horizon, making no assumptions about the significance of the weather features. The performace of the proposed model proves it as a successful tool for allergy patients in preventing and minimizing the exposure to risky pollen concentrations and for researchers to gain a deeper insight on the factors driving the pollination season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoaceae 3aartificial intelligence 3abioclimatology 3ahypersensitivity 3amodels 3apatients 3apollen 3apollination 3aprediction 3aresearchers 3arisk 3aweather1 aAznarte, José Luis0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2017 Apr., v. 61, no. 4 p.647-656dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-016-1242-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002200164245011800186300001600304520120500320592002801525650001601553650000801569650001401577650001701591650001001608650001401618650002501632650001301657650000901670650001301679650001201692650001901704650001001723650001401733650001101747650005101758650002101809650001901830650002401849650001201873650001801885650002101903650003101924650001101955650002201966650003201988650002802020650004302048650002102091650004502112700001202157700001302169700002002182700002002202700001902222773008802241856007902329852000902408655001202417IND60080540720221123042108.0150207e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008054072DNAL7 a239559372pmid7 a10.1111/1744-7917.120532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Song‐Dou10aMolecular identification of a pancreatic lipase‐like gene involved in sex pheromone biosynthesis of Bombyx mori  ap. 459-468.  aCytoplasmic lipid droplet (LD) lipolysis is regulated by pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) in Bombyx mori. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of cytoplasm LD lipolysis, the pancreatic lipase‐like gene in B. mori pheromone glands (PGs), designated as B. mori pancreatic lipase‐like gene (BmPLLG), was identified in this study. Spatial expression analysis revealed that BmPLLG is a ubiquitous gene present in all studied tissues, such as PGs, brain, epidermis, egg, midgut, flight muscle and fat body. Temporal expression analysis showed that the BmPLLG transcript begins to express 96 h before eclosion (−96 h), continues to increase, peaks in newly emerged females and steadily decreases after eclosion. Translational expression analysis of BmPLLG using a prepared antiserum demonstrated that BmPLLG was expressed in an age‐dependent pattern at different development stages in B. mori. This finding was similar to the transcript expression pattern. Further RNA interference‐mediated knockdown of BmPLLG significantly inhibited bombykol production. Overall, these results demonstrated that BmPLLG is involved in PBAN‐induced sex pheromone biosynthesis and release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aRNA 3aantiserum 3abiosynthesis 3abrain 3acytoplasm 3adevelopmental stages 3aeclosion 3aeggs 3afat body 3afemales 3aflight muscles 3agenes 3alipolysis 3amidgut 3apheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide 3apheromone glands 3asex pheromones 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBombyxxgenetics 2aFatty Alcoholsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aLipasexanalysisxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeuropeptidesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRNA Interference 2aSex Attractantsxbiosynthesisxgenetics.1 aLi, Xun1 aBin, Zhu1 aDu, Meng‐Fang1 aYin, Xin‐Ming1 aAn, Shi‐Heng0 tInsect science.g2014 Aug., v. 21, no. 4 p.459-468dBlackwell Pub.x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.120533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014600171300001600317520104800333592002801381650002401409650002701433650001001460650001401470650000901484650001501493650002701508650001001535650001201545650001401557650001801571650002401589650001201613653001601625653001301641653001701654653001701671653001401688653002801702700001701730700001901747700001901766700001701785700001801802773012001820856008801940852000902028655001202037IND60630689320221117012450.0201209e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063068932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.2622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenting14aThe occurrence and distribution of hexabromocyclododecanes in freshwater systems, focusing on tissue-specific bioaccumulation in crucian carp  ap. 470-478.  aThe occurrence and distribution of hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) were investigated in freshwater, sediment, and selected crucian carp (Carassius carassius) tissues (muscle, liver, egg, and blood) to evaluate the potential for HBCDs bioaccumulation. The HBCDs concentration ranged from not detected to 0.35ng/L in freshwater, and from 0.037 to 35.4ng/g-dw in sediment. The highest HBCDs concentration was detected in crucian carp liver (5.14±8.15ng/g-ww), followed by egg (3.88±10.1ng/g-ww), blood (0.61±0.63ng/mL), and muscle (0.38±0.70ng/g-ww). In all crucian carp tissues, α-HBCD was the predominant stereoisomer, and the fraction of α-HBCD as a proportion of the total HBCDs in liver tissue (96%) was higher than that in egg tissue (79%). There was a positive correlation between the HBCDs concentration in crucian carp muscle and body size (p<0.01, Spearman). The biota–sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) (0.14) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) (137,000L/kg) values were estimated in crucian carp muscle using field-based data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius carassius 3abioaccumulation factor 3ablood 3abody size 3aeggs 3afreshwater 3ahexabromocyclododecane 3aliver 3amuscles 3asediments 3astereoisomers 3atissue distribution 3atissues 0aRiver water 0aSediment 0aHBCDs source 0aFish tissues 0aBody size 0aBioaccumulation factors1 aChoo, Gyojin1 aCho, Hyeon-Seo1 aPark, Kyunghwa1 aShin, Yu-Jin1 aOh, Jeong-Eun0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 635 p.470-478dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.2623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009200171520098400263592002801247650001401275650002101289650001401310650001801324650002601342650001201368650001301380651001401393653001401407653003101421653001301452653003001465653002801495653002401523700001901547700002401566700005601590700002901646773009401675856008601769852000901855655001201864IND60719564820221117235444.0210723e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071956482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e054262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHandayati, Puji10aDoes entrepreneurship education promote vocational students’ entrepreneurial mindset?  aThis paper aims to explore how entrepreneurship education determines students' entrepreneurial intentions as well as examine the emerging role of the entrepreneurial mindset in supporting this relationship.

Eukaryotes do acquire genes from mitochondria and plastids and they do transfer genes during the process of secondary endosymbiosis, the spread of plastids via eukaryotic algal endosymbionts. From those observations it, however, does not follow that eukaryotes transfer genes either in the same ways as prokaryotes do, or to a quantitatively similar degree. An important illustration of the difference is that eukaryotes do not exhibit pangenomes, though prokaryotes do. Eukaryotes reveal no detectable cumulative effects of LGT, though prokaryotes do. A critical analysis suggests that something is deeply amiss with eukaryote LGT theories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aendosymbionts 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amitochondria 3aplastids 3aprokaryotic cells 3asymbiosis 3awings0 tBioEssays.g2017 Dec., v. 39, no. 12dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2017001153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245010100178300001400279520136200293592002801655596006001683650002701743650001901770650001601789650002901805650002101834650001901855650002601874650001201900650002301912650002001935650001301955650002501968650001801993650001202011650002502023650000902048650000902057650002002066700001802086700001802104700001802122700001902140773013102159856008102290852000902371655001202380IND60627324520221116215947.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062732452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-018-9961-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFawibe, Oluwasegun Olamide10aGreenhouse gas emissions from rice field cultivation with drip irrigation and plastic film mulch  ap. 51-62.  aGround cover rice production system is a promising technique with potentials to alleviate the effect of the increasing water-scarcity on rice production. Hence, finding appropriate management practices under this system is crucial for reducing global warming without yield loss. In this study, CH₄ and N₂O were quantified and contrasted in drip irrigation with plastic-film-mulch system (DP) and a continuous flooded rice cultivation system (CF) during two rice growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. The range of methane fluxes observed between irrigation regimes was (− 0.36 to 0.43 mg m⁻² h⁻¹) and (− 0.77 to 4.66 mg m⁻² h⁻¹) in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The cumulative CH₄ emissions in 2017 under CF and DP were 16 times and 5 times higher than in 2016 respectively. DP reduced cumulative CH₄ flux by 194% and 69% in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared to CF. Emissions of N₂O were low and insignificant for both irrigation regimes. Grain yields were comparable between irrigation regimes with an insignificant reduction of 19% and 5% under DP in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The GWP of the 2-year average was 89% reduced under DP compared to CF. Our findings demonstrated that the DP mitigated GHGs while sustaining rice yield as a result of low nitrogen fertilization application and intermittent soil saturation level.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP 16K07570cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3afertilizer application 3aglobal warming 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3agrowing season 3airrigation management 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicroirrigation 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3apaddies 3aplastic film mulches 3arice 3asoil 3awater shortages1 aHonda, Kanako1 aTaguchi, Yuki1 aPark, Sangsoo1 aIsoda, Akihiro0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2019 Jan., v. 113, no. 1 p.51-62dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55283x1385-13147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-018-9961-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007700168300002000245520158200265592002801847650002001875650001101895650001901906650001401925650002101939650001101960650001701971650001501988650001202003650001602015651001002031700002302041700002302064700002102087700002202108773014902130856008102279852000902360655001202369IND60547990920221119071745.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054799092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4319-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElkafoury, Ahmed10aDevelop dynamic model for predicting traffic CO emissions in urban areas  ap. 15899-15910.  aThe greater the use of energy in the transportation sectors, the higher the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), and hence inevitable harm to environment and human health. In this concern, measuring and predicting of CO emission from transportation sector—especially large cities—is important as it constitute 90 % of all CO emission. Many urban cities in developing world have not properly experienced such measurements or predictions. In this paper, for the first time, field measurements of traffic characteristics data and corresponding CO concentration have been performed for developing a model for predicting CO emissions from transportation sector for New Borg El Arab (NBC), Egypt. The performance of Swiss-German Handbook Emission Factors for Road Transport (HBEFA v3.1) model has been assessed for predicting the CO concentration at roadside in the study area. Results indicated that HBEFA v3.1 underestimate emission figures. The developed CO dynamic emission model involves the traffic flow characteristics with roadside CO concentrations. Acceptable representation of measured CO concentration has been shown by the developed dynamic CO emission model which introduces R ² = 0.77, mean biases and frictional biases of −0.27 mg m⁻³ and 0.09, respectively. A comparison between predicted CO concentrations using HBEFA v3.1 and the promoted dynamic model indicate that HBEFA v3.1 estimates CO emission concentrations in the study area with a mean error and frictional biases 159.26 and 233.33 %, respectively, higher than those of the developed model.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acities 3adynamic models 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3ahuman health 3aprediction 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3aEgypt1 aNegm, Abdelazim M.1 aAly, Mohamed Hafez1 aBady, Mahmoud F.1 aIchimura, Teijiro0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Aug., v. 23, no. 16 p.15899-15910dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4319-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245010600165300001800271520178300289592002802072596004502100650002002145650002102165650001902186650001602205650002102221650001302242650001302255650001902268650001502287650001802302650001302320651002902333700002302362700002502385700002202410700002002432773015702452856007702609852000902686655001202695IND60772740320221119093517.0220409s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077274032DNAL7 a10.13031/trans.134312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeilhauer, Mary G.10aNitrate Removal by Floating Treatment Wetlands Amended with Spent Coffee: A Mesocosm-Scale Evaluation  ap. 1619-1630.  aHighlightsA floating treatment wetland design was evaluated for water quality improvements.Nitrate-N removal rates were quantified using spent coffee grounds as a carbon source.Nitrate-N removal rates increased throughout the growing season Abstract. The Midwestern U.S. is vulnerable to eutrophic conditions from high nutrient concentrations. Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are an innovative wetland design for nutrient removal from nonpoint sources and provide a unique treatment. The objectives of this project were to quantify nitrate removal in traditional and carbon-amended FTWs planted with Midwestern plant species during the establishment year. Three greenhouse experiments were conducted throughout the growing season using 18 mesocosms. Two vegetation designs were evaluated: rush species (and) and diverse species (, , , , , and). Spent coffee grounds were applied to 9 of the 18 mesocosms as a carbon amendment. Nitrate-N removal increased during the establishment growing season in the FTW systems (Spring: 15.0% to 17.3%, Summer 1: 82.8% to 92.6%, Summer 2: 86.4% to 94.7%). Nitrate-N removal was also impacted by carbon amendments (FTW without amendment: 82.8% to 94.7%, FTW with amendment: 88.4% to 96.1%). Carbon additions were found to enhance denitrifying conditions even in the absence of FTWs (decreased dissolved oxygen, increased available organic carbon). Significant differences in nitrate-N removal were not observed between FTW vegetation designs. This study provides new insight on the impacts of the growing season, plant species, and carbon amendments on FTW nitrate-N removal performance during the establishment year.

(Merrill)) to Bradyrhizobium Inoculation, Lime, and Phosphorus Applications at Bako, Western Ethiopia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil acidity and poor soil fertility are the major soil chemical constraints which limit crop productivity in western Ethiopia. In leguminous crops, low productivity is not only a result of declining soil fertility but also reduced N₂ fixation due to biological and environmental factors. Thus, this study was carried out to determine the influence of lime, Bradyrhizobium inoculation, and phosphorus fertilizer on soybean yield components and yields and to identify economically feasible treatments that can maximize the productivity of soybean. Factorial combinations of three Bradyrhizobium strains (uninoculated, TAL379, and Legumefix), two lime levels (0 and 3.12 t ha⁻¹), and four P levels (0, 23, 46, and 69 kg P₂O₅ ha⁻¹) were laid out in RCBD with three replications. The results showed that the application of lime (3.12 t ha⁻¹) significantly increased soil pH (5.6), plant height (77.2 cm), number of primary branches per plant (6.6), 100-seed weight (17.5 g), grain yield (3431 kg ha⁻¹), and harvest index (41%). Similarly, significantly higher grain yield (3228 kg ha⁻¹) and harvest index (41%) were obtained with inoculation of TAL379 whereas Legumefix inoculation recorded the highest number of primary branches (6.7). The effect of P at 69 kg P₂O₅ ha⁻¹also gave significantly higher plant height (75.5 cm), number of primary branches (6.6), grain yield (3277 kg ha⁻¹), and harvest index (43%). The interaction of P and Bradyrhizobium inoculation significantly influenced days to physiological maturity and number of pods per plant. Similarly, the interaction of phosphorus and lime significantly influenced days to 50% flowering. Likewise, the combination of lime (3.12 t ha⁻¹) with TAL379 inoculation gave the highest aboveground biomass. On the other hand, the interaction of Bradyrhizobium × lime × phosphorus revealed that application of 69 kg P₂O₅ ha⁻¹ without TAL379 inoculation under limed condition significantly resulted in the highest number of nodules per plant (79.4) and number of effective nodules (67.9). Thus, it can be concluded that, particularly in the western part of Ethiopia where soil acidity is a major problem, application of phosphorus with Bradyrhizobium and lime is an alternative option to enhance biological nitrogen fixation and grain yield of soybean in smallholder farming system.  aPublisher supplied data  aIIT021cFederal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development 3aBradyrhizobium 3aGlycine max 3aaboveground biomass 3aagronomy 3aeconomic feasibility 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3anitrogen fixation 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplant height 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asoybeans 3aEthiopia1 aTana, Tamado0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2021 May 24, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/66869573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014200165300001600307520178400323592002802107650001002135650002502145650002202170650001002192650001002202650001802212650001102230650001102241650002602252650003102278650001402309650001502323650001502338650001802353650001402371650001102385650001202396650001002408650001002418653000802428653003802436653000902474653001002483653001002493700001602503700001702519700001802536700001602554700001802570773014302588856008502731852000902816655001202825IND60564525420221121051324.0190318e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056452542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2017.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Bei, R.10aRapid measurement of total non-structural carbohydrate concentration in grapevine trunk and leaf tissues using near infrared spectroscopy  ap. 176-183.  aCarbohydrate assays are commonly used in crops and plant research to understand the way in which carbohydrates are allocated within the vine and to assess its influence on the physiology and phenology of the plant. Total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration is normally assessed by wet chemistry methods which are time consuming and costly, especially when studying carbohydrate dynamics over seasons. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a fast and easy technique that has lately gained wide acceptance for the analysis of the chemical composition of grain, food, wine, pharmaceutical products, among others. Near infrared is the region of the electromagnetic spectrum between 750nm and 2500nm and it is used to gather information on the relative proportions of CH, NH and OH bonds of the organic molecules. This study collected NIR spectra from grapevine trunk and leaf tissues, measured TNC concentration of the same samples using a wet chemical method and compared the results using multivariate data analysis to develop a rapid procedure for the estimation of TNC concentration in grapevine tissues. Results showed that NIR spectroscopy could be used to predict starch and TNC concentration in freeze-dried and ground grapevine trunk and leaf tissues. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that a robust universal model could be applied to the prediction of TNC in both leaves and trunks. Therefore, this method could be used as a practical tool for a rapid screening of TNC concentration for high temporal and spatial assessment of grapevine tissues at given phenological stages. The main advantages of this technique over traditional methods are the rapidity and the ease-of-use protocol in routine analysis, which allows a considerable reduction of costs and time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3achemical composition 3achemical elements 3acrops 3adrugs 3afreeze drying 3aleaves 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aphenology 3aphysiology 3aprediction 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3astarch 3atissues 3avines 3awines 0aNIR 0aTotal non-structural carbohydrate 0aLeaf 0aTrunk 0aVitis1 aFuentes, S.1 aSullivan, W.1 aEdwards, E.J.1 aTyerman, S.1 aCozzolino, D.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 136 p.176-183dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100001800164245011500182300001600297520169600313592002802009650001602037650002202053650001602075650001002091650001302101650002002114650001202134650001102146650001102157650001902168650001002187650003002197650000902227650001602236650001402252650002002266650001202286650003402298650003602332650004302368650003302411650003702444650003402481650004002515650000902555700002002564700001502584700002302599700001502622700001902637700002002656700002102676700001802697700002002715773008702735856007902822852000902901655001202910IND60080541120221120204113.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008054112DNAL7 a241240132pmid7 a10.1111/1744-7917.120632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dan‐Dan14aThe expression analysis of silk gland‐enriched intermediate‐size non‐coding RNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori  ap. 429-438.  aSmall non‐protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in development, stress response and other cellular processes. Silkworm is an important model for studies on insect genetics and control of Lepidopterous pests. We have previously identified 189 novel intermediate‐size ncRNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori, including 40 ncRNAs that showed altered expression in different developmental stages. Here we characterized the functions of these 40 ncRNAs by measuring their expressions in six tissues of the fifth instar larvae using Northern blot and real‐time polymerase chain reaction assays. We identified nine ncRNAs (four small nucleolar RNAs and five unclassified ncRNAs) that were enriched in silk gland, including four ncRNAs that showed silk gland‐specific expression. We further showed that three of nine silk gland‐enriched ncRNAs were predominantly expressed in the anterior silk gland, whereas another three ncRNAs were highly accumulated in the posterior silk gland, suggesting that they may play different roles in fibroin synthesis. Furthermore, an unclassified ncRNA, Bm‐152, exhibited converse expression pattern with its antisense host gene gartenzwerg in diverse tissues, and might regulate the expression of gartenzwerg through RNA‐protein complex. In addition, two silk gland‐enriched ncRNAs Bm‐102 and Bm‐159 can be found in histone modification complex, which indicated that they might play roles through epigenetic modifications. Taken together, we provided the first expression and preliminary functional analysis of silk gland‐enriched ncRNAs, which will help understand the molecular mechanism of silk gland‐development and fibroin synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aNorthern blotting 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahistones 3ainsect genetics 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amodels 3anon-coding RNA 3apests 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asilk 3asilk glands 3asilkworms 3astress response 2aAnimals 2aBombyxxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFibroinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLarvaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Nucleolarxmetabolism 2aRNA, Untranslatedxmetabolism 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSilk1 aLiu, Zong‐Cai1 aHuang, Lei1 aJiang, Qian‐Ling1 aZhang, Kun1 aQiao, Hui‐Li1 aJiao, Zhu‐Jin1 aYao, Lun‐Guang1 aLiu, Ren‐Yi1 aKan, Yun‐Chao0 tInsect science.g2014 Aug., v. 21, no. 4 p.429-438dBlackwell Pubx1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.120633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002300187245008500210300001800295506007600313520021700389592002800606506003700634650002600671650002100697650001300718650001100731650001500742650002500757651001100782700002000793700002300813700001800836700002600854700001900880700001800899700001900917773012700936856008001063852000901143655001201152IND60128104620221207120007.0150501e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012810462DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00144-152doi7 aPMC43950632pmcid7 a257920622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorcellato, Davide10aDraft Genome Sequence of Lactobacillus kunkeei AR114 Isolated from Honey Bee Gut  ap. e00144-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLactobacillus kunkeei is a common inhabitant in honey bee gut, being present in several parts of the world.

To promote the environmental protection strategy of sustainable development, environmentally friendly biopolymers were used to treat typical silt samples collected from the Yellow River Basin. The water retention characteristics and vegetation growth of the treated silt were evaluated, and the microscopic mechanism of the water retention characteristics was investigated. The results show that the water retention capacity of the treated silt increased upon increasing the ratio of xanthan gum, gellan gum, and guar gum, with gellan gum performing better than the other two gums. The biopolymers had no discernible effect on the vegetation germination, but effectively promoted vegetation growth with a significantly lower wilting rate than that of the untreated soil. The soil treated with xanthan gum had the highest germination rate and vegetation growth height, while soil treated with gellan gum had the lowest wilting rate. The superior performance of gellan gum and xanthan gum can be attributed to their hydrophilicity and adhesion. These gums directly interact with the surface of charged clay particles in the soil pore space to closely connect the particles, reduce water loss, and increase the water retention capacity. The better soil water retention capacity is associated with improved germination and vegetation growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiopolymers 3acement 3aclay 3aenvironmental protection 3agellan gum 3agermination 3aguar gum 3ahydrophilicity 3aresearch 3asilt 3asoil pore system 3asoil water retention 3asustainable development 3atillage 3avegetation 3awater holding capacity 3awatersheds 3axanthan gum 3aYellow River 0aSilt 0aBiopolymer 0aWater retention characteristics 0aVegetation growth 0aMicroscopic1 aZhao, Xinxin1 aZhang, Junran1 aJiang, Tong1 aWang, Shaokai1 aZhao, Jindi1 aMeng, Zhihao0 tSoil & tillage research.g2023 Jan., v. 225 p.105544-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.1055443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245007900179300001600258520103100274536004701305592002801352596004601380650001601426650001501442650001601457653001901473653002001492653002601512653001601538653002301554773012201577856008501699852000901784655001201793IND60687579320221120201352.0200402e20200311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068757932DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2019.17053022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoutsoyiannis, Demetris10aSimple stochastic simulation of time irreversible and reversible processes  ap. 536-551.  aAs time irreversibility of streamflow is marked for time scales up to several days, while common stochastic generation methods are good only for time-symmetric processes, the need for new methods to handle irreversibility, particularly in flood simulations, has been recently highlighted. From an investigation of the historical evolution of existing stochastic generation methods, which is a useful step before proposing new methods, the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches are located. Following this investigation, a generic solution to the stochastic generation problem is proposed. This is an analytical exact method based on an asymmetric moving-average scheme, capable of handling time irreversibility in addition to preserving the second-order stochastic structure, as well as higher-order marginal statistics, of a process. The method is studied theoretically in its general setting, as well as in its most interesting special cases, and is successfully applied to streamflow generation at an hourly scale.  aNo funding was provided for this research.  aPublisher supplied data  cNo funding was provided for this research 3amethodology 3astatistics 3astream flow 0atime’s arrow 0airreversibility 0astochastic simulation 0atime series 0aMonte Carlo method0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2020 Mar. 11, v. 65, no. 4 p.536-551dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2019.17053023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012700159300001600286520167300302592002801975650001802003650001402021650002102035650001502056650003102071650001002102650002002112650001302132650002202145650003402167650001102201650001502212650001502227650001502242650002002257650002902277700002202306700002202328700001302350773011102363856007302474852000902547655001202556IND60517841820221117234703.0160405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051784182DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.123962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Nicole10aMolecular markers define progressing stages of phosphorus limitation in the nitrogen‐fixing cyanobacterium, Crocosphaera  ap. 274-282.  aCrocosphaera watsonii is a marine cyanobacterium that frequently inhabits low phosphate environments in oligotrophic oceans. While C. watsonii has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, its growth may be limited by availability of phosphorus. Biomarkers that indicate cellular phosphorus status give insight into how P‐limitation can affect the distribution of nitrogen‐fixing cyanobacterial populations. However, adaptation to phosphorus stress is complex and one marker may not be sufficient to determine when an organism is P‐limited. In this study, we characterized the transcription of key genes, activated during phosphorus stress in C. watsonii WH8501, to determine how transcription changed during the phosphorus stress response. Transcription of pstS, which encodes a high‐affinity phosphate binding protein, was discovered to be quickly up‐regulated in phosphorus‐depleted cells as an immediate stress response; however, its transcription declined after a period of phosphorus starvation. In addition, diel regulation of pstS in C. watsonii WH8501 complicates the interpretation of this marker in field applications. Transcription of the gene coding for the arsenite efflux protein, arsB, was upregulated after pstS in phosphorus limited cells, but it remained upregulated at later stages of phosphorus limitation. These results demonstrate that a single molecular marker does not adequately represent the entire phosphorus stress response in C. watsonii WH8501. Using both markers, the variations in transcriptional response over a range of degrees of phosphorus limitation may be a better approach for defining cellular phosphorus status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aarsenites 3abinding proteins 3abiomarkers 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria 3aoceans 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3astarvation 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics)1 aShilova, Irina N.1 aZehr, Jonathan P.1 aPost, A.0 tJournal of phycology.g2016 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.274-282dPhycological Society of Americax0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.123963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100001900164245012100183300001600304520110300320592002801423650002301451650001201474650001901486650000901505650003701514650001301551650000901564650001501573650001201588650001301600650001001613650001401623650001301637650000901650650001901659650001401678650001201692650005201704650001401756650004801770650001301818650002501831650001401856650003901870650002701909650002601936651000901962700001401971700002001985700002302005700002002028700001502048773008702063856007902150852000902229655001202238IND60080541320221120203930.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008054132DNAL7 a239558412pmid7 a10.1111/1744-7917.120492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shu‐Hua10aBiological and biochemical characterization of a red‐eye mutant in Nilaparvata lugens （Hemiptera: Delphacidae）  ap. 469-476.  aA red‐eye colony was established in our laboratory in brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), a major rice pest in Asia. Except for the red‐eye phenotype, no other differences were observed between the wild‐type (brown eye) and the mutant‐type (red eye) in external characters. Genetic analysis revealed that the red‐eye phenotype was controlled by a single autosomal recessive allele. Biological studies found that egg production and egg viability in the red‐eye mutant colony were not significantly different from those in the wild‐type BPH. Biochemical analysis and electronic microscopy examination revealed that the red‐eye mutants contained decreased levels of both xanthommatin (brown) and pteridine (red) and reduced number of pigment granules. Thus, the changes of amount and ratio of the two pigments is the biochemical basis of this red‐eye mutation. Our results indicate that the red‐eye mutant gene (red) might be involved in one common gene locus shared by the two pigments in pigment transportation, pigment granule formation or some other processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aalleles 3aegg production 3aeyes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agranules 3aloci 3amicroscopy 3amutants 3amutation 3apests 3aphenotype 3apigments 3arice 3atransportation 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aCompound Eye, Arthropodxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFertility 2aHemipteraxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aOxazinesxmetabolism 2aPhenotype 2aPigments, Biologicalxbiosynthesis 2aPteridinesxmetabolism 2aXanthenesxmetabolism 3aAsia1 aYao, Jing1 aYao, Hong‐Wei1 aJiang, Peng‐Ling1 aYang, Bao‐Jun1 aTang, Jian0 tInsect science.g2014 Aug., v. 21, no. 4 p.469-476dBlackwell Pubx1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.120493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245015400199500001900353520093700372592002801309596005601337650001601393650001501409650002301424650001301447650001701460650002201477650002001499650001601519650002801535650001401563650002901577650001201606650001901618650002401637651001401661651002401675700006601699700001801765700002201783700006001805700005501865700005601920773010201976856007602078852000902154655001202163IND60740737120221118035113.0210608e20210527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074073712DNAL7 a10.1155/2021/88205482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBally, Alissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1273-232714aThe Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Parasites and Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in Captive Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) in Trinidad, West Indies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was conducted from November 2010 to June 2011 to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites and the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in captive ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) in Trinidad. Faecal samples were collected and analyzed using faecal flotation to identify helminth ova and protozoan cysts and oocysts. Serum samples from captive ocelots were screened for T. gondii using a latex agglutination test kit. Of the 19 ocelots examined, the most prevalent parasites noted were ova of ascarids, strongyles, and Capillaria spp. The serum of three of the 13 (23.1%) ocelots tested was positive for T. gondii antibodies. These ocelots are therefore a potential source of T. gondii infection to both humans and other animals. This is the first documented report of endoparasites in local captive ocelots within Trinidad and provides useful data to support further research of the captive and wild populations.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus 3aAscarididae 3aCapillaria 3aLeopardus pardalis 3aProtozoa 3aStrongylidae 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aanalytical kits 3ablood serum 3agastrointestinal system 3ahelminths 3alatex agglutination test 3aoocysts 3aseroprevalence 3aveterinary medicine 3aCaribbean 3aTrinidad and Tobago1 aFrancis-Charles, Stacy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4361-91911 aAckbar, Tariq1 aBeharrylal, Yadel1 aCharles, Roxanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6982-30431 aBasu, Asoke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3721-88931 aSuepaul, Rod1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4420-25710 tVeterinary medicine international.g2021 May 27, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:21537x2042-00487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/88205483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010000169300001600269520151200285592002801797650002901825650001401854650002401868650001301892700002401905700002001929773009101949856008102040852000902121655001202130IND50074396820221120053343.0151103e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007439682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-013-9691-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyers, Steven D.10aAlteration of Residual Circulation Due to Large-Scale Infrastructure in a Coastal Plain Estuary  ap. 493-507.  aLarge-scale human-built infrastructure is shown to alter the salinity and subtidal residual flow in a realistic numerical simulation of hydrodynamic circulation in a coastal plain estuary (Tampa Bay). Two model scenarios are considered. The first uses a modern bathymetry and boundary conditions from the years 2001–2003. The second is identical to the first except that the bathymetry is based on depth soundings from the pre-construction year 1879. Differences between the models' output can only result from changes in bay morphology, in particular built infrastructure such as bridges, causeways, and dredging of the shipping channel. Thirty-day means of model output are calculated to remove the dominant tidal signals and allow examination of the subtidal dynamics. Infrastructure is found to steepen the mean axial salinity gradient [Formula: see text] by ~40% when there is low freshwater input but flatten [Formula: see text] by ~25% under more typical conditions during moderate freshwater inflow to the estuary. Deepening of the shipping channel also increases the magnitude of the residual Eulerian circulation, allowing for larger up-estuary salt transport. Local bathymetry and morphology are important. Some regions within the estuary show little change in residual circulation due to infrastructure. In others, the residual circulation can vary by a factor of 4 or more. Major features of the circulation and changes due to infrastructure can be partially accounted for with linear theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3abridges (infrastructure) 3aestuaries 3amathematical models 3asalinity1 aLinville, Amanda J.1 aLuther, Mark E.0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2014 Mar., v. 37, no. 2 p.493-507dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-013-9691-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010700162500001100269520121100280592002801491650000801519650001601527650001101543650001301554650001301567650000901580650001101589650001601600650002501616773008201641856007801723852000901801655001201810IND60586768020221120193718.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058676802DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2017000532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErdel, Fabian10aHow Communication Between Nucleosomes Enables Spreading and Epigenetic Memory of Histone Modifications  aREVIEW  aNucleosomes “talk” to each other about their modification state to form extended domains of modified histones independently of the underlying DNA sequence. At the same time, DNA elements promote modification of nucleosomes in their vicinity. How do these site‐specific and histone‐based activities act together to regulate spreading of histone modifications along the genome? How do they enable epigenetic memory to preserve cell identity? Many models for the dynamics of repressive histone modifications emphasize the role of strong positive feedback loops, which reinforce histone modifications by recruiting histone modifiers to preexisting modifications. Recent experiments question that repressive histone modifications are self‐sustained independently of their genomic context, thereby indicating that histone‐based feedback is relatively weak. In the present review, current models for the dynamics of histone modifications are compared and it is suggested that limitation of histone‐based feedback is key to intrinsic confinement of spreading and coexistence of short‐ and long‐term memory at different genomic loci.

S.10aAluminum-induced high IAA concentration may explain the Al susceptibility in Citrus limonia  ap. 123-137.  aIn acidic soils (pH < 5.0), aluminum (Al) occurs as Al³⁺, which is phytotoxic and reduces the root growth by hormonal imbalance and/or cell wall rigidity. However, the explanations for the decrease in root growth are not clear. A 60-day study was held with ‘Rangpur’ lime (Citrus limonia) plants grown in nutrient solution containing 0 and 1480 µM Al. We measured plant biometric data and used root apices to analyze auxin (IAA), the expression of some Al-responsive genes that had been differentially expressed in a transcriptome analysis and anatomical profiles. We found up-regulated expression of multidrug and toxic compound exudation (Cl-MATE channel), citrate synthase (Cl-CS) and pectin methylesterase inhibitor (Cl-PMEI) genes, but while Cl-PMEI expression was increased after 7 days, Cl-CS and Cl-MATE were up-regulated only after 60 days, suggesting that the timing of these events was ineffective against Al. These results could be associated with the Al-induced decrease in root growth and anatomical root damage. In addition, genes related to IAA cell transport were not differentially expressed in the transcriptome analysis. Therefore, high IAA and up-regulation of auxin-related small RNAs suggest Al-induced high IAA concentration rather than Al-induced disruption in IAA distribution in root cells of this species.  aPublisher supplied data  a474169/2013-8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (BR)  a309149/2017-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (BR)  a305458/2013-2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (BR)  a2013/11370-3cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (BR)  a2014/14386-0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (BR)  a2016/14216-3cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (BR)  a2013/07914-8cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (BR) 3aCitrus limonia 3aRNA 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3abiometry 3acell walls 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aexudation 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aindole acetic acid 3anutrient solutions 3apH 3apectinesterase 3aphytotoxicity 3aroot growth 3atoxic substances 3atranscriptomics1 aCavalheiro, Mariana F.1 aBressan, Anna C.

Crantz (camelina or false flax) and its mixtures with Brassica napus (rape) SVO as fuel in adapted diesel engines are described with chemical parameters, measurements in a test engine and a field test in a tractor. Camelina as a crop is attracting attention in organic farming and is often used in mixed cropping systems with low competition to food production area. Camelina SVO has low oxidation stability. Its polymerization affinity limits the storage time and increase the risk of coking at hot motor components and of thickening processes in the lubricant oil of the engine. In mixtures with rape and camelina SVO, threshold limits for Conradson Carbon Residues and for oxidation resistance were exceeded. The oxidation resistance could be prolonged by the addition of commercial antioxidants. Camelina and rape SVO showed very similar burning characteristics at full-to-medium partial engine loads. Under low partial loads and idle load, the burning function of the various fuels was increasingly delayed, beginning with diesel fuel over pure rape SVO, then a mixture containing 700 dm³ m⁻³ rape SVO, and 300 dm³ m⁻³ camelina SVO, through to pure camelina SVO. The exhaust emissions of NOₓ-, CO-, particles and HC of rape SVO, camelina SVO and their described mixture were not significantly different. The typically higher NOₓ- and lower HC-emissions of SVO compared to diesel fuel were apparent. The results principally reveal the usability of a cold pressed, non-refined camelina-rape SVO mixture in adapted diesel engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aCamelina sativa 3aantioxidants 3acarbon 3acold 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3afarms 3aflax 3afood production 3amixed cropping 3anitrogen oxides 3aorganic production 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3arisk 3astorage time 3atractors 3avegetable oil1 aWichmann, V.1 aSchuemann, U.1 aRichter, B.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2011 Oct., v. 35, no. 9 p.4015-4024dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014100171300001500312520132900327592002801656650003101684650002001715650001401735650001601749650001101765650002201776650001301798650002601811650001501837650001101852650002601863700002401889700002401913700002201937700002501959700003101984700002502015700002502040700002602065700002302091700002302114700001902137700002002156700002702176700006302203773012002266856008102386852000902467655001202476IND60627325220221116220435.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062732522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-018-0456-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXanthopoulou, Aliki10aΙntra-species grafting induces epigenetic and metabolic changes accompanied by alterations in fruit size and shape of Cucurbita pepo L.  ap. 93-108.  aTo further understand the impact of grafting on fruit characteristics and to comprehend the mechanisms involved in graft-induced changes we studied homo- and hetero- grafted Cucurbita pepo cultivars (cv.) that vary in fruit size and shape. C. pepo cv. ‘Munchkin’ and cv. ‘Big Moose’ as well as cv. ‘Round green’ and cv. ‘Princess’ were homo-grafted and reciprocally hetero-grafted. The results show significant changes in fruit size when ‘Big Moose’ was grafted onto ‘Munchkin’ rootstocks in comparison to homo-grafted controls. Statistically significant changes were also observed in fruit shape when cv. ‘Princess’ was grafted on cv. ‘Round green’. This is the first report of such phenotypic changes after intra-species/inter-cultivar grafting in Cucurbitaceae. Additionally, we found significant changes in (i) secondary metabolite profile, (ii) global DNA methylation pattern and (iii) miRNA expression patterns in grafted scions and (iv) DNA methylation on graft-induced phenotypic changes in grafted plants. Our results contribute to further understanding graft-induced effects on fruit morphology in intra-species grafting. Furthermore, our results pave the way for understanding the role of phenolic metabolites and epigenetic molecular mechanisms on the phenotypic changes recorded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita pepo subsp. pepo 3aDNA methylation 3acultivars 3aepigenetics 3afruits 3agrafting (plants) 3amicroRNA 3aphenotypic plasticity 3arootstocks 3ascions 3asecondary metabolites1 aTsaballa, Aphrodite1 aGanopoulos, Ioannis1 aKapazoglou, Aliki1 aAvramidou, Evangelia1 aAravanopoulos, Filippos A.1 aMoysiadis, Theodoros1 aOsathanunkul, Maslin1 aTsaftaris, Athanasios1 aDoulis, Andreas G.1 aKalivas, Apostolos1 aSarrou, Eirini1 aMartens, Stefan1 aNianiou-Obeidat, Irini1 aMadesis, Panagiotis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1447-35140 tPlant growth regulation.g2019 Jan., v. 87, no. 1 p.93-108dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34166x0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-018-0456-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245013800161300001600299520177000315592002802085650002202113650001002135650002602145650003302171650001602204650001402220650001802234650001902252651001802271700002802289700002002317700002402337700001902361700002002380700002102400700001902421700001702440700001302457773011102470856007302581852000902654655001202663IND60517842120221117234700.0160405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051784212DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.123952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPercopo, Isabella10aPseudo‐nitzschia arctica sp. nov., a new cold‐water cryptic Pseudo‐nitzschia species within the P. pseudodelicatissima complex  ap. 184-199.  aA new nontoxic Pseudo‐nitzschia species belonging to the P. pseudodelicatissima complex, P. arctica, was isolated from different areas of the Arctic. The erection of P. arctica is mainly supported by molecular data, since the species shares identical ultrastructure with another species in the complex, P. fryxelliana, and represents a new case of crypticity within the genus. Despite their morphological similarity, the two species are not closely related in phylogenies based on LSU, ITS and rbcL. Interestingly, P. arctica is phylogenetically most closely related to P. granii and P. subcurvata, from which the species is, however, morphologically different. P. granii and P. subcurvata lack the central larger interspace which is one of the defining features of the P. pseudodelicatissima complex. The close genetic relationship between P. arctica and the two species P. granii and P. subcurvata is demonstrated by analysis of the secondary structure of ITS2 which revealed no compensatory base changes, two hemi‐compensatory base changes, and two deletions in P. arctica with respect to the other two species. These findings emphasize that rates of morphological differentiation, molecular evolution and speciation are often incongruent for Pseudo‐nitzschia species, resulting in a restricted phylogenetic value for taxonomic characters used to discriminate species. The description of a new cryptic species, widely distributed in the Arctic and potentially representing an endemic component of the Arctic diatom flora, reinforces the idea of the existence of noncosmopolitan Pseudo‐nitzschia species and highlights the need for combined morphological and molecular analyses to assess the distributional patterns of phytoplankton species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aflora 3agenetic relationships 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aphytoplankton 3aultrastructure 3aArctic region1 aRuggiero, Maria Valeria1 aBalzano, Sergio1 aGourvil, Priscillia1 aLundholm, Nina1 aSiano, Raffaele1 aTammilehto, Anna1 aVaulot, Daniel1 aSarno, Diana1 aMock, T.0 tJournal of phycology.g2016 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.184-199dPhycological Society of Americax0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.123953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245011900158300001600277520134200293592002801635650000801663650001901671650001601690650001001706650001701716650001701733650002501750650000701775650003001782650001401812650001801826650002201844651001001866700001701876700001601893700001801909700001501927773017601942856007802118852000902196655001202205IND60118205220221120130459.0141126e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011820522DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.056689-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Aihua10aFlavobacterium lacus sp. nov., isolated from a high-altitude lake, and emended description of Flavobacterium filum  ap. 933-939.  aTwo Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterial strains, designated NP180T and NR80, were isolated from water of Nam Co Lake, located in Tibet, China. Growth of strains NP180T and NR80 occurred at 4–25 °C and at pH 6.5–10.0 (optima, 15–20 °C and pH 7.5–8.5). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to the phylogenetically closest related strains, Flavobacterium filum EMB 34T, F. ponti GSW-R14T and F. gelidilacus LMG 21477T, was 95.1, 94.8 and 94.6 %, respectively. The predominant fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 1 G, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH and summed feature 9 (comprising iso-C17 : 1ω9c and/or 10-methyl C16 : 0). The major menaquinone of the two strains was menaquinone 6 (MK-6). Phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminolipid and one unidentified lipid were the major polar lipids in both strains. The G+C contents of the genomic DNA were 34.9 and 35.1 mol%, respectively, for strains NP180T and NR80. DNA–DNA relatedness between strains NP180T and NR80 was 99 %, indicating that they belong to the same species. According to phylogenetic inference and phenotypic characteristics, a novel species, Flavobacterium lacus sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is NP180T ( = CGMCC 1.12504T = NBRC 109715T).

Due to the plasticity of the developing nociceptive system, neonatal pain might carry long-term consequences on adult behavior. In this study, we examined whether infant male circumcision is associated with long-term psychological effects on adult socio-affective processing.We recruited 408 men circumcised within the first month of life and 211 non-circumcised men and measured socio-affective behaviors and stress via a battery of validated psychometric scales.Early-circumcised men reported lower attachment security and lower emotional stability while no differences in empathy or trust were found. Early circumcision was also associated with stronger sexual drive and less restricted socio-sexuality along with higher perceived stress and sensation seeking.This is a cross-sectional study relying on self-reported measures from a US population.Our findings resonate with the existing literature suggesting links between altered emotional processing in circumcised men and neonatal stress. Consistent with longitudinal studies on infant attachment, early circumcision might have an impact on adult socio-affective traits or behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3across-sectional studies 3amales 3apain 0aPsychology 0aClinical research 0aNeonatal pain 0aAttachment style 0aEmpathy 0aPersonality 0aStress 0aSociosexuality1 aDi Bernardo, Gian Antonio1 aHøjgaard, Astrid Ditte1 aEarp, Brian D.1 aZak, Paul J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4563-84061 aLandau, Anne M.1 aHoppe, Jørgen1 aWinterdahl, Michael0 tHeliyon.g2020 Nov., v. 6, no. 11 p.e05566-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e055663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245014500170506002800315520154300343592002801886506003701914650001701951650002101968650001201989650001702001650002202018650001602040651001302056653001502069653002802084653001702112653002402129653002502153700002502178700003002203700002102233700001902254773009202273856008002365852000902445655001202454IND60764701820221207110722.0211122e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076470182DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2205082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaumthong, Matayawee10aClimate effects on the growth of Pinus latteri and Pinus kesiya at the Intakin Silvicultural Research Station, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand  aResource is Open Access  aNaumthong M, Palakit K, Duangsathaporn K, Prasomsin P, Lumyai P. 2021. Climate effects on the growth of Pinus latteri and Pinus kesiya at the Intakin Silvicultural Research Station, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. Biodiversitas 22: 2512-2519. Relationship between the growth of two pine species, Pinus latteri and Pinus kesiya, and past climatic factors are studied. Standard dendrochronological techniques were used on 40 core samples obtained from 20 trees from each species to cross-date tree-ring width and determine the growth patterns of each species. Over a period spanning from 1980-2019 (P. latteri) and 1984-2019 (P. kesiya), the calculated mean ring-width values were 0.596 and 0.430 cm per year, respectively. An analysis of the relationship between tree-ring width of P. latteri and climatic data indicated a positive correlation with the relative humidity in April. However, a negative correlation was observed with the temperature in April and August. The factors limiting the growth of P. latteri the most were the temperature in August (r2=0.228; P<0.01). The index constructed for P. kesiya indicated a positive correlation with extreme minimum relative humidity in December and extreme maximum temperature in March. The factors limiting the growth of P. kesiya with a significant correlation, were the relative humidity in April (r2=0.173) and temperature in May (r2=0.184). These results can be used to plan the management of forest plantations and to select suitable areas for the cultivation of pine trees in Thailand  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus kesiya 3adendrochronology 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3aThailand 0achiang mai 0aclimate growth response 0apinus kesiya 0apinus latteri mason 0atree ring chronology1 aPalakit, Kritsadapan1 aDuangsathaporn, Khwanchai1 aPrasomsin, Patsi1 aLumyai, Pichit0 tBiodiversitas.g2021 Apr., v. 22, no. 5dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2205083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245007900167500001100246520104300257592002801300650001801328650002601346650001901372650001101391650001301402650002701415773008201442856007801524852000901602655001201611IND60586768320221120214427.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058676832DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2017000892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolker, Jessica A.10aAnimal Models in Translational Research: Rosetta Stone or Stumbling Block?  aREVIEW  aLeading animal models are powerful tools for translational research, but they also present obstacles. Poorly conducted preclinical research in animals is a common cause of translational failure, but even when such research is well‐designed and carefully executed, challenges remain. In particular, dominant models may bias research directions, elide essential aspects of human disease, omit important context, or subtly shift research targets. Recognizing these stumbling blocks can help us find ways to avoid them: employing a wider range of models, incorporating more realistic environmental conditions, better aligning studies between animals and patients, and focusing on human biology and therapeutic goals. Such changes are costly; but insisting it would be impractical or unrealistic to change strategies offers no way out of the current impasse.

The 20-item spiritual well-being scale (SWBS) (Paloutzian and Ellision), which measures the spiritual well-being dimensions, was completed by patients before and after the intervention. Data analysis was performed using descriptive and inferential methods (paired T-test, independent t-test, Fisher's exact test, mann-whitney test, and chi-square) in SPSS ver. 16.The results showed no statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of mean spiritual wellbeing before the intervention, but, the post-intervention mean spiritual wellbeing score in the control and experimental groups was 97.82 ± 9.25 and 88.40 ± 9.47, respectively. (α = 0.05) (P = 0.001).According to the results of the present study, it seems that spiritual care is able to improve the spiritual wellbeing status of individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamputation 3aclinical trials 3ametabolic syndrome 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3at-test 0aClinical psychology 0aPediatrics 0aAlternative medicine 0aEvidence-based medicine 0aClinical research 0aType 2 diabetes 0aAmputation 0aSpiritual wellbeing 0aSpiritual care 0aMeditation1 aSabouhi, Fakhri1 aMohammadpourhodki, Reza1 aMahdavi, Sepideh1 aGoudarzian, Sima1 aAmerian, Malihe1 aMohtashami, Mona1 aKheiri, Mansoure1 aImeni, Malihe0 tHeliyon.g2020 Nov., v. 6, no. 11 p.e05567-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e055673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005700168300001800225520124800243592002801491650001001519650002201529650002001551650001101571650003201582650001001614651001901624700001901643773008201662856004801744852000901792655001201801IND50060694720221120125128.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006069472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-012-0747-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠrámek, Martin14aThe vertical leaf distribution of Ulmus laevis Pall.  ap. 1781-1792.  aVertical leaf distribution and relative irradiance were ascertained for the dominant species Ulmus laevis Pall. at the level of the individual tree and at the level of the stand in a mixed broad-leaved forest in South Moravia, the Czech Republic. The study consisted of detailed, destructive measurement of five selected sample trees and the establishment of basic biometric parameters for the entire stand. Using allometric relationships, measurements from sample trees were generalized to diameter at breast height (DBH) classes and were then scaled up to the level of the imaginary pure stand of elm; the selected independent variables were tree height and DBH. The vertical leaf distribution was unimodal in trees with smaller dimensions and bimodal in trees with larger dimensions. The leaf area index (LAI) of the stand was 4 (6.4 including the undergrowth), and the sunlit leaf area index (SLAI) was 1.7. Dominant trees had a higher proportion of sunlit leaf area than subdominant and suppressed trees. Determination of appropriate methods and intensity of thinning can lead to optimizing of irradiation control, vitality increase of the elm stands and subsequently to a higher resistance to Dutch elm disease vector and disease itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUlmus 3adeciduous forests 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aCzech Republic1 aČermák, Jan,0 tTrees.g2012 Dec., v. 26, no. 6 p.1781-1792dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-012-0747-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011100169300001400280520140100294592002801695650002401723650002501747650001301772650001901785650001701804650001301821650001901834650000901853650001601862650002601878650001001904650002701914650001601941650002301957650001301980651001601993700001902009773008702028856004802115852000902163655001202172IND4446319920221122050109.0120727e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444631992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-010-0315-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandman, Michael J.10aFish health changes in Lake Okaro, New Zealand: effects of nutrient remediation, season or eutrophication?  ap. 65-79.  aThe purpose of this investigation was to measure the in situ health of selected biota with respect to a large-scale application of an aluminium-amended zeolite (Z2G1) in Lake Okaro, New Zealand. We hypothesized that, based on previous laboratory toxicity testing, the Z2G1 application would have minimal or no significant health effects on lake fauna. To test this hypothesis, two sampling events were timed around the Z2G1 application to examine the health of two finfish species (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Gobiomorphus cotidianus) and crayfish (Paranephrops planifrons). Additionally, the same species were sampled from the neighbouring Lake Rerewhakaaitu in order to delineate seasonal and lake-specific effects. A general lack of aluminium accumulation in animal tissues following the application indicated that Z2G1-derived aluminium was not readily bioavailable. An unexplained osmoregulatory disturbance, indicated by increased blood plasma ion concentrations in Lake Okaro trout, was observed following the application, but could not be directly attributed to Z2G1 exposure. Changes in fish haematology over time and between lake populations were interpreted as physiological responses to seasonal changes in lake conditions. Using a broad range of specific and non-specific endpoints it was concluded that there were no obvious negative impacts on fish health resulting from Z2G1 exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3aaluminum 3aanimal tissues 3ablood plasma 3acrayfish 3aeutrophication 3afish 3afish health 3alaboratory techniques 3alakes 3aphysiological response 3aremediation 3aseasonal variation 3azeolites 3aNew Zealand1 aLing, Nicholas0 tHydrobiologia.g2011 Feb., v. 661, no. 1 p.65-79dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0315-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011500153300001800268520158100286592002801867650003401895650002101929650001301950650002201963650002601985650002502011650001802036650001602054650002402070650002002094650002202114650002102136650002202157650002802179650002002207650001502227650001802242650001602260650003202276650002302308650002102331650000902352650004302361650002102404650002002425650002002445650001902465650002102484700001602505700002002521700001702541700001902558773012502577856007402702852000902776655001202785IND60662333920221119183608.0190904e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066233392DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00430b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei10aHypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects of Sarcandra glabra polysaccharide in type 2 diabetic mice  ap. 2850-2860.  aSarcandra glabra (Thunb.) Nakai is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine and dietary supplement used for treating several diseases. The anti-diabetic activity of S. glabra polysaccharides is reported for the first time. The in vitro α-glucosidase inhibition assay indicated that the acidic S. glabra polysaccharide (SGP-2) has an IC₅₀ of 87.06 ± 11.76 μg mL⁻¹, which was much lower than acarbose at 338.90 ± 46.86 μg mL⁻¹. Moreover, high fat diet (HFD) with streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic mice were administered SGP-2 (150, 300, or 600 mg kg⁻¹ per day, respectively) for 3 weeks. Postprandial blood glucose levels (PBGL), total cholesterol, triglyceride and free fatty acid levels in diabetic mice treated with SGP-2 were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) compared to those of the model group. The results of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index indicated that SGP-2 could significantly improve (p < 0.05) the insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in diabetic mice. Furthermore, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in SGP-2 treated groups. Thus we proposed that SGP-2 exerted hypoglycemic activity by relieving insulin resistance, reducing postprandial blood glucose levels and ameliorating lipid metabolism, as well as alleviating oxidative stress. These data suggested that SGP-2 with anti-hyperglycemic activity could be used in medicinal preparations for diabetes mellitus and its complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aSarcandra glabra 3aacarbose 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood glucose 3acholesterol 3adietary supplements 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose tolerance 3aglucose tolerance tests 3aglycemic effect 3ahexokinase 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsulin resistance 3alipid metabolism 3amice 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3apolysaccharides 3apyruvate kinase 3astreptozotocin 3atriacylglycerols1 aZheng, Ying1 aZhang, Zhenzhen1 aYao, Wenbing1 aGao, Xiangdong0 tFood & function.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 5, no. 11 p.2850-2860dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00430b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013900156300001600295500002000311520123400331592002801565650001201593650001101605650001101616650001801627650001101645650001401656650003101670650001401701650002301715650001101738650002201749651001001771651001101781651002401792700002001816700002001836700001901856773008701875856007301962852000902035655001202044IND60550379620221118034701.0160910e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055037962DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.124012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMellone, Ugo10aIndividual variation in orientation promotes a 3000‐km latitudinal change in wintering grounds in a long‐distance migratory raptor  ap. 887-893.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMigrating juvenile birds rely on endogenous information in choosing the direction in which to fly, but such input may be overridden by social interactions with experienced individuals. We tagged seven juvenile Short‐toed Eagles Circaetus gallicus with GPS transmitters in southern Italy. This trans‐Saharan migrant flies mainly by soaring and is therefore not well adapted to performing long water crossings. Five of the seven tagged juveniles used the longer but apparently safer route towards the Strait of Gibraltar, and two migrated along a southerly trajectory and subsequently spent the winter in Sicily, apparently forced to do so by the 150‐km‐wide Sicily Channel. One of these individuals took the longer route the following autumn. These results, combined with long‐term (15 years) visual field observations involving thousands of individuals, suggest that inexperienced Short‐toed Eagles may learn their migratory routes from experienced adults, whereas some of them migrate south in response to an innate orientation instinct. Transport costs, inherited information and geography apparently interact, forcing some Short‐toed Eagles to winter 3000 km to the north of the majority of their conspecifics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aadults 3aautumn 3abirds of prey 3aeagles 3ageography 3aglobal positioning systems 3ajuveniles 3amigratory behavior 3awinter 3awintering grounds 3aItaly 3aSicily 3aStrait of Gibraltar1 aLucia, Giuseppe1 aMallìa, Egidio1 aUrios, Vicente0 tIbis.g2016 Oct., v. 158, no. 4 p.887-893dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.124013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010800160300001800268520204300286592002802329650001202357650001802369650001802387650000902405650000902414650001902423650001102442650001502453650002002468650002302488650001502511650002202526650001902548650001202567650001602579650000702595650001302602650003902615650001902654650002202673650001602695650005802711650002702769650001702796700002202813700001702835700001202852773012502864856007402989852000903063655001203072IND60662334320221119182654.0190904e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066233432DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00454j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Tanoj K.10aInfluence of heat and shear induced protein aggregation on the in vitro digestion rate of whey proteins  ap. 2686-2698.  aProtein intake is essential for growth and repair of body cells, the normal functioning of muscles, and health related immune functions. Most food proteins are consumed after undergoing various degrees of processing. Changes in protein structure and assembly as a result of processing impact the digestibility of proteins. Research in understanding to what extent the protein structure impacts the rate of proteolysis under human physiological conditions has gained considerable interest. In this work, four whey protein gels were prepared using heat processing at two different pH values, 6.8 and 4.6, with and without applied shear. The gels showed different protein network microstructures due to heat induced unfolding (at pH 6.8) or lack of unfolding, thus resulting in fine stranded protein networks. When shear was applied during heating, particulate protein networks were formed. The differences in the gel microstructures resulted in considerable differences in their rheological properties. An in vitro gastric and intestinal model was used to investigate the resulting effects of these different gel structures on whey protein digestion. In addition, the rate of digestion was monitored by taking samples at various time points throughout the in vitro digestion process. The peptides in the digesta were profiled using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase-HPLC and LC-MS. Under simulated gastric conditions, whey proteins in structured gels were hydrolysed faster than native proteins in solution. The rate of peptides released during in vitro digestion differed depending on the structure of the gels and extent of protein aggregation. The outcomes of this work highlighted that changes in the network structure of the protein can influence the rate and pattern of its proteolysis under gastrointestinal conditions. Such knowledge could assist the food industry in designing novel food formulations to control the digestion kinetics and the release of biologically active peptides for desired health outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3afood industry 3agels 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aimmune response 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3amass spectrometry 3amicrostructure 3amuscles 3anovel foods 3apH 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein intake 3aprotein structure 3aproteolysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3arheological properties 3awhey protein1 aØiseth, Sofia K.1 aLundin, Leif1 aDay, Li0 tFood & function.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 5, no. 11 p.2686-2698dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00454j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245011400165300001600279500002000295520136700315592002801682650002201710650001001732650001401742650002001756650002401776650001301800650001601813650001501829650001301844650002301857650002201880650001501902650001601917650001401933651001601947700002201963700002301985700002102008700002802029773008702057856007302144852000902217655001202226IND60550379920221118034653.0160910e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055037992DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.123932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Oosten, H.

Here, we show that these three populations together with an additional larger population in the European lowlands are highly genetically differentiated based on 22 microsatellite markers. In contrast, we found no evidence for differentiation using two mitochondrial DNA markers. An IMa2 analysis indicates that gene flow has occurred regularly among our sampled populations. As immigration of colour‐ringed birds among our sampled populations is rare at best, our results suggest that the populations have recently become isolated from one another. Low dispersal rates in highly mobile birds may occur when suitable habitat becomes highly fragmented, and will accentuate stochastic demographic processes and inbreeding, both reducing population viability. As dispersal rates are low among populations of Northern Wheatears in The Netherlands, there is only a small probability of recolonization of habitat patches where populations have become locally extinct.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOenanthe oenanthe 3abirds 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aimmigration 3ainbreeding 3alowlands 3amigratory behavior 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphilopatry 3aprobability 3aviability 3aNetherlands1 aMueller, Jakob C.1 aOttenburghs, Jente1 aBoth, Christiaan1 aKempenaers, B.q(Bart),0 tIbis.g2016 Oct., v. 158, no. 4 p.857-867dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.123933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245018700164300001600351520138400367592002801751650002201779650003101801650002501832650001201857650002201869650002201891650001501913650003101928650001001959650001701969650001801986650002402004650001802028650001302046650001402059650001602073650004302089650002802132650005202160650003602212650003202248650003702280700002302317700002502340700002802365700002302393700002102416700003202437773012202469856007402591852000902665655001202674IND60662334420221119182418.0190904e20141224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066233442DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00459k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjwang, Leonnard O.10aPolyphenolic extracts from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) protect colonic myofibroblasts (CCD18Co cells) from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation – modulation of microRNA 126  ap. 145-153.  aCowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a drought tolerant crop with several agronomic advantages over other legumes. This study evaluated varieties from four major cowpea phenotypes (black, red, light brown and white) containing different phenolic profiles for their anti-inflammatory property on non-malignant colonic myofibroblasts (CCD18Co) cells challenged with an endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay on the LPS-stimulated cells revealed antioxidative potential of black and red cowpea varieties. Real-time qRT-PCR analysis in LPS-stimulated cells revealed down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-α, VCAM-1), transcription factor NF-κB and modulation of microRNA-126 (specific post-transcriptional regulator of VCAM-1) by cowpea polyphenolics. The ability of cowpea polyphenols to modulate miR-126 signaling and its target gene VCAM-1 were studied in LPS-stimulated endothelial cells transfected with a specific inhibitor of miR-126, and treated with 10 mg GAE/L black cowpea extract where the extract in part reversed the effect of the miR-126 inhibitor. This suggests that cowpea may exert their anti-inflammatory activities at least in part through induction of miR-126 that then down-regulate VCAM-1 mRNA and protein expressions. Overall, Cowpea therefore is promising as an anti-inflammatory dietary component.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3acowpeas 3adrought tolerance 3aendothelial cells 3aendotoxins 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3alipopolysaccharides 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aphenotype 3apolyphenols 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avascular cell adhesion molecules1 aBanerjee, Nivedita1 aNoratto, Giuliana D.1 aAngel-Morales, Gabriela1 aHachibamba, Twambo1 aAwika, Joseph M.1 aMertens-Talcott, Susanne U.0 tFood & function.g2014 Dec. 24, v. 6, no. 1 p.145-153dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00459k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010400155300001600259500002000275520214200295592002802437650002502465650002302490650002202513650001502535650001802550650001202568650002202580650001202602650001302614651001802627700001702645700001902662700001602681700001602697773008702713856007302800852000902873655001202882IND60550380120221118034831.0160910e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055038012DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.123972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEda, Masaki10aAssortative mating in two populations of Short‐tailed Albatross Phoebastria albatrus on Torishima  ap. 868-875.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAssortative mating is an important pre‐mating isolation mechanism that has been observed in some wild populations of seabirds. The Short‐tailed Albatross Phoebastria albatrus is a globally Vulnerable seabird that breeds mainly on Torishima and the Senkaku Islands in the north‐western Pacific Ocean. Our previous studies suggested that two genetically distinct populations exist, one on Torishima and the other on the Senkaku Islands. Recently, however, several un‐ringed birds in subadult plumage have been observed breeding on Torishima in the Hatsunezaki colony. As almost all birds hatched on Torishima since 1979 have been ringed, the natal site of the un‐ringed birds was suspected to be the Senkaku Islands. Genetic differences between the two populations would reveal the natal sites of un‐ringed birds. By observing the ring status (ringed or un‐ringed) of mating pairs and analysing the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region 2 of un‐ringed birds, we assessed whether birds that originated from Torishima and the Senkaku Islands achieved pre‐mating isolation. There was a small number of pairs on Torishima that consisted of one ringed and one un‐ringed bird, but the observed number was significantly lower than that expected if ringed and un‐ringed birds mated randomly. Furthermore, mtDNA analyses of nine un‐ringed birds demonstrated that all belonged to a particular haplotype clade from the Senkaku Islands. These results show that birds from Torishima and the Senkaku Islands mate assortatively but that there is incomplete pre‐mating isolation between birds from the two island groups. The pre‐mating isolation of these two populations of Short‐tailed Albatross could arise from differences in the timing of breeding and incompatibility in mating displays. As the divergence between the two populations is unlikely to be sufficient to achieve complete post‐mating isolation, the two groups are likely to be hybridizing. Further studies using molecular and/or behavioural analyses would be required to reveal the evolutionary significance of hybridization between these two populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoebastria albatrus 3aassortative mating 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahybridization 3aislands 3amitochondrial DNA 3aplumage 3aseabirds 3aPacific Ocean1 aIzumi, Hiroe1 aKonno, Satoshi1 aKonno, Miwa1 aSato, Fumio0 tIbis.g2016 Oct., v. 158, no. 4 p.868-875dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.123973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245012500167300001800292520107000310592002801380650002701408650001501435650001701450650001201467650001201479650002301491650001601514650002401530650002301554650001701577650001701594650001401611650002101625650002301646650000901669700002201678700002201700700002401722700001901746700002001765773012501785856007401910852000901984655001201993IND60662335120221119182535.0190904e20141119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066233512DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00489b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCimolai, Maria Cecilia10aα-Lipoic acid protects kidney from oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated to inflammatory conditions  ap. 3143-3150.  aAn adequate redox status is important for maintaining mitochondrial function in inflammatory conditions. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of α-lipoic acid (LA) in kidney oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated rats. Sprague-Dawley rats (female, 45 ± 5 days old) were treated with LPS (10 mg kg⁻¹) and/or LA (100 mg kg⁻¹). It was observed in LPS-treated animals that the LA prevented the increase in 1.2 fold of NO production, decreased (30–40%) mitochondrial complex I–III and IV activities, and decreased (26%) membrane potential and cardiolipin oxidation (76%). No differences were observed in mitochondrial O₂ consumption, mitochondrial complex II–III activity, and ATP production when LPS group was compared to LA + LPS group. Based on the improvement of mitochondrial function, the decreased production of mitochondrial NO and restoration of cardiolipin levels, this work provides a new evidence that α-lipoic acid protects kidney from oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaerobiosis 3acardiolipins 3afemales 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3alipoic acid 3alipopolysaccharides 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen consumption 3arats1 aVanasco, Virginia1 aMarchini, Timoteo1 aMagnani, Natalia D.1 aEvelson, Pablo1 aAlvarez, Silvia0 tFood & function.g2014 Nov. 19, v. 5, no. 12 p.3143-3150dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00489b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017200160300001800332520137600350592002801726650001701754650002601771650001501797650001301812650000901825650003101834650001001865650001601875650002701891650002801918650003601946650003601982650001702018650002202035650001802057650002002075650000902095650002102104650000702125650001702132650002702149650001902176650002802195650002502223650003602248650003202284700002202316700002502338700001202363700002802375700001902403773012502422856007402547852000902621655001202630IND60662335920221119182436.0190904e20141119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066233592DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00531g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonga, Jitender10aTopical (+)-catechin emulsified gel prevents DMBA/TPA-induced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin by modulating antioxidants and inflammatory biomarkers in BALB/c mice  ap. 3197-3207.  aAn emulsified gel of (+)-catechin was developed and evaluated topically against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-promoted (DMBA-induced and TPA-promoted) squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in BALB/c mice. The biological evaluation outcome indicated that the (+)-catechin emulsified gel increased the activity of oxidative stress biomarkers glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), whereas it decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA). The mechanistic study showed that genes implicated in the inflammation and cancer, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), were down-regulated by (+)-catechin emulsified gel while inhibiting an inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂). The (+)-catechin emulsified gel further suppressed the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines, viz. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The in vitro permeation study revealed that release of (+)-catechin from an emulsified gel base reached a steady state after 6 h, while pH of the entire emulsified gel was found to be between 6.2 and 6.5 that falls well within the normal pH range of the skin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abiological assessment 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3agels 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3apermeability 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostaglandins 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aAggarwal, Vaibhav1 aSuthar, Sharad Kumar1 aMonika,1 aNongalleima, Khumukcham1 aŚarmā, Manu,0 tFood & function.g2014 Nov. 19, v. 5, no. 12 p.3197-3207dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00531g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003100145245015700176300002000333500002000353520168300373592002802056650002202084650002802106650002702134650001602161650001602177650001702193650001402210650002202224650001302246650001702259650003102276650001702307650003302324650003302357650001302390650001102403650001602414650001602430700003402446700003902480700003302519700003702552700003302589700003202622773011002654856007902764852000902843655001202852IND60550381720221118112236.0160910e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055038172DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.134162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitch‐Vargas, Perla Rosa10aPhysicochemical and Microstructural Characterization of Corn Starch Edible Films Obtained by a Combination of Extrusion Technology and Casting Technique  ap. E2224-E2232.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStarch edible films (EFs) have been widely studied due to their potential in food preservation; however, their application is limited because of their poor mechanical and barrier properties. Because of that, the aim of this work was to use the extrusion technology (EₓT) as a pretreatment of casting technique to change the starch structure in order to obtain EFs with improved physicochemical properties. To this, corn starch and a mixture of plasticizers (sorbitol and glycerol, in different ratios) were processed in a twin screw extruder to generate the starch modification and subsequently casting technique was used for EFs formation. The best conditions of the EₓT and plasticizers concentration were obtained using response surface methodology. All the response variables evaluated, were affected significatively by the Plasticizers Ratio (Sorbitol:Glycerol) (PR (S:G)) and Extrusion Temperature (ET), while the Screw Speed (SS) did not show significant effect on any of these variables. The optimization study showed that the appropriate conditions to obtain EFs with the best mechanical and barrier properties were ET = 89 °C, SS = 66 rpm and PR (S:G) = 79.7:20.3. Once the best conditions were obtained, the optimal treatment was characterized according to its microstructural properties (X‐ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy) to determine the damage caused in the starch during EₓT and casting technique. In conclusion, with the combination of EₓT and casting technique were obtained EFs with greater breaking strength and deformation, as well as lower water vapor permeability than those reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbohydrate structure 3acorn starch 3adeformation 3aedible films 3aextrusion 3afood preservation 3aglycerol 3apermeability 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplasticizers 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorbitol 3astarch 3atemperature 3awater vapor1 aAguilar‐Palazuelos, Ernesto1 ade Jesús Zazueta‐Morales, José1 aVega‐García, Misael Odín1 aValdez‐Morales, Jesús Enrique1 aMartínez‐Bustos, Fernando1 aJacobo‐Valenzuela, Noelia0 tJournal of food science.g2016 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.E2224-E2232dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.134163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245010400165300002000269500002000289520174600309592002802055650002202083650001602105650001102121650001002132650001202142700002002154773011002174856007902284852000902363655001202372IND60550382020221118112253.0160910e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055038202DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.134042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBloom, David J.10aSample Dimensionality Effects on d′ and Proportion of Correct Responses in Discrimination Testing  ap. S2246-S2251.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProducts in the food and beverage industry have varying levels of dimensionality ranging from pure water to multicomponent food products, which can modify sensory perception and possibly influence discrimination testing results. The objectives of the study were to determine the impact of (1) sample dimensionality and (2) complex formulation changes on the d′ and proportion of correct response of the 3‐AFC and triangle methods. Two experiments were conducted using 47 prescreened subjects who performed either triangle or 3‐AFC test procedures. In Experiment I, subjects performed 3‐AFC and triangle tests using model solutions with different levels of dimensionality. Samples increased in dimensionality from 1‐dimensional sucrose in water solution to 3‐dimensional sucrose, citric acid, and flavor in water solution. In Experiment II, subjects performed 3‐AFC and triangle tests using 3‐dimensional solutions. Sample pairs differed in all 3 dimensions simultaneously to represent complex formulation changes. Two forms of complexity were compared: dilution, where all dimensions decreased in the same ratio, and compensation, where a dimension was increased to compensate for a reduction in another. The proportion of correct responses decreased for both methods when the dimensionality was increased from 1‐ to 2‐dimensional samples. No reduction in correct responses was observed from 2‐ to 3‐dimensional samples. No significant differences in d′ were demonstrated between the 2 methods when samples with complex formulation changes were tested. Results reveal an impact on proportion of correct responses due to sample dimensionality and should be explored further using a wide range of sample formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverage industry 3acitric acid 3aflavor 3afoods 3asucrose1 aLee, Soo‐Yeun0 tJournal of food science.g2016 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.S2246-S2251dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.134043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245010600168300002000274500002000294520175900314592002802073650001702101650003002118650001802148650002102166650002302187650002002210650001602230650001102246650002302257650001002280650002402290650001702314650001002331650001502341650000902356700002002365700001802385773011002403856007902513852000902592655001202601IND60550382120221118112313.0160910e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055038212DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.134152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonovan, Joseph D.10aR‐Index Measure of Microencapsulated Tributyrin in Gamma‐Cyclodextrin Influenced by Drying Method  ap. S2252-S2257.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicroencapsulation is commonly used in the food industry for a variety of purposes including added ingredient functionally and taste‐masking for those ingredients with negative sensory qualities. Tributyrin (TB), a source intestinally‐essential butyric acid, possesses negative aroma (cheesy, fecal) and taste (bitter) qualities. This has significantly limited its use in food applications for the potential improvement of intestinal health. Utilizing spray drying and low‐temperature oven drying, microcapsules containing TB were produced using whey (WPI), WPI and inulin, and gamma‐cyclodextrin (GCD). To determine how microcapsule formulation and drying method affected the perception of TB relative to a control, microencapsulated and free TB were added to an infant formula system and evaluated using the rating method to determine R‐index measures. Pooled R‐index measures (α = 0.01, 2‐tailed, and n = 170) indicated that the only microcapsule not significantly different from the control (R‐index below 57.95%) was the GCD and TB oven dried (GCT OD) microcapsule. All other WPI, WPI–inulin, and GCD and TB spray‐dried (GCT SD) microcapsules were all significantly different from the control. Average individual R‐index results indicated that all microcapsules in infant formula, except for GCT OD, were significantly different (P < 0.01) from the control formula but not from free TB. Spray drying may create microcapsules with surface TB and disturb the GCD–TB complex, allowing free, and surface TB to be perceived by the panelists. The GCT OD microcapsule has the potential to be used for the potential oral treatment of intestinal disorders in functional food applications without the negative sensory qualities of TB.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutyric acid 3adigestive system diseases 3afood industry 3afunctional foods 3agamma-cyclodextrin 3ainfant formulas 3aingredients 3ainulin 3amicroencapsulation 3aodors 3aoral administration 3aspray drying 3ataste 3atributyrin 3awhey1 aLee, Soo‐Yeun1 aLee, Youngsoo0 tJournal of food science.g2016 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.S2252-S2257dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.134153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03875naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015800153300001800311520217300329592002802502650001702530650002502547650002002572650002102592650002502613650001702638650001402655650001602669650001802685650001802703650001702721650002802738650004302766650001402809650001902823650002102842650002002863650001202883650001002895650001002905650000902915650001602924650001802940650001002958650001802968700001602986700001303002700001503015700001603030700001503046700001603061773012503077856007403202852000903276655001203285IND60662336620221119183945.0190904e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066233662DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00550c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ou10aHepatoprotective effect of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. lignans and its formula with Rubus idaeus on chronic alcohol-induced liver injury in mice  ap. 3018-3025.  aThis study aimed to investigate the liver protection effect of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. (SC) lignans and its combination with Rubus idaeus (RI) on chronic alcohol-induced mice. A low level of SC lignans (SL) was prepared from the clear juice of sarcocarp. Lignans were further extracted from the SC seeds and added to the SL to form high-level SC lignans (SH). Moreover, RI clear juice lyophilized powder was mixed with SL (SR), and the liver protection effects of SL, SH and SR were investigated. Male ICR mice were administered with the corresponding samples and gastrically infused with 50% alcohol (1 h later) once per day for 60 d. In the in vitro study, the characteristic lignans in the SC clear juice and the seed extract were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capability of SL, SH, and SR were determined. The results of the in vivo study showed that SC lignans exhibited a dose-dependent effect on the regulation of hepatic antioxidant status, serum transaminases levels, hyperlipidemia and hepatic fat deposition in mice. However, hepatic lesions were observed in the SH mice, which indicated a potential side effect caused by long-term consumption of SH under chronic alcohol administration. By contrast, SR exhibited a similar hepatoprotective effect as SH without any abnormality found in the histological analysis. After analysis with HPLC, Schizandrol A and Schizandrol B were identified in the SC clear juice, and two more kinds of lignans, Schisandrin A and Schisandrin B, were identified in the seed extracts. The SR sample had the highest TPC and exhibited the best antioxidant capability. In conclusion, RI strengthened the liver protection effect of SC lignans effectively and safely, which was probably achieved by enhancing the antioxidant status and the positive effect of their combination was possibly attributed to both lignans and polyphenols. This study demonstrated that the combination of low-level SC lignans and RI might be used as a potential safe formula for beverage development to alleviate the adverse effects of long-term alcohol consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus idaeus 3aSchisandra chinensis 3aadverse effects 3aalcohol drinking 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3ablood serum 3adose response 3afreeze drying 3afruit juices 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahistology 3ahyperlipidemia 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3alignans 3aliver 3amales 3amice 3apolyphenols 3aseed extracts 3aseeds 3atransaminases1 aCheng, Qian1 aLiu, Jia1 aWang, Yong1 aZhao, Liang1 aZhou, Feng1 aJi, Baoping0 tFood & function.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 5, no. 11 p.3018-3025dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00550c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245013500165300001600300520127600316592002801592650001801620650000901638650002001647650001101667650001001678650002001688650002301708650001501731650001701746650002601763650002001789650000901809650002101818650001501839700002201854700002201876700002101898773012201919856007402041852000902115655001202124IND60662336820221119183552.0190904e20141224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066233682DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00554f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiotrkowski, Barbara10a(−)-Epicatechin prevents alterations in the metabolism of superoxide anion and nitric oxide in the hearts of l-NAME-treated rats  ap. 154-160.  aThe aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of (−)-epicatechin administration in the heart of a rat model with reduced NO production that follows a short-term treatment with l-NAME. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 4 d with l-NAME in the absence or presence of (−)-epicatechin in the diet. The redox status in cardiac tissue was improved by (−)-epicatechin administration. l-NAME treatment induced a decrease in NO synthase activity (−62%, p < 0.05) and an increase in NADPH-dependent superoxide anion production (+300%, p < 0.05) that were totally prevented by (−)-epicatechin administration. These effects of (−)-epicatechin were associated with a higher endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation at an activation site and a reduced expression of the regulatory subunit, p47ᵖʰᵒˣ, suggesting the involvement of posttranslational mechanisms in (−)-epicatechin action. Thus, the (−)-epicatechin treatment would restore NO steady state levels in vivo through effects on both, its synthesis and degradation via the reaction with superoxide anion. The fact that (−)-epicatechin is commonly present in human diet makes this compound a reasonable explanation for the positive cardiovascular effects of a high consumption of fruits and vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3afruits 3aheart 3ahuman nutrition 3alaboratory animals 3ametabolism 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3asuperoxide anion 3avegetables1 aCalabró, Valeria1 aGalleano, Mónica1 aFraga, Cesar G.,0 tFood & function.g2014 Dec. 24, v. 6, no. 1 p.154-160dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00554f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245013800153300001600291520117800307592002801485650002501513650002501538650002501563650001701588650001601605650001101621650002701632650001601659650002501675650002001700650001801720650001701738650002001755650001501775650002701790650002801817650001001845650001901855650002001874650000901894650001601903650002501919700001701944700001601961700001601977700001801993773012202011856007402133852000902207655001202216IND60662337020221119182402.0190904e20150211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066233702DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00557k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Yan10aDifferential protective effects of polyphenol extracts from apple peels and fleshes against acute CCl₄-induced liver damage in mice  ap. 513-524.  aThe present study reports the phenolic profiles and antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties of Red Fuji apple peel polyphenolic extract (APP) and its flesh polyphenolic extract (AFP) against CCl₄-induced acute hepatic damage in mice. It was found that the polyphenol and flavonoid contents of APP were significantly higher than those of AFP. APP was shown to exhibit stronger in vitro antioxidant activities than AFP in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of APP at 250 and 500 mg per kg bw to mice ahead of CCl₄ injection was further shown to exhibit stronger in vivo protective effects than those of AFP and could observably antagonize the CCl₄-induced increase in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities and hepatic malondialdehyde levels, and prevent the CCl₄-caused decrease in antioxidant superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, compared to CCl₄-treated mice (p < 0.05). This finding demonstrates that the polyphenolic extract from apple, particularly its peel, can be explored as a chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent against oxidative-stress-related liver disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapple peels 3aapples 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acarbon tetrachloride 3achemoprevention 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3aenzyme activity 3aflavonoids 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatoprotective effect 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3apolyphenols 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aRen, Daoyuan1 aLu, Xinshan1 aSun, Yanfei1 aYang, Xingbin0 tFood & function.g2015 Feb. 11, v. 6, no. 2 p.513-524dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00557k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245012300166300001400289520087400303592002801177650002901205650002501234650002201259650001601281650001801297650001901315700001501334700002001349700001801369700001501387700001301402700001701415700001701432700001401449700001501463700001501478700001701493700001601510700001901526700001801545773009501563856005501658852000901713655001201722IND4468554220221122041930.0120423e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446855422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2338.2012.02527.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenis, M.10aNew protocols to assess the environmental impact of pests in the EPPO decision‐support scheme for pest risk analysis  ap. 21-27.  aAssessing the potential environmental impact of alien plants and plant pests is notoriously difficult. New protocols have been developed in the framework of the EC project PRATIQUE to provide guidance on environmental impact assessment in the EPPO pest risk analysis (PRA) decision‐support scheme and enhance consistency between risk assessors and risk ratings for different pests. A set of questions with rating guidance and examples is provided, and individual scores are summarized into final scores, using a hierarchy of risk matrices, to assess current and potential environmental impacts. Two separate protocols are available: for alien plants and for other pests. These protocols could also be used to assess environmental impact in other PRA schemes as well as to assign alien species to regional black lists or to prioritize species for management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aintroduced plants 3aplant pests 3arisk analysis 3arisk assessors1 aBacher, S.1 aBaker, R.

Acid‐thinned samples were prepared with 0.54 M HCl for 4 h using the slurry process. The suspension temperature was adjusted to 2, 25, and 50°C, respectively. Simultaneously, samples were produced applying the same conditions without acid (annealing). The carbohydrate solubilization due to hydrolysis at 50°C was remarkable (7.60%, w/w) compared to the other samples (annealed and hydrolyzed, <1%, w/w). No differences in DSC gelatinization temperatures (tₒₙₛₑₜ, tₚₑₐₖ ₘₐₓᵢₘᵤₘ, tcₒₙcₗᵤₛᵢₒₙ) were found when modified at 2 and 25°C, independent of annealing or acid‐thinning. However, modification at 50°C enhanced the gelatinization temperatures significantly, whereat the values of the hydrolyzed sample were higher compared to the corresponding annealed one. Investigation of the water hydration capacity gave evidence for higher granule swelling when processed at 50°C. Compared to the annealed counterpart, the hydrolysis‐induced molar mass reduction increased with increasing suspension temperature. Especially at 50°C, both the amylose fraction and the branch chain length of the amylopectin decreased noticeably. A sol‐to‐gel transition of the paste and the ability to form a firm gel was exclusively determined for the sample hydrolyzed at 50°C. Basically, the enhancement of the hydrolysis temperature from 25 to 50°C caused an enormous change of the investigated starch properties. However, the differences found between modification at 2 and 25°C were marginal. The acid‐thinning is assumed to be a cooperating process of both annealing and hydrolysis (chain cleavage).  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3aannealing 3agelatinization 3agels 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3aslurries 3asolubilization 3atemperature1 aLampl, Viktoria1 aFlöter, Eckhard0 tStärke =.g2016 Sept., v. 68, no. 9-10 p.885-899dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2015003653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013100162300001800293520103300311592002801344650001801372650002101390650001101411650000901422650001701431650001301448650002701461650001301488650001601501650001101517700002501528700002201553700002101575700002301596700002101619773012501640856007401765852000901839655001201848IND60662337720221119182311.0190904e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066233772DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00573b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoehm, Michael W.10aInfluence of hydration and starch digestion on the transient rheology of an aqueous suspension of comminuted potato snack food  ap. 2775-2782.  aOral processing of most foods is inherently destructive: solids are broken into particles before reassembly into a hydrated bolus while salivary enzymes degrade food components. In order to investigate the underlying physics driving changes during oral processing, we capture the transient rheological behaviour of a simulated potato chip bolus during hydration by a buffer with or without α-amylase. In the absence of amylase and for all oil contents and solids weight fractions tested, we find a collapse of the transient data when graphed according to simple Fickian diffusion. In the presence of amylase, we find effects on the transient and pseudo steady state bolus rheology. Within the first minute of mixing, the amylase degrades only ≈6% of the starch but that leads to an order of magnitude reduction in the bolus elasticity, as compared to the case without amylase. Thus, for an in vitro bolus, only a small amount of starch needs to be digested to have a large impact on the bolus rheology very soon after mixing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3afood composition 3amixing 3aoils 3apotato chips 3apotatoes 3arheological properties 3arheology 3asnack foods 3astarch1 aWarren, Frederick J.1 aMoore, Jackson E.1 aBaier, Stefan K.1 aGidley, Michael J.1 aStokes, Jason R.0 tFood & function.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 5, no. 11 p.2775-2782dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00573b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009200164300001600256500002000272520136300292592002801655650002501683650002401708650002001732650001001752650001301762650001501775650001601790650002501806650001101831650002901842700002001871700002001891700001801911700002001929700002401949700001901973700001901992773009502011856007802106852000902184655001202193IND60550383520161216000000.0160910e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055038352DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2016000232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelikova, Petya10aStarch utilization routes in lactic acid bacteria: New insight by gene expression assay  ap. 953-960.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe annotation of full genomes of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (ALAB) leads to conviction that many of them contain a basic pool of chromosomal genes, responsible for starch hydrolysis. However, only the strains that are forced to survive in starchy environment are able to display these genetically determined properties. The aim of the present work is to investigate the genes actually engaged in starch utilization by ALAB using gene transcription assay. Twenty five new ALAB strains, belonging to 11 distinct species of four genera were isolated and analyzed. Among them, the first amylolytic Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecium, and E. durans were reported. The presence and expression of the genes amy1, glgP, glgB, agl, malL, treC, and dexC were examined. Although all strains possessed extracellular and cell‐bound amylase activity and produced lactic acid from starch, high genus and species specificity in the gene expression was observed. ALAB strains of genus Lactobacillus (except L. sakei) and P. acidilactici own and express all the tested genes, while E. faecium and E. durans strains expressed predominantly the gene, encoding amylase. The co‐transcription of glgP and glgB genes indicates that glycogen synthesis and starch degradation occur in parallel, which is another example for dual metabolic role of biochemical paths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aLactobacillus sakei 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycogen 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3astarch 3atranscription (genetics)1 aStoyanov, Anton1 aBlagoeva, Galya1 aPopova, Luiza1 aPetrov, Kaloyan1 aGotcheva, Velitchka1 aAngelov, Angel1 aPetrova, Penka0 tStärke =.g2016 Sept., v. 68, no. 9-10 p.953-960dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2016000233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01331naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245010100156300001600257500001100273520039000284592002800674650001300702650001400715650001400729650001300743650000900756650001500765650002000780700002300800773009500823856007800918852000900996655001201005IND60550384120161216000000.0160910e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055038412DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2016001252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Xin10aHeat and moisture modification of native starch granules on susceptibility to amylase hydrolysis  ap. 816-820.  aREVIEW  aAlthough annealing and heat‐moisture treatments do not gelatinize or modify the size or shape of starch granules, the treatments do cause modification to the internal structure of the granules and as a consequence of these changes, modify the rate and extent of hydrolysis by amylases.

The aim of the study was to establish the method of human ex vivo digestion of carp muscle tissue and evaluate the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant activities of hydrolysates obtained after digestion. It was found that the hydrolysates of carp muscle tissue obtained with the three-stage method of simulated ex vivo digestion showed ACE inhibitory as well as antioxidative activities. It was demonstrated that the degree of hydrolysis depended on the duration of individual stages and the degree of comminution of the examined material. Although the applied gastric juices initiated the process of hydrolysis of carp muscle tissue, the duodenal juices caused a rapid increase in the amount of hydrolysed polypeptide bonds. The antihypertensive and antioxidative activities of the hydrolysates of carp muscle tissue increased together with progressive protein degradation. However, the high degree of protein hydrolysis does not favour an increase in the activity of free radical scavenging. The presented results are an example of the first preliminary screening of the potential health-promoting biological activity of carp muscle tissue in an ex vivo study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acarp 3adietary protein 3adigestive tract 3aduodenal juices 3aenzyme inhibition 3afree radical scavengers 3agastric juice 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestion 3amuscle tissues 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3apolypeptides 3aprotein degradation 3ascreening1 aDarewicz, M.1 aVegarud, G.

In a previous study, we have shown that Sri Lankan cinnamon (C. zeylanicum) was one of the most potent anti-inflammatory foods out of 115 foods tested. However, knowledge about the exact nature of the anti-inflammatory compounds and their distribution in the two major cinnamon species used for human consumption is limited. The aim of this investigation was to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of C. zeylanicum and C. cassia and elucidate their main phytochemical compounds. When extracts were tested in LPS and IFN-γ activated RAW 264.7 macrophages, most of the anti-inflammatory activity, measured by down-regulation of nitric oxide and TNF-α production, was observed in the organic extracts. The most abundant compounds in these extracts were E-cinnamaldehyde and o-methoxycinnamaldehyde. The highest concentration of E-cinnamaldehyde was found in the DCM extract of C. zeylanicum or C. cassia (31 and 34 mg g⁻¹ of cinnamon, respectively). When these and other constituents were tested for their anti-inflammatory activity in RAW 264.7 and J774A.1 macrophages, the most potent compounds were E-cinnamaldehyde and o-methoxycinnamaldehyde, which exhibited IC₅₀ values for NO with RAW 264.7 cells of 55 ± 9 μM (7.3 ± 1.2 μg mL⁻¹) and 35 ± 9 μM (5.7 ± 1.5 μg mL⁻¹), respectively; and IC₅₀ values for TNF-α of 63 ± 9 μM (8.3 ± 1.2 μg mL⁻¹) and 78 ± 16 μM (12.6 ± 2.6 μg mL⁻¹), respectively. If therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in target tissues, cinnamon and its components may be useful in the treatment of age-related inflammatory conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3abioactive compounds 3acinnamon 3afoods 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterferon-gamma 3amacrophages 3anitric oxide 3aphytochemicals 3atherapeutics 3atissues 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aKarunaweera, Niloo1 aLee, Samiuela1 avan Der Kooy, Frank1 aHarman, David G.1 aRaju, Ritesh1 aBennett, Louise1 aGyengesi, Erika1 aSucher, Nikolaus J.1 aMünch, Gerald0 tFood & function.g2015 Mar. 11, v. 6, no. 3 p.910-919dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00680a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011400156300001600270520169400286592002801980650002402008650001902032650001802051650003102069650002402100650001702124650001602141650000902157650001302166650001102179650004602190650001902236650001202255650002102267650002802288650001602316650002302332650002302355650000902378650001002387650002402397650002102421650001902442650001602461650000902477650001902486650002502505650002102530650002102551700001802572700002202590700001902612700002402631773012202655856007402777852000902851655001202860IND60662341320221119183818.0190904e20150311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066234132DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00711e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIssac, Abin10aSafety and anti-ulcerogenic activity of a novel polyphenol-rich extract of clove buds (Syzygium aromaticum L)  ap. 842-852.  aDespite the various reports on the pharmacology of Clove bud [Syzygium aromaticum]-derived essential oil and its major component eugenol, systematic information on the bioactivity of clove polyphenols is very limited. Clove buds being one of the richest sources of dietary polyphenols with many traditional medicinal uses, the present contribution attempted to derive their standardized polyphenol-rich extracts as a water soluble free flowing powder (Clovinol) suitable for functional food applications, without the issues of its characteristic pungency and aroma. The extract was characterized by electrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS), and investigated for in vivo antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerogenic activities. Clovinol showed significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as measured by cellular antioxidant levels, and the ability to inhibit carrageenan-induced paw swelling in mice. Further investigations revealed its significant anti-ulcerogenic activity (>97% inhibition of ethanol-induced stomach ulcers in Wistar rats when orally administered at 100 mg per kg b.w.) and up regulation of in vivo antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT). Clovinol also reduced the extent of lipid peroxidation among ulcer induced rats, indicating its usefulness in ameliorating oxidative stress and improving gastrointestinal health, especially upon chronic alcohol consumption. The extract was also shown to be safe and suitable for further investigations and development upon acute toxicity studies at 5 g per kg body weight and 28 days of repeated dose toxicity studies at 2.5 g per kg b.w.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3aacute toxicity 3aalcohol abuse 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanti-ulcer activity 3aantioxidants 3abody weight 3abuds 3acatalase 3acloves 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aessential oils 3aeugenol 3afunctional foods 3agastrointestinal system 3aglutathione 3alaboratory animals 3alipid peroxidation 3amice 3aodors 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aplant extracts 3apolyphenols 3arats 3astomach ulcers 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity testing 3awater solubility1 aGopakumar, G.1 aKuttan, Ramadasan1 aMaliakel, Balu1 aKrishnakumar, I.

The goal of the study was therefore to investigate effects of fat-rich diet on mechanisms involved in fat deposition in the liver. Three hundred blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) juveniles (initial weight 18.00±0.05g) were fed with two diets (5% or 15% fat) for 8weeks. Histological and biochemical parameters were determined. The hepatic triacylglycerol (TG) secretion rate was measured by intraperitoneal injection with poloxamer 407 (a lipoprotein lipase inhibitor). Lipid transport was studied by determining components of lipoproteins. We also examined lipid uptake by assaying lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activities and mRNA expressions in tissues. Our results showed that ultrastructural lesions of organelles in hepatocytes occurred after intake of a high-fat diet. The hepatic TG secretion rate and plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) amount of fish fed high-fat diet were significantly lower compared to those of fish fed control diet. Concomitantly, variations of components of lipoproteins were also apparent. In the liver, muscle and mesenteric fat tissue, the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) was significantly increased, while both saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) percentages decreased in high-fat group. Both activities and mRNA expressions of LPL were also increased in these tissues. On the whole, a low level of lipid transport out of the liver, alterations of lipid transport and elevated lipid uptake contributed to fatty liver of blunt snout bream fed high-fat diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegalobrama amblycephala 3afatty liver 3afish 3afish feeding 3agene expression 3ahepatocytes 3ahigh fat diet 3aintraperitoneal injection 3ajuveniles 3alipoprotein lipase 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3amuscles 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3asecretion 3atriacylglycerols 3avery low density lipoprotein 0aHigh-fat diet 0aLipid transport 0aLipid deposition 0aLiver 0aBlunt snout bream1 aXu, Wei-Na1 aLi, Xiang-Fei1 aLiu, Wen-Bin1 aWang, Lina,1 aZhang, Chun-Nuan0 tAquaculture.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 408-409 p.160-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013300161300002000294520100600314592002801320650001401348650002801362650003201390650002301422650001901445650001801464650000901482650002201491650001101513650001301524650002301537650002001560650001901580650001701599650001501616650002501631700001601656700001801672700001601690700001601706700001701722700001401739773012401753856007401877852000901951655001201960IND60661196620221119085208.0190828e20190823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066119662DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra05152j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiangdong10aSpermidine enhanced resistance of Chlorella to high levels of CO₂ and light intensity for improving photosynthetic growth rate  ap. 26495-26502.  aIn order to promote the photosynthetic growth rate of Chlorella in the presence of flue gas CO₂ from coal-fired power plants, spermidine was first used to enhance cellular resistance to a high CO₂ concentration (15%) and high light intensity (30 000 lux). It was found that low concentrations (100–300 μM) of spermidine significantly enhanced the photosynthetic growth rate of Chlorella. The accelerated cell division decreased the cell diameter from 3.64 μm to 2.71 μm and the fractal dimension from 1.60 to 1.49, and the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) increased from 0.48 U mL⁻¹ to 5.33 U mL⁻¹. Expression levels of key enzymes of photosystems I and II, ATP synthase and transportase markedly increased, thereby enhancing the electron transport and energy supply that reduced oxidative damage. Finally, an enhanced cellular resistance to the high CO₂ concentration and high light intensity increased the biomass yield from 0.11 g L⁻¹ to 1.71 g L⁻¹ (300 μM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3acell division 3acoal 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3afractal dimensions 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthesis 3apower plants 3aspermidine 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aZheng, Run,1 aLu, Hongxiang1 aChu, Feifei1 aXu, Junchen1 aWang, Xuebin1 aCen, Kefa0 tRSC advances.g2019 Aug. 23, v. 9, no. 45 p.26495-26502dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05152j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011500173300001400288520153700302592002801839650002301867650001201890650001301902650001101915650001601926650001301942650001501955650002401970650002001994653002202014653002302036653002202059653001502081653002002096700001702116700002402133700002102157700001802178773009402196856008502290852000902375655001202384IND60604160120221122124352.0180905e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060416012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2014.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavender, Jason M.14aThe interactive role of distress tolerance and eating expectancies in bulimic symptoms among substance abusers  ap. 88-91.  aDifficulties tolerating distress and the expectancy that eating will relieve negative affect have been linked with bulimic symptoms, which commonly co-occur with other forms of psychopathology characterized by emotion dysregulation (e.g., substance abuse). Indeed, problems with emotional functioning may be of particular relevance to bulimic symptoms in at-risk populations with heightened emotion dysregulation (such as substance use disorder patients). This study examined the interactive role of two emotion-related constructs (distress tolerance and the expectancy that eating relieves negative affect) in relation to bulimic symptoms among patients (N=93) recruited from a residential substance abuse treatment facility. Participants completed the Bulimia Test-Revised, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Distress Tolerance Scale, and the Eating Expectancy Inventory. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the main effects and interaction of distress tolerance and negative affect eating expectancies in relation to bulimic symptoms, controlling for participant gender and overall negative affect. Significant main effects were found for both distress tolerance and negative affect eating expectancies, and these two constructs were found to significantly interact in the prediction of bulimic symptoms. Interventions that address these constructs may be useful in treating those with bulimic symptoms, as well as those with co-occurring bulimic symptoms and substance use disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3abinging 3adistress 3agender 3ainventories 3apatients 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asubstance abuse 0aDisordered eating 0aEmotion regulation 0aAffect regulation 0aExpectancy 0aSubstance abuse1 aHappel, Kate1 aAnestis, Michael D.1 aTull, Matthew T.1 aGratz, Kim L.0 tEating behaviors.g2015 Jan., v. 16 p.88-91dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2014.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01720naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011000157300002000267520050900287592002800796650001200824650001500836650002300851650001800874650001400892650001900906650001300925650001200938700001500950700001800965700001700983700001301000700001601013700001701029700001301046700001301059700001901072773012401091856007401215852000901289655001201298IND60661197320221119085222.0190828e20190823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066119732DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra05420k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yifeng10aEnhanced production of aromatics from propane with a temperature-shifting two-stage fluidized bed reactor  ap. 26532-26536.  aA temperature-shifting two-stage fluidized bed reactor technology was used to convert propane and its intermediate products into aromatics.

An aromatic sulfur group could be chemoselectively introduced at α- or β-position of carbonyls with different sulfur reagents under slightly changed reaction conditions. A series of desired products were obtained in moderate to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies revealed that B₂pin₂ played the key role in activating the transformation towards the β-thiolation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This transition-metal-catalyst-free method provides a convenient and efficient tool for the highly chemoselective preparation of α-thiolation or β-sulfenylation products of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonyl compounds 3achemoselectivity 3asulfur1 aLi, Juan1 aLi, Xiang1 aWang, Jiayi1 aPeng, Yanqing1 aSong, Gonghua0 tRSC advances.g2019 Aug. 22, v. 9, no. 45 p.26419-26424dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05708k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009600154300002000250520083300270592002801103650001001131650001201141650002001153650001401173700001701187700001701204700001201221773012401233856007401357852000901431655001201440IND60661197920221119085315.0190828e20190821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066119792DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06370f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dawei10aFormation of G-quadruplex structure in supercoiled DNA under molecularly crowded conditions  ap. 26248-26251.  aG-quadruplex is a secondary structure of nucleic acids that plays crucial roles in many significant biological processes. Potential G-quadruplex-forming sequences exist widely in various regions of the genome such as telomeres and gene promoters. In spite of the fact that G-quadruplex can be readily assembled from a single-stranded segment of DNA, its formation from duplex DNA is very difficult under physiological conditions because Watson–Crick interactions in guanine rich segments need to be weakened first. It is demonstrated in our studies that intrastrand G-quadruplex generated from a perfectly matched guanine-rich duplex in a circular DNA as a result of significant quadruplex stabilization and duplex destabilization created by the combined actions of negative DNA supercoiling and molecular crowding conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3aguanine 3asupercoiled DNA 3atelomeres1 aPeng, Peiwen1 aYang, Zhaoqi1 aLv, Bei0 tRSC advances.g2019 Aug. 21, v. 9, no. 45 p.26248-26251dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06370f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011000157300001800267520122600285592002801511650002401539650001401563650001901577650001101596650001501607650001101622650002901633650002101662650001101683650001701694650002501711651001801736700002401754773012401778856007501902852000901977655001201986IND60536281820221120191956.0160806e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628182DNAL7 a10.1021/es505621s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuksel, Tugce10aEffects of Regional Temperature on Electric Vehicle Efficiency, Range, and Emissions in the United States  ap. 3974-3980.  aWe characterize the effect of regional temperature differences on battery electric vehicle (BEV) efficiency, range, and use-phase power plant CO₂ emissions in the U.S. The efficiency of a BEV varies with ambient temperature due to battery efficiency and cabin climate control. We find that annual energy consumption of BEVs can increase by an average of 15% in the Upper Midwest or in the Southwest compared to the Pacific Coast due to temperature differences. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from BEVs vary primarily with marginal regional grid mix, which has three times the GHG intensity in the Upper Midwest as on the Pacific Coast. However, even within a grid region, BEV emissions vary by up to 22% due to spatial and temporal ambient temperature variation and its implications for vehicle efficiency and charging duration and timing. Cold climate regions also encounter days with substantial reduction in EV range: the average range of a Nissan Leaf on the coldest day of the year drops from 70 miles on the Pacific Coast to less than 45 miles in the Upper Midwest. These regional differences are large enough to affect adoption patterns and energy and environmental implications of BEVs relative to alternatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abatteries 3acarbon dioxide 3acoasts 3acold zones 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aleaves 3apower plants 3avehicles (equipment) 3aUnited States1 aMichalek, Jeremy J.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Mar. 17, v. 49, no. 6 p.3974-3980dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505621s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245017800170300001400348520143200362592002801794650001601822650001801838650002601856650001601882650001101898650001201909653002701921653001801948653002001966653001601986653002002002653001302022700001802035700001702053700001802070700001702088700002702105773009402132856008502226852000902311655001202320IND60604161820221119173612.0180905e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060416182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2014.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStok, F.

The purpose of the current study was to examine associations of these two factors with unhealthy snacking among adolescents. We also investigated whether self-regulatory competence could attenuate the negative effects of being sensitive to the food environment.A survey was completed by 11,392 European adolescents (10–17years old). The survey measured psychological sensitivity to the food environment, self-regulatory competence and self-reported unhealthy snack intake.Higher food environment sensitivity and lower self-regulatory competence were associated with more unhealthy snacking. The two factors also interacted, with self-regulatory competence attenuating the influence of high food environment sensitivity.Adolescents who are sensitive to the food environment reported higher unhealthy snack intake. More frequent use of self-regulation strategies on the other hand was associated with lower unhealthy snack intake. Moreover, self-regulatory competence was found to moderate the influence of psychological sensitivity to the food environment on unhealthy snacking, although the effect size was small. Fostering adolescents' self-regulatory competence can help enable them to better navigate the obesogenic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aeating habits 3aenvironmental factors 3afood intake 3asnacks 3asurveys 0aObesogenic environment 0aPower of food 0aSelf-regulation 0aAdolescence 0aEating behavior 0aSnacking1 aDe Vet, Emely1 aWardle, Jane1 aChu, Maria T.1 aDe Wit, John1 aDe Ridder, Denise T.D.0 tEating behaviors.g2015 Apr., v. 17 p.19-22dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2014.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245010600152300002000258520128600278592002801564650001701592650001401609650002301623650001101646650002801657650002101685650001001706650002401716650001101740650001301751650002401764650001701788650001401805700001801819700002101837700001601858700001301874700001301887700001501900700001701915773014401932856007402076852000902150655001202159IND60661198820221119085441.0190828e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066119882DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta05455c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Luo12aA universal synthesis strategy to make metal nitride electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction  ap. 19728-19732.  aTransition-metal nitrides have increasingly attracted interest for use as electrocatalysts in water splitting due to their superior catalytic activity and stability. However, the development of a general and simple strategy to synthesize metal nitrides remains challenging. Here we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of various porous monometallic and bimetallic nitrides on different substrates for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. The best monometallic nitride of CoN supported on the Ni foam delivered current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm⁻² at overpotentials of 95 and 212 mV, respectively in 1 M KOH. This performance was further improved through Ni-doping to form bimetallic nitrides of NiCoN, the best of which exhibited excellent HER performance with low overpotentials of 48 and 149 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm⁻², respectively, along with superior stability in 1 M KOH. The enhanced performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Co and Ni, a larger surface area with more active sites, and improved electrical conductivity for more efficient charge transfer. This work demonstrates a particularly facile and general approach to synthesize porous transition metal nitrides with advanced HER performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3afoams 3ahydrogen production 3anickel 3anitrides 3apotassium hydroxide 3asurface area 3asynergism1 aSong, Shaowei1 aMcElhenny, Brian1 aDing, Fazhu1 aLuo, Dan1 aYu, Ying1 aChen, Shuo1 aRen, Zhifeng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 7, no. 34 p.19728-19732dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta05455c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245006400163300001800227520143100245592002801676650002901704650002001733650002201753650000901775650000901784650002101793650001001814650001901824650001401843650001101857650001501868650001101883650001401894650003501908650001401943700002501957700002401982700002302006700002102029700002102050700002102071773012402092856007502216852000902291655001202300IND60536282420221120222904.0160806e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628242DNAL7 a10.1021/es50570382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDietrich, Joseph P.10aAssimilation Efficiency of PBDE Congeners in Chinook Salmon  ap. 3878-3886.  aPolybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are environmental contaminants that can accumulate in biota. PBDE accumulation in an organism depends on exposure, assimilation efficiency, and elimination/metabolism. Net assimilation efficiency represents the fraction of the contaminant that is retained in the organism after exposure. In the present study, congener-specific estimates of net PBDE assimilation efficiencies were calculated from dietary exposures of juvenile Chinook salmon. The fish were exposed to one to eight PBDE congeners up to 1500 ng total PBDEs/g food. Mean assimilation efficiencies varied from 0.32 to 0.50 for BDE congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154. The assimilation efficiency of BDE49 was significantly greater than 100%, suggesting biotransformation from higher brominated congeners. Whole body concentrations of BDE49 significantly increased with both exposure to increasing concentrations of BDE99 and decreasing fish lipid levels, implying lipid-influenced debromination of BDE99 to BDE49. Excluding BDE49, PBDE assimilation efficiency was not significantly related to the numbers of congeners in the diets, or congener hydrophobicity, but was greater in foods with higher lipid levels. Estimates of PBDE assimilation efficiency can be used in bioaccumulation models to assess threats from PBDE exposure to Chinook salmon health and recovery efforts, as well as to their predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3abioaccumulation 3abiotransformation 3adiet 3afish 3aflame retardants 3afoods 3ahydrophobicity 3ajuveniles 3alipids 3ametabolism 3amodels 3apollution 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apredators1 aStrickland, Stacy A.1 aHutchinson, Greg P.1 aVan Gaest, Ahna L.1 aKrupkin, Alex B.1 aYlitalo, Gina M.1 aArkoosh, Mary R.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Mar. 17, v. 49, no. 6 p.3878-3886dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50570383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015200155300002000307520150100327592002801828650001401856650001101870650001401881650002301895650003401918650002101952650001501973650001601988650001902004650001902023650002302042650002202065650002102087650001302108700001602121700002002137700001802157773014402175856007402319852000902393655001202402IND60661199120221119085532.0190828e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066119912DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta05719f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Song10aThermally driven phase transition of manganese oxide on carbon cloth for enhancing the performance of flexible all-solid-state zinc–air batteries  ap. 19719-19727.  aFlexible and rechargeable zinc–air batteries with high energy density and stable output voltage are promising energy sources for wearable electronics and implantable medical devices. The development of efficient bi-functional catalysts with low-cost and environmentally friendly properties has become the focus of research on rechargeable zinc–air batteries. Herein, we present the in situ growth of manganese oxide (MnOₓ) on carbon cloth (MnOₓ-CC) by incorporating a simple chemical bath deposition method with the phase transformation of MnOₓ driven by thermal treatment for improving the bifunctional catalytic activities for the ORR and OER. With bifunctional catalytic activities, the carbon cloth supported MnOₓ electrode without an additional nonconductive binder has been used to assemble an all-solid-state rechargeable zinc–air battery. The solid-state battery shows a high open circuit voltage (1.47 V), superior round-trip efficiency (62.4% after 120 cycles), long cycling life (45 h over an operating voltage of 1.2 V), and high capacity (728 mA h g⁻¹), which is superior to those of the Pt/C and RuO₂ based battery. The battery also demonstrated excellent mechanical flexibility and cycling stability without obvious performance degradation. The present work provides an efficient approach to prepare advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts for the fabrication of all-solid-state zinc–air batteries, which would meet the demand for flexible and wearable devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3aenergy density 3aheat treatment 3amanganese monoxide 3amedical equipment 3aphase transition 3aplatinum1 aShu, Xinxin1 aWang, Huaisheng1 aZhang, Jintao0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 7, no. 34 p.19719-19727dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta05719f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009500154300001800249520126400267592002801531650001401559650001301573650001601586650001401602650001401616650001201630650001001642650001801652650000901670651001001679700001801689700001501707700001901722700001501741700001401756700001301770773012401783856007501907852000901982655001201991IND60536282820221120212635.0160806e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628282DNAL7 a10.1021/es505723a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qingru10aNew Insight into Atmospheric Mercury Emissions from Zinc Smelters Using Mass Flow Analysis  ap. 3532-3539.  aThe mercury (Hg) flow paths from three zinc (Zn) smelters indicated that a large quantity of Hg, approximately 38.0–57.0% of the total Hg input, was stored as acid slag in the landfill sites. Approximately 15.0–27.1% of the Hg input was emitted into water or stored as open-dumped slags, and 3.3–14.5% of the Hg input ended in sulfuric acid. Atmospheric Hg emissions, accounting for 1.4–9.6% of the total Hg input, were from both the Zn production and waste disposal processes. Atmospheric Hg emissions from the waste disposal processes accounted for 40.6, 89.6, and 94.6% of the total atmospheric Hg emissions of the three studied smelters, respectively. The Zn production process mainly contributed to oxidized Hg (Hg²⁺) emissions, whereas the waste disposal process generated mostly elemental Hg (Hg⁰) emissions. When the emissions from these two processes are considered together, the emission proportion of the Hg²⁺ mass was 51, 46, and 29% in smelters A, B, and C, respectively. These results indicated that approximately 10.8 ± 5.8 t of atmospheric Hg emissions from the waste disposal process were ignored in recent inventories. Therefore, the total atmospheric Hg emissions from the Zn industry of China should be approximately 50 t.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aindustry 3ainventories 3alandfills 3amass flow 3amercury 3aslags 3asulfuric acid 3azinc 3aChina1 aWang, Shuxiao1 aHui, Mulin1 aWang, Fengyang1 aZhang, Lei1 aDuan, Lei1 aLuo, Yao0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Mar. 17, v. 49, no. 6 p.3532-3539dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505723a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010500156300002000261520145600281592002801737650001501765650001401780650001101794650001301805650001701818650002101835650002201856650001101878650001301889650002201902650001101924700001901935700001701954700001501971700001701986773014402003856007402147852000902221655001202230IND60661199720221119085605.0190828e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066119972DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta06232g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Shuaiyu10aTheoretical insights into nitrogen fixation on Ti₂C and Ti₂CO₂ in a lithium–nitrogen battery  ap. 19950-19960.  aRecently, the first lithium–nitrogen (Li–N₂) battery was designed, achieving a reversible electrochemical reaction between N₂ and Li₃N under ambient conditions (Ma et al., Chem, 2017, 2, 525–532). However, the performance of a Li–N₂ battery is limited by the weak interaction between the carbon cloth cathode substrate and N₂. In the present work, we theoretically evaluate a Ti₂C monolayer as a potential cathode substrate to improve the performance of an Li–N₂ battery. Our results reveal that N₂ interacts strongly with the bare Ti₂C substrate with low adsorption energy and a lot of electron transfer, and the existence of Li atoms facilitates N₂ dissociation. The estimated discharge and charge overpotentials of this novel electrochemical system are less than 0.55 V. With regard to the typical surface termination, the oxygen (O) termination weakens the N₂ fixation, hinders the dissociation and increases the overpotential of the electrochemical reaction. According to the present theoretical calculations, Ti₂CO₂ will be lithiated to Ti₂CO₂Li₂ in the initial discharge state, and the lithiated Ti₂CO₂ substrate can decrease discharge and charge overpotentials in comparison to a bare Ti₂CO₂ substrate. Our work is the first theoretical report on the mechanism of an Li–N₂ battery on a Ti₂C cathode substrate, which provides a feasible strategy for efficient N₂ fixation and reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acathodes 3adissociation 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aoxygen1 aLiu, Guangdong1 aLiu, Zhixiao1 aHu, Wangyu1 aDeng, Huiqiu0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 7, no. 34 p.19950-19960dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta06232g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009600156300001800252520123700270592002801507650002201535650002701557650001201584650001901596650001601615650001201631650001201643650001301655650001301668650001701681700001901698700001701717700001901734700001501753773012401768856007501892852000901967655001201976IND60536283120221120052644.0160806e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628312DNAL7 a10.1021/es505803c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Lan Hee10aPhysicochemical Interactions between Rhamnolipids and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Layers  ap. 3718-3726.  aThis study investigated the physicochemical interactions between a rhamnolipid biosurfactant and a biofilm layer. A concentration of 300 μg mL–¹ of rhamnolipids, which is around the critical micelle concentration value (240 μg mL–¹), showed great potential for reducing biofilm. The surface free energy between the rhamnolipids and biofilm layer decreased, as did the negative surface charge, due to the removal of negatively charged humic-like, protein-like, and fulvic acid-like substances. The carbohydrate and protein concentrations composed of extracellular polymeric substances decreased by 31.6% and 79.6%, respectively, at a rhamnolipid concentration of 300 μg mL–¹. In particular, rhamnolipids can interact with proteins, leading to a reduction of the N source and amide groups on the membrane. For carbohydrates, the component ratio of glucosamine was decreased, but the levels of glucose and mannose that form the majority of the carbohydrates remained unchanged. To our knowledge, the present study is the first attempt at studying the interactions of the two phases of rhamnolipids and the biofilm layer, and as such is expected to clarify the mechanism by which rhamnolipids lead to a reduction in biofilm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abiofilm 3abiosurfactants 3aglucosamine 3aglucose 3amannose 3amicelles 3aproteins 3arhamnolipids1 aJung, Yongmoon1 aYu, Hye-Weon1 aChae, Kyu-Jung1 aKim, In S.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Mar. 17, v. 49, no. 6 p.3718-3726dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505803c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012600160300001800286520138800304592002801692650001301720650001501733650002801748650001301776650002401789650001101813650001501824650001701839650001501856650001501871650001001886650002201896650002301918650001201941650001401953651001501967700002101982700002202003700002502025700002502050700001802075700002102093700002002114773012402134856007502258852000902333655001202342IND60536283420221120052627.0160806e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628342DNAL7 a10.1021/es505846r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReid, Colleen E.10aSpatiotemporal Prediction of Fine Particulate Matter During the 2008 Northern California Wildfires Using Machine Learning  ap. 3887-3896.  aEstimating population exposure to particulate matter during wildfires can be difficult because of insufficient monitoring data to capture the spatiotemporal variability of smoke plumes. Chemical transport models (CTMs) and satellite retrievals provide spatiotemporal data that may be useful in predicting PM₂.₅ during wildfires. We estimated PM₂.₅ concentrations during the 2008 northern California wildfires using 10-fold cross-validation (CV) to select an optimal prediction model from a set of 11 statistical algorithms and 29 predictor variables. The variables included CTM output, three measures of satellite aerosol optical depth, distance to the nearest fires, meteorological data, and land use, traffic, spatial location, and temporal characteristics. The generalized boosting model (GBM) with 29 predictor variables had the lowest CV root mean squared error and a CV-R² of 0.803. The most important predictor variable was the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Aerosol/Smoke Product (GASP) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), followed by the CTM output and distance to the nearest fire cluster. Parsimonious models with various combinations of fewer variables also predicted PM₂.₅ well. Using machine learning algorithms to combine spatiotemporal data from satellites and CTMs can reliably predict PM₂.₅ concentrations during a major wildfire event.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aland use 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3aprediction 3asatellites 3asmoke 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3atraffic 3awildfires 3aCalifornia1 aJerrett, Michael1 aPetersen, Maya L.1 aPfister, Gabriele

The use of NMC as a template improves the electronic conductivity of the catalyst, while the high specific surface area increases the number of active sites and the highly ordered mesoporous structure enables fast mass transfer. As a result, the Ni₃S₄/NMC catalyst shows a half-wave potential (E₁/₂) of 0.89 V vs. RHE for the ORR in 0.1 M KOH and a potential of 1.57 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm⁻² (Eⱼ₌₁₀) for the OER in 1.0 M KOH. The potential gap ΔE (ΔE = Eⱼ₌₁₀ − E₁/₂) is 0.68 V, which is significantly lower than the 0.8 V for 10 wt% Pt/C + IrO₂. The primary Zn–air battery shows a maximum power density of 186 mW cm⁻² and an energy density as high as 805 W h kg⁻¹ at 100 mA cm⁻². The battery also exhibits favorable long-term cycling behaviour (the polarization voltage increased by only 0.05 V after 300 charge/discharge cycles for 100 h). This work provides an effective strategy for the design of metal–carbon nanohybrid electrocatalysts for low-cost energy storage and conversion devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy density 3amass transfer 3ananohybrids 3anickel 3aoxygen production 3aplatinum 3aporous media 3apotassium hydroxide 3asulfides 3asurface area1 aLuo, Jiangshui1 aZhang, Xuan1 aZhou, Chen1 aSeo, Jin Won1 aSubramanian, Palaniappan1 aYan, Jia-wei1 aFransaer, Jan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 7, no. 34 p.19889-19897dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta06446j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245012700209300001600336520088800352592002801240650002201268650001201290650002001302650001301322650001301335650001201348650001301360650001001373653001701383653002201400653001301422653001501435653001001450700002501460700002601485700002401511773009601535856008501631852000901716655001201725IND60604164320221119175102.0180905e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060416432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoker, Elise L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6976-271114aThe difficulty in defining binge eating in obese women: How it affects prevalence levels in presurgical bariatric patients  ap. 130-135.  aWe aim to determine how increasing the specificity of binge eating criteria affects the prevalence of self-reported binge eating among presurgical bariatric patients.197 women ages 20 to 65 being assessed for bariatric surgery with a BMI greater than 30kg/m² were interviewed and completed the Eating and Exercise Examination.The prevalence of self-reported binge eating was 55% (n=109).

Moreover, men who ate until they were 80% full consumed fewer servings of grain dishes (always: 3.7 [0.9] servings; rarely/never: 5.1 [1.9] servings; p<0.05) and more servings of vegetable dishes (always: 5.9 [2.2] servings; rarely/never: 4.0 [2.3] servings, p<0.05) than those who did not.Men who ate until they were 80% full consumed less energy and more vegetable dishes than those who did not, suggesting that eating until one is 80% full is associated with healthy dietary habits among men.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aanalysis of variance 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3afoods 3amen 3aquestionnaires 3avegetables 3aJapan 0aOECD 0aBMI 0aEER 0aPAL 0aBMR 0aEI 0aEating habit 0aEnergy intake 0aServings of dishes 0aDiet 0aJapanese1 aAkamatsu, Rie1 aShimpo, Misa0 tEating behaviors.g2015 Apr., v. 17 p.153-156dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012300169300001300292520172600305592002802031650001602059650000902075650001402084650001302098650001402111650001802125650002402143650001002167650001002177650001702187650003202204650001102236650002502247650001002272653000902282653000902291653001102300653000902311653001902320700002402339700002802363700001902391773009302410856008502503852000902588655001202597IND60604164920221119175237.0180905e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060416492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawka, Keri Jo10aAssociations between aspects of friendship networks and dietary behavior in youth: Findings from a systematized review  ap. 7-15.  aTo gather and synthesize current evidence on the associations between aspects of friendship networks (e.g., friends' dietary behavior, popularity) and an individual's dietary behavior among children and adolescents.A systematic search of six scientific online databases was conducted in August 2013. Eligible studies included child or adolescent participants (aged 6 to 18years), a measure of each participant's friendship network, and a measure of habitual dietary behavior for both the participant and the participant's nominated friend(s). Data on study design, participant characteristics, friendship networks, dietary behavior, and study outcomes were abstracted.From a total of 9041 articles retrieved, seven studies were included in this review. Overall, friends' unhealthy food consumption was associated with an individual's unhealthy food consumption, and this association appeared to be stronger for boys compared with girls. More popular adolescents also tended to consume more unhealthy foods. Best friends' total energy intake was correlated with an individual's total energy intake. Similarities among friends' healthy food consumption, as well as daily breakfast consumption, were inconclusive. Longitudinal evidence showed that an individual's unhealthy food consumption tended to become similar to friends' unhealthy food consumption over time.Social network analysis in the adolescent dietary behavior literature is beginning to emerge. Results highlight friends' particular influence on unhealthy food consumption among adolescents. Focus on modeling healthy dietary behaviors among adolescent friendship group may help reduce unhealthy dietary behaviors and promote healthy weight status among youth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aboys 3abreakfast 3achildren 3adatabases 3aenergy intake 3aexperimental design 3afoods 3agirls 3ahealthy diet 3ainterpersonal relationships 3amodels 3anutritional behavior 3ayouth 0aDiet 0aFood 0aFriend 0aPeer 0aSocial network1 aMcCormack, Gavin R.1 aNettel-Aguirre, Alberto1 aSwanson, Kenda0 tEating behaviors.g2015 Aug., v. 18 p.7-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014800173300001400321520088600335592002801221650001601249650002101265650001301286650001001299653002101309653001501330653001501345653001401360653001601374700002301390700002101413700002001434773009401454856008501548852000901633655001201642IND60604165020221119172353.0180905e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060416502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombardo, Caterina10aPersistence of poor sleep predicts the severity of the clinical condition after 6months of standard treatment in patients with eating disorders  ap. 16-19.  aClinical evidence suggests that eating disorder (ED) patients experience poor sleep even if they rarely complain of it. However, direct empirical evidence supporting this relationship is still sparse. In order to provide direct evidence, poor sleep, severity of the ED symptoms and depression were obtained in 562 ED patients at treatment admission (T0). For 271 patients out of them, data were also available after 6months of standard treatment (T1). Results evidence that at T0 poor sleep predicts severity of ED symptoms through the mediation of depression. Persistence of poor sleep at T1 directly predicts the severity of the ED symptoms both directly and through the mediation of depression. These findings suggest that the treatment of ED may benefit from addressing poor sleep since its presence and persistence increase comorbidity and attrition to the standard treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomorbidity 3aeating disorders 3apatients 3asleep 0aEating disorders 0aPoor sleep 0aDepression 0aMediation 0aComorbidity1 aBattagliese, Gemma1 aVenezia, Carmela1 aSalvemini, Vito0 tEating behaviors.g2015 Aug., v. 18 p.16-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245017000156300002000326520162900346592002801975650002202003650001902025650001102044650001902055650002002074650002302094650001502117650001302132650001602145650001202161650001902173650001802192650001502210650001102225650001402236650001102250650001402261700001602275700001602291700001502307700002002322700001302342700001202355700001802367773014402385856007402529852000902603655001202612IND60661201520221122100626.0190828e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066120152DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta06923b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aUV-vis-IR irradiation driven CO₂ reduction with high light-to-fuel efficiency on a unique nanocomposite of Ni nanoparticles loaded on Ni doped Al₂O₃ nanosheets  ap. 19800-19810.  aA unique nanocomposite of Ni nanoparticles loaded on Ni doped Al₂O₃ nanosheets (Ni/Ni-Al₂O₃) was prepared with a facile approach. Ni/Ni-Al₂O₃ possesses very high photothermocatalytic activity for CO₂ reduction with CH₄ (CRM) under focused UV-vis-IR irradiation. Its production rates of H₂ and CO (rH₂ and rCO) are 27.02 and 28.71 mmol g⁻¹ min⁻¹, respectively. A very high light-to-fuel efficiency (η) of 19.9% is achieved. Even under focused vis-IR irradiation of λ > 690 nm, it still possesses photothermocatalytic performance, evidenced by its high rH₂ and rCO values (14.64 and 17.24 mmol g⁻¹ min⁻¹) and a high η value of 16.4%. Ni/Ni–Al₂O₃ possesses excellent photothermocatalytic durability which is much superior to its counterpart of Ni nanoparticles loaded on Al₂O₃ nanosheets (Ni/Al₂O₃). This is ascribed to the synergetic effect between Ni nanoparticles and Ni doped Al₂O₃ in Ni/Ni-Al₂O₃ in which oxygen in Ni doped Al₂O₃ participates in the oxidation of the formed carbon species, thus inhibiting carbon deposition on Ni nanoparticles. The high photothermocatalytic activity of Ni/Ni-Al₂O₃ originates from effective light-driven thermocatalytic CRM. A new type of photoactivation is discovered to substantially reduce the activation energy for CRM on Ni/Ni-Al₂O₃, thus considerably enhancing the light-driven thermocatalytic activity. Moreover, the new photoactivation also substantially inhibits the CO disproportionation side reaction, thus promoting the photothermocatalytic durability due to carbon deposition being substantially reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3ahydrogen 3airradiation 3amethane 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asynergism1 aLi, Yuanzhi1 aWu, Shaowen1 aWu, Jichun1 aJiang, Zhongkai1 aYang, Yi1 aRen, Lu1 aZhao, Xiujian0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 7, no. 34 p.19800-19810dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta06923b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245017300158300001800331520135400349592002801703650001301731650002301744650001101767650002101778650001401799650001301813650001501826650001301841650001201854700002001866700002401886700002501910700002801935700002101963700002101984773012402005856007502129852000902204655001202213IND60536284820170606000000.0160806e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628482DNAL7 a10.1021/es506249z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiorio, Chiara10aLocal and Regional Components of Aerosol in a Heavily Trafficked Street Canyon in Central London Derived from PMF and Cluster Analysis of Single-Particle ATOFMS Spectra  ap. 3330-3340.  aPositive matrix factorization (PMF) has been applied to single particle ATOFMS spectra collected on a six lane heavily trafficked road in central London (Marylebone Road), which well represents an urban street canyon. PMF analysis successfully extracted 11 factors from mass spectra of about 700 000 particles as a complement to information on particle types (from K-means cluster analysis). The factors were associated with specific sources and represent the contribution of different traffic related components (i.e., lubricating oils, fresh elemental carbon, organonitrogen and aromatic compounds), secondary aerosol locally produced (i.e., nitrate, oxidized organic aerosol and oxidized organonitrogen compounds), urban background together with regional transport (aged elemental carbon and ammonium) and fresh sea spray. An important result from this study is the evidence that rapid chemical processes occur in the street canyon with production of secondary particles from road traffic emissions. These locally generated particles, together with aging processes, dramatically affected aerosol composition producing internally mixed particles. These processes may become important with stagnant air conditions and in countries where gasoline vehicles are predominant and need to be considered when quantifying the impact of traffic emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon 3acluster analysis 3aemissions 3agasoline 3alubricants 3anitrates 3atraffic1 aTapparo, Andrea1 aDall’Osto, Manuel1 aBeddows, David C.

Nevertheless, their low electrical conductivity impeded their potential usage in supercapacitors. Herein, a two-dimensional conductive covalent organic framework (Ni-COF) with a square-planar Ni(ii) coordination geometry is developed. The electrical conductivity of Ni-COF powder and thin film is 1.3 × 10⁻² and 1.2 S cm⁻¹, respectively. The highly conjugated skeleton, ordered porous structure and numerous redox centres contribute to a high specific capacitance of 1257 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹ with 94% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles. Meanwhile, the asymmetric supercapacitor (activated carbon//Ni-COF) shows a high capacitance of 417 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹, and an outstanding energy density of 130 W h kg⁻¹ at a power density of 839 W kg⁻¹, outperforming previously reported COF electrode materials and even comparable to metal–organic framework systems. Thus, this study opens a new way to construct highly conductive structure-controllable COF electrode materials for supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acapacitance 3acoordination polymers 3acrystal structure 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3afilms (materials) 3ageometry 3amoieties 3anickel 3asemiconductors1 aZhang, Wen-Da1 aLiu, Yong1 aLi, Yunxing1 aCheng, Caikun1 aZhu, Haiyan1 aYan, Xiaodong1 aLi, Zaijun1 aGu, Zhi-Guo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 7, no. 34 p.19676-19681dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta07194f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01790naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009400169300001400263520073400277592002801011650002101039650001701060650001801077650001101095650001301106650000901119650001201128653001601140653002101156653002001177700002301197700002001220773009401240856008501334852000901419655001201428IND60604165920221119172233.0180905e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060416592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuran, Şenol,10aProlonged anorexia nervosa associated with female-to-male gender dysphoria: A case report  ap. 54-56.  aTranssexual (TS) individuals seem to display an increased risk in having eating disorders.

Herein we propose a new strategy of triply-hybridized supercapacitive energy storage device composed of hybrid battery–supercapacitor negative electrode [Mo₆S₈ (Chevrel-phase)/Ti₃C₂ (MXene)] coupled with positive nanoporous carbon electrode, integrated with novel yet unexplored saturated (14 M) aqueous solution of LiCl. The electrochemical stability window of this electrolyte solution (2.70 V) significantly exceeds the cell voltage (2.05 V) relevant for the asymmetrical (hybrid anode vs. carbon cathode) cells. The aqueous 14 M LiCl solution has far superior characteristics to that of the previously studies 21 m LiTFSI aqueous solution. The paper is also focused on a deep electroanalytical analysis of a peculiar redox/capacitive heterogeneity of hybrid electrodes. It establishes a variety of additivity rules for both differential and integral equilibrium and kinetic characteristics of the charging processes in hybrid electrodes, solving the puzzle of potential distribution of specific electrochemical energy stored the hybrid electrodes. A careful 3-level hybridization design of asymmetric supercapacitive storage devices enabled the integration of battery and supercapacitor materials to get free-standing binderless electrodes suitable for high power/high energy density systems. Studying thoroughly the properties of highly concentrated solutions such as aqueous 14 M LiCl, which are very suitable for different types of supercapacitive devices, combined with profound analyses of the properties of hybrid electrodes, will pave the way for a rational design of very effective devices for energy storage and conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aaqueous solutions 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3acathodes 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3alithium chloride 3ananopores 3asulfides1 aShpigel, Netanel1 aLevi, Mikhael D.1 aMathis, Tyler S.1 aMor, Albert1 aGogotsi, Yury1 aOrbakh, Doron,0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 7, no. 34 p.19761-19773dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta08066j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245009600160300001800256520104200274592002801316650001801344650003001362650001201392650001601404650001501420650001701435651001701452700001701469700002101486700002201507700002201529773012401551856008101675852000901756655001201765IND60536285820221117222937.0160806e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b001322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Mary10aEffective Permeabilities of Abandoned Oil and Gas Wells: Analysis of Data from Pennsylvania  ap. 4757-4764.  aAbandoned oil and gas (AOG) wells can provide pathways for subsurface fluid migration, which can lead to groundwater contamination and gas emissions to the atmosphere. Little is known about the millions of AOG wells in the U.S. and abroad. Recently, we acquired data on methane emissions from 42 plugged and unplugged AOG wells in five different counties across western Pennsylvania. We used historical documents to estimate well depths and used these depths with the emissions data to estimate the wells’ effective permeabilities, which capture the combined effects of all leakage pathways within and around the wellbores. We find effective permeabilities to range from 10–⁶ to 10² millidarcies, which are within the range of previous estimates. The effective permeability data presented here provide perspective on older AOG wells and are valuable when considering the leakage potential of AOG wells in a wide range of applications, including geologic storage of carbon dioxide, natural gas storage, and oil and gas development.  aPublisher supplied data 3agas emissions 3agroundwater contamination 3amethane 3anatural gas 3aoil fields 3apermeability 3aPennsylvania1 aBaik, Ejeong1 aMiller, Alana R.1 aBandilla, Karl W.1 aCelia, Michael A.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Apr. 07, v. 49, no. 7 p.4757-4764dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b001323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245014300214300001400357506007600371520136400447592002801811506003701839650001601876650001601892650002101908650001801929653001601947653001601963653002201979653002202001653001602023700002002039700006002059773009402119856008502213852000902298655001202307IND60604166520221207095720.0180905e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060416652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.04.0052doi7 aPMC45048122pmcid7 a260108182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThamotharan, Sneha10aDelay discounting, but not disinhibition or inattention, partially mediates the effects of neuroticism on disordered eating in adolescents  ap. 91-96.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAdolescence represents an integral developmental period for the prevention and intervention of disordered eating. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism have been shown to respond with greater impulsivity and use of disordered eating as a coping mechanism. However, the exact mechanism through which neuroticism and impulsivity affect disordered eating remains unknown. To understand the effects of personality and impulsivity on disordered eating in adolescence, the present study aimed to investigate whether impulsivity mediated the relationship between neuroticism and disordered eating. Adolescents (N=40) between the ages of 13 and 19 (Mage=18.25years; S.D.=1.30) were queried on eating attitudes and personality, as well as completed behavioral tasks assessing impulsivity (delay discounting, disinhibition and inattention). Mediation analyses revealed that neuroticism was significantly associated with patterns of disordered eating, but delay discounting, and not disinhibition and inattention, appeared to mediate the relationship between neuroticism and disordered eating. These results should guide prospective research exploring the relations between neurotic and impulsive behavior, particularly delay discounting on disordered eating, which will assist in future treatment efforts targeting the development of maladaptive eating behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aeating disorders 3aeating habits 0aNeuroticism 0aImpulsivity 0aDelay discounting 0aDisordered eating 0aAdolescents1 aHubbard, Meagan1 aFields, Sherecce1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6618-33940 tEating behaviors.g2015 Aug., v. 18 p.91-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008003300030016002300063024002300086024001700109024003800126024002200164024001900186040001800205100002500223245010400248300001300352500001900365506007600384506017300460520168500633506003702318650002002355650001402375650001202389650001702401650002502418650001502443650001502458650002202473650001902495650001902514650001502533650002702548650001102575650001102586650001602597650001502613650002302628650001702651650002202668650001102690700002002701700001702721700002202738700003002760700001602790700002202806700001902828700001902847700002402866700002202890700000302912773008602915856011603001856008403117956008503201961000903286852000903295655001203304IND60661202720221214231442.0190829exx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066120272DNAL7 a10113/66120272hdl7 a3450002aris7 a10.1371/journal.pone.02041532doi7 aPMC61733802pmcid7 a302899102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTetreault, Hannah M.10aOverexpression of the Sorghum bicolor SbCCoAOMT alters cell wall associated hydroxycinnamoyl groups  ap. 1-25.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aSorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is a drought tolerant crop, which is being developed as a bioenergy feedstock. The monolignol biosynthesis pathway is a major focus for altering the abundance and composition of lignin. Caffeoyl coenzyme-A O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) is an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent O-methyltransferase that methylates caffeoyl-CoA to generate feruloyl-CoA, an intermediate required for the biosynthesis of both G- and S-lignin. SbCCoAOMT was overexpressed to assess the impact of increasing the amount of this enzyme on biomass composition. SbCCoAOMT overexpression increased both soluble and cell wall-bound (esterified) ferulic and sinapic acids, however lignin concentration and its composition (S/G ratio) remained unaffected. This increased deposition of hydroxycinnamic acids in these lines led to an increase in total energy content of the stover. In stalk and leaf midribs, the increased histochemical staining and autofluorescence in the cell walls of the SbCCoAOMT overexpression lines also indicate increased phenolic deposition within cell walls, which is consistent with the chemical analyses of soluble and wall-bound hydroxycinnamic acids. The growth and development of overexpression lines were similar to wild-type plants. Likewise, RNA-seq and metabolite profiling showed that global gene expression and metabolite levels in overexpression lines were also relatively similar to wild-type plants. Our results demonstrate that SbCCoAOMT overexpression significantly altered cell wall composition through increases in cell wall associated hydroxycinnamic acids without altering lignin concentration or affecting plant growth and development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSorghum bicolor 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3acoenzyme A 3adrought tolerance 3aenergy content 3aesterification 3afeedstocks 3agrowth and development 3aleaves 3alignin 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3amethyltransferases 3aplant growth 3asequence analysis 3astover1 aScully, Erin D.1 aGries, Tammy1 aPalmer, Nathan A.1 aFunnell-Harris, Deanna L.1 aBaird, Lisa1 aSeravalli, Javier1 aDien, Bruce S.1 aSarath, Gautam1 aClemente, Thomas E.1 aSattler, Scott E.1 0 tPloS one.g2018 Oct. 5, v. 13, no. 10 p.1-25wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.10.1371/journal.pone.02041533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.02041533Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/345000.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024003600127040001800163100001700181245011200198300001800310520163400328592002801962596008301990650002302073650001302096650001302109650001102122650001102133650000902144650001802153650001502171650000902186650001102195650002002206650003702226700001802263700001802281700002102299700001902320700002002339700001302359773012402372856008002496852000902576655001202585IND60536286120221117222845.0160806e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b003702doi7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b003702chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Huiyuan10aAnalysis of Silver Nanoparticles in Antimicrobial Products Using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)  ap. 4317-4324.  aSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most commonly used nanoparticles in consumer products. Concerns over human exposure to and risk from these particles have resulted in increased interest in novel strategies to detect AgNPs. This study investigated the feasibility of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a method for the detection and quantification of AgNPs in antimicrobial products. By using ferbam (ferric dimethyl-dithiocarbamate) as an indicator molecule that binds strongly onto the nanoparticles, AgNPs detection and discrimination were achieved based on the signature SERS response of AgNPs-ferbam complexes. SERS response with ferbam was distinct for silver ions, silver chloride, silver bulk particles, and AgNPs. Two types of AgNPs with different coatings, citrate and polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP), both showed strong interactions with ferbam and induced strong SERS signals. SERS was effectively applicable for detecting Ag particles ranging from 20 to 200 nm, with the highest signal intensity in the 60–100 nm range. A linear relationship (R² = 0.9804) between Raman intensity and citrate-AgNPs concentrations (60 nm; 0–20 mg/L) indicates the potential for particle quantification. We also evaluated SERS detection of AgNPs in four commercially available antimicrobial products. Combined with ICP-MS and TEM data, the results indicated that the SERS response is primarily dependent on size, but also affected by AgNPs concentration. The findings demonstrate that SERS is a promising analytical platform for studying environmentally relevant levels of AgNPs in consumer products and related matrices.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acitrates 3acoatings 3aferbam 3ahumans 3aions 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3arisk 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Zhiyun1 aXing, Baoshan1 aMukherjee, Arnab1 aMusante, Craig1 aWhite, Jason

Previous research has identified that one such barrier is low eating self-efficacy or poor confidence in one's ability to control eating behavior in the presence of challenging situations. Accordingly, a valid, brief measure of eating self-efficacy for longitudinal assessment of weight loss and regain is needed. The purpose of this study was to test the internal consistency and clinical validity of the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire-Short Form (WEL-SF). Participants were 1740 consecutive obese patients who presented for a psychological evaluation in consideration for bariatric surgery. Median BMI was 44.9 (range: 35.0–111.9), age 48.7years (range: 18.9–77.3years), and patients were predominantly female (71.1%) and Caucasian (90.8%). The median WEL-SF total score was 56 (range: 0–80) and Cronbach's alpha measuring internal consistency was 0.92 with a one-factor structure. In terms of clinical validation, lower WEL-SF total scores were significantly associated with higher rates of binge eating episodes (P<0.0001), food addiction severity and dependence (P<0.0001), night eating syndrome (P<0.0001), depression (P<0.0001), and anxiety (P<0.0001). In contrast, higher WEL-SF total scores were associated with higher weight management self-efficacy (P<0.0001) and motivation to make positive lifestyle changes (P<0.0001).

However, it is believed that other scientists, including Priestley, may have observed their existence before this date. They are solid crystalline inclusion compounds consisting of polyhedral water cavities which enclathrate small gas molecules. Natural gas hydrates are important industrially because the occurrence of these solids in subsea gas pipelines presents high economic loss and ecological risks, as well as potential safety hazards to exploration and transmission personnel. On the other hand, they also have technological importance in separation processes, fuel transportation and storage. They are also a potential fuel resource because natural deposits of predominantly methane hydrate are found in permafrost and continental margins. To progress with understanding and tackling some of the technological challenges relating to natural gas hydrate formation, inhibition and decomposition one needs to develop a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes. This fundamental understanding is also important to the broader field of inclusion chemistry. The present article focuses on the application of a range of physico-chemical techniques and approaches for gaining a fundamental understanding of natural gas hydrate formation, decomposition and inhibition. This article is complementary to other reviews in this field, which have focused more on the applied, engineering and technological aspects of clathrate hydrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aengineering 3afinancial economics 3agas hydrate 3ahuman resources 3amethane 3apermafrost 3apipelines 3arisk 3atransportation0 tChemical Society reviews.g2002 May 7, v. 31, no. 3 p.157-167dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b008672j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016700172300001600339520166500355592002802020650001102048650001302059650002102072650002602093650001202119650002002131650001202151650001202163650001602175650001102191650001902202653002102221653002002242653002602262653002002288653002602308653001702334700001902351700002702370700001902397700002302416700001902439700002002458700002002478700002302498700002202521773009602543856008502639852000902724655001202733IND60604168020221119173553.0180905e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060416802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElran-Barak, Roni10aDietary Restriction Behaviors and Binge Eating in Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorder: Trans-diagnostic Examination of the Restraint Model  ap. 192-196.  aTo compare dietary restriction behaviors among adults with eating disorders involving binge eating, including anorexia nervosa-binge/purge subtype (AN-BE/P), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), and to examine whether dietary restriction behaviors impact binge eating frequency across diagnoses.Participants included 845 treatment seeking adults (M=30.42+10.76years) who met criteria for DSM-5 AN-BE/P (7.3%;n=62), BN (59.7%;n=504), and BED (33.0%;n=279). All participants self-reported their past and current eating disorder symptoms on the Eating Disorder Questionnaire.Adults with AN-BE/P and BN reported significantly more dietary restriction behaviors (e.g. eating fewer meals per day, higher frequency of fasting, consuming small and low calorie meals) in comparison to adults with BED. Adults with AN-BE/P and BN who reported restricting food intake via eating fewer meals per day had more frequent binge eating episodes. However, adults with BN who reported restricting food intake via eating small meals and low calorie meals had less frequent binge eating episodes.This study provides mixed support for the restraint model by suggesting that not all dietary restriction behaviors are associated with higher levels of binge eating. It may be that adults with BN who report a higher frequency of eating small and low calorie meals display more control over their eating in general, and therefore also have lower frequency of binge eating. Clinicians should assess for dietary restriction behaviors at the start of treatment prior to assuming that all forms of strict dieting and weight control behaviors similarly impact binge eating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanorexia 3aanorexia nervosa 3abinge eating disorder 3abinging 3abulimia nervosa 3adieting 3afasting 3afood intake 3amodels 3aweight control 0aAnorexia Nervosa 0aBulimia Nervosa 0aBinge Eating Disorder 0aRestraint Model 0aRestriction Behaviors 0aBinge Eating1 aSztainer, Maya1 aGoldschmidt, Andrea B.1 aCrow, Scott J.1 aPeterson, Carol B.1 aHill, Laura L.1 aCrosby, Ross D.1 aPowers, Pauline1 aMitchell, James E.1 aLe Grange, Daniel0 tEating behaviors.g2015 Aug., v. 18 p.192-196dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012800162300001800290520153700308592002801845650001901873650001301892650001301905650001401918650001201932650001401944650001301958650001101971650001301982650001001995650001602005650003002021650000902051650001402060650003002074650001502104650000902119650001102128651001002139700002202149700002202171700002302193773012402216856007502340852000902415655001202424IND60536287420221117222851.0160806e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628742DNAL7 a10.1021/es504707x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsborne, Thomas
H.10aIsolation of an Arsenate-Respiring Bacterium from a Redox Front in an Arsenic-Polluted Aquifer in West Bengal, Bengal Basin  ap. 4193-4199.  aNatural pollution of groundwater by arsenic adversely affects the health of tens of millions of people worldwide, with the deltaic aquifers of SE Asia being particularly polluted. The pollution is caused primarily by, or as a side reaction of, the microbial reduction of sedimentary Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides, but the organism(s) responsible for As release have not been isolated. Here we report the first isolation of a dissimilatory arsenate reducer from sediments of the Bengal Basin in West Bengal. The bacterium, here designated WB3, respires soluble arsenate and couples its reduction to the oxidation of acetate; WB3 is therefore implicated in the process of arsenic pollution of groundwater, which is largely by arsenite. The bacterium WB3 is also capable of reducing dissolved Fe(III) citrate, solid Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide, and elemental sulfur, using acetate as the electron donor. It is a member of the Desulfuromonas genus and possesses a dissimilatory arsenate reductase that was identified using degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers. The sediment from which WB3 was isolated was brown, Pleistocene sand at a depth of 35.2 m below ground level (mbgl). This level was some 3 cm below the boundary between the brown sands and overlying reduced, gray, Holocene aquifer sands. The color boundary is interpreted to be a reduction front that releases As for resorption downflow, yielding a high load of labile As sorbed to the sediment at a depth of 35.8 mbgl and concentrations of As in groundwater that reach >1000 μg/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfuromonas 3aacetates 3aaquifers 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abacteria 3abasins 3acitrates 3acolor 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3airon 3aoxidation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aresorption 3asand 3asulfur 3aIndia1 aMcArthur, John M.1 aSikdar, Pradip K.1 aSantini, Joanne M.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Apr. 07, v. 49, no. 7 p.4193-4199dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes504707x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01426naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245005700159300001600216520048600232592002800718650001300746650001300759650001000772650001400782650001700796650001400813650002200827650002600849650001200875773013200887856007201019852000901091655001201100IND60661204620221120112744.0190829e20020318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066120462DNAL7 a10.1039/b101905h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWainwright, Mark14aThe emerging chemistry of blood product disinfection  ap. 128-136.  aGiven the importance and limitations of the blood supply worldwide, widely applicable procedures for the inactivation of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa etc.) in donated blood and blood products are now required.

The first enantioselective version of the reaction using a chiral base was reported in 1980. Since then, the reaction has received a lot of attention mostly due to the great usefulness of chiral allylic alcohols in organic synthesis. Major breakthroughs in the area were the first report on using a sub-stoichiometric amount of chiral base, and the development of chiral bases for a true catalytic reaction protocol.

To address this, a randomized, controlled research study of a behavioral weight management program for individuals with severe mental illness was undertaken to assess its efficacy. Patients unable to meet weight loss goals during the first portion of the year-long study were given the option of using meal replacement shakes in an effort to assist with weight loss. Specific requirements for use of meal replacement shakes were specified in the study protocol; only five patients were able to use the shakes in accordance with the protocol and lose weight while improving metabolic parameters. Case studies of two subjects are presented, illustrating the challenges and obstacles they faced, as well as their successes. Taking responsibility for their own weight loss, remaining motivated through the end of the study, and incorporating the meal replacement shakes into a daily routine were factors found in common with these patients. Use of meal replacements shakes with this population may be effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abehavior disorders 3acase studies 3apatients 3aprotocols 3aweight control programs 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 0aMeal replacements 0aObesity 0aMental illness 0aWeight management 0aDiet 0aNutrition1 aKwan, Crystal L.1 aMena, Shirley J.1 aErickson, Zachary D.1 aBaker, Matthew R.1 aChamberlin, Valery1 aNguyen, Charles1 aRosen, Jennifer A.1 aShah, Chandresh1 aAmes, Donna0 tEating behaviors.g2015 Dec., v. 19 p.61-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014000170300001400310520151200324592002801836650002001864650001601884650002101900650002301921650003401944650001401978650002101992650001502013650001602028653001002044653001502054653001402069653001802083653001002101653001602111700002502127700003402152773009402186856008502280852000902365655001202374IND60604169520221119172132.0180905e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060416952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Wendy J.10aDietary adherence and acceptability of five different diets, including vegan and vegetarian diets, for weight loss: The New DIETs study  ap. 33-38.  aThe goal of the present study was to examine dietary adherence and acceptability among participants from the New DIETs study who were randomized to one of four plant-based diets (vegan, vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian) or an omnivore diet. Primary outcomes at two- and six months included dietary adherence (24-hour dietary recalls), weight loss and changes in animal product intake (mg cholesterol) by adherence status, Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), Power of Food Scale (PFS), dietary acceptability (Food Acceptability Questionnaire), and impact of diet preference on adherence. No differences were found in dietary adherence or changes in FAQ, TFEQ, or PFS among the groups. At six months, non-adherent vegan and vegetarian participants (n=16) had a significantly greater decrease in cholesterol intake (−190.2±199.2mg) than non-adherent pesco-vegetarian/semi-vegetarian (n=15, −2.3±200.3mg, P=0.02) or omnivore participants (n=7, 17.0±36.0, P=0.04). Non-adherent vegan/vegetarian participants lost significantly more weight at six months (−6.0±6.7%) than non-adherent omnivore participants (−0.4±0.6%, P=0.04). Dietary preference had no impact on adherence at six months. Due to equal rates of adherence and acceptability among the diet groups, instructing participants to follow vegan or vegetarian diets may have a greater impact on weight loss and animal product intake than providing instruction in more moderate approaches even among non-adherent participants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal products 3acholesterol 3aflexitarian diet 3afood acceptability 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aomnivores 3aplant-based diet 3avegan diet 3aweight loss 0aVegan 0aVegetarian 0aAdherence 0aAcceptability 0aDiets 0aWeight loss1 aMcGrievy, Michael E.1 aTurner-McGrievy, Gabrielle M.0 tEating behaviors.g2015 Dec., v. 19 p.33-38dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2015.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245014500154300001800299520131300317592002801630650001501658650001401673650002301687650001401710650002201724650002201746650001201768650001101780650003401791650001301825650002701838650002801865650001701893700001901910700001601929700001801945700001701963700001501980700001601995700001402011700001602025700001302041773012402054856007502178852000902253655001202262IND60536288720221117223034.0160806e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628872DNAL7 a10.1021/es505232f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yang10aBall Milling Synthesized MnOx as Highly Active Catalyst for Gaseous POPs Removal: Significance of Mechanochemically Induced Oxygen Vacancies  ap. 4473-4480.  aA rapid (1.5 h) one-step ball milling (BM) method was developed not only to modify commercial MnO₂ via top-down approaches (BM0), but also to bottom-up synthesize MnOₓ by cogrinding of KMnO₄ and MnC₄H₆O₄ (BM1) or KMnO₄ and MnSO₄ (BM2). Catalysts activity on gaseous POPs removal was tested using hexachlorobenzene (HCBz) as surrogate. Catalytic performance decreases in the order of BM2 ≈ BM1 (T₉₀% = 180–200 °C) > BM0 (260 °C) > CMO ≈ cryptomelane MnO₂ (>300 °C). Both adsorption and destruction contribute to HCBz removal at 180 °C while destruction prevails at 200–300 °C. Mechanism studies show that destruction activity is lineally correlated with the amount of surface reactive oxygen species (Oₐdₛ); stability is determined by the removal of surface chloride, which is associated with the mobility of bulk lattice oxygen (Oₗₐₜ); adsorption capacities are linearly correlated with surface area and pore structure. With the aid of extensive characterizations the excellent performance of BM prepared samples can be explained as (1) abundant surface vacancies enhance the generation of Oₐdₛ; (2) massive bulk vacancies promote the mobility of bulk Oₗₐₜ; (3) large surface area and uniform pore size distribution facilitate the physisorption of HCBz.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achlorides 3ahexachlorobenzene 3amanganese dioxide 3amilling 3aoxygen 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aporosity 3apotassium permanganate 3areactive oxygen species 3asurface area1 aZhang, Shuzhen1 aWang, Siwen1 aZhang, Kunlun1 aWang, Haizhu1 aHuang, Jun1 aDeng, Shubo1 aWang, Bin1 aWang, Yujue1 aYu, Gang0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Apr. 07, v. 49, no. 7 p.4473-4480dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505232f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011200156300001800268520190200286592002802188650001702216650000802233650001102241650001302252650002602265650002102291650001902312650002402331650001702355650001002372650001902382650001102401650001802412650003302430650001102463650002502474700001302499700001402512700001602526700001802542700001402560700002502574700001502599700001802614773012402632856007502756852000902831655001202840IND60536289020221117222949.0160806e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053628902DNAL7 a10.1021/es50530452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Yuanyuan10aResponses of Microbial Communities to Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes in Phenol Wastewater Treatment Systems  ap. 4627-4635.  aThe expanding use of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) raises environmental concerns. Wastewater treatment systems are potential recipients of SWCNTs containing influent, yet the impacts of SWCNTs on these systems are poorly documented. In this study, the microbial responses to SWCNTs in simulated phenol wastewater treatment systems were investigated. The phenol removal rates were improved in all SWCNTs-treated sequencing batch reactors during the first 20 days, but when facing higher phenol concentration (1000 mg/L) after 60 days, reactors with the highest concentration (3.5 g/L) of SWCNTs exhibited a notably decreased phenol removal capacity. Cell viability tests, scanning electron microscopy analysis and DNA leakage data suggested that SWCNTs protected microbes from inactivation, possibly by producing more bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which could create a protective barrier for the microbes. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed that the bacterial diversity did not change significantly except for a minor reduction after the immediate addition of SWCNTs. Bacterial community structure significantly shifted after SWCNTs addition and did not recover afterward. Zoogloea increased significantly upon SWCNTs shocking. At the final stage, Rudaea and Mobilicoccus increased, while Burkholderia, Singulisphaera, Labrys and Mucilaginibacter decreased notably. The shifts of these dominant genera may be associated with altered sludge settling, aromatic degradation and EPS production. This study suggested that SWCNTs exerted protective rather than cytotoxic effects on sludge microbes of phenol wastewater treatment systems and they affected the bacterial community structure and diversity at test concentrations. These findings provide new insights into our understanding of the potential effects of SWCNTs on wastewater treatment processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia 3aDNA 3aLabrys 3aZoogloea 3abacterial communities 3acarbon nanotubes 3acell viability 3acommunity structure 3acytotoxicity 3agenes 3amicroorganisms 3aphenol 3aribosomal RNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asludge 3awastewater treatment1 aMa, Qiao1 aDeng, Jie1 aShen, Wenli1 aZhang, Xuwang1 aHe, Zhili1 aNostrand, Joy D.

To explore the recycling potential of these metals, it is important to understand their distribution in the vehicles as well as their fate at the vehicles’ end-of-life. However, this information remains very scattered and sparse. In this paper, we present a study investigating the distribution of 31 SMs in selected electrical and electronic (EE) components of conventional passenger vehicles and in the end-of-life vehicle shredder fractions from a shredder plant in Switzerland. The results of the chemical analyses show that the mass fractions of Co, Sn, Sr, Ta, Y, and Zr were dominant with >20 000 g/t in the selected EE components and Ag, Ga, Mo, Sb, Sn, Sr, and Zr with >50 g/t in the analyzed shredder fractions. The largest masses of 17 SMs were found in the shredder light fraction, which is incinerated in municipal waste treatment plants mainly in Switzerland; thus, these SMs are currently not recovered. The SM mass fractions in both the EE components and the shredder fractions were projected to their total masses in 100 hypothetical midrange passenger vehicles. The resulting mass balance showed a mismatch of >50% for 23 metals, which indicates other important SM sources such as alloys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aantimony 3achemical analysis 3acobalt 3amolybdenum 3aphysicochemical properties 3arecycling 3asilver 3astrontium 3atin 3awaste treatment 3azirconium 3aSwitzerland1 aDu, Xiaoyue1 aHaag, Olaf1 aRestrepo, Eliette1 aWäger, Patrick

The electronic structure of these materials can be regarded to a first approximation as a superposition of the framework, of the charge compensating ions, of solvent molecules and of guest species. Zeolite oxygen to d¹⁰-ion charge transfer transitions dominate the electronic spectra if the ions coordinate to the zeolite oxygens. Specific coordination sites can influence the energy and the intensity of these transitions remarkably. Intra guest transitions dominate in quantum dot materials, as discussed in detail for luminescent Ag₂S zeolite A. The zeolite is not needed for the photocatalytic water oxidation on Ag⁺/AgCl photo anodes with visible light. It can, however, be used to increase the active surface area substantially.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acopper 3aenergy 3agold 3aions 3aluminescence 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aquantum dots 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3asilver sulfide 3asolvents 3asurface area 3azeolites1 aLeiggener, Claudia1 aGlaus, Stephan1 aSchürch, David1 aKuge, Ken’ichi0 tChemical Society reviews.g2002 Dec. 18, v. 32, no. 1 p.29-37dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b108571a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245011000169300001800279520076600297592002801063650001401091650001401105650002201119650001301141650002201154700002301176700002701199773011901226856008101345852000901426655001201435IND60550364520221118111512.0160910e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055036452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b004112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajkumar, Subramani10aRu(II)-Catalyzed β-Carboline Directed C–H Arylation and Isolation of Its Cycloruthenated Intermediates  ap. 5532-5545.  aA Ru(II)-catalyzed C–H arylation approach has been developed utilizing β-carboline alkaloids as the directing group.

Many airfields contain large areas of anthropogenic grassland habitats, often dominated by cool season grasses. Land managed as native warm season grasses (NWSG) potentially could increase bird strike hazards on and near airports by attracting hazardous birds and harboring small mammals that are prey for hazardous raptors. We investigated bird and small mammal communities at three NWSG areas and three adjacent on airfield grassland areas in western Ohio, U.S.A. to determine whether NWSG increased bird strike hazards. Species specific differences in bird abundance and density were evident between the two landcover types, presumably the result of differences in plant community characteristics. Seven species of birds were found exclusively in NWSG or airfield grasslands. Birds of species categorized as ‘moderate’ to ‘extremely high’ in regard to hazard (severity) level to aircraft accounted for only 6% and 2% of all birds observed in airfield grasslands and NWSG areas, respectively. Small mammal capture success was approximately three times higher in NWSG areas, although raptor abundance did not differ between the two landcover types. Our findings suggest that NWSG might be considered a viable land use adjacent to airfields; however, similar research at additional locations, including larger NWSG areas, should be conducted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3aairports 3abirds of prey 3acool season grasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3aland use 3aplant communities 3asmall mammals 3awarm season 3awarm season grasses 3aOhio1 aWashburn, Brian E.1 aDevault, Travis L.1 aSeamans, Thomas W.1 aSchmidt, Paige M.0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2013 July, v. 170, no. 1 p.144-157dAmerican Midland Naturalistx0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674%2F0003-0031-170.1.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012400166300001600290520135100306592002801657650002701685650002401712650002101736650002501757650001101782650000901793650001201802650001801814650001101832650001301843650001001856650000901866650001801875650001801893650001001911651001701921700002401938700002201962773011501984856008502099852000902184655001202193IND60124763320221122232514.0151029e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012476332DNAL7 a10.1674/0003-0031-170.1.1712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByman, David10aDemographic Effects of White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) Exclosures on White-footed Mice (Peromyscus leucopus)  ap. 171-183.  aIn 1994 two 0.65 ha deer exclosures were built in a second growth forest in northeastern Pennsylvania, one under an oak-maple canopy and the other under eastern hemlock. We hypothesized that populations of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) outside the exclosures were depressed because of herbaceous cover removal by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and/or by acorn competition with deer and would be higher inside the exclosures. For 10 y, the small mammal communities were censured with one 10 × 4 Sherman live-trap grid in each exclosure and one control grid of identical dimensions immediately outside each exclosure. Paired-T comparisons between the oak-maple exclosure and control grids, and the hemlock exclosure and control grids indicated that more total males were captured in the oak-maple exclosure grid than in the oak-maple control grid. Although repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that habitat (tree canopy type) produced more differences in mice numbers than did the presence of the exclosures, it also demonstrated that numbers of large females fluctuated less in the oak-maple exclosure than in the corresponding control. A repeated measures ANOVA of Jolly-Seber population estimate indicated that more mice were trapped in the combined oak-maple and hemlock exclosure grids than in the combined control grids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aPeromyscus leucopus 3aTsuga canadensis 3aanalysis of variance 3acanopy 3adeer 3afemales 3aforest growth 3afruits 3ahabitats 3amales 3amice 3asecond growth 3asmall mammals 3atrees 3aPennsylvania1 aHarding, Shannon D.1 aSpear, Francis W.0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2013 July, v. 170, no. 1 p.171-183dAmerican Midland Naturalistx0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674%2F0003-0031-170.1.1713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001500186245012600201300001800327506007600345520104400421592002801465506003701493650002101530650002801551650001901579650000901598650001201607650002201619650002301641650001901664650000901683700001901692700001901711700002501730700001301755773011901768856008101887852000901968655001201977IND60550365420221207143446.0160910e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055036542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b005032doi7 aPMC44994602pmcid7 a259423572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Zhao10aEnhancing the Photostability of Arylvinylenebipyridyl Compounds as Fluorescent Indicators for Intracellular Zinc(II) Ions  ap. 5600-5610.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArylvinylenebipyridyl (AVB) ligands are bright, zinc(II)-sensitive fluoroionophores. The applicability of AVBs as fluorescent indicators for imaging cellular zinc(II), however, is limited by low photostability, partially attributable to the photoisomerization of the vinylene functionality. Two configurationally immobilized (i.e., “locked”) AVB analogues are prepared in this work. The zinc(II)-sensitive photophysical properties and zinc(II) affinities of both AVBs and their locked analogues are characterized in organic and aqueous media. The zinc(II) sensitivity of the emission is attributed to the zinc(II)-dependent energies of the charge transfer excited states of these compounds. The configurationally locked ligands have improved photostability, while maintaining the brightness and zinc(II) sensibility of their AVB progenitors. The feasibility of the “locked” AVB analogues with improved photostability for imaging intracellular Zn(II) of eukaryotic cells using laser confocal fluorescence microscopy is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeukaryotic cells 3afluorescence microscopy 3aimage analysis 3aions 3aligands 3aorganic chemistry 3aphotoisomerization 3aphotostability 3azinc1 aYounes, Ali H.1 aAllen, John R.1 aDavidson, Michael W.1 aZhu, Lei0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2015 June 05, v. 80, no. 11 p.5600-5610dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.5b005033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01843naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245011000164300001800274520072400292592002801016650001501044650001701059650001801076650001201094650001201106650002001118650005801138650001301196650001401209700001901223700001701242700001701259773012401276856007201400852000901472655001201481IND60662320020221119185305.0190904e20090803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066232002DNAL7 a10.1039/b906215g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelch, Christopher J.10aPerformance to burn?

In recent years, improvements in both instrument and stationary phase technologies have greatly enhanced the performance of routine laboratory HPLC, leading to an excess of performance for many users. In this study we re-examine the choice of acetonitrile as the platform organic solvent for HPLC, addressing the question of whether greener solvents such as ethanol could potentially replace acetonitrile in some instances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aacetonitrile 3aboiling point 3aburning 3aethanol 3agreen chemistry 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asolvents 3aviscosity1 aBrkovic, Tanja1 aSchafer, Wes1 aGong, Xiaoyi0 tGreen chemistry.g2009 Aug. 3, v. 11, no. 8 p.1232-1238dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b906215g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01422naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245010400164300001800268520034900286592002800635650001400663650002300677650001900700650002000719650001100739650003000750650001400780650001300794700002300807700001700830700001900847773012500866856007200991852000901063655001201072IND60662320220221119185341.0190904e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066232022DNAL7 a10.1039/b906311k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFletcher, Andrew E.D.10aCatalytic dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) using amine functionalised titanocenes  ap. 1343-1348.  aNovel ring-functionalised titanocene dichloride compounds have been prepared and tested for catalytic activity for the dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) under Schwartz conditions; they represent the first examples of metal complexes that are active under these conditions without the need for toxic additives, such as pyridine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acatalytic activity 3adechlorination 3agreen chemistry 3ametals 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apyridines 3atoxicity1 aHyatt, Jonathan D.1 aOk, Kang Min1 aO'Hare, Dermot0 tGreen chemistry.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 11, no. 9 p.1343-1348dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b906311k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245011900169300001800288520070200306592002801008650002301036650000901059650001801068650001201086650001301098650001301111650001101124650002201135650002201157700002001179700002301199700002101222700001801243773011901261856008101380852000901461655001201470IND60550367020171214000000.0160910e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055036702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b006662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlimczyk, Sebastian10aStereoselective Gold(I) Domino Catalysis of Allylic Isomerization and Olefin Cyclopropanation: Mechanistic Studies  ap. 5719-5729.  aGold(I) catalysis of olefin activation is still a rare feature in the repertoire of that metal. Mechanistic studies on the gold(I)-catalyzed cyclopropanation of allyl-substituted sulfonium ylides, including kinetic analysis as well as detailed computational studies, reveal that the reaction proceeds through activation of the alkene moiety. Furthermore, a novel competitive allylic isomerization pathway that interconverts “linear” and “branched” allylic isomers is uncovered. The subtle interplay of cyclopropanation and olefin isomerization results in an intriguing domino process where two independent catalytic transformations combine with near-perfect regio- and stereoselectivities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3agold 3aisomerization 3aisomers 3akinetics 3amoieties 3aolefin 3aorganic chemistry 3astereoselectivity1 aHuang, Xueliang1 aKählig, Hanspeter1 aVeiros, Luís F.1 aMaulide, Nuno0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2015 June 05, v. 80, no. 11 p.5719-5729dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.5b006663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245009600178300001600274520148400290592002801774650002701802650001401829650001201843650000901855650003501864650003101899650002401930650002401954650001301978650001001991650001102001650001102012650001102023650002202034650001002056650001902066650001502085700001902100700002402119700002902143700001702172700002102189773011502210856008502325852000902410655001202419IND60124765920221122125136.0151029e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012476592DNAL7 a10.1674/0003-0031-171.1.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotapov, E.q(Evgeniĭ),10aWhite-Tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) Suburban Habitat Use along Disturbance Gradients  ap. 128-138.  aHabitat use was studied for 28 deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a suburban area 20 km northeast of the city of Philadelphia. Deer were tracked at high frequency by the use of GPS collars (one GPS fix every 5 min for weeks to months) providing high resolution location data. Habitat disturbance was ranked using several approaches. One metric was based on a human activity index (scale 0–10, with zero corresponding to least impacted and ten to most impacted habitat). A second metric was based on vegetation succession depression [scale 0–5, with zero indicating areas undergoing natural succession and five for areas where succession is almost impossible (paved roads, buildings)]. In addition habitat was classified by the density of occupied buildings. The resulting GIS model depicting habitat disturbance (Disturbance Index, DI) was then plotted against GPS fixes generated by individual deer. Monitored animals selected wooded habitat with shrubby underbrush, neglected land parcels, and fields with annual and bi-annual mowing regimes. They avoided high-density residential areas and very low disturbance areas, but tolerated areas with low density of buildings (fewer than 400 buildings km⁻²). Deer preferences along the suburban disturbance gradient suggested that patches of moderate disturbance with ongoing succession in areas with low building density are most important for the deer. Managing these areas could be instrumental in controlling the deer herd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3abuildings 3acollars 3adeer 3ageographic information systems 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aherds 3ahumans 3amodels 3amowing 3aresidential areas 3aroads 3asuburban areas 3avegetation1 aBedford, Allen1 aBryntesson, Fredrik1 aCooper-Landsman, Sherri,1 aNyholm, Brad1 aRobertson, David0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2014 Jan., v. 171, no. 1 p.128-138dAmerican Midland Naturalistx0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674%2F0003-0031-171.1.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245008300179300001600262520169700278592002801975650002302003650002002026650002002046650002202066650002302088650002202111650001102133650001202144650001002156650001402166650001002180700002202190700002202212773011502234856008502349852000902434655001202443IND60124766320221122053021.0151029e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012476632DNAL7 a10.1674/0003-0031-171.1.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeckscher, Christopher M.10aVeery (Catharus fuscescens) Nest Architecture and the Use of Alien Plant Parts  ap. 157-164.  aThe use and potential consequence of alien plant parts in the construction of open-cup leaf nests by Nearctic-breeding forest songbirds has not been investigated. We dissected 19 leaf nests constructed by Veeries (Catharus fuscescens) over two breeding seasons in a temperate broadleaf forest infested with alien plants. Our objectives were: (1) confirm the architectural approach used by Veeries to construct nests, (2) determine if Veeries used alien plant parts in nest construction, (3) determine if nest success was related to the use of alien material, (4) determine the use of alien plants relative to native plants, and (5) test for an association of alien plant mass with the progression of the nesting season. Our results showed that Veeries constructed three separate nest layers: (1) a platform for support, (2) an inner cup, and (3) nest lining. Veeries incorporated parts from six alien plant species in their nests representing 22% of the 27 species used. All nests contained alien plant parts but use differed among the three layers. In particular the use of stems of Alliaria petiolata and Rosa multiflora, two alien species, appeared to provide important structural support in the nest's outer layers. Although our sample size was small, we found no relationship between the use of alien plant parts and nest failure suggesting use of alien plant material does not have negative effects on productivity. We caution that sudden large-scale restoration efforts, which remove the alien forest plant species used in nest construction prior to the recovery of comparable native species, may result in the temporary reduction of materials available to birds for nest construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlliaria petiolata 3aRosa multiflora 3abreeding season 3adeciduous forests 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aleaves 3anesting 3anests 3asongbirds 3astems1 aTaylor, Syrena M.1 aSun, Catherine C.0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2014 Jan., v. 171, no. 1 p.157-164dAmerican Midland Naturalistx0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674%2F0003-0031-171.1.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01430naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245008700169300001800256520040200274592002800676650001600704650002300720650002300743650002600766650002200792650002200814650001600836700002500852700001800877773011900895856008101014852000901095655001201104IND60550367620221118111835.0160910e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055036762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b007252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCochrane, Edward

A palladium catalyst, supported on sPS–TPP, effectively catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions of aryl halides under homogeneous conditions. The polymer-supported palladium complex was recovered quantitatively by adding an equal volume of poor solvent to the polymer, and coupling products could be easily isolated by evaporating the solvents. The recovered polymer complex was reused several times without significant loss of activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuzuki reaction 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aevaporation 3agreen chemistry 3aorganic halogen compounds 3apalladium 3apolystyrenes 3asolvents1 aBertoia, Julie1 aCzerwinski, Kenneth R.1 aBae, Chulsung0 tGreen chemistry.g2009 Oct. 5, v. 11, no. 10 p.1576-1580dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b913060h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245013300152300001400285520080800299592002801107650004401135650003701179650001201216650001401228650001201242650001401254650002301268650002301291650001701314650002001331650001801351650001801369650002701387650001401414650002101428650003701449700001801486700001701504700001501521700001701536700001801553700001601571773012001587856007201707852000901779655001201788IND60662322120221119184258.0190904e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066232212DNAL7 a10.1039/b913182e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Gang10aImmobilization of Pd nanoparticles with functional ionic liquid grafted onto cross-linked polymer for solvent-free Heck reaction  ap. 65-69.  a1-Aminoethyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide ([VAIM]Br) grafted on the cross-linked polymer polydivinylbenzene (PDVB) was synthesized.

In 2010–2011 we located nesting ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata) in a large group of radio-tagged animals. To minimize search efforts, we investigated whether automated radio telemetry and the signal change method could be used to identify nesting activity before locating animals. The signal change method relies on the principle that any movement of a radio transmitter, including minor changes in orientation, can strongly affect the intensity of the transmitter's signal at a stationary receiving station. Using video recordings of free-ranging radio-tagged turtles, we confirmed that transmitter signal strength values can be analyzed to identify periods of box turtle activity. Early in the 2010 nesting season, automated telemetry observations indicated that some females engaged in nocturnal activity. Previous reports indicate that ornate box turtles often nest at night but are otherwise inactive after dark. Based upon this information and relatively little indication of nocturnal activity by males, we hypothesized that nocturnal activity corresponded to nesting. We subsequently monitored female nighttime activity in near real time, hand-tracked four night-active individuals, and found three of these turtles nesting. In 2011 we again selectively hand-tracked night-active females and located nests for 12 of 18 study animals, which approximates the expected annual reproductive rate for our population. We demonstrate that the signal change method can be used to identify nesting activity in ornate box turtles and suggest this method may be of use in other species that nest outside of their normal activity periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3afemales 3amales 3amonitoring 3anesting 3anests 3anocturnal activity 3aradio frequency identification 3aradio telemetry 3aradio transmitters 3aresearchers 3aturtles1 aRadzio, Thomas A1 aStrickland, Jeramie T1 aBritton, Ed1 aDelaney, David K.,1 aLigon, Day B0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2014 Jan., v. 171, no. 1 p.78-89dAmerican Midland Naturalistx0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674%2F0003-0031-171.1.783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01560naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245011600156300001800272520045000290592002800740650001700768650001400785650001400799650002400813650001200837650002000849650001800869650001900887650001300906700002000919700002600939700002700965773012500992856007201117852000901189655001201198IND60662322220221119184202.0190904e20091103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066232222DNAL7 a10.1039/b913252j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Brian10aGreen photochemistry: photo-Friedel–Crafts acylations of 1,4-naphthoquinone in room temperature ionic liquids  ap. 1867-1870.  aThe photo-Friedel–Crafts acylation of 1,4-naphthoquinone with various aldehydes was investigated in a series of room temperature ionic liquids.

Given the well-studied influence of habitat structure on spider abundance and guild composition, we examined the effects of this invasive shrub on spiders in forests of southwestern Ohio. Because spiders are sensitive to shrub architecture, we predicted that increased vegetative cover caused by invasion of L. maackii would increase diversity and abundance of spider taxa and guilds. We used paired plots (e.g., honeysuckle present and honeysuckle-absent) in ten deciduous forest locations to sample spiders and measured vertical cover of woody vegetation in the shrub layer. Abundance of spiders overall, spider families (Anyphaenidae, Araneidae, Salticidae, Theridiidae) and spider guilds (foliage runners, orb weavers, space web builders, stalkers), was higher in honeysuckle-present than in honeysuckle-absent plots, but diversity was not affected. Ordination of spider taxa and guilds significantly distinguished honeysuckle-present from honeysuckle-absent plots. Invasion by honeysuckle more than doubled the amount of vertical cover on honeysuckle-present plots compared to honeysuckle-absent plots. This increased vertical cover explained the significant increase in abundance of spiders and spider guilds on honeysuckle-present plots, likely because of increased complexity of vegetation. While a positive association between vegetation complexity, spider abundance, and guild structure has been documented for native habitats, our study extends this relationship to result from invasion by an exotic shrub. Because spiders are important predators in forest food webs, and their abundance is higher in areas containing honeysuckle, forests could be managed to retain some honeysuckle in the system, thereby preserving their positive effect on spider populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnyphaenidae 3aAraneidae 3aLonicera maackii 3aSalticidae 3aTheridiidae 3adeciduous forests 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3apredators 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3atrees 3aOhio1 aCameron, Guy N.1 aUetz, George W.0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2014 Feb., v. 171, no. 2 p.204-218dAmerican Midland Naturalistx0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674%2F0003-0031-171.2.2043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245022700163300001800390520091700408592002801325650001401353650002201367650002201389650002301411650001101434650001201445700001901457700002201476700001801498700002001516773011901536856008101655852000901736655001201745IND60550368520170925000000.0160910e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055036852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b007742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeyer, Marcel10aSi- and C-Functional Organosilicon Building Blocks for Synthesis Based on 4-Silacyclohexan-1-ones Containing the Silicon Protecting Groups MOP (4-Methoxyphenyl), DMOP (2,6-Dimethoxyphenyl), or TMOP (2,4,6-Trimethoxyphenyl)  ap. 5804-5811.  a4-Silacyclohexan-1-ones 1a–1c, 4-silacyclohexan-1-one oximes 2a–2c, 1,4-azasilepan-7-ones 3a–3c, 1,4-azasilepanes 4a–4c, and 2-bromo-4-silacyclohexan-1-ones 5a and 5b were prepared in multistep syntheses, starting from trimethoxypropylsilane.

A key step in guiding informed policy towards isolated wetlands is to understand their economic value. This study combines a year of intensive amphibian surveys within a wetland with the assignment of values to each of the captured species based upon their reported commercial values. The 392,605 amphibians comprising 17 species captured at this wetland in 1 y were valued at $3,605,848 (U.S. dollars). Juvenile amphibians produced in the wetland in a single year accounted for the 95% of the reported value ($3,413,821). This value far exceeds the value of other natural habitats evaluated with similar methods and exceeds by two orders of magnitude the value of this land had it been converted to agriculture. Although this study does not advocate amphibian harvest as an economic use for wetlands, it does highlight the value, diversity, and abundance of amphibians inhabiting these small, isolated, and often unprotected wetlands and provides a foundation for future research, management, mitigation, and policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3aeconomic valuation 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3ajuveniles 3areptiles 3asurveys 3awetlands1 aWillson, John D.1 aDorcas, Michael E.1 aGibbons, J.

(Oriental bittersweet) is an invasive exotic liana introduced to western North Carolina in the late 1800s that has established in forests across the southern Appalachian region. The twining habit of bittersweet is recognized to have negative impacts on tree growth by constricting trunks, overtopping canopies, and increasing the probability of wind and ice damage. Our study was designed to quantify effects of invasion by C. orbiculatus on Liriodendron tulipifera (tulip poplar) growth. We cored trees on invaded sites with both twined and untwined trees to test for above and below ground competition effects of C. orbiculatus and compared growth to nearby uninvaded sites. Contrary to our expectations, we found radial growth increased after invasion. This increase is likely a release response from a disturbance that allowed C. orbiculatus to become establised. There were many historical ice storms that occured in our region during the time of C. orbiculatus invasion that may have helped it to become established in these stands. Liriodendron tulipifera are known to respond positively after ice storm thinning and this release may mask any initial negative effects of liana competition. The short duration of our study may not have been long enough to capture the transition from the effect of canopy release due to disturbance to competition with C. orbiculatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCelastrus orbiculatus 3aLiriodendron tulipifera 3acanopy 3aforests 3aice 3aice damage 3ainvasive species 3aprobability 3astorms 3atree growth 3atrees 3awind 3aAppalachian region 3aNorth Carolina1 aFrancis, Jacob S.0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2014 July, v. 172, no. 1 p.25-36dAmerican Midland Naturalistx0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674%2F0003-0031-172.1.253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245014300159300001800302520095100320592002801271650001601299650002201315650001301337650001101350650002101361650002301382650002301405650001301428650001301441650002001454650002201474700002201496700002001518700003301538700002301571700002201594700001601616700002901632773011901661856008101780852000901861655001201870IND60550370420171220000000.0160910e20150619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055037042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b004662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xing10aHydroalumination of Ketenimines and Subsequent Reactions with Heterocumulenes: Synthesis of Unsaturated Amide Derivatives and 1,3-Diimines  ap. 6062-6075.  aThe series of differently substituted ketenimines 1 was hydroluminated using di-iso-butyl aluminum hydride.

In situ treatment of the hydroaluminated ketenimines 5 with various heterocumulenes like carbodiimides, isocycanates, isothiocyanates and ketenimines as electrophiles and subsequent hydrolytic workup resulted in novel enamine derived amide species in case of N-attack (sterically less hindered ketenimines) under formation of a new C–N-bond or in 1,3-diimines by C–C-bond-formation in case of bulky substituents at the ketenimine-nitrogen atom.

Yet, estimating wetland water sources quantitatively across more than a few study sites remains impractical for larger comparative studies due to the time-intensive measurements required. In this research we tested the efficacy of using dissolved magnesium (Mg²⁺) as a semiconservative tracer of wetland water sources in southern Lower Michigan. Because concentrations of magnesium in groundwater are high due to equilibrium with dolomite in the glacial deposits, dissolved magnesium distinguished the relative importance of groundwater vs. precipitation as wetland water sources. We examined a set of 24 wetlands to consider relationships between a wetland's water sources and its geomorphic setting, water level variation, and biogeochemistry. Fens and swamps were generally groundwater-dominated, whereas wetlands dominated by Sphagnum mosses (“bogs”) were all strongly precipitation-dominated; few wetlands exhibited relatively equitable contributions of groundwater and precipitation. In terms of geomorphic setting, precipitation-dominated acidic bogs were restricted to isolated basins that were positioned higher on the landscape. In contrast, groundwater-dominated circumneutral fens and swamps occurred in basins that spanned the range of landscape position and were associated with surface inlets and outlets. Mean and maximum water levels were lower in more groundwater-dominated wetlands associated with outflow streams. Mean nutrient (ammonium and phosphate) availability was generally higher in more groundwater-dominated wetlands, whereas all precipitation-dominated wetlands had low nutrient availability. We conclude in the southern Great Lakes region: (1) dissolved magnesium can be used to characterize wetland water sources, and (2) the relative importance of groundwater vs. precipitation is strongly linked to a wetland's geomorphic setting, water level variation, and biogeochemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3abasins 3abiogeochemistry 3abogs 3adolomite 3afens 3aglacial deposits 3agroundwater 3ahydrodynamics 3alandscape position 3alandscapes 3amagnesium 3amosses and liverworts 3anutrient availability 3astreams 3aswamps 3aGreat Lakes region 3aMichigan1 aHamilton, Stephen K.0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2014 Oct., v. 172, no. 2 p.205-218dAmerican Midland Naturalistx0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674%2F0003-0031-172.2.2053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012000171300001600291500001500307520166100322592002801983650001602011650002902027650001102056650001302067650001402080650001202094650001302106650001002119650001102129650001302140650001602153650001302169650001002182650001102192650001702203650001102220650001202231650001202243650001202255651000902267653001602276700002202292773011502314856008502429852000902514655001202523IND60124770720221120115921.0151029e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012477072DNAL7 a10.1674/0003-0031-172.2.2362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Matthew B.10aReproductive Ecology of the Endangered Utah Endemic Hesperidanthus suffrutescens with Implications for Conservation  ap. 236-251.  a2019-12-04  aWe investigated fruit set, seed set, and germination requirements of shrubby reed-mustard (Hesperidanthus suffrutescens), an endangered endemic shrub in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah, U.S.A. To determine the degree of self-compatibility, 120 plants received four pollination treatments each for 2 y. Treatments included autogamy, geitonogamy, xenogamy, and an open control. Autogamy and geitonogamy produced substantially and significantly fewer fruits, seeds, and seeds per fruit than xenogamy, suggesting little self-compatibility. Additionally, the maternal reproductive success of outcrossed flowers was significantly greater than open control flowers suggesting pollen limitation, perhaps due to reduced pollinator abundance or activity. One study population showed significantly reduced reproduction during the second year, perhaps resulting from impacts of anthropogenic disturbance. Although both selfing treatments produced significantly fewer seeds, there were no significant differences in germination among treatments. Potential pollinators were observed and collected during three sampling efforts. A total of 77 flower visitors were collected during the study. Potential pollinators providing outcrossed pollen included several Andrena species and several Lasioglossum and Halictus species. Overall, these results indicate little self-compatibility while suggesting that the pollinators needed for successful reproduction may, in fact, be limiting. This study highlights the important role of native pollinator fauna in conservation while providing managers with the basic reproductive ecology needed to conserve this endemic desert shrub.  aPublisher supplied data 3apollinators 3aanthropogenic activities 3apollen 3aHalictus 3afruit set 3aselfing 3aseed set 3afauna 3abasins 3aautogamy 3agermination 3amanagers 3aseeds 3afruits 3aLasioglossum 3ashrubs 3aecology 3aflowers 3aAndrena 3aUtah 0apollination1 aSchupp, Eugene W.0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2014 Oct., v. 172, no. 2 p.236-251dAmerican Midland Naturalistx0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674%2F0003-0031-172.2.2363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03828naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001200138245048600150300001800636520213500654592002802789650002802817650001602845650001202861650002202873650001902895650002802914650001602942650002702958650002002985650002003005650000903025650001903034650002103053650002103074650001103095650002703106650001603133700001303149700001403162773012503176856007203301852000903373655001203382IND60662325620221119184414.0190904e20091005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066232562DNAL7 a10.1039/b914787j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wei10aSubmicronic calcite particles with controlled morphology tailored by polymer skeletons via carbonation route with compressed or supercritical CO₂Eₗₑcₜᵣₒₙᵢc ₛᵤₚₚₗₑₘₑₙₜₐᵣy ᵢₙfₒᵣₘₐₜᵢₒₙ ₍ESI₎ ₐᵥₐᵢₗₐbₗₑ: TGA cᵤᵣᵥₑₛ ₒf CₐCO₃ ₚₐᵣₜᵢcₗₑₛ ₒbₜₐᵢₙₑd ᵤₙdₑᵣ dᵢffₑᵣₑₙₜ cₒₙdᵢₜᵢₒₙₛ.

In this paper, submicronic CaCO₃ particles with ellipsoidal morphology were synthesized using compressed or supercritical CO₂ with sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) as a template. By regulating some experimental parameters, including the concentration and molecular weight of NaCMC, as well as the CO₂ pressure and temperature, the morphology and size of the CaCO₃ particles could be effectively controlled. Besides, in contrast to the effective results of another additive, Polyacrylic Acid (PAA), our research suggested that the morphology of the synthesized particles was strongly related to the flexibility of the polymer chains, namely, the relatively rigid chains induce the formation of ellipsoidal particles while the more flexible chains would result in the spherical ones. In addition, amorphous calcium carbonate was traced as an intermediate phase during the crystallization process. Based on the experimental results, we discussed the formation mechanism of such particles: the polymer chains serve as the skeletons, then the ions attach along the chains to grow. The final morphology of CaCO₃ aggregates is tailored by the flexibility of the polymer chain, while the size of the particles is related with the chain length of the polymer. In comparison with the traditional mineralization methods, here we provide a highly efficient and versatile approach to integrate the fixation of CO₂ and the regulating effect of different polymer chains, to produce submicroscopic CaCO₃ particles and further control their morphology and size distribution. Such an approach is facile and of potential importance as an environmentally benign industrial route to synthesize biomaterials, and it may also serve to shed light on the study of the mechanism of biomimetic mineralization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomimetics 3acalcite 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarbonation 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acrystallization 3agreen chemistry 3aions 3amineralization 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylic acid 3asodium 3asustainable technology 3atemperature1 aYu, Qisi1 aWu, Peiyi0 tGreen chemistry.g2009 Oct. 5, v. 11, no. 10 p.1541-1549dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b914787j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245016600157300001800323520078300341592002801124650002001152650002501172650002001197650001401217650002301231650001501254650002001269650001201289650002701301650001401328650001401342650001301356700001801369700001801387773012501405856007201530852000901602655001201611IND60662325820221119184438.0190904e20091005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066232582DNAL7 a10.1039/b914844m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Mingzhong14aThe first heterogeneous carbonylative Stille coupling of organostannanes with aryl iodides catalyzed by MCM-41-supported bidentate phosphine palladium(0) complex  ap. 1687-1693.  aThe first heterogeneous carbonylative Stille coupling reaction of organostannanes with aryl iodides under an atmospheric pressure of carbon monoxide has been achieved in DMF at 80 °C in the presence of a catalytic amount of an MCM-41-supported bidentate phosphine palladium(0) complex [MCM-41-2P-Pd(0)], yielding a variety of unsymmetrical ketones in good to high yields.

The results of photostability study in nonpolar 1,4-dioxane revealed the remarkable enhancement in stability of the novel dyes compared to that of PM567 as well as improved laser performances. Cyclic voltammetry study strongly supports the observed enhancement in photostability of the novel dyes compared to that of PM567. The observed properties of the novel dyes in relation to those of PM567 have been rationalized by extensive use of DFT and TD-DFT using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method of theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adyes 3alasers 3aliquids 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3aphotostability 3asolvents1 aKamble, Priyadarshani1 aMallah, Ramnath1 aRay, A.

For this sulfonamide the European Union in Regulation 37/2010 has established a maximum residue limit in milk of 100μgkg⁻¹. The study includes the effect of six factors on the recovery of sulfathiazole. The factors are: (i) The one related to the matrix depending on the heat treatment of the milk (UHT, pasteurized); (ii) Those related to the protein precipitation step, namely the ratio between the volume of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and milk, centrifugation speed and temperature; (iii) Those affecting the derivatization reaction: derivatization time and volume of fluorescamine. To do this, two chemometric tools are used together: a D-optimal design for studying the effect of the factors on the recovery of sulfathiazole, considerably reducing the number of needed experiments; and the second-order property of the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) decomposition that avoids the need of fitting a new calibration model each time that the experimental conditions change. It has been found that the type of milk, the TCA:milk ratio and the volume of fluorescamine have significant effect on the response. The rest of factors and interactions are not significant. The best recovery is obtained with UHT milk, 4:6 rate for TCA:milk volumes and 40μL of fluorescamine. In UHT milk, the mean recovery (n=5) in the optimal conditions is 88.7% (RSD=12.4%). As some non-linear behaviour may occur when using fluorescence spectroscopy, the calibration model that relates the fluorescence spectra with the concentration is computed by a partial least squares regression and a multi-layer feed-forward neural network. In both cases, the proposed procedures have been validated according to Decision 2002/657/EC, concluding that the two are accurate although the calibration model built with the neural network has better figures of merit, the decision limit (CCα) for x₀=100μgL⁻¹ is 103.3μgL⁻¹ and the detection capability (CCβ) is 106.5μgL⁻¹, with the probabilities of false noncompliance (α) and false compliance (β) equal to 5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aUHT milk 3acentrifugation 3achemometrics 3acompliance 3aderivatization 3afactor analysis 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aheat treatment 3aleast squares 3amaximum residue limits 3amilk 3aneural networks 3asulfathiazole 3atemperature 3atrichloroacetic acid1 aOrtiz, M.

Bangladesh has approximately 8500 km² (<5 m depth) exploitable coastal area and is home to 335 different types of natural populations of seaweeds, some of which are cultivated on a limited scale due to environmental, technological and socio-economic constraints. Given the current national interest, this study reviewed the previous works as well as collected primary data visiting to seaweed farming sites, and consulting with farmers and relevant stakeholders to better understand the present status of seaweed culture, existing challenges and a possible way forward. A roadmap for seaweed-based new frontiers with necessary interventions is also suggested to promote the seaweed industry in Bangladesh. The strategies to leverage key activities include – (1) zooning of seaweed farming areas, (2) farming intensification and integration, (3) seed bank for commercially important seaweed species, (4) post-harvest management, (5) value-added products and market development, and (6) establishing seaweed-based forward linkage sub-sectors. Overall, the future of seaweed farming in Bangladesh will likely depend upon suitable site selection followed by adaption of improved culture techniques, production volume and market demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3aindustry 3amacroalgae 3amarket development 3apostharvest technology 3aseaweed culture 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3asupply balance 3avalue added 3aBangladesh 0aSeaweeds 0aSite selection 0aBay of Bengal 0aValue addition 0aMarketing channel1 aHossain, M.

Developments in the use of remote aircraft, or unmanned aerial systems (UAS), for ecological study have been rapid. Helicopter surveys have proven to be a reliable, repeatable method for broad-scale monitoring of harvested kangaroo populations in Australia’s rangelands, but the recent availability of long-range UAS may offer improvements in detectability and cost efficiency. Aims. We aimed to test the ability of a long-range UAS (Spylite, Bluebird Aero Systems Ltd, Kadima, Israel) to survey macropod populations at a landscape scale, and validate the results against those from the current best-practice helicopter surveys. Methods. Four 80-km transects in south-western Queensland were surveyed using a helicopter and UAS. Two observers, occupying the rear seats of the helicopter, recorded animals observed in distance classes perpendicular to either side of the aircraft. Continuous electro-optical (EO) or infrared (IR) video from the UAS were recorded for later processing. Animal densities were calculated using line-transect methods for both techniques. The efficiency and cost effectiveness of each survey technique were also assessed using the flight and data processing times. Key results. The encounter rate for macropods during the UAS was significantly lower compared with the helicopter survey, resulting in low estimates of macropod density (3.2 versus 53.8 animals km–² respectively). The UAS technique recorded between 2.9 and 12.7% of the macropod density observed on each transect during the helicopter survey. The helicopter surveys were less expensive and more efficient and cost effective, requiring less flight and data processing time than the UAS surveys. Conclusions. Utilising long-range UAS to detect and count groups of wild animals for landscape-scale wildlife monitoring has potential, but improvements in detection and identification technology are needed to match or exceed the accuracy of the conventional aerial survey technique for kangaroos. Implications. Recent advances in camera technology and methodological refinements are encouraging for aerial survey of wildlife using UAS. However, significant improvements are required to survey for kangaroos and new technology should again be tested against current benchmarks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacropodidae 3aaerial surveys 3acameras 3acost effectiveness 3ahelicopters 3ainformation processing 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3aprocessing time 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awild animals 3awildlife 3aQueensland 0awildlife survey 0adensity 0aunmanned aerial system (UAS)1 aFinch, Neal1 aSpeed, James1 aPople, Anthony0 tWildlife research.g2018 Nov., v. 45, no. 7 p.586-594dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957321x1448-54947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR180343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012900164520137600293592002801669650001101697650001901708650001901727650000901746650002201755650002501777650002201802650002501824650001301849650002401862650001701886650001201903650000901915650001101924650001101935653003101946653002901977653002702006653001502033653003602048700001502084700001902099700002002118700001502138700001602153700001402169773009002183856008502273852000902358655001202367IND60752517820221122060902.0211206e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075251782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1221672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Hui10aTechno-economic analysis of a solar thermochemical cycle-based direct coal liquefaction system for low-carbon oil production  aDirect coal liquefaction turns solid coal into transportable liquid fuel with a high energy conversion efficiency of nearly 60%. However, the hydrogen used in the direct coal liquefaction process mainly comes from coal gasification units, and gasification coal consumption accounts for about 30% of the total coal consumption. The authors of this article have proposed a solar thermochemical cycle-based direct coal liquefaction system and conducted a corresponding thermodynamic analysis. In this work, the economic feasibility, environmental impact, and the influence of key factors (coal price, oil price, carbon tax) for the industrial-scale low-carbon oil production system are analyzed. Compared with the traditional direct coal liquefaction system, the total coal consumption of the new system is reduced by ∼40%. Under low carbon constraints, the economics of the new system is comparable to that of the traditional one with a lower solar thermochemical hydrogen production cost (<13–16 yuan/kg H₂). With the help of the solar thermochemical hydrogen production process, CO₂ emissions of the new system can be reduced by 63%. Moreover, the solar thermochemical cycle could generate additional pure oxygen and profits. The methodology and results can provide important references for coal-to-liquid technology with high efficiency and low carbon emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acoal 3acoal gasification 3aeconomic feasibility 3aenergy conversion 3aenvironmental impact 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aliquefaction 3aliquids 3aoils 3aoxygen 3aprices 0aSolar thermochemical cycle 0aDirect coal liquefaction 0aCO2 emission reduction 0aCarbon tax 0aTechnical and economic analysis1 aWang, Jian1 aZheng, Hongfei1 aWang, Hongsheng1 aZhang, Jun1 aYu, Zhufeng1 aBo, Zheng0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122167-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1221673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006900165300001600234520083300250592002801083650002801111650001701139650002501156650002701181650001301208650002001221700002001241700001901261773010201280856004801382852000901430655001201439IND50063176420221118223651.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006317642DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954130200382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChadov, B.

Classifying forest stands in groups according to their soil fertility (i.e. in nutrient management areas) can be very helpful to this respect and it is considered to be a first step in what has been called precision forestry. For this paper, we explore the capability of multivariate analyses of topsoil data to be used as tools for evaluating and classifying soil fertility. A case study from a teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) plantation in Costa Rica was used to evaluate and illustrate how to use multivariate analysis with these aims. A topsoil (0–20 cm) database with soil test results assembled by Panamerican Woods Ltd. was used. Different multivariate techniques [Principal Component Analysis, Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), Cluster analysis] were performed and compared. Cluster analysis resulted as an appropriate tool for grouping soil samples into soil fertility classes. Therefore, it is considered as a promising tool which would help to design a fertilization program to meet the specific needs of each group of stands with relatively homogeneous soil fertility properties. NMDS is also a suitable complementary tool to graphically explore the similarities within groups and the differences between them. The application of procedures similar to those being reported may help to optimize the design of nutritional and fertilization plans across large forest plantations, by using multivariate analysis to establish fertilization regimes that are appropriate to groups of stands of more homogeneous soil fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTectona grandis 3acase studies 3acluster analysis 3adatabases 3aforest plantations 3aforest stands 3aforests 3amultivariate analysis 3anutrient management 3aplanning 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil fertility 3asoil sampling 3atopsoil 3aCosta Rica1 aAlvarado, Alfredo1 aMorales, Manuel1 aSan Miguel Ayanz, A.,1 aMarchamalo-Sacristán, Miguel0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2014 Mar., v. 98, no. 2 p.155-167dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl55283x1385-13147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-014-9603-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009900176300001600275520186400291592002802155650001602183650002602199650001702225650001602242650002202258650001602280650001302296650001002309650005002319650001702369650001102386650001902397650001402416650001102430650001502441650001402456650001902470651002002489651003102509651000902540700002102549773008802570856008602658852000902744655001202753IND60089137820221117193559.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008913782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahnenberger, Maura10aMeteorological characteristics of dust storm events in the eastern Great Basin of Utah, U.S.A.  ap. 601-612.  aWe assess the mesoscale climatology of dust storm events affecting Salt Lake City, Utah (SLC) since the 1930s, and document the ascendant controls on atmospheric dust generation and transport in the semi-arid Great Basin. Records indicate a seasonal and diurnal pattern, with dust storms typically occurring in spring months during the afternoon. Since 1930, SLC had 379 dust event days (DEDs), averaging 4.7 per year. Air quality station data from populated regions in Utah indicate that dust events produced elevated PM₁₀ exceeding NAAQS on 16 days since 1993, or 0.9 per year. Analysis of DEDs over the period 1948–2010 (n = 331) indicates that approaching mid-level troughs caused 68% of these dust outbreaks and storms. We analyzed two significant DEDs occurring on 19 April 2008 and 4 March 2009, both of which produced elevated particulate matter (PM) levels in the populated region surrounding SLC. Strengthening cyclonic systems are the primary producer of dust outbreaks and storms; the Great Basin Confluence Zone (GBCZ) in the lee of the Sierra Nevada is a known region of cyclogenesis. These cyclonic systems produce strong southwesterly winds in the eastern Great Basin of Utah - termed “hatu winds” – that exceed threshold friction velocities, entrain sediments and loft them into the atmosphere. Plumes identified in MODIS satellite imagery on case study DEDs indicate specific dust source areas, not widespread sediment mobilization. These “hotspots” include playa surfaces at Sevier Dry Lake, Tule Dry Lake, and the Great Salt Lake Desert, as well as Milford Flat, an area burned by Utah's largest wildfire in 2007. The characteristic mountain-valley topography in the Basin & Range physiographic province creates terrain channeling that enhances deflation and funnels dust-bearing winds toward SLC, a growing urban center.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acase studies 3aclimatology 3adiurnal variation 3adust storms 3afriction 3alakes 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aparticulates 3aplayas 3aremote sensing 3asediments 3aspring 3atopography 3awildfires 3awind direction 3aGreat Salt Lake 3aSierra Nevada (California) 3aUtah1 aNicoll, Kathleen0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 60 p.601-612dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013100174520213700305592002802442650002302470650002302493650002802516650002002544650001402564650000902578650001602587653002302603653002902626653001802655653002002673653002502693700003302718700006802751773011102819856008802930852000903018655001203027IND60787506220221120151926.0220914e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078750622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.1063202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillanueva, Raul10aRecovering highly exploited stocks with heterogeneous resilience capacities in mixed fisheries under uncertain illegal fishing  aThe complexity of stock recovery strategies in mixed-species fisheries involving heterogeneous resilience capacities of target and incidentally harvested species is further challenged by possible levels of illegal exploitation rates. This context adds to the uncertainty for decision-makers when establishing proper management measures to recover highly overexploited stocks towards the selected target reference point (e.g., BiMSY). With a dynamic bioeconomic model, we analyzed the stock recovery performance of a mixed fishery with two overexploited species using combinations of moratoria durations (μi) and subsequent exploitation rates (FiMSY), under possible states of nature of illegal fishing (θj). Alternative stock recovery management strategies (Dj) were considered to include the effect of possible θj. Both stocks present heterogenous abundance, renewability capacities, and relative prices. The impact of possible levels of illegal fishing on the legal resource rent and the corresponding forgone legal resource rent was also assessed. A Monte Carlo analysis was undertaken to calculate the risk of falling below BiMSY considering alternative management strategies to deal with possible illegal fishing (ρi,Dj). Overexploited species with lower resilience capacity require longer moratoria timelines, extended when dealing with alternative states of nature of illegal fishing. Management strategies based on target species achieved the highest fishery legal resource rent while having the highest risk of not recovering the stock of incidental species with lower resilience capacity. In this study, a mixed-strategy management decision where a moratorium is based on target species and subsequent exploitation rates (Fi) based on lower resilience species resulted in minimum risks of falling below species MSY at high levels of illegal fishing. This same strategy resulted in maximum NPV of resource rent per vessel for alternative levels of illegal fishing. Lack of consideration of possible levels of illegal fishing may lead to failure in achieving stock recovery to target reference points in mixed fisheries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3abioeconomic models 3acoastal zone management 3adecision making 3afisheries 3arisk 3auncertainty 0aRecovery timelines 0aHeterogeneous resilience 0aMixed fishery 0aIllegal fishing 0aMonte Carlo analysis1 aSeijo, J.

The use of camera traps as a wildlife survey tool has rapidly increased, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the technology is imperative to assess the degree to which research objectives are met. Aims. We evaluated the differences in performance among three Reconyx camera-trap models, namely, a custom-modified high-sensitivity PC850, and unmodified PC850 and HC550. Methods. We undertook a controlled field trial to compare the performance of the three models on Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory, by observing the ability of each model to detect the removal of a bait by native mammals. We compared variation in detecting the known event, trigger numbers, proportion of false triggers and the difference in detection probability of small to medium-sized mammals. Key results. The high-sensitivity PC850 model detected bait take 75% of the time, as opposed to 33.3% and 20% for the respective unmodified models. The high-sensitivity model also increased the detection probability of the smallest mammal species from 0.09 to 0.34. However, there was no significant difference in detection probability for medium-sized mammals. Conclusions. Despite the three Reconyx camera models having similar manufacturer-listed specifications, they varied substantially in their performance. The high-sensitivity model vastly improved the detection of known events and the detection probability of small mammals in northern Australia. Implications. Failure to consider variation in camera-trap performance can lead to inaccurate conclusions when multiple camera models are used. Consequently, researchers should carefully consider the parameters and capabilities of camera models in study designs. Camera models and their configurations should be reported in methods, and variation in detection probabilities among different models and configurations should be incorporated into analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3afield experimentation 3amodels 3aprobability 3asmall mammals 3asurveys 3awildlife 3aNorthern Territory 0adetection 0amonitoring 0aperformance 0aReconyx 0atechnology1 aGillespie, Graeme0 tWildlife research.g2018 Nov., v. 45, no. 7 p.578-585dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957321x1448-54947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR180783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012600164300001400290520124300304592002801547650001601575650001501591650001801606650001201624650002401636650001601660650002001676700002001696700002001716700001901736700001901755773009901774856008101873852000901954655001201963IND60085735520221120074734.0141101e20111130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008573552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonny, Sarah10aIonic liquids based microwave-assisted extraction of lichen compounds with quantitative spectrophotodensitometry analysis  ap. 69-75.  aIonic liquids based extraction method has been applied to the effective extraction of norstictic acid, a common depsidone isolated from Pertusaria pseudocorallina, a crustose lichen. Five 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) differing in composition of alkyl chain and anion were investigated for extraction efficiency. The extraction amount of norstictic acid was determined after recovery on HPTLC with a spectrophotodensitometer. The proposed approaches (IL-MAE and IL-heat extraction (IL-HE)) have been evaluated in comparison with usual solvents such as tetrahydrofuran in heat-reflux extraction and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). The results indicated that both the characteristics of the alkyl chain and anion influenced the extraction of polyphenolic compounds. The sulfate-based ILs [C₁mim][MSO₄] and [C₂mim][ESO₄] presented the best extraction efficiency of norstictic acid. The reduction of the extraction times between HE and MAE (2h–5min) and a non-negligible ratio of norstictic acid in total extract (28%) supports the suitability of the proposed method. This approach was successfully applied to obtain additional compounds from other crustose lichens (Pertusaria amara and Ochrolechia parella).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchrolechia 3aPertusaria 3aionic liquids 3alichens 3amicrowave treatment 3apolyphenols 3atetrahydrofuran1 aPaquin, Ludovic1 aCarrié, Daniel1 aBoustie, Joël1 aTomasi, Sophie0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 Nov. 30, v. 707, no. 1-2 p.69-75dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010900169300001600278520081700294592002801111650002301139650001701162650002701179650002101206650001701227650001701244650002301261700001701284700002201301773011201323856008501435852000901520655001201529IND60582469020221120070705.0180830e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058246902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shawn H.10aWater transport and mechanical response of block copolymer ion-exchange membranes for water purification  ap. 388-396.  aA membrane inflation experiment was used to measure the mechanical response of ABCBA pentablock copolymer membranes designed to transport water through the coalescence of water-swollen polyelectrolyte domains within the polymer. Creep resistance of the block copolymers originates from glassy A blocks of either poly(p-methyl styrene) or poly(t-butyl styrene), and water permeability is attributed to the polystyrene C block that is partially sulfonated. The creep resistance of the membranes in the wet state was enhanced by replacing the poly(t-butyl styrene) A blocks with poly(p-methylstyrene), or by decreasing the molecular weight of the polyelectrolyte C block. Both of these substitutions increased the creep resistance of the membranes in a wet state while retaining a high degree of water permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrolytes 3aion-exchange membranes 3amolecular weight 3apermeability 3apolystyrenes 3awater purification1 aWillis, Carl1 aShull, Kenneth R.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 544 p.388-396dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007200166300001300238520172100251592002801972650000802000650001402008650002802022650002302050650001202073650002202085650001202107650001602119650001102135650001602146650002202162650000902184650001302193650001302206650001202219650002502231650002102256650001402277650001102291650002202302650001502324650001702339650002202356650001302378700002302391773009802414856008102512852000902593655001202602IND60085735620221120074935.0141101e20111130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008573562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.08.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosman, Joanna10aPeroxidase-mimicking DNAzymes for biosensing applications: A review  ap. 7-17.  aDNAzymes are single stranded DNA molecules that exhibit catalytic activity and are exploited in medicine, biology and material sciences. Development in this area is related to the many advantages of DNAzymes over conventional protein enzymes, such as thermal stability and simpler preparation. DNAzymes with peroxidase-like activity have recently attracted great interest. To assure such catalytic activity, oligonucleotides have to adopt a G-quadruplex structure, which can bind the hemin molecule. This system facilitates a redox reaction between the target molecule and hydrogen peroxide, which results in the appearance of an oxidized target molecule (product). DNAzymes with peroxidase-mimicking activity have great potential in bioanalytical chemistry. This review presents fundamentals concerning the design and engineering of DNAzymes with peroxidase-like activity, describes their properties and spectral characteristics and shows how DNAzymes can contribute to bioanalytical research. Examples of bioanalytical applications of DNAzymes with peroxidase-like activity include nucleic acid probes with DNAzyme labels for the detection of specific DNA sequences in colorimetric or chemiluminescent assays. Assays for telomerase or methyltransferase activity, which are potential targets in anticancer therapy, are also described in this review. Other applications include the determination of metal cations such as Ag⁺, K⁺, Hg²⁺, Pb²⁺ or Cu²⁺ and amplified detection of small molecules such as adenosine, cocaine or AMP and proteins such as lysozyme or thrombin. In the last decade, DNAzymes have become part of numerous applications in many areas of science from chemistry to biology to medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadenosine 3aadenosine monophosphate 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3achemiluminescence 3acocaine 3acolorimetry 3acopper 3aengineering 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alead 3alysozyme 3amedicine 3amercury 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligonucleotides 3apotassium 3asilver 3aspectral analysis 3atelomerase 3atherapeutics 3athermal stability 3athrombin1 aJuskowiak, Bernard0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 Nov. 30, v. 707, no. 1-2 p.7-17dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.08.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010400209506011700313506007600430520107000506592002801576506003701604650002301641650002001664650001201684650001701696650002601713653002601739653001901765653002301784653002001807653002201827700001701849700002801866773013901894856008302033852000902116655001202125IND60761820020221207113808.0220421e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076182002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2021.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Raghu Rai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4001-169810aHerbal products as skincare therapeutic agents against ultraviolet radiation-induced skin disorders  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper aims to highlight the pharmacological aspects of listed herbal skincare products used for the treatment of various disorders caused due to ultraviolet radiation.

Two pressing questions stand out. These questions relate to whether space use by subordinate carnivores is a function of resource distribution and shifts in resource availability or fine scale movement associations with sympatric top predators that dominate them. We hypothesized that leopard movements were primarily resource-driven and secondarily, competition driven. Using data from leopards and lions collared in the Kruger National Park (Kruger) and the neighboring Timbavati Private Nature Reserve (Timbavati), we investigated the associations between leopard GPS fixes and resource distribution. We built landscapes of movement activities of lions to investigate the relationships with leopard movements. Results suggested that leopard movements were strongly resource-driven. Lion influence did not come out strongly on leopards collared in the Kruger. In the Timbavati however, lion movements appeared to strongly influence the male leopard movements. We concluded that resources were the main driver of leopard movement behavior and that differences in observed behaviors between Kruger and Timbavati were as a result of different management regimes practiced in the two reserves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera leo 3acarnivores 3aconservation areas 3aglobal positioning systems 3alandscapes 3amales 3anational parks 3apredators 3asympatry 3aSouth Africa 0aCoexistence 0aResources 0aCompetition 0aLeopard 0aLion 0aKruger National Park1 aMaruping, Nkabeng T.1 aChimimba, Christian T.1 aFerreira, S.

However, differential decomposition of individual con stituents during incorporation of plant material into lake sediments could influence these interpretations. There fore, we investigated down-core variations in the carbon isotope composition (δ¹³C) of subfossil leaves of Salix herbacea L., and their holocellulose component, from a late-Holocene (c. 0–3300 years ago) site in northern Sweden. Locally weighted regression curves fitted to bothδ¹³C data sets showed similar but conserved temporal patterns of change, and there was no evidence for systematic shifts in the holocellulose yields or C:N ratios of leaves with age. Small d¹³C variations over the past 3300 years probably reflect natural variations in microclimate within the lake catchment area. This interpretation is quantitatively consistent with the variability determ ined from measurements made on leaves of modern S. herbacea plants growing at the same site. Overall these results imply that, under conditions of uniform decomposition,δ¹³C measurements made on late-Holocene sequences of whole leaves provide an interpretation of the pattern and direction of change consistent with that obtained from holocellulose isolated from the same leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix herbacea 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acellulose 3adata collection 3alakes 3aleaves 3amicroclimate 3aplants (botany) 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3awatersheds 3aSweden 0aDiagenesis 0apalaeoclimates 0aSalix herbacea 0astable carbon isotopes 0acellulose 0alate Holocene1 aLoader, N.

A key contributor to this double burden of malnutrition is dietary changes associated with nutrition transition. Although the importance of socio-economic drivers is known, there is limited knowledge about their stratification and relative importance to diet and to different forms of malnutrition. The aim of this study was to assess diet diversity and malnutrition in preschoolers and evaluate the relative importance of socioeconomic resources. Households with children under five (5467) were enrolled using a multi-stage sampling procedure. Standardized tools and procedures were used to collect data on diet, anthropometry and socio-economic factors. Multivariable analysis with cluster adjustment was performed. The prevalence of stunting was 19.6% (18.5–20.6), wasting 3.2% (2.8–3.7), and overweight/obesity 11.4% (10.6–12.2). Stunting, overweight, wasting and limited diet diversity was present in all social strata. Low maternal education was associated with an increased risk of stunting (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.8; 1.4–2.2), limited diet diversity (AOR: 0.33; 0.26–0.42) and reduced odds of being overweight (AOR: 0.61; 0.44–0.84). Preschoolers in Addis Ababa have limited quality diets and suffer from both under- and over-nutrition. Maternal education was an important explanatory factor for stunting and being overweight. Interventions that promote diet quality for the undernourished whilst also addressing the burgeoning problem of being overweight are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropometric measurements 3achildhood obesity 3adiet 3aeducation 3agrowth retardation 3ahouseholds 3aknowledge 3amalnutrition 3anutrients 3anutritional adequacy 3aodds ratio 3apreschool children 3aprevalence 3arisk 3asampling 3asocial stratification 3asocioeconomic factors 3asurveys 3aEthiopia1 aJirström, Magnus,1 aAbdelmenan, Semira 1 aBerhāna Yamāna,1 aAlsanius, Beatrix 1 aTrenholm, Jill 1 aEkström, Eva-Charlotte,0 tNutrients.g2020 Mar. 07, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120307123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012700171300001600298500001500314520141700329592002801746650001401774650001201788650001901800650001401819650001101833650002301844650001201867650001401879650001001893650001701903650001901920650001401939650002101953650001501974650001001989650001601999650002102015650002102036650000902057651002502066653001502091653002002106653001202126653003402138653001902172653001502191700001802206700002202224700003002246700002302276700002502299773011602324856008502440852000902525655001202534IND60526223620221120174532.0190403e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052622362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerguido, Estela10aContrasting growth and mortality responses to climate warming of two pine species in a continental Mediterranean ecosystem  ap. 149-158.  a2019-12-06  aThe long lifespan of trees makes them sensitive to climate warming, particularly when abrupt changes in climatic conditions occur and when trees are already growing near to their climatic tolerance thresholds. In many Mediterranean pine forests, drought stress induced by warmer temperatures and increased aridification compromise tree survival, causing growth decline and, eventually, triggering tree mortality. We evaluated the effect of climate on radial growth and mortality comparing dead and living trees of two pine species,Pinus sylvestrisandPinus nigrasubsp.salzmannii, in a continental Mediterranean area over a 50-year long period. We used linear mixed models and correlations to evaluate the effect of climate on basal area increment (BAI) and on ring-width indices, respectively. InP. nigra, growth was enhanced by wet and cold conditions, whilst growth increased with temperatures inP. sylvestris. A gradual BAI reduction was detected inP. nigratrees since the late 1970s, becoming more pronounced in recently dead trees. Contrarily,P. sylvestris growth did not show such decline, whilst death events in this species were linked to severe and punctual droughts. Our findings show that warming and drought stress trigger contrasting responses in functionally and phylogenetically similar tree species, and suggest climate-mediated important changes on competitive dominance in Mediterranean forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3alongevity 3adecline 3atree mortality 3adead wood 3amodels 3aconiferous forests 3adrought 3aphylogeny 3atrees 3awater stress 3aglobal warming 3amortality 3aPinus sylvestris 3aecosystems 3adeath 3atemperature 3astand basal area 3aclimatic factors 3acold 3aMediterranean region 0aTree death 0aClimate warming 0aDrought 0aPinus nigra subsp. salzmannii 0aGrowth decline 0abasal area1 aGranda, Elena1 aBenavides, Raquel1 aGarcía-Cervigón, Ana I.1 aCamarero, J.

Results showed that oral bioaccessibility of CuO NPs in gastric phase (GP) ranged from 70% to 84%, it significantly decreased to 50%–70% in intestinal phase (IP). The inhalation bioaccessibility of CuO NPs in artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF) ranged from 66% to 85%, and much higher than that in Gamble’s solution (GS, 3.3%–23%). By comparing CuO NPs to Cu(NO₃)₂ bioaccessibility, insignificant difference was found. The aging time (D15 and D90) had limited effect on their oral and inhalation bioaccessibility. CEC and free Al were positively and clay content was negatively correlated with CuO NPs inhalation bioaccessibility, while Cu(NO₃)₂ inhalation bioaccessibility decreased with increasing soil clay content and pH. Our findings provide an essential basis to evaluate the human health risks of CuO NPs.  aPublisher supplied data  a41771524cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aZR2019MD028cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province 3abioavailability 3abreathing 3aclay fraction 3acupric oxide 3ahuman health 3aintestines 3apH 3apollution 3atoxicology1 aQiu, Yanhua1 aChang, Minghui1 aSun, Zongquan1 aHe, Fang1 aLi, Helian0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2021 Nov., v. 107, no. 5 p.967-974dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03287-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245006000131300001600191520114600207592002801353650000901381650001901390650001201409650000701421650001601428650001401444650002001458653001801478653001801496653001401514700002601528773012501554852000901679655001201688IND60747715720221119114201.0210818e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074771572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanna, Hussein10aPotable water treatment: Best time to measure turbidity  ap. 850-852.  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of time on the turbidity readings that and consequently guarantee the quality of the results in precision. Therefore, the methodology consists of creating three sets of river water turbidity levels (high, medium, and low). Jar-test was run for four times with the same concentrations of the added alum for each level. The optimum pH for the raw water followed by obtaining the optimum dose for the alum that were used to achieve the best turbidity removal in order to run the Jar-test to find the impact of time on turbidity readings. The high-level turbidity (200–250 NTU), was to measure the turbidity within the first 5 minutes of the sampling with an optimum dose = 38 mg/l and pH of 6.25. In terms of medium and low turbidity levels (100–130 NTU and 10–50 NTU), the best time to measure the turbidity is within the first 10 minutes of the sampling as there was no significant difference between the before and after the ten minutes with an optimum alum dose of 30 mg/l for medium level and alum dose of 15mg/l for the low level and both sets have an optimum pH equal to 7.5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalum 3adrinking water 3aecology 3apH 3ariver water 3aturbidity 3awater treatment 0aWater quality 0aPotable water 0aAlum dose1 aAnṣārī, Naẓīr,0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.850-852dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245011500161300001600276520144000292592002801732650001201760650001201772650002501784650001301809650001301822650000901835650001501844650001201859650001201871650001201883650001101895650001401906650001301920650001201933650000701945700003301952700002201985773014302007856007202150852000902222655001202231IND60661968420221122115757.0190904e20100311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066196842DNAL7 a10.1039/b920238b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeebink, Loreal V.10aEffects of mercury emission control technologies using halogens on coal combustion product chemical properties  ap. 608-613.  aFly ash and spray dryer absorber (SDA) material samples collected during mercury emission control technology tests that incorporated the use of halogens were evaluated for select chemical composition and leachability. Corresponding samples were also collected under standard operating conditions and examined using the same protocols. Included in these evaluations were pH and total and leachable concentrations of the mercury control technology (MCT) halogen of interest (Br, Cl, or I) and Hg, As, Cr, and Se. The use of a MCT using halogens decreased the pH values of coal combustion products (CCPs) collected in fabric filters compared with that of the corresponding standard CCPs. In many cases, the total As, Cr, and Se concentrations were similar between the standard and MCT test CCPs. However, at least a slight increase in total Se was noted in each sample set from the standard to the MCT test CCPs. Short-term leaching was performed on all samples, and long-term leaching was performed on most highly alkaline samples. On the basis of percentage of maximum leachability, the MCT additive halogens were more mobile than the other elements evaluated. The Hg in fly ash and SDA material samples was stable. Generally, more As and Se leached from the MCT test CCPs than the standard CCPs. Cr leachate results were more variable. The data indicate a need to further examine the effects of MCT using halogens applications on CCPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abromine 3achemical composition 3achlorine 3achromium 3acoal 3acombustion 3afabrics 3afilters 3afly ash 3aiodine 3aleachates 3aleaching 3amercury 3apH1 aPflughoeft-Hassett, Debra F.1 aHassett, David J.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2010 Mar. 11, v. 12, no. 3 p.608-613dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b920238b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245013300166300001500299520124100314592002801555650002901583650001301612650001701625650005301642650001301695650001701708650001601725650002201741650001001763650001401773650001801787650001001805650003201815650002501847650003101872650001001903650001101913700002801924700002701952700001901979700002301998700002702021773013302048856007902181852000902260655001202269IND60765040020221118025459.0220419e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076504002DNAL7 a10.17221/338/2018-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrtilová, Tereza10aImpact of different pure cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on the volatile profile of Cabernet Sauvignon<br />rosé wines  ap. 94-102.  aGrape juice of Cabernet Sauvignon was fermented with three axenic cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CS-V1, CS-V2, CS-V3) to determine the effect of yeast strain on the aroma of rosé wine. An analytical methodology based on headspace solid phase microextraction combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for identification of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in resulting wines. This method allowed the identification of 97 VOC responsible for wine aroma which was strictly affected by the strain used for fermentation. Results of the statistical analysis showed that strains CS-V2 and CS-V3 had the highest similarity of VOC profiles while CS-V1 was significantly different. Wine fermented with yeast strain CS-V1 was characterized by a high concentration of hexyl octanoate, 2-phenylethyl octanoate and free terpenoids (farnesol, farnesyl acetate). Strain CS-V2 contributed to an increased relative concentration of 1-hexadecanol, 1-heptanol, 9-decenoic acid and nerolidol.

Practicing Suryanamaskar before beginning routine activities vitalizes the practitioner and gives a completely energized day. Starting from the Raja of Aundh who first introduced surya namaskar, there is a line of eminent people who popularized this dynamic group of asanas including T Krishnamacharya, Swami Sivananda, Swami Satyananda from Bihar school of Yoga, so on and so forth. Their contributions resulted in this excellent series of Asanas being introduced to the practitioners. Such a miraculous group of postures also involves dynamic breathing patterns at each posture and gives a form of complete practice involving asanas and pranayama. There are a total of 12 postures in Suryanamaskar practice and 24 steps in one round. This is in the form of salutation to the “Sun” along with chanting the twelve names of the sun god. In this review, we accentuate the importance of Suryanamaskar highlighting its effects on physical, psychological and physiological aspects of the body based on published research. In addition, the usefulness of surya namaskar as one complete sadhana for the whole body is emphasized.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aRaja 3apeople 3aposture 3ayoga 3aIndia 0aSurya namaskar 0aPhysical 0aPhysiological 0aEndocrine 0aChakras 0aWomen health1 aVandhana, S.0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2022 Apr.,  June, v. 13, no. 2 p.100530-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245009000159300001600249520149100265592002801756650000801784650002801792650003101820650001901851650001501870650001001885650002201895650001501917650001901932650001501951651002101966700001601987700001502003700001602018700001902034700001602053700001502069700001602084773013102100856007702231852000902308655001202317IND60594321320221120024917.0200415e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059432132DNAL7 a10.1657/AAAR0016-0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Fanglin10aObservation of Strong Winds on the Northern Slopes of Mount Everest in Monsoon Season  ap. 687-697.  aAn analysis of the local atmospheric circulation in a northern Himalayan valley in the region of Mount Everest is presented. Data were collected using an automatic weather station over a one-year period in 2014. A ground-based wind profiler radar (WPR) and an in situ GPS radiosonde (RS) were also employed. This study focuses on the characteristics of afternoon strong wind events in the downstream of Rongbuk Valley. We found that: (1) The occurrence of the southwesterly wind during non-monsoon was in good consistency with high values of westerly wind at high levels over this region and confirmed to be driven by the strong westerly jet aloft. (2) The strong afternoon wind in monsoon season has a persistent southeasterly direction, which differs from the prevailing direction of the strong wind in non-monsoon. This flow was found to be independent of the wind aloft and was strongly seasonal, developing at Qomolangma Station (QOMS) when the subtropical jet stream had moved northward and was most stable and strongest in the early monsoon season but before the rainy season. (3) The southeasterly wind in monsoon is colder than local air, suggesting that it is driven by a strong thermal gradient from the Arun Valley to QOMS. Our results contribute to improving our knowledge of local circulation patterns in the Himalayas, and also to gaining a detailed understanding of the mountain chain’s role in both the monsoon system and regional transport of atmospheric pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric circulation 3aglobal positioning systems 3amonsoon season 3apollutants 3aradar 3atopographic slope 3awet season 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aHimalayan region1 aMa, Yaoming1 aHu, Zeyong1 aLi, Maoshan1 aGerken, Tobias1 aZhang, Lang1 aHan, Cunbo1 aSun, Genhou0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2017 Nov. 1, v. 49, no. 4 p.687-697dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1657/AAAR0016-0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009900171300001800270520184800288592002802136650002302164650002402187650001202211650001702223650001802240650002402258650001402282650002102296650001102317650001402328650001802342650001702360650001602377651001802393653000702411653000702418653000702425653000902432653000802441653000802449653000702457653000802464653004802472653001402520653003702534653002402571700001302595700001802608700001602626700001402642700005302656773012502709856008802834852000902922655001202931IND60562469220221123005306.0181011e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056246922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Zhiying10aTemperature change between neighboring days and mortality in United States: A nationwide study  ap. 1152-1161.  aTemperature change between neighboring days (TCN), an indicator to reflect sudden temperature variation, has been identified as an independent risk factor for human health by small-scale studies. However, the adverse impact of TCN on mortality and effect modification are insufficiently studied, and a larger multi-cities analysis at national level is needed to provide an insightful knowledge.Using daily mortality and meteorological data from 106 communities of United States during 1987 to 2000, we employed a quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model to quantitatively estimate the effect of TCN on mortality for each community and a multivariate meta-analysis to pool the community-specific estimates.At national level, a monotonic increasing curve of TCN–mortality association was observed, which indicated that negative TCN (temperature decrease from the previous day) was associated with reduced mortality and positive TCN (temperature increase) elevated the risk of mortality. The relative risk for lag 0–21days was 0.63 (95% confidence interval: 0.59–0.68) for extremely negative TCN (1st percentile) and 1.46 (1.39–1.54) for extremely positive TCN (99th percentile) on non-accidental mortality. We also found prominent effects of extreme TCNs on mortality for cardiovascular, respiratory, pneumonia, and COPD diseases. People ≥75years and those with respiratory disease, especially pneumonia-deaths, were identified as a particularly vulnerable population to TCN. The TCN–mortality association was modified by season and region.A positive TCN was associated with an elevated risk of mortality in United States, with different effect patterns by region and season. Identification of the effect modifiers presented a significantly stronger influence on older adults and those with respiratory disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3aconfidence interval 3aelderly 3ahuman health 3ameta-analysis 3ameteorological data 3amortality 3anonlinear models 3apeople 3apneumonia 3arelative risk 3arisk factors 3atemperature 3aUnited States 0aAT 0aCI 0adf 0aDLNM 0aTCN 0aDTR 0aRR 0aRRR 0aTemperature change between neighboring days 0aMortality 0aDistributed lag non-linear model 0aEffect modification1 aZhao, Yu1 aPang, Shaojie1 aXue, Zhong,1 aWu, Chong1 aDing, Zan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0311-33530 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 584-585 p.1152-1161dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009700160300001600257520106300273592002801336650001401364650001801378650001801396650002701414650001701441650001001458650001601468650001101484650001301495650001801508650001301526650001801539650001101557650001401568650001401582653001401596653002301610653003101633700001701664700001701681700001601698773012101714856008101835852000901916655001201925IND60586168420221121050852.0190318e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058616842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Han10aOptimization of additives and their combination to improve the quality of refrigerated dough  ap. 482-488.  aIn this study, emulsifiers (sugar ester and sodium stearoyl lactylate), hydrocolloids (guar gum and carboxy methyl cellulose), oxidizers (ascorbic acid and azobisformamide), and enzymes (xylanase and α-amylase) were added into refrigerated dough and revealed their totally different characteristics over 5 days of refrigeration. The optimal refrigerated dough formulation appeared to be the one containing 1% sugar ester, 1% sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL), 10 mg/kg xylanse and 0.04% ascorbic acid. This optimal formulation predicted a continuous and stable gluten matrix. The secondary structure of refrigerated dough containing optimal formulation remained unchanged while a decrease of 7.00% in α-helix content was observed in control refrigerated dough. It might be ascribed to the enhanced physical intra/intermolecular associations (cross-links or entanglements) of the polymeric chains. These results suggested that the combination of certain additives have a synergistic effect on maintaining the structural characteristics of refrigerated dough.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aalpha-amylase 3aascorbic acid 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acrosslinking 3adough 3aemulsifiers 3agluten 3aguar gum 3ahydrocolloids 3aoxidants 3arefrigeration 3asodium 3asynergism 3axylanases 0aAdditives 0aRefrigerated dough 0aStructural characteristics1 aXiao, Yingda1 aWu, Fengfeng1 aXu, Xueming0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Mar., v. 89 p.482-488dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008600208300001200294520168400306592002801990596002702018650001302045650002002058650001102078650002402089650001502113650002302128650001502151650000902166650003002175650002602205651001902231700003002250700001902280700001902299700003102318700002202349700001902371773013502390856008302525852000902608655001202617IND60755362720221121002933.0220818e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075536272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-021-01828-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlfonso, Beatriz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1539-178310aFast climatic changes place an endemic Canary Island macroalga at extinction risk  ap. 113.  aGlobal warming and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) affect marine organisms worldwide. However, we still lack knowledge about the consequences of these environmental changes to range-restricted macroalgae species, such as Gelidium canariense, a habitat-forming endemic of the Canary Islands. The aim of this study is to provide useful data for analyzing the conservation status of this endemic species. To do this, (1) we compared distributional data from 1987 with the data collected in 2008 and 2019 along the northern coast of Tenerife; (2) we assessed the variation in macroalgae assemblages dominated by G. canariense over the last decade on this same cost; and (3) we explored the correlation of these results with the actual trends of sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature at 2 m above the sea surface (T2m), UVR, and downward solar radiation (DSR). The results showed significant changes in the distribution of G. canariense in the last 30 years at Tenerife. More than 90% of its populations have declined. The endemic macroalgae have been replaced by the globally distributed species Pterocladiella capillacea at nearly all the sites studied. The cover of G. canariense and Gelidium arbuscula decreased significantly with increasing SST and T2m. Additionally, G. canariense is negatively related to the rise in UVR. These results highlight the vulnerability of both species of Gelidium to global warming and UVR, but especially of G. canariense. The drastic decline of this species reveals the need to upgrade its conservation status and implement protection measures to reduce the damage that predicted global change scenario may have to their relict populations.  aPublisher supplied data  aPhD thesiscCaja Siete 3aGelidium 3aair temperature 3acoasts 3aconservation status 3aextinction 3aindigenous species 3amacroalgae 3arisk 3asurface water temperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3aCanary Islands1 aHernández, José Carlos,1 aSangil, Carlos1 aMartin, Laura,1 aExpósito Lorenzo, Javier,1 aDíaz, Juan Pedro1 aSanson, Marta,0 tRegional environmental change.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 4 p.113-113dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-021-01828-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100005800190245016800248300001400416520192100430592002802351653001702379653001902396653002802415653001602443653002402459700002102483700001902504700002302523700001802546700001602564700002302580700001802603700002402621700002202645700002502667773007502692856008302767852000902850655001202859IND60555308020221119020854.0161026e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055530802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.02.0262doi7 aPMC48567482pmcid7 a272115512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasquier, Eddy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2824-500210aEffective Management of Advanced Angiosarcoma by the Synergistic Combination of Propranolol and Vinblastine-based Metronomic Chemotherapy: A Bench to Bedside Study  ap. 87-95.  aAngiosarcomas are rare malignant tumors of vascular origin that represent a genuine therapeutic challenge. Recently, the combination of metronomic chemotherapy and drug repositioning has been proposed as an attractive alternative for cancer patients living in developing countries.In vitro experiments with transformed endothelial cells were used to identify synergistic interactions between anti-hypertensive drug propranolol and chemotherapeutics. This led to the design of a pilot treatment protocol combining oral propranolol and metronomic chemotherapy. Seven consecutive patients with advanced/metastatic/recurrent angiosarcoma were treated with this combination for up to 12months, followed by propranolol-containing maintenance therapy.Gene expression analysis showed expression of ADRB1 and ADRB2 adrenergic receptor genes in transformed endothelial cells and in angiosarcoma tumors. Propranolol strongly synergized with the microtubule-targeting agent vinblastine in vitro, but only displayed additivity or slight antagonism with paclitaxel and doxorubicin. A combination treatment using bi-daily propranolol (40mg) and weekly metronomic vinblastine (6mg/m2) and methotrexate (35mg/m2) was designed and used in 7 patients with advanced angiosarcoma. Treatment was well tolerated and resulted in 100% response rate, including 1 complete response and 3 very good partial responses, based on RECIST criteria. Median progression-free and overall survival was 11months (range 5–24) and 16months (range 10–30), respectively.Our results provide a strong rationale for the combination of β-blockers and vinblastine-based metronomic chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced angiosarcoma. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of drug repositioning in combination with metronomic chemotherapy in low- and middle-income country setting.This study was funded by institutional and philanthropic grants.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAngiosarcoma 0aVascular tumor 0aMetronomic chemotherapy 0aPropranolol 0aAdrenergic receptor1 aAndré, Nicolas,1 aStreet, Janine1 aChougule, Anuradha1 aRekhi, Bharat1 aGhosh, Jaya1 aPhilip, Deepa S.J.1 aMeurer, Marie1 aMacKenzie, Karen L.1 aKavallaris, Maria1 aBanavali, Shripad D.0 tEBioMedicine.g2016 Apr., v. 6 p.87-95dElsevier B.V.x2352-39647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.02.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245012000135300001600255520097600271592002801247650001701275650002601292650002201318650001901340650001201359650001601371650002401387650001701411650000901428650001701437650001001454653002301464653002201487653002701509653001001536700002101546700002601567700002101593700002101614773012501635852000901760655001201769IND60747716020221119114132.0210818e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074771602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajvanshi, Shriram10aEffect of crop establishment methods and weed management practices on yield and economics of rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 866-871.  aA field study was undertaken to evaluate the crop establishment and weed management strategies for rice at Acharya Narendra Dev University of Agriculture and Technology, Kumarganj, Faizabad during kharif season, 2017–18.

Bumblebees have been well-studied in agricultural landscapes of Western Europe, Asia and North America, but few studies have been developed on bumblebees in forest-dominated landscapes of Eastern Europe. We developed this study in 22 semi-natural meadows located in a patchy forested landscape of Estonia. We investigated the influence of habitat characteristics and landscape factors (calculated at four spatial scales: 250, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 m radius) on the total species richness and abundance of bumblebees. Correlation analysis, partial least squares (PLS) and stepwise forward-selection multiple regression analysis were applied in this study. The presence of a high diversity of flowering plants in semi-natural meadows may benefit the abundance of bumblebees. At the local level, patch area and shape seem to have positive and negative influences, respectively, on bumblebee species richness. At the landscape level, human settlements with the presence of gardens may favour bumblebee richness and abundance. Also, bumblebee species may increase with a high presence of meadows in the landscape, and may decrease with high percentages of forest and young forest. Overall, forested landscapes with a strong presence of edges and a diverse matrix may support a higher species richness and abundance of bumblebees. Both local and landscape factors should be considered when designing conservation strategies and agri-environmental measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3aspecies richness 3aAsia 3aEastern European region 3aEstonia 3aNorth America 3aWestern European region1 aKuusemets, Valdo1 aMänd, Marika1 aLiivamägi, Ave1 aKaart, Tanel1 aLuig, Jaan0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2013 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.113-125dSpringer-Verlagx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-012-9490-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008800167300001600255520110000271592002801371650001901399650001001418650001301428650001201441650001701453650001201470650001001482650001401492650001101506651001501517653001701532653002301549653002101572653001301593653002201606653002201628700002001650700002101670773010501691856008201796852000901878655001201887IND60622208220221118045335.0181124e200007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062220822DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683006758376712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohr, Jerry A.10aPostglacial vegetation and fire history, eastern Klamath Mountains, California, USA  ap. 587-601.  aPollen and high-resolution charcoal data from Bluff Lake and Crater Lake, California, indicate simi lar changes in climate, vegetation and fire history during the last 15 500 years. Pollen data at Bluff Lake suggest that the vegetation betweenc. 15 500 and 13 100 cal. BP consisted of subalpine parkland with scattered Pinus andAbies. After 13 100 cal. BP a relatively closed forest ofP. monticola,P. contorta andAbies developed, and fire-event frequency was low. The inferred climate then was cooler and wetter than present. Pinus andQuercus vaccinifolia dominated at both sites during the early Holocene, when conditions were warm and dry. As climate became wetter and cooler in the late Holocene,Abies spp. at both sites andTsuga mertensi ana at Crater Lake increased in importance, displacingPinus andQuercus. The two lake records have similar trends in fire history, with high event frequencies atc. 8400, 4000 and 1000 cal. BP and low values atc. 4800 cal. BP. The fire and vegetation history at both sites suggests a similar response to large-scale changes in climate during the Holocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aPinus 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3afire history 3aforests 3alakes 3amountains 3apollen 3aCalifornia 0aFire history 0avegetation history 0acharcoal records 0aHolocene 0aPacific Northwest 0aKlamath Mountains1 aWhitlock, Cathy1 aSkinner, Carl N.0 tHolocene.g2000 July, v. 10, no. 5 p.587-601dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683006758376713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245013100210300001600341520134700357592002801704650002701732650001101759650001201770650001901782650001001801651001301811653002701824653002801851653002401879653002501903653001601928653002001944700001801964700002101982773011102003856008302114852000902197655001202206IND60544653620221120155015.0190417e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054465362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2015.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilvis, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1163-012310aDay-roost tree selection by northern long-eared bats—What do non-roost tree comparisons and one year of data really tell us?  ap. 756-763.  aBat day-roost selection often is described through comparisons of day-roosts with randomly selected, and assumed unused, trees. Relatively few studies, however, look at patterns of multi-year selection or compare day-roosts used across years. We explored day-roost selection using 2 years of roost selection data for female northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) on the Fort Knox Military Reservation, Kentucky, USA. We compared characteristics of randomly selected non-roost trees and day-roosts using a multinomial logistic model and day-roost species selection using chi-squared tests. We found that factors differentiating day-roosts from non-roosts and day-roosts between years varied. Day-roosts differed from non-roosts in the first year of data in all measured factors, but only in size and decay stage in the second year. Between years, day-roosts differed in size and canopy position, but not decay stage. Day-roost species selection was non-random and did not differ between years. Although bats used multiple trees, our results suggest that there were additional unused trees that were suitable as roosts at any time. Day-roost selection pattern descriptions will be inadequate if based only on a single year of data, and inferences of roost selection based only on comparisons of roost to non-roosts should be limited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyotis septentrionalis 3acanopy 3afemales 3alogit analysis 3atrees 3aKentucky 0aMyotis septentrionalis 0aNorthern long-eared bat 0aDay-roost selection 0aDay-roost comparison 0aMultinomial 0aRoost selection1 aFord, W.

We compared the yield potential, input cost and net returns in major crop combinations under SPNF during the Rabi (2018–19) and Kharif (2019–20) seasons, with Conventional Farming (CF). The cereals-pulses, cereals-vegetables, fruit-pulses-vegetables and vegetables-pulses were found as the four major crop combinations followed under SPNF on an average area of 0.26 ha, in the State. The fruit based SPNF farming combination was the most popular (40.6%) and profitable (REE=21.44%). A reduction of 14.3445.55 per cent in cost of cultivation and an increase of 11.8–21.55 per cent in the net returns, over CF, validate the superiority of SPNF over the CF. The success of early SPNF adopters supports the viable potential of SPNF to sustain farming and enhance mountainous farmers' income, yet long term studies are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3afruits 3amountains 3aIndia 0aZBNF 0aSPNF 0aEconomic impact 0aConventional farming 0aNet returns1 aGupta, M.q(Manoj),1 aSharma, Subhash1 aSharma, P.L.1 aVerma, Sudhir1 aChandel, Ashu0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.872-877dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011500170300001600285520123700301592002801538650001201566650002201578650001201600650003301612650001301645650001401658650001401672650001301686650002101699650001401720650001201734650001001746650001001756650001901766650001301785651002401798651001301822653001701835653002301852653002301875653001201898653001701910653001301927653001301940773010501953856008202058852000902140655001202149IND60622208320221118045241.0181124e200004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062220832DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683006760393972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Richard G.10aHolocene environments reconstructed from plant macrofossils in stream deposits from southeastern Nebraska, USA  ap. 357-365.  aPlant macrofossils from sediments exposed in cutbanks of small streams on the Great Plains yield details of the history of the vegetation and climate, and potentially of the hydrologic behaviour of the streams during the past 9000 radiocarbon years. Five zones are recognized by visual inspection. Macrofossils in zone 1(c. 9000 to c. 8500 BP) indicate that upland deciduous forest was sparsely present, but that prairie, weedy and wetland habitats were also well established. Zone 2 (c. 8500 to c. 5800 BP) is sparsely represented, but upland trees disappeared, riparian trees and wetland plants were sparse, and weeds and prairie taxa fluctuated from low to high values. This interval was probably the warmest, driest part of the Holocene. Zone 3 (c. 5800 to c. 3100 BP) had a rich riparian forest, along with well-developed prairies, disturbed habitats and wetlands. This period was more moist but had intermittent droughts. Zone 4 (c. 3100 to c. 2700 BP) has peaks in many prairie and weedy elements, whereas riparian forest elements nearly disappeared, suggesting another warm, dry interval. Zone 5 represents a return to somewhat less arid conditions and records a strong signature of introduced weeds in post-settlement time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adeciduous forests 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3ahydrology 3aprairies 3ariparian forests 3asediments 3astreams 3atrees 3aweeds 3awetland plants 3awetlands 3aGreat Plains region 3aNebraska 0aPaleoecology 0aplant macrofossils 0avegetation history 0aprairie 0aGreat Plains 0aHolocene 0aNebraska0 tHolocene.g2000 Apr., v. 10, no. 3 p.357-365dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683006760393973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011800171300001600289520098500305592002801290650001501318650001501333650001101348650002301359650002001382650002101402650003201423650001101455650001801466650001001484653002001494653001101514653003401525653002101559653003101580700002701611773010101638856008601739852000901825655001201834IND60583827220221122194142.0171024e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058382722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilera, P.G.10aTechno-economic assessment of biogas plant upgrading by adsorption of hydrogen sulfide on treated sewage–sludge  ap. 411-420.  aBiogas plant upgrading by adsorption of hydrogen sulfide on treated sewage–sludge was techno-economically assessed. Three different processes were included in the study: the desulfurization of biogas by adsorption, the in-situ regeneration of the adsorbent and its production from sewage-sludge. Biogas plant upgrading was performed for a flow rate of 1000Nm3/h of biogas with a H2S concentration of 2000ppmv and a breakthrough concentration of 200ppmv, which is the technical limit value for internal combustion engines. The cost due to the steam required for the in-situ regeneration was evaluated in two different scenarios: as a bought external utility and as an in-situ produced utility, installing an electric or a biogas steam boiler. According to the cash flow analysis carried out, all the options require a similar minimum selling price for the upgraded biogas (about 0.27–0.29€/Nm3), with a cost of the overall desulfurization process between 2.5 and 4.0c€/Nm3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiogas 3acash flow analysis 3adesulfurization 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ainternal combustion engines 3aprices 3asewage sludge 3asteam 0aDesulfurization 0aBiogas 0aSewage-sludge based adsorbent 0aHydrogen sulfide 0aTechno-economic assessment1 aGutiérrez Ortiz, F.J.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 126 p.411-420dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245019900172300001600371520189600387592002802283650001102311650002102322650001402343650002302357650001602380650001302396650001302409650002402422650001402446650001202460650001802472650001102490650001702501650003302518650001702551650001602568653002102584653003102605653002402636653001102660653001302671653003302684700001902717700002402736773010102760856008602861852000902947655001202956IND60583827320221122194356.0171024e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058382732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPudukudy, Manoj10aMethane decomposition into COx free hydrogen and multiwalled carbon nanotubes over ceria, zirconia and lanthana supported nickel catalysts prepared via a facile solid state citrate fusion method  ap. 302-315.  aMethane decomposition is the most effective route for the simultaneous production of COx-free hydrogen and nanocarbon. In this work, a set of porous ceria, zirconia and lanthana supported nickel catalysts were successfully synthesized via a facile solid state citrate fusion method and used for the thermocatalytic decomposition of undiluted methane for the first time. The catalysts were completely characterized for their crystalline, structural, textural and reduction properties and correlated to their catalytic performance. The active phase of fresh catalysts was found to be NiO in the CeO2 and ZrO2 supported catalysts whereas the formation of lanthanum nickel oxide solid solution was observed in the Ni/La2O3 catalyst. Various attractive porous morphologies of the fresh catalysts were confirmed by scanning electron microscopic studies. All of the catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for methane decomposition. The yield of hydrogen and carbon increased significantly with increasing the reaction temperature from 600°C to 700°C. A maximum initial hydrogen yield of 62%, 61% and 58% and a final carbon yield of 1360wt%, 1159wt% and 1576wt% was achieved over ceria, zirconia and lanthana supported catalysts respectively, at 700°C. The surface area of the catalysts could not have any significant effect on the catalytic efficiency and it was fully depended on the metal support interaction. The Ni/La2O3 catalyst showed high catalytic stability than ceria and zirconia supported catalysts due to the enhanced surface dispersion of finely crystallized Ni nanoparticles on the lanthana matrix aroused by the reduction of lanthanum nickel oxide. Moreover, bulk deposition of highly uniform multiwalled carbon nanotubes with high graphitization degree (ID/IG=0.95) with different diameters depending on the Ni crystalline size was observed over the catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3acitrates 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3alanthanum 3amethane 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aMethane cracking 0aSolid state citrate fusion 0aRare earth supports 0aNickel 0aHydrogen 0aMultiwalled carbon nanotubes1 aYaakob, Zahira1 aTakriff, Mohd Sobri0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 126 p.302-315dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01396naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245003500173300001400208520062900222592002800851650001000879650003100889650001200920650001000932773012200942856005701064852000901121655001201130IND4483886020221120052603.0120727e194910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448388602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0307.1949.tb00731.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmillie, D.

In both fine (< 2.1 µm, PM₂.₁) and coarse (> 2.1 µm, PM>₂.₁) PM, organic carbon (OC) accounted for the highest fractions (26.9% ± 10.9% and 23.1% ± 9.35%) of all measured species, and NO₃⁻ lead in average concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs). The size distributions of measured components were parameterized using geometric mean diameter (GMD). GMD values of NO₃⁻, Cl⁻, OC, and PM for the whole size range varied from < 2.1 µm in winter to > 2.1 μm in warm seasons, which was due to the fact that the size distributions of semi-volatile components (e.g., NH₄NO₃, NH₄Cl, and OC) had a dependency on the ambient temperature. Unlike OC, elemental carbon (EC), and elements, NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻, and SO₄²⁻ exhibited an increase trend in GMD values with relative humidity, indicating that the hygroscopic growth might also play a role in driving seasonal changes of PM size distributions. Positive matrix factorization was performed using compositional data of fine and coarse particles, respectively. The secondary formation of inorganic salts contributing to the majority (> 70%) of fine PM and 20.2% ± 19.9% of speciated coarse PM. The remaining coarse PM content was attributed to a variety of dust sources. Considering that coarse and fine PM had comparable mass concentrations, more attention should be paid to local dust emissions in future air quality plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aambient temperature 3adust 3alead 3aorganic carbon 3aparticulates 3arelative humidity 3awater solubility 3aChina 0aParticulate matter 0aSize distribution 0aSeasonal variation 0aSemi-volatility 0aSource apportionment1 aFeng, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7251-68291 aHe, Shuyan1 aWang, Qin'geng0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2022 Nov., v. 121 p.175-186dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010900157300002000266520104000286592002801326650001101354650001401365650002201379650001701401650002301418650002801441650002101469650002201490650001901512650001801531650001101549700001401560700001701574700001401591700001701605700001501622773012401637856007401761852000901835655001201844IND60641628520221120191102.0190505e20170426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064162852DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02965a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Zhenwei10aElectrospinning synthesis of Co₃O₄@C nanofibers as a high-performance anode for sodium ion batteries  ap. 23122-23126.  aA unique 1D structure of Co₃O₄ nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon nanofibers has been fabricated by a facile, cost-effective and scalable electrospinning method followed by a two-step heat-treatment. When tested as an anode for sodium ion batteries, the composite exhibits an initial discharge and charge capacity of 768.4 mA h g⁻¹ and 422.4 mA h g⁻¹ at 50 mA g⁻¹, and retains a reversible specific capacity of ∼300 mA h g⁻¹ up to 100 cycles. At a higher current density of 500 mA g⁻¹, a reversible capacity of 251.7 mA h g⁻¹ is still obtained. Meanwhile, compared to the pure Co₃O₄ nanofibers, Co₃O₄@C nanofibers demonstrate much improved capacity retention of 84.3% over 500 cycles. The good electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the unique 1D nanofiber structure with stable structural integrity and improved electrical conductivity rendered by the carbon nanofiber framework, which is more convenient for the electron transport and Na⁺ insertion/extraction of the active materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon nanofibers 3acobalt oxide 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aheat treatment 3ananoparticles 3asodium1 aZhou, Min1 aWang, Kangli1 aWang, Wei1 aTao, Hongwei1 aJiang, Kai0 tRSC advances.g2017 Apr. 26, v. 7, no. 37 p.23122-23126dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02965a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011600167520144300283592002801726650001701754650002301771650002001794650002701814650001401841650003201855650001601887650001101903650001801914650002001932650001101952650001801963650001601981650001901997650001902016650001202035651001302047653002202060653001902082653000902101653001202110653001202122653001302134700001802147700005502165773009402220856008402314852000902398655001202407IND60787414120221119131357.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078741412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1131892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabar, Zainab10aConsumer's perception towards electricity theft: A case study of Islamabad and Rawalpindi using a path analysis  aElectricity theft is a chronic issue and energy worth billions of dollars is stolen annually from electricity grids mainly in the developing countries. This study highlights socio-economic and institutional factors deteriorating the electricity theft situation using the path analysis by employing a measurement model in the analysis of a moment structures (AMOS). Preceding the path analysis, statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) is used for descriptive statistics, reliability analysis through Cronbach's alpha test, and exploratory factor analysis through KMO & Barlett's test of sphericity. The study analyses the factors that facilitate the illegal consumption of electricity in the service area of Islamabad Electric Supply Company, Pakistan, utilizing a primary dataset collected through a structured questionnaire from the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The analysis is based on perception of the consumers. The factors that significantly and positively affect the behavior towards theft include corruption diluting deterrence and power outages/load shedding, whereas the age of the respondent negatively affects their perception towards electricity theft. The role of electricity tariff rate, electricity consumption pattern, probability of detection, the rule of law, education of the respondent and quality of conduct of utility officials appeared insignificant in motivating consumers to steal electricity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconsumer attitudes 3adata collection 3adescriptive statistics 3aeducation 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3afactor analysis 3amodels 3apath analysis 3aprobability 3aquestionnaires 3asocioeconomics 3atariffs 3aPakistan 0aElectricity theft 0aSocio-economic 0aAMOS 0aOutages 0aBribery 0aPakistan1 aJamil, Faisal1 aHaq, Wajiha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7347-91960 tEnergy policy.g2022 Oct., v. 169 p.113189-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1131893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04052naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245011800214300001400332520238500346592002802731650002402759650002002783650002002803650001302823650001402836650001702850650002202867650001702889650001502906650002302921650002202944650002102966650001102987650001802998650001703016650001903033650001203052650001003064650001503074653003103089653001503120653002603135653001803161653002203179653002703201700002103228700001703249700002403266773011403290856008503404852000903489655001203498IND60526224520221120192959.0190403e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052622452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2016.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Verônica,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7688-262612aA meta-analysis on the effects of changes in the composition of native forests on litter decomposition in streams  ap. 27-38.  aNative forest replacement by plantations and invasions by exotic plant species are occurring worldwide. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting the effects of these forest changes on litter decomposition in streams. Overall, forest change significantly inhibited litter decomposition rate by ca 18%. However, only the replacement of native forests by deciduous broadleaf or eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) plantations resulted in significant inhibition of litter decomposition (26% and 22%, respectively) whereas conifer plantations or the invasion by exotic species did not significantly affect litter decomposition. The replacement of native forests by eucalyptus plantations was the most common type of forest change in our database. The effect of eucalyptus plantations on litter decomposition was significant when they were present simultaneously at the catchment and riparian scales and when native litter input was replaced by eucalyptus litter input in a manipulative experiment at the stream reach level. This suggests that a strong effect of eucalyptus plantations on ecosystem functioning is mediated by changes on litter inputs to streams. Eucalyptus plantations significantly inhibited the decomposition of high quality litter and total leaf litter decomposition but not the decomposition of wood and low quality leaves, or microbial-driven leaf litter decomposition. This indicates that eucalyptus plantations inhibit (likely through changes in litter inputs) litter decomposition by affecting detritivores. Eucalyptus plantations may thus have stronger negative effects on decomposition rates in streams receiving high quality litter and where detritivores are abundant. The presence of native tree species in the riparian area may mitigate the negative effects of eucalyptus plantations on stream processes. The inhibitory effect of deciduous broadleaf plantations on litter decomposition was likely due to beech (Fagus sylvatica) being used in the majority of the plantations, and beech litter is of low quality for detritivores and decomposers. The lack of significant effects of conifer plantations and invasions might be due to contrasting effects of the different conifer or invasive species on decomposers. This meta-analysis also identified several research gaps that may guide future studies on the effect of forest change on stream functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aFagus sylvatica 3aadverse effects 3aconifers 3adatabases 3adecayed wood 3adeciduous forests 3adetritivores 3aecosystems 3aforest plantations 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3ameta-analysis 3aplant litter 3ariparian areas 3astreams 3atrees 3awatersheds 0aCommercial tree plantation 0aDecomposer 0aEcosystem functioning 0aNative forest 0aSystematic review 0aWoody species invasion1 aKoricheva, Julia1 aPozo, Jesús1 aGraça, Manuel A.S.0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 364 p.27-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2016.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00889naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006000168300001600228520014000244592002800384650002200412650001400434650002200448773007400470856008200544852000900626655001200635IND60551691420221119062425.0161019e20141120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055169142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCramer, Patrick12aA Tale of Chromatin and Transcription in 100 Structures  ap. 985-994.  aTo celebrate a century of X-ray crystallography, I describe how 100 crystal structures influenced chromatin and transcription research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achromatin 3acrystal structure0 tCell.g2014 Nov. 20, v. 159 p.985-994dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002700190245013400217300001600351520157200367592002801939653003001967653001401997653001902011653003202030700002602062700002502088700002302113700002102136700002602157700002602183700002502209700002402234700001902258773007702277856008302354852000902437655001202446IND60555308820221119021200.0161026e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055530882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.02.0402doi7 aPMC48567472pmcid7 a272115552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Shashikant12aA Long-term Co-perfused Disseminated Tuberculosis-3D Liver Hollow Fiber Model for Both Drug Efficacy and Hepatotoxicity in Babies  ap. 126-138.  aTreatment of disseminated tuberculosis in children≤6years has not been optimized. The pyrazinamide-containing combination regimen used to treat disseminated tuberculosis in babies and toddlers was extrapolated from adult pulmonary tuberculosis. Due to hepatotoxicity worries, there are no dose–response studies in children. We designed a hollow fiber system model of disseminated intracellular tuberculosis with co-perfused three-dimensional organotypic liver modules to simultaneously test for efficacy and toxicity. We utilized pediatric pharmacokinetics of pyrazinamide and acetaminophen to determine dose-dependent pyrazinamide efficacy and hepatotoxicity. Acetaminophen concentrations that cause hepatotoxicity in children led to elevated liver function tests, while 100mg/kg pyrazinamide did not. Surprisingly, pyrazinamide did not kill intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis up to fourfold the standard dose as monotherapy or as combination therapy, despite achieving high intracellular concentrations. Host-pathogen RNA-sequencing revealed lack of a pyrazinamide exposure transcript signature in intracellular bacteria or of phagolysosome acidification on pH imaging. Artificial intelligence algorithms confirmed that pyrazinamide was not predictive of good clinical outcomes in children≤6years who had extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, adding a drug that works inside macrophages could benefit children with disseminated tuberculosis. Our in vitro model can be used to identify such new regimens that could accelerate cure while minimizing toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDisseminated tuberculosis 0aPediatric 0aHepatotoxicity 0a3D liver hollow fiber model1 aPasipanodya, Jotam G.1 aRamachandran, Geetha1 aDeshpande, Devyani1 aShuford, Stephen1 aCrosswell, Howland E.1 aCirrincione, Kayle N.1 aSherman, Carleton M.1 aSwaminathan, Soumya1 aGumbo, Tawanda0 tEBioMedicine.g2016 Apr., v. 6 p.126-138dElsevier B.V.x2352-39647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012800175300001600303520123100319592002801550596004901578650002401627650002301651650001101674650000801685650001501693650001701708650001601725650001601741650002501757650001901782650001401801650004101815650002201856650002801878650001101906650002801917650001301945650001401958650001601972650001301988651001202001653005102013653001302064653002502077653002602102700002502128700002302153700002302176700001902199773013102218856008502349852000902434655001202443IND60608277920221119212048.0180807e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060827792DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2017.14224402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawal, Oladipupo A.10aChemical Composition and Insecticidal Activity of Essential Oils of Four Varieties of Codiaeum variegatum (L.) from Nigeria  ap. 840-847.  aEssential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of the air-dried leaves of four varieties of Codiaeum variegatum were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The main constituents of C. variegatum (L.) Blume f. lobatum cv. Disraeli were caryophyllene oxide (58.2 %) and (Z)-β-farnesene (19.6 %). All the four compounds present in C. variegatum var. pictum ‘Congo’ namely linalool (39.3 %), 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (21.0 %), β-pinene (21.6 %) and α-pinene (17.9 %) were present in significant amounts.

Increasing the relative breeding value of net daily gain in the sires was associated with increased BCS in their daughters. The differences ranged between 0.02 and 0.18 points in the particular lactation periods, but they were not statistically significant. The group of cows with the highest BCS before calving showed the highest BCS decrease (–0.25 points) after calving (<I>P</I> < 0.01); the BCS loss lasted for 3 months. The analysis of the relationship between the relative breeding value of sires for net daily gain and milk yield of their daughters showed a negative effect of RBV NG ≤ 89 on the daughters’ milk yield (<I>P</I> < 0.05), while the negative differences were up to – 279.12 kg of fat-protein corrected milk. The effect of this trait on the lactation curve was also analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSimmental 3abeef production 3abody condition 3alactation 3alactation curve 3amilk 3amilk yield1 aŠtípková, M.1 aPytloun, P.1 aPytloun, J.1 aKubešová, M.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 53, no. 11 p.453-461dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/339-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014000166300001600306520128200322592002801604650002201632650002101654650002101675650001801696650002501714650001501739650002001754650002101774650001401795650002401809650001701833653002001850653000801870653000901878653001501887653001401902653001301916700001501929700001701944700001801961700001901979700005601998773009802054856008202152852000902234655001202243IND60586169120221121055548.0190913e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058616912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2017.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Weilong10aEffects of Antarctic krill docosahexaenoic acid on MCF-7 cell migration and invasion induced by the interaction of CD95 with caveolin-1  ap. 270-277.  aTumor metastasis leads to a poor prognosis in breast cancer, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) extracted from Antarctic krill is an optical isomer of common DHA and has a much stronger anti-neoplastic effect. In this work, the migration and invasion abilities of MCF-7 cells treated with low concentrations of Antarctic krill DHA were evaluated. Low concentrations of Antarctic krill DHA significantly reduced the numbers of migrating and invasive MCF-7 cells, whereas the cell numbers decreased slowly in the CD95-silenced MCF-7 cells, which implies that CD95 might be involved in cell migration and invasion. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting demonstrated that Antarctic krill DHA induced the accumulation of CD95 and caveolin-1 interaction, resulting in the down-regulation of MMP2 expression through the FAK/SRC/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, Antarctic krill DHA enhanced the interaction between CD95 and caveolin-1, which may led to an inhibitory effect on cell migration and invasion via the FAK/SRC/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our study indicates that Antarctic krill DHA has great potential for tumor therapy and has revealed a new metastatic mechanism mediated by the interaction of CD95 with caveolin-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphausia superba 3aWestern blotting 3abreast neoplasms 3acell movement 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3ametastasis 3aoptical isomers 3aprecipitin tests 3aprognosis 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 0aAntarctic krill 0aDHA 0aCD95 0aCaveolin-1 0aMigration 0aInvasion1 aLi, Jingda1 aWang, Xudong1 aYuan, Yanping1 aZhang, Jianing1 aXiu, Zhilong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1150-658X0 tLife sciences.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 192 p.270-277dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2017.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245011900162300001600281520173700297592002802034650001802062650002402080650001502104650001102119650001902130650002002149650002002169650001002189650002002199650001802219650001502237650002002252650001502272650001602287650002202303650001302325650001902338650002002357650001802377650002602395650001402421650002002435650002302455650001102478651001102489700002002500700002102520700002402541700001702565700002502582700002002607700001902627700002102646773013102667856007702798852000902875655001202884IND60594322020221117172931.0200415e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059432202DNAL7 a10.1657/AAAR0016-0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobbie, Erik A.10aStable Isotopes and Radiocarbon Assess Variable Importance of Plants and Fungi in Diets of Arctic Ground Squirrels  ap. 487-500.  aArctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii) rely primarily on dietary protein derived from plants to fuel gluconeogenesis during hibernation, yet fungal sporocarps may be an important, yet overlooked, protein source. Fungivory levels depend on sporocarp productivity, which varies with the dominant plant species and is higher on acidic than on non-acidic soils. To test whether these factors altered fungal consumption, we used stable isotopes to investigate arctic ground squirrel diets at two sites in northern Alaska, Toolik (primarily moist acidic tundra) and Atigun (primarily moist non-acidic tundra). Radiocarbon estimates can also indicate fungivory levels because ectomycorrhizal fungi assimilate soil-derived organic nitrogen whose ¹⁴C levels are higher than current photosynthesis. We measured radiocarbon in hair and δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N in hair, feces, ectomycorrhizal sporocarps, graminoids, and dicots. Feces were higher in δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N at Toolik than at Atigun, and fecal δ¹⁵N increased in August at Toolik, coincident with sporocarp production and fungal spores in feces. Mixing models indicated that graminoids contributed 64%, dicots 35%, and sporocarps 1% to Atigun hair protein, whereas graminoids contributed 37%, dicots 16%, and sporocarps 47% to Toolik hair protein. Acidic soils appeared to correlate with higher sporocarp production and fungivory at Toolik than at Atigun. Atigun hair resembled atmospheric CO2 in ¹⁴C, whereas Toolik hair had higher ¹⁴C, consistent with greater fungal consumption at Toolik. Late-season sporocarps may be a key protein source for some squirrels and may provide an integrated signal of the soil organic nitrogen assimilated by ectomycorrhizal fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnoliopsida 3aUrocitellus parryii 3aacid soils 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adietary protein 3aectomycorrhizae 3afeces 3afruiting bodies 3afungal spores 3afungivores 3agluconeogenesis 3agraminoids 3ahibernation 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein sources 3aradionuclides 3asoil organic nitrogen 3asquirrels 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 3atundra 3aAlaska1 aShamhart, Julee1 aSheriff, Michael1 aOuimette, Andrew P.1 aTrappe, Matt1 aSchuur, Edward A.

Improving the heat recovery within a pinched-network is independent of the areas of individual exchangers present in the network, rather the topology of the network must be altered. Such a change in the topology can be very capital intensive and in many cases seems not easy to implement. This research aims to overcome the Network Pinch through proposing process operation changes, avoiding network topology alterations; hence, debottlenecks the heat-integrated systems towards further energy savings beyond the maximum heat recovery limitations. A new graphical representation is recently proposed to simulate existing preheat trains/networks with all energy equipment. The recent graphical representation is employed in this work to identify the pinching matches that limit heat recovery. Therefore, such graphs are key tools to identify potential process changes by which the Network Pinch is overcome. New graphs are constructed involving hot stream temperatures against cold stream temperatures. Existing exchangers are described by straight lines, with slopes related to flows of process streams and heat capacities. Exchanger matches touching the line where hot outlet stream temperature equals cold inlet stream temperature are pinching matches; this condition corresponds to absolute maximum heat recovery (ΔT=0). Potential process changes within a distillation unit are identified to relax the Network Pinch and further heat recovery is maximised. The slope of such an exchanger match is decreased or the location of the pinching match is altered keeping the same slope. These changes are translated into process changes within the crude oil distillation unit. Accordingly, the process changes are determined based on which match is pinched besides its location within the network. An illustrative example shows that process changes overcome the Network Pinch and energy recovery is increased by 14% beyond the maximum level achieved for the existing process conditions. Capital investments imposed are minor compared with substantial energy cost savings.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acold 3acost effectiveness 3adistillation 3aeconomic investment 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenergy recovery 3aequipment 3agraphs 3aheat exchangers 3aheat recovery 3apetroleum 3atopology 3awater temperature 0aNetwork Pinch 0aEnergy efficiency 0aRetrofit 0aHeat exchanger network 0aCrude distillation unit 0aProcess integration1 aAbdelaziz, Omar Y.1 aAshour, Fatma H.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 126 p.329-341dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02112naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013700155300001600292520113600308592002801444650001201472650001701484650002001501650002701521700001401548700001501562700001501577773013401592856007501726852000901801655001201810IND60765041120221118025351.0220422e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076504112DNAL7 a10.17221/3390-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇelik, I.14aThe effects of the addition of baker&rsquo;s yeast on the functional properties and quality of tarhana, a traditional fermented food  ap. 190-195.  aAs a fermented product, tarhana is the dry form of yogurt-cereal mixture and represents an important part of the diets of many people in different countries including Turkey. In the present study, the effects of the addition of baker&rsquo;s yeast on the quality and functional properties of tarhana were investigated. Tarhana was produced under laboratory conditions (uncontrolled and controlled conditions) using two formulas. Some physicochemical, functional, and sensory properties of the samples were analysed. An increase was found in the acidity value of all samples during the fermentation period. The addition of baker&rsquo;s yeast affected the functional properties (water absorption capacity, foaming capacity, foaming stability, emulsifying activity) of the samples (P< 0.05). The tarhana samples produced by the addition of yeast and under controlled conditions had shorter fermentation times and better sensory properties. This research suggests that the addition of baker&rsquo;s yeast and the employment of controlled conditions can be recommended in the production of the commercial type of tarhana. &nbsp; &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3awater binding capacity1 aIșik, F.1 aSimsek, O.1 aGursoy, O.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 23, no. 5 p.190-195dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3390-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013500155300002000290520139400310592002801704650001201732650002201744650002601766650001701792650001501809650002501824650002101849650001701870650001701887700001801904773012301922856007402045852000902119655001202128IND60641629020221120191137.0190505e20170505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064162902DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02984e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiaona12aA novel, label-free fluorescence detection method for the formation of G-quadruplex DNA based on DNA-templated silver nanoclusters  ap. 24628-24632.  aA novel, label-free fluorescence detection method was proposed for the formation of the G-quadruplex DNAs based on placing two DNA-Ag NCs together to light-up fluorescence. Herein, we designed two tailored DNA sequences noted as target DNA (abbreviated as T-DNA) and complementary DNA (abbreviated as C-DNA), respectively. T-DNA contains two cytosine-rich sequences at the 3′- and 5′-end responsible for Ag NCs synthesis, together with the guanine-rich (G-rich) DNA sequence in the middle segment. C-DNA was designed completely complementary to the G-rich segment of the T-DNA. Provided that the middle G-rich oligonucleotide of T-DNA folds into G-quadruplex in the presence of monovalent cations, the located at 3′ and 5′ terminuses two darkish DNA-Ag NCs approximate, leading to the enhanced fluorescence signal readout. Upon addition of the C-DNA, the G-quadruplex structure is unfolded and the two DNA-Ag NCs are separated, then the fluorescence signal is quenched. On the contrary, when the G-rich oligonucleotide with mutational bases failed to form the G-quadruplex, the fluorescence signal decreased clearly. This design allowed specific and general detection of the formation of diverse G-quadruplexes with easy operation and low cost. We believed that the proposed approach laid a foundation for the researchers in bioimaging, pharmacology, diagnostics, and other fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3acomplementary DNA 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescence 3ananosilver 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligonucleotides 3apharmacology 3atransfer DNA1 aWei, Chunying0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 05, v. 7, no. 40 p.24628-24632dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02984e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245011200185300001600297520195400313592002802267650001502295650001502310650001902325650000902344650001202353650002602365650003102391650001702422650002902439650000902468650002202477650002402499650002102523650001502544650001702559650002202576650001302598653002202611653002202633653002402655653001302679700001902692700001802711773010102729856008602830852000902916655001202925IND60583827920221122194133.0171024e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058382792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Mousawi, Fadhel Noraldeen10aLow grade heat driven adsorption system for cooling and power generation using advanced adsorbent materials  ap. 373-384.  aGlobally there is abundance of low grade heat sources (around 150°C) from renewables like solar energy or from industrial waste heat. The exploitation of such low grade heat sources will reduce fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Adsorption technology offers the potential of using such low grade heat to generate cooling and power. In this work, the effect of using advanced adsorbent materials like AQSOA-Z02 (SAPO-34) zeolite and MIL101Cr Metal Organic Framework (MOF) at various operating conditions on power and cooling performance compared to that of commonly used silica-gel was investigated using water as refrigerant. A mathematical model for a two bed adsorption cooling cycle has been developed with the cycle modified to produce power by incorporating an expander between the desorber and the condenser. Results show that it is possible to produce power and cooling at the same time without affecting the cooling output. Results also show that for all adsorbents used as the heat source temperature increases, the cooling effect and power generated increase. As for increasing the cold bed temperature, this will decrease the cooling effect and power output except for SAPO-34 which shows slightly increasing trend of cooling and power output. As the condenser cooling temperature increases, the cooling effect and power output will decrease while for the chilled water temperature, the cooling load and power generated increased as the temperature increased. The maximum values of average specific power generation (SP), specific cooling power (SCP) and cycle efficiency are 73W/kgads, 681W/kgads (using SAPO-34) and 67% (using Silica-gel) respectively. However, MIL101Cr can generate SP and SCP of 95W/kgads and 1367W/kgads respectively, but this case cannot consider to be practical operating conditions, because of using relatively low cooling source temperature, but this material still offers potential of generating power.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acold 3acooling 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy use and consumption 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3aindustrial wastes 3amathematical models 3apower generation 3asilica gel 3asolar energy 3awater temperature 3azeolites 0aAdsorption system 0aCooling and power 0aAQSOA-Z02 (SAPO-34) 0aMIL101Cr1 aAl-Dadah, Raya1 aMahmoud, Saad0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 126 p.373-384dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002300173245017600196300001800372520168000390592002802070650001902098650001702117650001202134650001702146650001402163650001102177650001902188650002802207650001602235650001802251650004302269650002802312650001702340650001902357650002502376650004302401650002202444700002302466700002302489700002202512700002702534700003302561700002302594700002102617773011402638856005502752852000902807655001202816IND50064456520221119063213.0130330e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006445652DNAL7 a225829972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2012.02536.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeckett, Megan K.,10aPhotosynthetic limitations and volatile and non‐volatile isoprenoids in the poikilochlorophyllous resurrection plant Xerophyta humilis during dehydration and rehydration  ap. 2061-2074.  aWe investigated the photosynthetic limitations occurring during dehydration and rehydration of Xerophyta humilis, a poikilochlorophyllous resurrection plant, and whether volatile and non‐volatile isoprenoids might be involved in desiccation tolerance. Photosynthesis declined rapidly after dehydration below 85% relative water content (RWC). Raising intercellular CO₂ concentrations during desiccation suggest that the main photosynthetic limitation was photochemical, affecting energy‐dependent RuBP regeneration. Imaging fluorescence confirmed that both the number of photosystem II (PSII) functional reaction centres and their efficiency were impaired under progressive dehydration, and revealed the occurrence of heterogeneous photosynthesis during desiccation, being the basal leaf area more resistant to the stress. Full recovery in photosynthetic parameters occurred on rehydration, confirming that photosynthetic limitations were fully reversible and that no permanent damage occurred. During desiccation, zeaxanthin and lutein increased only when photosynthesis had ceased, implying that these isoprenoids do not directly scavenge reactive oxygen species, but rather protect photosynthetic membranes from damage and consequent denaturation. X. humilis was found to emit isoprene, a volatile isoprenoid that acts as a membrane strengthener in plants. Isoprene emission was stimulated by drought and peaked at 80% RWC. We surmise that isoprene and non‐volatile isoprenoids cooperate in reducing membrane damage in X. humilis, isoprene being effective when desiccation is moderate while non‐volatile isoprenoids operate when water deficit is more extreme.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adenaturation 3adrought 3afluorescence 3aleaf area 3alutein 3aphotosystem II 3areactive oxygen species 3arehydration 3awater content 2aMagnoliopsidaxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aFluorescence 2aPhotosynthesis 2aTerpenesxmetabolism 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxmetabolism 2aWaterxmetabolism1 aLoreto, Francesco,1 aVelikova, Violeta,1 aBRUNETTI, CECILIA1 aDI FERDINANDO, MARTINA1 aTattini, M.q(Massimiliano),1 aCALFAPIETRA, CARLO1 aFARRANT, JILL M.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2012 Dec., v. 35, no. 12 p.2061-2074dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2012.02536.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009200166520137300258592002801631650000901659650002501668650001801693650001601711650001401727650001401741650002401755650002201779651001001801653002501811653002201836653001301858653002801871653001601899700001201915700001901927700005601946773009402002856008402096852000902180655001202189IND60787414620221119125546.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078741462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1132032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Tingru14aThe impact of city gas on income inequality in China: A regional heterogeneity analysis  aCity gas plays a significant role in reducing pollution, facilitating life, and promoting economic development. In this study, the fixed effects panel regression model based on data for 30 provinces in China, covering 2005–2018, is employed to investigate the interrelationship between city gas and income inequality. Primarily, the impact of gas penetration, gas supply, gas users, and gas pipelines on income inequality in terms of three types of city gas (i.e., coal gas, liquified petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas) is discussed. Then, a heterogeneity analysis of the influence of city gas consumption on income inequality is conducted based on the spatial distribution, economic development, and proportion of gas access. According to the empirical results, the total gas penetration increases while the gas penetration rate plunges. For different types of city gas, the impact of coal gas and natural gas consumption on income inequality is significantly negative. In other words, expanding natural gas consumption can effectively narrow income inequality. Furthermore, the impact of LPG consumption on income inequality is positive. In addition, improvement in the economic level coming from city gas can narrow income inequality. In conclusion, several policy implications for promoting natural gas development and narrowing income inequality are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aeconomic development 3aenergy policy 3anatural gas 3apetroleum 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3asocial inequality 3aChina 0aCity gas consumption 0aIncome inequality 0aCoal gas 0aLiquified petroleum gas 0aNatural gas1 aLi, Hui1 aZhang, Lingyue1 aChen, Tianqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9255-08210 tEnergy policy.g2022 Oct., v. 169 p.113203-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1132033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245010600215300001600321500001500337520174800352592002802100650001002128650001702138650001702155650001502172650002102187650001202208650002502220650001102245650001002256650002402266650002202290650002902312650002102341651002102362653002102383653002202404653001602426653002502442653001502467653002202482700002102504773011602525856008502641852000902726655001202735IND60526224920221120192937.0190403e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052622492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2016.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeegalapalli, Karthik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1560-471510aField to a forest: Patterns of forest recovery following shifting cultivation in the Eastern Himalaya  ap. 173-182.  a2019-12-06  aThe patterns of vegetation recovery in shifting cultivation landscapes that undergo a cycle of clearing, cultivation and forest regeneration are not well understood in Asian tropical forests. We determined forest recovery patterns by comparing species composition, richness and forest structure in early and late fallows formed following shifting cultivation and in an uncut forest site in a mid-elevation subtropical forest in the Indian Eastern Himalaya. We also examined changes in functional traits of tree species to understand recovery processes with succession. Tree species richness in the 12, 25 and 50-year old sites was 37%, 54% and 82% the value of the richness in uncut forest, respectively, while basal area was 33%, 25% and 41% of the value in uncut forest, respectively. Species composition recovery, however, was low; with even the oldest fallow (50-year fallow) being less than 50% similar to uncut forest in terms of composition. Successional sites that recover over long periods may differ compositionally from uncut forest within a shifting cultivation landscape as these forests are often prone to other anthropogenic disturbances. Functional trait analysis revealed that early fallows were colonized by tree species that are animal-dispersed, insect-pollinated with small fruits and seeds, whereas uncut forest and late successional forests were dominated by species that were tall, self-dispersed, wind-pollinated and of high wood density that are dominant mature forest species in the Himalaya. These results are in contrast with the patterns in functional traits of tree species in successional sites from the Neotropics. This points to the importance of site-specificity in succession following shifting cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseeds 3asmall fruits 3awood density 3alandscapes 3atropical forests 3atropics 3ashifting cultivation 3afallow 3atrees 3aforest regeneration 3aspecies diversity 3aanthropogenic activities 3astand basal area 3aHimalayan region 0aNorth-east India 0aFunctional traits 0aUpper Siang 0aSecondary succession 0abasal area 0aArunachal Pradesh1 aDatta, Aparajita0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 364 p.173-182dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2016.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012500173300001600298520194100314592002802255650001502283650002002298650002502318650001502343650001302358650002202371650002302393650001102416650002102427650002602448650001002474653001902484653001502503653001302518653001702531653002002548653002102568700003302589700002202622700002702644773011802671856008802789852000902877655001202886IND60562470120221121231157.0190328e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056247012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Bruno A.10aUrinary concentrations of 25 phthalate metabolites in Brazilian children and their association with oxidative DNA damage  ap. 152-162.  aExposure of humans to phthalates has received considerable attention due to the ubiquitous occurrence and potential adverse health effects of these chemicals. Nevertheless, little is known about the exposure of the Brazilian population to phthalates. In this study, concentrations of 25 phthalate metabolites were determined in urine samples collected from 300 Brazilian children (6–14years old). Further, the association between urinary phthalate concentrations and a biomarker of oxidative stress, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8OHDG), was examined. Overall, eleven phthalate metabolites were found in at least 95% of the samples analyzed. The highest median concentrations were found for monoethyl phthalate (mEP; 57.3ngmL−1), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (mECPP; 52.8ngmL−1), mono-isobutyl phthalate (mIBP; 43.8ngmL−1), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (mBP; 42.4ngmL−1). The secondary metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and mEP, mIBP, and mBP were the most abundant compounds, accounting for >90% of the total concentrations. On the basis of the measured concentrations of urinary phthalate metabolites, we estimated daily intakes of the parent phthalates, which were 0.3, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, and 7.2μg/kg-bw/day for dimethyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, and DEHP, respectively. Approximately one-quarter of the Brazilian children had a hazard index of >1 for phthalate exposures. Statistically significant positive associations were found between 8OHDG and the concentration of the sum of phthalate metabolites, sum of DEHP metabolites, mEP, mIBP, mBP, monomethyl phthalate, mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate, monocarboxyoctyl phthalate, monocarboxynonyl phthalate, monoisopentyl phthalate, and mono-n-propyl phthalate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the exposure of a Brazilian population to phthalates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aadverse effects 3aaverage daily intake 3abiomarkers 3achildren 3adibutyl phthalate 3adimethyl phthalate 3ahumans 3aoxidative stress 3asecondary metabolites 3aurine 0aHuman exposure 0aPhthalates 0aChildren 0aDaily intake 0aRisk assessment 0aOxidative stress1 aAsimakopoulos, Alexandros G.1 aBarbosa, Fernando1 aKannan, Kurunthachalam0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 May 15, v. 586 p.152-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245008300176500001900259520208300278592002802361650002202389650001202411650001202423650001602435650002402451650001102475650001802486650002102504650001902525650002402544650001902568650001102587650002302598650002102621650001302642650001002655651001002665700001602675700002302691700005502714773009102769856009002860852000902950655001202959IND60741022120221121100542.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074102212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhowmick, Tanaya10aAssessing the effect of herbicide diuron on river biofilm: A statistical model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRiver biofilm communities are the first ones to be exposed to all toxic discharges received via run off from agricultural fields. Hence, changes in river biofilm community structure and growth pattern are considered as indicator of overall health of lotic ecosystem. Toxicants have effect on biofilm biomass, photosynthetic efficiency and chlorophyll a concentrations. Mathematical models may be applied to estimate the overall vigor of riverine ecosystems considering biofilms as indicators. Herein, previous empirical data of Ricart et al. (2009) on long term effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of diuron on biofilm communities of the River Llobregat, Spain was considered as our model inputs. Our objective is to understand the influence of diuron, chlorophyll a concentrations and photosynthetic efficiency on biovolume using a statistical model. The non-linear relationships between biovolume (dependent variable) and diuron, chlorophyll a concentrations and photosynthetic efficiency (independent variables) were represented by constructing three separate basis functions based on day 8 empirical data. Biovolume, due to nonlinear influence as yielded by the basis functions were used in a multiple linear regression model to estimate the net biovolume. Model validation was done based on day 29 empirical data. The experimentally determined biovolume and our model estimated biovolume showed similar trends. Also, diuron and photosynthetic efficiency had significant (p < 0.05) influence on biovolume. Since, the predominance of diatoms as biofilms within periphytic layers is very common in lotic systems, estimation of changes in diatom biovolume will be significant to assess the effect of herbicides. Diatom biovolume of any day (for example day 22) mentioned in the experimental study may be determined by this model, without the requirement of tedious manual biovolume calculation. Our model will be useful in numerous other studies undertaken on the toxic effect of pollutants on biofilms to quickly and accurately estimate the biofilm biovolume.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acommunity structure 3adiuron 3alotic systems 3amodel validation 3aphotosynthesis 3aregression analysis 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3astatistical models 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3avigor 3aSpain1 aSen, Goutam1 aMukherjee, Joydeep1 aDas, Reshmi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1729-89370 tChemosphere.g2021 Nov., v. 282 p.131104-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245018800196300001600384500002000400520151600420592002801936596013201964650002502096650001402121650001102135650002402146650000902170650002602179650001502205650003302220650002102253650001402274650001402288650001402302650002502316650003702341650001302378700002002391700002602411700001502437700002202452700005902474700006002533773012402593856007402717852000902791655001202800IND60777002920221120165947.0220512e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077700292DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.136012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Shreesha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6576-049510aGenotyping and phenotyping of Lactococcus garvieae isolates from fish by pulse‐field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and electron microscopy indicate geographical and capsular variations  ap. 771-781.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLactococcus garvieae is the etiological agent of Lactococcosis, an evolving disease affecting many fish species and causing significant economic losses worldwide. Assessing pathogen relatedness and bacterial population structure is critical for determining the epidemiology of L. garvieae infections and in establishing effective pathogen management methods. The previously published morphological and genetic studies point to a clonal population structure, as seen in other fish bacteria. In the present study, the pulsed‐field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method was utilized to define a population of 41 Taiwanese isolates from outbreaks with comparisons to four well‐characterized non‐Taiwanese isolates previously published. Two restriction enzymes (ApaI and SmaI) were utilized individually for PFGE analysis (cut‐off value = 90.0%), revealing genetic heterogeneity across L. garvieae isolates, with ApaI and SmaI yielding 12 and seven distinct PFGE band patterns, respectively. The phylogenic analysis using internal transcribed spacer region clustered all L. garvieae isolates in the same clad. Furthermore, the electron microscopic results confirmed the absence of capsular gene cluster (CGC) in previously characterized Taiwanese vaccine strain (S3) from grey mullet. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of analysing the morphological and genetic diversity in L. garvieae being correlated for proper taxonomic classification in vaccine strain selection and epidemiological studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a(104AS‐16.3.1‐ST‐a5)cThis research was financially supported by a grant from the Council of Agriculture, Taiwan (R.O.C.) 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aMugilidae 3aclones 3aelectron microscopy 3afish 3agenetic heterogeneity 3agenotyping 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amultigene family 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3avaccines1 aChen, Mei‐Yun1 aSudpraseart, Chiranan1 aLin, Peiry1 aYoshida, Terutoyo1 aWang, Pei‐Chi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7986-16251 aChen, Shih‐Chu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2885-93700 tJournal of fish diseases.g2022 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.771-781dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.136013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245014200172500001900314520170000333592002802033650001202061650001102073650001902084650002102103650003402124650003302158650000902191650001902200651001502219651001102234651001002245651001002255651001002265651001302275653002402288653001002312653001802322653002402340653002402364700001902388700001202407700005802419700001602477700001502493700001802508773009102526856009002617852000902707655001202716IND60741022220221121100550.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074102222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Mengke10aPerfluoroalkyl substances in precipitation from the Tibetan Plateau during monsoon season: Concentrations, source regions and mass fluxes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAtmospheric wet deposition is an important process for the occurrence of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in polar/remote mountain regions; however, there are limited data on PFASs in precipitation from the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Precipitation (rain from May to October 2017) was therefore collected across the TP to investigate the concentrations, composition profiles, sources, and fluxes of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs). The average ∑PFAA concentrations ranged from 212.3 pg L⁻¹ to 547.7 pg L⁻¹, and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) accounted for 87% of the measured PFAAs (mean value). Significant positive associations (p < 0.05) were found for most PFCAs in the southeast TP, indicating that they may come from similar sources. The monthly PFAA deposition flux ranged from 12.6 to 68.9 ng m⁻² month⁻¹, decreasing from east to west. As climate of the eastern TP is controlled mainly by the Indian monsoon, indicating that the Indian monsoon plays an important role in delivering PFAAs to the TP. PCA (principal component analysis) combined with back-trajectory analysis was used to estimate the atmospheric transport pathways, and the PSCF (potential source contribution function) model was applied to define the potential source regions of individual PFAAs. The results suggested that northeast India, Bangladesh, and southern Nepal are the potential sources of C4–C7 PFCAs; C8–C10 PFCAs are more influenced by emissions from southern Nepal and Bhutan; while the source regions of long-chain PFCAs (C11–C12) can be attributed to northern India and Pakistan. Specifically, PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) has a local contribution from the central TP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aprincipal component analysis 3arain 3awet deposition 3aBangladesh 3aBhutan 3aChina 3aIndia 3aNepal 3aPakistan 0aEmerging pollutants 0aPFAAs 0aPrecipitation 0aThe Tibetan plateau 0aWet deposition flux1 aWang, Chuanfei1 aGao, Ke1 aWang, Xiaoping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7524-75401 aFu, Jianjie1 aGong, Ping1 aWang, Yongjie0 tChemosphere.g2021 Nov., v. 282 p.131105-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003800150245014100188300001800329520131100347592002801658650002101686650001001707650001601717650001701733650001601750650002101766650001101787650001901798650001801817650001201835650002701847650003301874650001401907650001101921653002301932653001801955653002501973653001401998653001802012700005902030700002402089700002202113773013702135856008502272852000902357655001202366IND60612412520221122020650.0190416e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061241252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2016.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Rodríguez, Victoria E.14aThe F-actin capping protein is required for hyphal growth and full virulence but is dispensable for septum formation in Botrytis cinerea  ap. 1225-1235.  aFilamentous (F-) actin is an integral part of the cytoskeleton allowing for cell growth, intracellular motility, and cytokinesis of eukaryotic cells. Its assembly from G-actin monomers and its disassembly are tightly regulated processes involving a number of actin-binding proteins (ABPs) such as F-actin nucleators and cross-linking proteins. F-actin capping protein (CP) is an alpha/beta heterodimer known from yeast and higher eukaryotes to bind to the fast growing ends of the actin filaments stabilizing them. In this study, we identified the orthologs of the two CP subunits, named BcCPA1 and BcCPB1, in the plant pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea and showed that the two proteins physically interact in a yeast two-hybrid approach. GFP-BcCPA1 fusion proteins were functional and localized to the assumed sites of F-actin accumulation, i.e. to the hyphal tips and the sites of actin ring formation. Deletion of bccpa1 had a profound effect on hyphal growth, morphogenesis, and virulence indicating the importance of F-actin capping for an intact actin cytoskeleton. As polarized growth – unlike septum formation – is impaired in the mutants, it can be concluded that the organization and/or localization of actin patches and cables are disturbed rather than the functionality of the actin rings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aactin 3acell growth 3acrosslinking 3acytokinesis 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahyphae 3amicrofilaments 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3avirulence 3ayeasts 0aActin cytoskeleton 0aCell polarity 0aConidial germination 0aInfection 0aMorphogenesis1 aGarrido, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9150-61191 aCantoral, Jesús M.1 aSchumacher, Julia0 tFungal biology.g2016 Oct., v. 120, no. 10 p.1225-1235dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2016.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245005600166520159400222592002801816650001501844650001901859650001501878650001601893650002901909650001501938650001601953650001301969650002501982650001002007650001002017650001802027650001902045650001302064653002502077653003102102653003202133700001602165700001402181700001102195700001802206773009602224856008702320852000902407655001202416IND60730128320221120165058.0220606e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073012832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1080252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Jie10aCompact supervisory system for cold chain logistics  aIn this paper, a compact supervisory system for cold chain logistics organisers is designed to track refrigerated transportation and detect improper practices only with temperature data. First, to simulate the trailer of a refrigerated vehicle, a box-like testbed is built. Second, a completed transportation task of a refrigerated vehicle is categorised into four modes according to the guidance for industry. And a compact supervisory system with four types of corresponding supervisory modules is designed to identify the current mode and detect improper practices with temperature data, the situations of the door, and the refrigeration system of the trailer. Third, a correlation matrix of the temperature and the door state data obtained from the testbed is derived. In light of the correlation matrix, data are rearranged into seven groups. Then such seven groups are used as the features of interest to classify the state of the door and the state of the refrigeration system by supervised machine learning models, such as decision tree, SVM, weighted k-NN algorithm, and ensemble method. After comparisons of their estimation performances, the optimal feature groups, and the optimal classification models of door state classification and refrigeration system state classification are selected. It means that the door and the refrigeration system states required by the compact supervisory system could be estimated by internal temperature data of the refrigerated trailer. Lastly, the validity of the proposed supervisory system is investigated with a light refrigerated vehicle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclassification 3acold chain 3acorrelation 3adecision support systems 3aestimation 3afood safety 3aindustry 3ainternal temperature 3alight 3apaper 3arefrigeration 3atransportation 3avalidity 0aCold chain logistics 0aCompact supervisory system 0aSupervised machine learning1 aZou, Yifeng1 aXie, Ruhe1 aTu, Bo1 aLiu, Guanghai0 tFood control.g2021 Aug., v. 126 p.108025-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1080253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04873naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100011100188245021600299300001200515506007600527520254200603592002803145596005403173506003703227650002203264650002103286650002603307650002403333650001203357650000903369650002503378650002603403650002903429650002803458650001503486650002303501650002503524650001603549650001703565650001803582650001003600650001103610650003203621650002603653650001803679650001103697650002403708650002103732650001303753650003703766650001903803650001303822650001503835650002503850650001703875651001703892700002803909700002803937773013103965856008204096852000904178655001204187IND60624053320221207113634.0191108e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062405332DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-018-2378-32doi7 aPMC62670262pmcid7 a304974612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoyingbe, Oluwagbemiga Sewanu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0816-0482 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0816-048210aIn vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of leaf extracts of Centella asiatica (L.)

C.A.Sm - medicinal plants used in South Africa  ap. 315.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Compounds having both anticancer and antimicrobial activity have promising therapeutic potential due to their selective cytotoxicity and their potential to reduce the occurrence of bacterial and fungal infections in immune-compromised cancer patients. In our quest to find new antimicrobial agents with potent anticancer activity, the biological potential of leaves from the three medicinal plants Centella asiatica, Warburgia salutaris and Curtisia dentata as used by Zulu traditional healers for the treatment of cancer is investigated. METHODS: Extracts were assayed for antibacterial activity using the agar well diffusion and micro plate dilution assay. In addition, minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay and rhodamine 6G intake assay were used to ascertain the antibacterial activity. The cytotoxic effects of the plant extracts were determined using tetrazolium-based colorimetric (MTT) cell proliferation assay against MCF-7, human colorectal carcinoma cells (Caco-2), A549 and HeLa cancerous cell lines. RESULTS: The acetone extracts from Waburgia salutaris revealed noteworthy anti-proliferative effect yielding IC₅₀ value of 34.15 μg/ml against MCF-7 cell line, while acetone extract from Curtisia dentata significantly (P ≤ 0.05) revealed promising IC₅₀ values of 41.55, 45.13, 57.35 and 43.24 μg/ml against A549, HeLa, CaCo-2 and MCF-7 cell lines. The extracts further revealed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against bacterial strains used in the study. An acetone extract from W. salutaris revealed the highest zone of inhibition and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 21.0 mm and 0.16 mg/ml respectively against Staphylococcus aureus. Methanol extract from W. salutaris and ethyl acetate extract from C. dentata revealed 53% inhibition of R6G inside the cell against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli respectively in a cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase assay, suggesting that the mode of action of such extracts may be through efflux pump. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the extracts had good antibacterial activity and anti-proliferative effects against selected cancerous cell lines. Given the good antibacterial activity of the extracts the plants may act as an immune booster and prevent infection in immunosuppressed cancer patients. This is further supported by the plants’ anti-proliferative potential, bacteriostatic, bactericidal properties and also their ability to block bacterial efflux pump systems.  aPublisher supplied data  a113595cNational Research Foundation South Africa0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCentella asiatica 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aWarburgia salutaris 3aacetone 3aagar 3aalternative medicine 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibacterial properties 3aantineoplastic activity 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acolorimetry 3acytotoxicity 3aethyl acetate 3afungi 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amechanism of action 3amedicinal plants 3amethanol 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3arhodamines 3atraditional medicine 3atransporters 3aSouth Africa1 aMongalo, Nkoana Ishmael1 aMakhafola, Tshepiso Jan0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.315-315dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2378-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04707naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014700171300001400318500001500332520276400347592002803111650001903139650002203158650002003180650001503200650001003215650002603225650001003251650001603261650001803277650002403295650001603319650000903335650003403344650002503378650002203403650001103425651001103436651001803447651001903465653003203484653001703516653002203533653001603555653001603571653001603587653001203603700002003615700002203635700001603657700002303673700002103696700002203717700002403739700002503763700001803788700002603806773011603832856008803948852000904036655001204045IND60560353220221121235049.0190318e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056035322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinior, Beate12aA systematic review of financial and economic assessments of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) prevention and mitigation activities worldwide  ap. 77-92.  a2019-12-06  aInfection with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) results in major economic losses either directly through decreased productive performance in cattle herds or indirectly, such as through expenses for control programs. The aim of this systematic review was to review financial and/or economic assessment studies of prevention and/or mitigation activities of BVDV at national, regional and farm level worldwide. Once all predefined criteria had been met, 35 articles were included for this systematic review. Studies were analyzed with particular focus on the type of financially and/or economically-assessed prevention and/or mitigation activities. Due to the wide range of possible prevention and/or mitigation activities, these activities were grouped into five categories: i) control and/or eradication programs, ii) monitoring or surveillance, iii) prevention, iv) vaccination and v) individual culling, control and testing strategies. Additionally, the studies were analyzed according to economically-related variables such as efficiency, costs or benefits of prevention and/or mitigation activities, the applied financial and/or economic and statistical methods, the payers of prevention and/or mitigation activities, the assessed production systems, and the countries for which such evaluations are available.Financial and/or economic assessments performed in Europe were dominated by those from the United Kingdom, which assessed mostly vaccination strategies, and Norway which primarily carried out assessments in the area of control and eradication programs; whereas among non-European countries the United States carried out the majority of financial and/or economic assessments in the area of individual culling, control and testing. More than half of all studies provided an efficiency calculation of prevention and/or mitigation activities and demonstrated whether the inherent costs of implemented activities were or were not justified. The dairy sector was three times more likely to be assessed by the countries than beef production systems. In addition, the dairy sector was approximately eight times more likely to be assessed economically with respect to prevention and/or mitigation activities than calf and youngstock production systems. Furthermore, the private sector was identified as the primary payer of prevention and/or mitigation activities.This systematic review demonstrated a lack of studies relating to efficiency calculations, in particular at national and regional level, and the specific production systems. Thus, we confirmed the need for more well-designed studies in animal health economics in order to demonstrate that the implementation and inherent costs of BVDV prevention and/or mitigation activities are justified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprivate sector 3aeconomic analysis 3ameat production 3amonitoring 3aherds 3aproduction technology 3afarms 3abeef cattle 3aanimal health 3afinancial economics 3avaccination 3abeef 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3astatistical analysis 3asystematic review 3acalves 3aNorway 3aUnited States 3aUnited Kingdom 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aSurveillance 0aEconomic analysis 0aVaccination 0aBiosecurity 0aEradication 0aControl1 aFirth, Clair L.1 aRichter, Veronika1 aLebl, Karin1 aTrauffler, Martine1 aDzieciol, Monika1 aHutter, Sabine E.1 aBurgstaller, Johann1 aObritzhauser, Walter1 aWinter, Petra1 aKäsbohrer, Annemarie0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 137 p.77-92dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012900175520147400304592002801778650002201806650002001828650001601848650001601864650001701880650001601897650001801913650001001931650000901941650001901950650001501969650001201984650001001996650002102006650001002027650001202037650001602049650001902065653001302084653001002097653001602107653009202123653002002215700003102235700006002266773009602326856008702422852000902509655001202518IND60730128420221120165015.0220606e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073012842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1080362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiannetti, Vanessa10aFurosine as marker of quality in dried durum wheat pasta: Impact of heat treatment on food quality and security – A review  aDrying is a widely used technique in food manufacturing to preserve food stability by minimizing physical and chemical changes during storage. In dried pasta production, drying is a crucial operation for the quality of the end-product. The traditional drying methods use low temperature (less than 60 °C) and long treatment times (for up to 60 h depending on the pasta shape); but on large-scale retail trade production, the high/very high temperature (75–100 °C or ≥ 100 °C) and short-time (for 10 to 3 h) drying processes are widely employed. A lot of studies prove that drastic heat treatment promotes the Maillard reaction causing changes in the final nutritional and organoleptic properties of pasta. Furosine, an amino acid derived from the acid hydrolysis of Amadori compounds formed during the early stage of the Maillard reaction, has been extensively used as a marker of the heat damage. This review aims to carry out an in-depth investigation of the scientific literature about the role of furosine as a marker of quality. Particularly, to valorise on the market durum wheat dried pasta that has not undergone to thermal stress and also to identify potential commercial fraud. Additionally, volatile compounds, formed during the advanced and final stage of Maillard reaction and responsible for several food properties, were considered due to the possibility to use them in combination with furosine for food security and food quality purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3aacid hydrolysis 3aamino acids 3adurum wheat 3afood quality 3afood safety 3afood security 3afraud 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3aliterature 3amarkets 3apasta 3aretail marketing 3ashape 3astorage 3atemperature 3athermal stress 0aFurosine 0aPasta 0aHeat damage 0aHigh/very high temperature-short time (HT/VHT-St) and low temperature-long time (LT-Lt) 0aQuality markers1 aBoccacci Mariani, Maurizio1 aColicchia, Sonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4045-32770 tFood control.g2021 July, v. 125 p.108036-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1080363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245008400175300001600259520118900275592002801464650004401492650002101536650002001557650001001577650002001587650002101607650001701628650000901645650002001654650003101674650001801705650001401723650002401737650003301761650001601794650001601810650001701826650001201843653001801855653001701873653002701890653001501917700002201932773012201954856008302076852000902159655001202168IND60625887220221120091652.0190416e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062588722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2018.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngeline Kirubha, S.P.10aEnhancement of thermal imaging by iron oxide nanoparticle – Preliminary study  ap. 352-360.  aMagnetic nanoparticles (MNP) have been developed in the recent years for various applications like cell separation, immunoassay, and drug delivery. The present study involves the synthesis of stable, biocompatible Iron oxide MNP by coprecipitation of ferric chloride and ferrous chloride with Polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a surfactant to coat the nanoparticles twice. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images confirm the formation of uniform MNPs of size 12–17 nm. The peak at 582.2 cm−1 in the Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) corresponds to the Fe–O bond and the peak at 1104.1 cm−1 corresponds to a characteristic peak of PEG binding to the iron core. Tumor tissues selectively targeted with MNPs when placed in a magnetic field increases the temperature of the tumor tissues. The phantom study shows that there is a minimum of 1.3 °C and a maximum of 6.7 °C rise in temperature with increasing concentration of the nanoparticles embedded in the phantoms; this proved the possibility of enhancement of thermal images using MNPs and its usage for thermal ablation of cancer. MNPs can also be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemical bonding 3acoprecipitation 3adrugs 3aferric chloride 3aferrous chloride 3aimmunoassays 3airon 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apolyethylene glycol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3athermography 3atissues 0aBreast cancer 0aThermography 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aIron oxide1 aRajput, Alankruti0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2019 Jan., v. 17 p.352-360dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2018.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245015200207300001600359500001900375520196600394592002802360596007202388650001302460650002502473650000902498650002602507650001802533650001602551650001502567650001302582700002002595773016102615856008202776852000902858655001202867IND60725528120221116211418.0210126e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552812DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02830-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlghamdi, A.

Their distribution in a soil system depends upon soil properties and the nature of PAH itself. Therefore, an experiment was conducted in the soil-block system to evaluate the release, transport, toxicity equivalents, and lifetime average daily dose (LADD) of different PAHs over 30 days by growing maize (Zea mays L.) plants. The soil was spiked at the rate of 500 ppb by different PAHs in soil-block systems from one side. After spiking, soil sampling was performed from four different distances {10, 20, 30, and 40 mm distance from the source (DFS)} in three intervals (5, 15, and 30 days) of time. Results depicted that the maximum diffusive mass flux (Jd) was obtained at 0–10 mm DFS after five days of sampling for all PAHs and a minimum from 30 to 40 mm DFS after 30 days of sampling. Out of all PAHs concentrations, three PAHs concentrations were in detectable range and high as compared to other PAHs. The fluoranthene was released maximum as compared to pyrene, and benzo[k]fluoranthene at all time interval samplings with and without plants. The concentration of all PAHs release was highest where plants were grown as compared to the samples obtained where no plants were grown. The growth of maize under PAHs application enhanced diffusion as compared to control (where no plants were grown). The LADD after 5 days of sampling was highest at 0–10 mm DFS as compared to 10–20 mm, 20–30 mm, and 30–40 mm DFS. Benzo[a]pyrene toxicity equivalency (BaPTEQ) data for fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo (k)fluoranthene showed a range from 0.001 to 0.299 ng m³, 0.001–0.182 ng m³ and 0.001–0.202 ng m³, respectively. It was concluded that the presence of plants in a soil enhanced the diffusive mass flux of PAHs but also increased the LADD and BaPTEQ.  aPublisher supplied data  aRGP-1440-050cDeanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University 3aZea mays 3aaverage daily intake 3acorn 3aenvironmental science 3amass transfer 3asoil blocks 3atechnology 3atoxicity1 aEL-Saeid, M.

A database from winter 2004 to summer 2011 has been analysed. Results show the dominant processes affecting the formation and evolution of nitrate (NO₃ ⁻) and sulphate (SO₄ ²⁻) in both regions. In Madrid, photochemistry dominates formation of nitrate, which is mostly locally-generated. Strong thermal decomposition results in very low concentrations in summer. In contrast, in London high nocturnal values suggest the importance of heterogeneous formation processes as well as nitrate condensation at lower temperatures. The seasonal nitrate maximum in the UK is found in late winter-early spring, when the region typically receives the highest input of pollutants transported from mainland Europe. Daily evolution of nitrate in both cities is heavily influenced by meteorological factors. Seasonal sulphate patterns show no obvious trend, except at the Spanish rural site in summer where photochemical formation was apparent. In Madrid, daily SO₂ and sulphate patterns exhibiting maximum concentrations at noon were found in winter. In previous studies this phenomenon was observed for SO₂ in London, where it was explained by the entrainment of pollutants from aloft into the mixing layer. SIC weekend reductions were investigated at the urban background sites of Madrid and London, and in both cities statistically significant fine nitrate reductions of around 20% are found in summer. These values are consistent with the annual reductions observed by researchers in the US. Weekend sulphate reductions occurred in winter, reflecting a clear impact of anthropogenic sulphate in urban environments, in spite of the large reductions in sulphur emissions in Europe in the last decade. Ratios of nitrate and sulphate to oxidant gases and to one another have been calculated for Madrid, and are consistent with a contribution of local formation to sulphate in winter, while in summer a regional background unrelated to urban SO₂ is observed. The strong differences in the behaviour seen in London and Madrid (and the rural sites) emphasises the need to study cities individually and not to extrapolate conclusions drawn in one city to others in different climate/topographic situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3asulfur dioxide 3agases 3aphotochemistry 3ameteorological parameters 3asummer 3aanthropogenic activities 3asulfur 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aaerosols 3acities 3athermal degradation 3adatabases 3aclimate 3awinter 3apollutants 3aoxidants 3aemissions 3atemperature 3amixing 3aspring 3anitrates 3aUnited States 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 3aUnited Kingdom 0acondensation1 aHarrison, R.M.1 aNúñez, L.1 aGomez-Moreno, F.J.1 aPujadas, M.1 aArtíñano, B.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 60 p.383-391dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167520153400267592002801801650002601829650002001855650002101875650001101896650001801907650001901925650001701944650002201961650001701983651001002000653002802010653002902038653003902067700001702106700002602123700002002149700006502169700001402234773009002248856008502338852000902423655001202432IND60752515020221123034239.0211206e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075251502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJingke, Hong12aA spatiotemporal analysis of energy use pathways in the construction industry: A study of China  aChina has experienced rapid urbanization across the country which has required significant energy use and has also posed a series of possible environmental risks. Given the role that the construction industry plays in China's economy and in achieving sustainability, it is paramount to trace and measure the evolutionary pathways of energy induced by China's supply chains. By using a multiregional input–output model, structural path analysis, and exploratory spatial data analysis, this study presents a spatiotemporal analysis of how upstream energy interactions change in the context of rapid urbanization and the Chinese economy. The results show there has been less embodied energy consumption of building materials over time due to significant improvements in energy intensity reduction. The upstream energy distribution exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity within clustered urban agglomerations. Regions with poor resource endowment but highly vibrant economies appear to have wider connections with the national economy, whilst the critical energy flows in resource-exporting regions were only concentrated in energy-intensive sectors. The findings of this study provide improved understanding of energy evolutionary pathways and their complexities from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Such understanding will assist policymakers, especially the local government of each province, to implement effective energy reduction strategies and fairly address the allocation of energy reduction responsibilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstruction industry 3aembodied energy 3alocal government 3amodels 3apath analysis 3aprimary energy 3aspatial data 3aspatial variation 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aSpatiotemporal analysis 0aStructural path analysis 0aMultiregional input–output model1 aChenyu, Wang1 aChang-Richards, Alice1 aJingxiao, Zhang1 aQiping, Geoffrey Shen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3111-20191 aBei, Qiao0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122084-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1220843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003400134024001200168040001800180100001800198245015400216300002000370506017300390520105500563592002801618650002101646650001201667650002501679650001701704650001801721650001501739650001301754650004101767650001601808650001701824650002401841650003301865650001201898650001401910650001401924650001101938650001101949650001201960653001201972653001401984653001701998653001302015653001102028653001102039700001902050700001702069700001502086700001502101700002302116700002202139773013502161856011402296856008102410956011802491961001302609852000902622655001202631IND60586430120221214223505.0171213e20171129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058643012DNAL7 a3448422aris7 a10113/58643012hdl7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b040372doi8 ans14235  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fengjuan10aMetabolomics Approach To Understand Mechanisms of β-N-Oxalyl-l-α,β-diaminopropionic Acid (β-ODAP) Biosynthesis in Grass Pea (Lathyrus sativus L.)  ap. 10206-10213.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA study was performed to identify metabolic processes associated with β-ODAP synthesis in grass pea using a metabolomics approach. GC–MS metabolomics was performed on seedlings at 2, 6, and 25 days after sowing. A total of 141 metabolites were detected among the three time points representing much of grass pea primary metabolism, including amino acids, carbohydrates, purines, and others. Principal component analysis revealed unique metabolite profiles of grass pea tissues among the three time points. Fold change, hierarchical clustering, and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analyses, and biochemical pathway ontologies were used to characterize covariance of metabolites with β-ODAP content. The data indicates that alanine and nitrogen metabolism, cysteine and sulfur metabolism, and purine, pyrimidine, and pyridine metabolism were associated with β-ODAP metabolism. Our results reveal the metabolite profiles in grass pea development and provide insights into mechanisms of β-ODAP accumulation and degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLathyrus sativus 3aalanine 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarbohydrates 3acovariance 3acysteine 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anitrogen metabolism 3aprincipal component analysis 3apurines 3apyridines 3aseedlings 3asowing 3asulfur 3atissues 0aβ-ODAP 0agrass pea 0ametabolomics 0anitrogen 0asulfur 0auracil1 aJiao, Chengjin1 aBi, Chunxiao1 aXu, Quanle1 aChen, Peng1 aHeuberger, Adam L.1 aKrishnan, Hari B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Nov. 29, v. 65, no. 47 p.10206-10213dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/58643013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b040373Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Grass%20pea%20Metabolomic%20JAFC%202017.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009200163300002000255520127900275592002801554650001501582650001301597650002801610650001901638650001301657650001101670650002301681650001701704650001101721700001401732700001301746700002001759700001201779700001501791700001801806773012901824856008201953852000902035655001202044IND60566130120221118120854.0170402e20151231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056613012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b105462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Junwei10aCdSeTe/CdS Type-I Core/Shell Quantum Dot Sensitized Solar Cells with Efficiency over 9%  ap. 28800-28808.  aSurface trap defects are the limited factor for quantum dots (QDs) application in solar cells. The trapping states can be efficiently suppressed by coating a shell of wider band gap material around the core QDs. We choose CdSe₀.₆₅Te₀.₃₅ (simplified as CdSeTe) as a model core material, and CdS shell was then overcoated around the CdSeTe core QD to decrease surface defect density and to increase the stability of the core QDs. By optimizing the thickness of the CdS shell, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the CdSeTe/CdS quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) is enhanced by 13% in comparison with that of plain CdSeTe QDSCs. Transient absorption (TA), incident-photo-to-carrier conversion efficiency (IPCE), open-circuit voltage decay (OVCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements confirmed the suppressed charge recombination process in internal QDs and QD/TiO₂/electrolyte interfaces with the overcoating of CdS shell around CdSeTe core QDs. With the further overcoating of a-TiO₂ and SiO₂ barrier layers around the QD-sensitized photoanode, the PCE of champion CdSeTe QDSCs achieved 9.48% (Jₛc = 20.82 mA/cm², Vₒc = 0.713 V, FF = 0.639) with average PCE 9.39 ± 0.09% under AM 1.5 G one full sun illumination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acoatings 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric power 3alighting 3amodels 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aquantum dots 3asilica1 aWang, Jin1 aZhao, Ke1 aIzuishi, Takuya1 aLi, Yan1 aShen, Qing1 aZhong, Xinhua0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Dec. 31, v. 119, no. 52 p.28800-28808dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b105463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014600167300001100313520131800324592002801642596006601670650003401736650001001770650002001780650002201800650001801822650001601840650002501856650002401881650001501905650001701920650001001937650001801947650001601965650001601981650000901997650001802006650002102024700001702045700001702062700001302079700001802092700001602110700001602126700001802142700001802160700001502178700005602193773011902249856008302368852000902451655001202460IND60725528320221116211344.0220109e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552832DNAL7 a10.1186/s13765-020-00587-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Yeong-Ju10aOptimal bioconversion for compound K production from red ginseng root (C.A.

This study aimed to establish the optimal conditions for enzyme treatment to convert ginsenosides from RG extract to CK, and to prove the characteristics of bioconverted red ginseng (BRG) extract. CK was not detected in unenzyme-treated RG extract, and in the single-step enzyme treatment, it was produced at less than 4.58 mg/g only in treatment group with Pyr-flo or Sumizyme AC (at 50 °C for 48 h). The highest yield of CK (14.32 mg/g) was obtained by Ultimase MFC treatment at 50 °C for 48 h after treatment with a mixture of Pyr-flo and Rapidase at 50 °C for 24 h. Total polyphenol, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and 2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity were higher in BRG than in RG (p < 0.5). High-fat diet (HD) rat fed 1% BRG had significantly lower body weight, heart weight, fat pads (periosteal fat, epididymal fat), serum glucose levels, and hepatic triglyceride levels than those HD rat fed 1% RG (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the sequential enzymatic bioconversion was produces higher CK in RG root extract than single-step enzyme treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  agrant number P0010311cMinistry of Trade, Industry and Energy 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPanax 3abioavailability 3abiotransformation 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymatic treatment 3aepididymis 3aginsenosides 3aheart 3ahigh fat diet 3ametabolites 3apolyphenols 3arats 3aroot extracts 3atriacylglycerols1 aHwang, Unsik1 aPark, Suyeon1 aSim, Sol1 aJeong, Soyeon1 aPark, Misun1 aKang, Minji1 aLee, Youngsoo1 aSong, Youngju1 aPark, Hoon1 aSuh, Hee-Jae1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0631-32700 tApplied biological chemistry.g2021 Dec., v. 64, no. 1 p.14-14dSpringer SingaporewJournal:27084x2468-08347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-020-00587-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245021500173300001800388520132900406592002801735650001401763650001901777650001601796650002901812650002401841650001001865650001501875650001001890650001301900650002301913650002801936650003301964650001501997650001402012650001402026650001202040650002202052651001002074653002002084653002802104653001002132653002002142653001902162653003102181700002302212700001702235700002602252773013702278856008502415852000902500655001202509IND60612412920221122073621.0190416e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061241292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2016.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWani, Zahoor Ahmed10aMolecular phylogeny, diversity, community structure, and plant growth promoting properties of fungal endophytes associated with the corms of saffron plant: An insight into the microbiome of Crocus sativus Linn.  ap. 1509-1524.  aA total of 294 fungal endophytes were isolated from the corms of Crocus sativus at two stages of crocus life cycle collected from 14 different saffron growing sites in Jammu and Kashmir (J & K) State, India. Molecular phylogeny assigned them into 36 distinct internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genotypes which spread over 19 genera. The diversity of endophytes was higher at the dormant than at the vegetative stage. The Saffron microbiome was dominated by Phialophora mustea and Cadophora malorum, both are dark septate endophytes (DSEs). Some endophytes were found to possess antimicrobial properties that could be helpful for the host in evading the pathogens. These endophytes generally produced significant quantities of indole acetic acid (IAA) as well. However, thirteen of the endophytic taxa were found to cause corm rot in the host with different levels of severity under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions. This is the first report of community structure and biological properties of fungal endophytes associated with C. sativus, which may eventually help us to develop agro-technologies, based on plant–endophyte interactions for sustainable cultivation of saffron. The endophytes preserved ex situ, in this study, may also yield bioactive natural products for pharmacological and industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCadophora 3aCrocus sativus 3aPhialophora 3aantimicrobial properties 3acommunity structure 3acorms 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agenotype 3aindole acetic acid 3aindustrial applications 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrobiome 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3asaffron 3avegetative growth 3aIndia 0aCrocus corm rot 0aDark septate endophytes 0aFungi 0aKashmir saffron 0aPhytopathogens 0aPlant microbe interactions1 aMirza, Dania Nazir1 aArora, Palak1 aRiyaz-Ul-Hassan, Syed0 tFungal biology.g2016 Dec., v. 120, no. 12 p.1509-1524dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2016.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009300161300002000254500001900274520119800293592002801491650001101519650001301530650002501543653003401568653001401602653003601616653002201652653002501674700001401699700001901713700005601732700005301788773014201841856007801983852000902061655001202070IND60731152120221120151923.0210317e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073115212DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c029132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuanyuan10aTime-Resolved Observation of Hole Tunneling in van der Waals Multilayer Heterostructures  ap. 12425-12431.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe reported a time-resolved study of quantum-mechanical tunneling of holes between two MoSe₂ monolayers that are separated by a monolayer WS₂ energy barrier. Four-layer heterostructures of MoSe₂/WS₂/MoSe₂/graphene, as well as control samples, were fabricated by mechanical exfoliation and dry transfer techniques. To time-resolve the hole tunneling process, an ultrashort laser pulse was used to excite electrons and holes in both MoSe₂ layers. By utilization of the graphene layer to eliminate carriers in the third MoSe₂ layer, the first MoSe₂ layer is selectively populated with the holes, which then tunnel to the third MoSe₂ layer. By monitoring decay of the hole population with an ultrashort probe pulse, we measure a hole tunneling time of about 20 ps, which is found to slightly increase with the injected carrier density. Besides the fundamental interests of real-time observation of the quantum-mechanical tunneling effect across a nanometer barrier, these results provide quantitative understanding on tunneling mechanisms of charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures, which is useful for designing sophisticated van der Waals multilayer heterostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3agraphene 3avan der Waals forces 0avan der Waals heterostructure 0atunneling 0atransition metal dichalcogenide 0aelectron transfer 0atransient absorption1 aZhang, Lu1 aChang, Jianhua1 aCui, Qiannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2675-06891 aZhao, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4552-38360 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 13, no. 10 p.12425-12431dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c029133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245007800175500001900253520161100272592002801883650002101911650001501932650001501947650001201962650001901974650001301993650001702006650002202023650002502045653002202070653001602092700005802108700005902166700006002225700002902285773009102314856009002405852000902495655001202504IND60741022720221122115833.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074102272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbuelnoor, Nada10aActivated carbons from biomass-based sources for CO2 capture applications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn an ever-growing attempt to reduce the excessive anthropogenic CO₂ emissions, several CO₂ capture technologies have been developed in recent years. Adsorption using solid carbonaceous materials is one of the many promising examples of these technologies. Carbon-based materials, notably activated carbons, are considered very attractive adsorbents for this purpose given their exceptional thermal stability and excellent adsorption capacities. More importantly, the ability to obtain activated carbons from agricultural wastes and other biomass that are readily available makes them good candidates for several industrial applications ranging from wastewater treatment to CO₂ adsorption, among others. Activated carbons from biomass can be prepared using various techniques, resulting in a range of textual properties. They can also be functionalized by adding nitrogen-based groups to their structure that facilitates faster and more efficient CO₂ capture. This review provides a detailed overview of the recent work reported in this field, highlighting the different preparation methods and their differences and effects on the textual properties such as pore size, surface area, and adsorption performance in terms of the CO₂ adsorption capacity and isosteric heats. The prospect of activated carbon functionalization and its effect on CO₂ capture performance is also included. Finally, the review covers some of the pilot-plant scale processes in which these materials have been tested. Some identified gaps in the field have been highlighted, leading to the perspectives for future work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aporosity 3asurface area 3athermal stability 3awastewater treatment 0aActivated carbons 0aCO2 capture1 aAlHajaj, Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7494-83181 aKhaleel, Maryam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4343-03641 aVega, Lourdes F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7609-41841 aAbu-Zahra, Mohammad R.M.0 tChemosphere.g2021 Nov., v. 282 p.131111-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012500155300001600280500002000296520201700316592002802333596005902361650002502420650002002445650002102465650002002486650000902506650003102515650001002546650001002556650001402566650002002580650002202600700001802622700002002640700001502660700001802675773012402693856007402817852000902891655001202900IND60777003420221120165746.0220512e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077700342DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.136162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Zhou10aEffect of secondary attack by Aeromonas hydrophila on the expression level of hif genes in common carp (Cyprinus carpio)  ap. 907-917.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHypoxia‐inducible factors (hifs) are involved in infectious diseases inflammatory reactions, and immune regulation. Common carp, a representative allotetraploid species that has undergone genome‐wide replication events, has important research value. In this study, common carp were infected twice with Aeromonas hydrophila. Liver tissues of common carp were collected at 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 3 days, 7 days post‐first infection and 4 h, 12 h, 24 h post‐second infection. The mRNA levels of hif genes were determined at different time points. The hif2a‐2, hif3a‐2, hif3b‐1 and hif3b‐2 expression levels in the infected group were upregulated when compared with those in the control group, whereas the expression levels of other genes were downregulated after the second infection. This indicates that the effect of A. hydrophila infection on gene expression pattern is dependent on the host, pathogen, infected tissue and gene. Pressure analysis of the hif gene family revealed that the non‐synonymous substitution to synonymous substitution ratio of 12 hif genes was <1, which indicated that they were in a state of purification and selection. Combined with the differences between copy genes, the polyclonal antibodies against Hif1b‐1 and Hif1b‐2 were successfully prepared in this study. Western blot analysis showed that the protein expression of Hif1b‐1 and Hif1b‐2 reached to the highest level 48 h after the first infection. After the second A. hydrophila infection, the protein expression levels of Hif1b‐1 and Hif1b‐2 reached the highest levels at 4 and 48 h, respectively. This may indicate that the Hif1b‐1 and Hif1b‐2 genes in common carp play an important role in the immune mechanism at the protein level. The findings of this study will lay the foundation for future studies on the immune regulatory function of common carp hif genes, which may aid in devising novel therapeutic strategies for common carp diseases, such as A. hydrophila infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801032cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aCyprinus carpio 3aWestern blotting 3aallotetraploidy 3afish 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aliver 3apathogens 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis1 aJia, Yingying1 aZhang, Jiangfan1 aLi, Xuejun1 aDong, Chuanju0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2022 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.907-917dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.136163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009600166300001600262520112200278592002801400650001501428650001401443650001601457650002001473650001501493700001901508700002001527700002401547700002101571700002001592700003401612773009901646856008101745852000901826655001201835IND60085732920221120065344.0141101e20111114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008573292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.08.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreau, Thomas10aAntibody-based surfaces: Rapid characterization using two complementary colorimetric assays  ap. 354-360.  aFinding a general solution for optimizing the grafting of antibody on solid surfaces is difficult due to the variety of material, grafting principles and chemistries or surface formats available (beads, microplates, fibers, etc.). Pre-screening methods able to assess grafting efficiency (GE) and specific activity (SA) are required. In this context, we present here two colorimetric assays that can be used on a wide variety of surface format, chemistry, etc. The first one, ADECA (Amino Density Estimation by Colorimetric Assay) allows a rapid estimation of grafted antibodies and allows calculating the GE. The second one, A₂HRP (Antibody Anti-HorseRadish Peroxidase) provides a measure of the amount of active antibody, which, combined to ADECA, is used to determine the SA of grafted antibody. Analytical parameters (limit of detection, repeatability, linearity, etc.) of these two colorimetric assays are presented. Using two commercially available microplates, we demonstrated that, when used in parallel, these rapid and sensitive methods are well adapted to pre-screening of antibody grafting performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3achemistry 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aperoxidase1 aFaye, Clément1 aBaqué, Mickael1 aDesvignes, Isabelle1 aCoussot, Gaëlle1 aRobert, Pascal,1 aVandenabeele-Trambouze, Odile0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 Nov. 14, v. 706, no. 2 p.354-360dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.08.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012500165520130300290592002801593650000801621650001801629650002801647650001901675653002401694653004301718653001301761653004901774700001901823700005501842700001801897700001501915773009001930856008502020852000902105655001202114IND60752515320221120185040.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075251532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1221112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yubin10aExploration on two-stage latent thermal energy storage for heat recovery in cryogenic air separation purification system  aMassive heat in the exhaust air of cryogenic air separation purification system is wasted in conventional systems. Its intermittent and dynamic characteristics are major constraints to achieve heat recovery. Cascaded latent thermal energy storage (LTES) is considered as a promising solution, but actual application is rarely reported. This paper initially investigates a two-stage LTES tank which is incorporated with a pilot plant of cryogenic air separation purification system, and a test under a real operation condition is performed. The tank contains five heat storage units in high-temperature stage and five units in low-temperature stage, which are loaded with commercial paraffin of melting temperatures 70 °C and 48 °C, respectively. Moreover, heat pipes combined with vertical fins are assembled to increase the heat transfer rate. Results show that 51369.5 kJ heat is saved in a charging-discharging cycle by introducing LTES tank to air separation system. 64.7% of waste heat in the exhaust air could be recovered based on waste heat criterion of 40 °C. Also worth noting that payback period of LTES tank is 2.3 years, and 25784.3 kg CO₂ emission is reduced per year. The LTES demonstrates good performance when compared with other reported LTES for industrial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aheat recovery 3aindustrial applications 3athermal energy 0aWaste heat recovery 0aCascaded latent thermal energy storage 0aParaffin 0aCryogenic air separation purification system1 aZhang, Chunwei1 aJiang, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0387-629X1 aZhang, Xuejun1 aQiu, Limin0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122111-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1221113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245014300162300001800305500001900323520179000342592002802132650001602160650002202176650001302198650001902211650001202230650001302242650001202255700006502267700003002332700002002362700002402382700006002406700005902466700005802525773014702583856007602730852000902806655001202815IND60731152420221120222334.0210317e20210308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073115242DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c097992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtet, Paula C.10aRecapitulating the Binding Affinity of Nrf2 for KEAP1 in a Cyclic Heptapeptide, Guided by NMR, X-ray Crystallography, and Machine Learning  ap. 3779-3793.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMacrocycles, including macrocyclic peptides, have shown promise for targeting challenging protein–protein interactions (PPIs). One PPI of high interest is between Kelch-like ECH-Associated Protein-1 (KEAP1) and Nuclear Factor (Erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). Guided by X-ray crystallography, NMR, modeling, and machine learning, we show that the full 20 nM binding affinity of Nrf2 for KEAP1 can be recapitulated in a cyclic 7-mer peptide, c[(D)-β-homoAla-DPETGE]. This compound was identified from the Nrf2-derived linear peptide GDEETGE (KD = 4.3 μM) solely by optimizing the conformation of the cyclic compound, without changing any KEAP1 interacting residue. X-ray crystal structures were determined for each linear and cyclic peptide variant bound to KEAP1. Despite large variations in affinity, no obvious differences in the conformation of the peptide binding residues or in the interactions they made with KEAP1 were observed. However, analysis of the X-ray structures by machine learning showed that locations of strain in the bound ligand could be identified through patterns of subangstrom distortions from the geometry observed for unstrained linear peptides. We show that optimizing the cyclic peptide affinity was driven partly through conformational preorganization associated with a proline substitution at position 78 and with the geometry of the noninteracting residue Asp77 and partly by decreasing strain in the ETGE motif itself. This approach may have utility in dissecting the trade-off between conformational preorganization and strain in other ligand–receptor systems. We also identify a pair of conserved hydrophobic residues flanking the core DxETGE motif which play a conformational role in facilitating the high-affinity binding of Nrf2 to KEAP1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3ageometry 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3apeptides 3aproline1 aMuellers, Samantha N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9233-97431 aViarengo-Baker, Lauren A.1 aStreu, Kristina1 aSzymczyna, Blair R.1 aBeeler, Aaron B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2447-06511 aAllen, Karen N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7296-05511 aWhitty, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0331-43690 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Mar. 08, v. 143, no. 10 p.3779-3793dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c097993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245009600170300001600266520084400282592002801126650002201154650002401176650001501200650001001215700001901225700001801244700001601262773007501278856008901353990002301442852000901465655001201474IND60096049720221119093044.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009604972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoroni, F.12aA numerical investigation on the interlaminar strength of nanomodified composite interfaces  ap. 635-641.  aThe effect of Nylon 6,6 electrospun nanofibers interleaved in composite laminate material is simulated numerically to investigate the differences in the fracture strength between a nanomodified laminate interface and the corresponding non-modified material.

After berries are picked, a washing step can reduce microbial counts on fruit surfaces to increase their safety. This study compared the effectiveness of tap water, commercial solutions of fruit and vegetable sanitizer composed of peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (PAA) and neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water (NEW) for washing fresh blueberries that had been inoculated with either murine norovirus (MNV-1), bacteriophage MS2, bovine rotavirus (boRV) or hepatitis A virus (HAV). Initially, inactivation levels were measured after blueberries were washed for 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 min. Subsequently, the effect of combining up to three sequential 1-min washes was evaluated. Washes with water lasting up to 20 min reduced MNV-1, MS2 and HAV populations by 1–2 log₁₀ (PFU) and boRV by less than 4 log₁₀. Increasing washing time did not have a significant effect, except where NEW washes were increased by up to 3 min for MS2 and by 10 min for boRV, with viral titers decreasing by > 4 log₁₀ and >5 log₁₀, respectively. Viral counts were further reduced through additional washes as follows: reduction of MS2 with water, of MNV-1 with NEW and HAV with PAA. PAA achieved significant and rapid inactivation of boRV (>6 log₁₀ PFU after 1 min), MNV-1 (>4 log₁₀ after 10 min) and MS2 (>3 log₁₀ after 3 min). HAV was moderately affected (<3 log₁₀ after 20 min or 3 log₁₀ after 3 washes). NEW was effective at inactivating MNV-1 (>4 log₁₀ after 1 min), MS2 (>4 log₁₀ after 3 min) and HAV (>4 log₁₀ after 1 min). For boRV, washing time needed to be increased to 10 min or three sequential washes were needed to reach >5 log₁₀ reduction. These results highlight the efficiency of PAA at reducing infectivity of MNV-1, MS2 bacteriophage and boRV, and NEW to inactivate the four viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatovirus A 3aNorovirus 3aRotavirus 3abacteriophages 3acattle 3afood safety 3afruits 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainactivation 3amice 3apathogenicity 3aperacetic acid 3arisk 3asanitizers 3atap water 3avegetables 3awater 0aEnteric viruses 0aBlueberries 0aWashing 0aSanitizers 0aFoodborne1 aGagné, Marie-Josée1 aBrassard, Julie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4676-27160 tFood control.g2021 Aug., v. 126 p.108043-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1080433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245011700181300001600298500001500314520110500329592002801434650001901462650000901481650002801490650001901518650001001537650002201547650001101569650001101580650001301591650001501604650001801619650001401637650001001651650001201661650006101673650001101734650002201745650000901767650004601776650004601822650001401868653001401882700002201896700001901918700002101937773009201958856004802050852000902098655001202107IND4468164520221118082057.0120313e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446816452DNAL7 a220156842pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-011-9962-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobune, Shun10aSymbiotic Fungal Flora in Leaf Galls Induced by Illiciomyia yukawai (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) and in Its Mycangia  ap. 619-627.  a2019-12-06  aWe investigated the association between a gall midge, Illiciomyia yukawai, and its symbiotic fungi on Japanese star anise, Illicium anisatum. The number of fungal species isolated from the galls increased with development of the galls, whereas those from the leaves showed a different trend. Botryosphaeria dothidea was dominant in the galls from June to October, and after that Phomopsis sp. 1, Colletotrichum sp., and Pestalotiopsis sp. became dominant. Although B. dothidea was not isolated from the leaves, it was detected from mycangia (abdominal sternite VII) of egg-laying adults at a high isolation frequency (>90%). However, B. dothidea was not isolated from mycangia of adults emerging from galls that were enclosed by plastic bags. This indicates that I. yukawai is closely associated with B. dothidea and that its newly emerged adults do not take the fungus into mycangia directly from the galls where they had developed. Also, the fungus from the fungal layers of ambrosia galls has less ability to propagate on artificial media despite the presence of its mycelial mass in mature galls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPestalotiopsis 3abags 3aBotryosphaeria dothidea 3aColletotrichum 3aflora 3aIllicium anisatum 3aadults 3aleaves 3aAmbrosia 3aleaf galls 3aCecidomyiidae 3aDiaporthe 3afungi 2aAnimals 2aDipteraxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFungixphysiology 2aMale 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aPlant Tumorsxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aSymbiosis 0aPhomopsis1 aKajimura, Hisashi1 aMasuya, Hayato1 aKubono, Takanori0 tMicrobial ecology.g2012 Apr., v. 63, no. 3 p.619-627dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-011-9962-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245012600158300001800284520116200302592002801464650001201492650002401504650001501528650003601543650001401579650002301593650001101616650002101627650001501648650001301663650002201676650002301698650001301721650002101734650001301755700002301768700002601791700005901817773014601876856007602022852000902098655001202107IND60603913420180905000000.0180716e20180529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060391342DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b035212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Ruhuai10aElectroremovable Traceless Hydrazides for Cobalt-Catalyzed Electro-Oxidative C–H/N–H Activation with Internal Alkynes  ap. 7913-7921.  aElectrochemical oxidative C–H/N–H activations have been accomplished with a versatile cobalt catalyst in terms of [4 + 2] annulations of internal alkynes. The electro-oxidative C–H activation manifold proved viable with an undivided cell setup under exceedingly mild reaction conditions at room temperature using earth-abundant cobalt catalysts. The electrochemical cobalt catalysis prevents the use of transition metal oxidants in C–H activation catalysis, generating H₂ as the sole byproduct. Detailed mechanistic studies provided strong support for a facile C–H cobaltation by an initially formed cobalt(III) catalyst. The subsequent alkyne migratory insertion was interrogated by mass spectrometry and DFT calculations, providing strong support for a facile C–H activation and the formation of a key seven-membered cobalta(III) cycle in a regioselective fashion. Key to success for the unprecedented use of internal alkynes in electrochemical C–H/N–H activations was represented by the use of N-2-pyridylhydrazides, for which we developed a traceless electrocleavage strategy by electroreductive samarium catalysis at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aambient temperature 3abyproducts 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrazides 3ahydrogen 3amass spectrometry 3amigratory behavior 3aoxidants 3aregioselectivity 3asamarium1 aSauermann, Nicolas1 aOliveira, João C.

This study aims to evaluate the chronic ecotoxicity of methylene blue dye degraded by the Fenton process using the non-target planarian Girardia tigrina as a sensitive bioindicator of environmental contamination. The bioassays evaluated the lethality of several concentrations of the untreated and degraded dye methylene blue (MB), as well as, their sub-lethal effects on locomotion, feeding, regeneration, and reproduction. In both acute and chronic tests, the degraded dye had a stronger toxic effect when compared to the untreated dye. This negative effect after treatment was mainly associated with the presence of residual hydrogen peroxide and iron (and consequently the hydroxyl radical formed). We conclude that the utilization of the Fenton process using less oxidizing agents should be considered as important alternatives for the protection of aquatic ecosystems, without compromising the efficient removal of MB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGirardia 3adeath 3aecotoxicology 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3alocomotion 3amethylene blue 3apollution 3areproduction 0aDye 0aWastewater 0aAOPs 0aEcotoxicological tests 0aPlanarians1 aPereira Dornelas, Aline Silvestre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5003-87581 aCarlos, Thayrine Dias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4312-49381 aPallini, Angelo1 aGravato, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0562-69451 aPereira, Douglas Henrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7700-47691 aSarmento, Renato Almeida1 aCavallini, Grasiele Soares0 tChemosphere.g2021 Nov., v. 283 p.131117-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014900156300001800305500001900323520175100342592002802093650002202121650001302143650001202156650002202168650001302190650002102203650001902224700001602243700001502259700001402274700001802288773012202306856007402428852000902502655001202511IND60725529020221116211504.0210126e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552902DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra07600g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinhu10aMass spectral and theoretical investigations of the transient proton-bound dimers on the cleavage processes of the peptide GHK and its analogues  ap. 4077-4086.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFragmentation mechanisms of the singly protonated peptides GHK, GHKH and HGHK have been investigated by mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations. Fragmentation behavior of the protonated H–K amide bond in GHK was changed completely when a histidinyl residue was introduced into the C-terminus of GHK. The H–K amide bond breaking was a predominant pathway in the case of GHK and GHKH. For HGHK, the histidinyl residue at the N-terminus hampered significantly breaking of the H–K amide bond resulting in a high potential energy barrier; calculations indicated that this histidinyl effect played a vital role for the H–K amide bond fragmentation. Subsequent analysis of the fragmentation mechanism revealed that recombination processes of the hydrogen bonding for the intermediate products were all exergonic. Formation of a proton-bound dimer (PBD) lowering the energy barriers from a thermodynamic perspective for all the designed fragmentation pathways was demonstrated to be feasible by our systematic calculations. Moreover, the involvement of different PBDs was further confirmed by analyses of the reduced density gradient (RDG) isosurfaces and scatter maps. A dynamically favored pathway was likely via six-membered ring or nine-membered ring structures generated by the diketopiperazine as revealed by atom-in-molecules (AIM) analyses, since the steric interaction energies in the newly formed ring were estimated to be relatively small when compared to the products generated from a lactam and/or an oxazolone pathway. This is the first feasibility investigation from a dynamic viewpoint for formation of different rings involved in the lactam, oxazolone or diketopiperazine pathways in the fragmentation mechanisms proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiketopiperazines 3ahydrogen 3alactams 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3apotential energy 3athermodynamics1 aWang, Cheng1 aZhang, Han1 aLiu, Yang1 aShi, Tiesheng0 tRSC advances.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 11, no. 7 p.4077-4086dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra07600g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245012900174500001900303520140300322592002801725650001401753650001401767650000701781650001401788650000901802650001501811650001901826653003001845653001401875653001401889653001301903653003501916653003601951700005901987700006402046700001902110700002302129773009102152856009002243852000902333655001202342IND60741023320221122065507.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074102332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbunama, Taher10aVariability of leachate quality and polluting potentials in light of leachate pollution index (LPI) – A global perspective  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFrom a holistic perspective, this review is the first to comprehensively assess and characterise leachate quality from waste disposal facilities (WDFs), landfills and dumpsites, located in 61 countries worldwide. A continent wise grouping approach was adopted to identify the variability of leachate quality and polluting abilities in light of leachate pollution index (LPI). The literature data on leachate quality included 428 samples, with eighteen leachate parameters, classified under, organic, inorganic, and heavy metals. Statistically significant differences in LPI were found between different continents and WDFs demographic data, i.e., type, status, age, rainfall, etc. A negative correlation was found between pH and the majority of studied parameters, especially for heavy metals such as Pb, Zn, As, Hg, Cy, as the decrease in pH intensifies heavy metals' solubility. Based on the studied worldwide leachate data and WDFs age, an LPI rating was identified, where high, intermediate, and low contaminated leachate are typically classified with having an average of 26.5, 23.6 and 17.5, respectively. The provided database in this review could be of great importance in establishing a more comprehensive global databank by including other countries- and site-specific factors that are vital in enhancing the accuracy of LPI and formatting a more representative leachate diagnosis index.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aleachates 3apH 3apollution 3arain 3asolubility 3awaste disposal 0aWaste disposal facilities 0aLandfills 0aDumpsites 0aLeachate 0aLeachate pollution index (LPI) 0aRainfall and climate conditions1 aMoodley, Tyrone1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9062-41371 aAbualqumboz, Motasem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1666-28451 aKumari, Sheena1 aBux, F.q(Faizel),0 tChemosphere.g2021 Nov., v. 282 p.131119-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245007700174500001900251520134700270592002801617650002801645650002101673650001401694650001801708650001901726650001101745650001701756650001001773650002401783650001501807650001701822650001601839650001901855650001101874650001701885650001301902653001101915653002401926700001701950700001901967700001801986700001802004700001502022700005902037773009102096856009002187852000902277655001202286IND60741023420221122083846.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074102342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Guo-ping10aSpermiogenesis toxicity of imidacloprid in rats, possible role of CYP3A4  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study evaluated the adverse effects of low-dose imidacloprid (IMI) on the characteristics of sperm from male Wistar rats. Thirty mature male rats were equally divided into three groups and orally administered vehicle (Control Group), acceptable daily intake (ADI) concentration of IMI (Group 1), and IMI at a dose 10-fold that of the ADI (Group 2) for 90 days. The findings revealed that IMI caused abnormalities in sperm concentrations and morphologies, accompanied by an imbalance of the gonadal hormone testosterone. Histopathological damage and decrease of testosterone levels were observed in testes from rats treated with IMI. However, estradiol and gonadotropin levels were unchanged after IMI treatment. IMI inhibited the activity of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and left itself existed in the organism of rats. The indicators relating to sperms and CYP3A4 activity were recovered when rats were co-treated with IMI and CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin together. These results indicated that low-dose IMI exposure caused sperm abnormalities through affecting on the spermiogenesis in testis. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by IMI largely contributed to its sperm toxicity. Thus, IMI exposure at doses close to real-world settings resulted in sperm toxicity on rats, which might be a potential risk factor for human reproductive diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceptable daily intake 3acytochrome P-450 3aestradiol 3agonadotropins 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimidacloprid 3amales 3aoral administration 3arifampicin 3arisk factors 3aspermatozoa 3aspermiogenesis 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atoxicity 0aTestis 0aCytochrome P450 3A41 aLi, Jin-wang1 aYang, Fang-wei1 aYin, Xue-feng1 aRen, Fa-zheng1 aFang, Bing1 aPang, Guo-Fang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4402-24770 tChemosphere.g2021 Nov., v. 282 p.131120-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011300175300001600288520091700304592002801221650001401249650002501263650001301288650001301301650001901314650001701333650001501350650001501365650001901380650002501399653003101424653002701455653004501482653002501527653002201552700001901574700001701593700001601610700001701626700002001643773011201663856008501775852000901860655001201869IND60582467220221120182642.0180830e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058246722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, David Junghoon,10aTailoring ceramic membrane structures of solid oxide fuel cells via polymer-assisted electrospray deposition  ap. 234-242.  aA versatile and robust process was developed for the fabrication of ceramic films in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), allowing the microstructures of the films to be tailored from porous to dense.

Phage biology studies as well as therapeutic phage applications necessitate highly purified phage particles. In this study, we compared combinations of seven different endotoxin removal strategies and validated their endotoxin removal efficacy for five different phages (i.e. four Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages and one Staphylococcus aureus phage). These purification strategies included Endotrap HD column purification and/or CsCl density centrifugation in combination with Endotrap purification, followed by organic solvent (1-octanol), detergent (Triton X-100), enzymatic inactivation of the endotoxin using alkaline phosphatase and CIM monolytic anion exchange chromatography. We show that CsCl density purification of the P. aeruginosa phages, at an initial concentration of 1012–1013pfu/ml, led to the strongest reduction of endotoxins, with an endotoxin removal efficacy of up to 99%, whereas additional purification methods did not result in a complete removal of endotoxins from the phage preparations and only yielded an additional endotoxin removal efficacy of 23 to 99%, sometimes accompanied with strong losses in phage titer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanion exchange chromatography 3abacteriophages 3acentrifugation 3adetergents 3aendotoxins 3aimmune response 3aoctoxynol 3apurification methods 3asolvents 0aEndotoxins 0aLipopolysaccharides (LPS) 0aBacteriophages 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aEndotoxin removal 0aEndotoxin quantification1 aMerabishvili, Maya1 aVergauwen, Bjorn1 aLavigne, Rob1 aVaneechoutte, Mario0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2017 Jan., v. 132 p.153-159dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2016.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01400naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009900166300001800265500001900283520036000302592002800662650001800690650001400708650002000722650001500742650000900757700002200766700002300788700002100811700002500832773012200857856007400979852000901053655001201062IND60725529220221116211238.0210126e20210118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552922DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra07965k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrenkel-Pinter, Moran10aTransition metals enhance prebiotic depsipeptide oligomerization reactions involving histidine  ap. 3534-3538.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiochemistry exhibits an intense dependence on metals.

The extraction of these types of plasmids from small bacterial cell cultures produces low DNA yields. In this study, we have quantitated yields of low copy and single copy number plasmid DNAs after growth of cells in four widely used broths (SB, SOC, TB, and 2xYT) and compared results to those obtained with LB, the most common E. coli cell growth medium. TB (terrific broth) consistently generated the greatest amount of plasmid DNA, in agreement with its ability to produce higher cell titers. The superiority of TB was primarily due to its high levels of yeast extract (24g/L) and was independent of glycerol, a unique component of this broth. Interestingly, simply preparing LB with similarly high levels of yeast extract (LB24 broth) resulted in plasmid yields that were equivalent to those of TB. By contrast, increasing ampicillin concentration to enhance plasmid retention did not improve plasmid DNA recovery. These experiments demonstrate that yields of low and single copy number plasmid DNAs from minipreps can be strongly enhanced using simple and inexpensive media.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aampicillin 3abacteria 3abroths 3acell culture 3acell growth 3aculture media 3aglycerol 3aheterologous gene expression 3amolecular cloning 3aplasmids 3ayeast extract 0aPlasmid 0aCopy number 0aDNA purification 0aMiniprep 0aTB 0aLB1 aSmith, Kyle D.1 aReam, Jennifer A.1 aLewis, L.

In particular, MPs may act as vectors for various contaminants to induce adverse effects in human. In this work, the joint cytotoxicity of two different MPs co-exposed with diverse ionic pollutants was investigated in two cell lines from human digestive system: human gastric epithelium (GES-1) and colorectal mucosa (FHC) cell lines. The results indicated that the cytotoxicity of cationic pollutants was alleviated by MPs more significantly than that of anionic pollutants in both culture medium and river water. The electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged MPs and cations was a key factor in determining the ultimate joint toxicity. Our findings indicate that the joint cytotoxicity of MP-pollutant mixtures may be proactively reduced by modulating the surface charge of MPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aculture media 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agastric mucosa 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3ariver water 0aIonic pollutants 0aJoint cytotoxicity 0aElectrostatic attraction1 aLiu, Jian1 aWang, Dujia1 aKong, Long1 aWu, Yanxin1 aZhou, Xiaoxia1 aJia, Jianbo1 aZhou, Hongyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9215-59471 aYan, Bing0 tChemosphere.g2021 Nov., v. 282 p.131121-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245009100174300001400265520098400279592002801263650001501291650001301306650002201319650001401341650001901355650003001374650001001404700002001414773007301434856008901507990002301596852000901619655001201628IND60096050220221120091009.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009605022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Do-Hyoung10aWaterproof characteristics of nanoclay/epoxy nanocomposite in adhesively bonded joints  ap. 86-95.  aWhen adhesively bonded joints are exposed to a moist environment, the tensile load capability of the joint is significantly decreased because moisture absorption weakens the mechanical properties of epoxy adhesive.

The water absorption of the epoxy adhesive and the adhesive strength of the adhesively bonded joints were measured in water absorption experiments with respect to the weight fraction of the nanoclay and the moisture exposure time. These results showed that the tensile load capability of the nanoclay-filled adhesively bonded joint was greatly enhanced, even in a moist environment, because the nanoclay reduced water absorption into the epoxy adhesive as well as into the interface between the epoxy adhesive and the steel adherend and increased the strength of the epoxy adhesive itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aepoxides 3aexposure duration 3ananoclays 3ananocomposites 3aresistance to penetration 3asteel1 aKim, Hak-sŏng,0 tComposites.g2013 Dec., v. 55 p.86-95dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.05.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013400159300001800293520149700311592002801808650001801836650001201854650001101866650001301877650002201890650001401912700001801926700001601944700001901960700002401979700001902003773012202022856007402144852000902218655001202227IND60725529320221116211617.0210126e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552932DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra08099c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSajid, Hasnain10aRemarkable static and dynamic NLO response of alkali and superalkali doped macrocyclic [hexa-]thiophene complexes; a DFT approach  ap. 4118-4128.  aIn this study, the nonlinear optical (NLO) response of alkali metal atom (Li, Na and K) and their corresponding superalkali (Li₃O, Na₃O and K₃O) doped six membered cyclic thiophene (6CT) has been explored. The optimized geometries of complexes; Li@6CT, Na@6CT, K@6CT, Li₃O@6CT, Na₃O@6CT and K₃O@6CT depict that the superalkalis and alkali metals interact through the active cavity of 6CT. Interaction energies reveal that superalkalis have higher interaction with 6CT than alkali metals. The nonlinear optical (NLO) response of the reported complexes is estimated via both static and dynamic hyperpolarizabilities which are further rationalized by the HOMO–LUMO gap, natural bond orbital (NBO) charge transfer, dipole moment, polarizabilities and βᵥₑc. A remarkably high NLO response is computed for Na₃O@6CT among all of the complexes. The static hyperpolarizability of the Na₃O@6CT complex is 5 × 10⁴ au along with the highest βᵥₑc value (2.5 × 10⁴ au). High charge transfer (1.53e⁻) and small EH–L gap (2.96 eV) is responsible for such a large NLO response. For dynamic NLO responses, electro-optic Pockel's effect (EOPE) and second-harmonic generation (SHG) are explored. A very large quadratic nonlinear optical response (3.8 × 10⁻¹² au) is observed for the Na₃O@6CT complex. Moreover, the absorption spectrum of the Na₃O@6CT complex shows ultra-high transparency in the ultraviolet and visible regions unlike any other of its counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkali metals 3aalkalis 3aenergy 3ageometry 3aspectral analysis 3athiophene1 aUllah, Faizan1 aKhan, Sidra1 aAyub, Khurshid1 aArshad, Muḥammad,1 aMahmood, Tariq0 tRSC advances.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 11, no. 7 p.4118-4128dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra08099c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010700165300001600272520086700288592002801155650001001183650001901193650002101212650002601233650001201259650001701271650001501288650001201303650001301315700001701328700002201345700001901367700001801386773012401404856008201528852000901610655001201619IND60566131120221118120919.0170402e20160114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056613112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b056042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, Masato10aSurface Structure and Current Transport Property of Boron and Phosphorus Co-Doped Silicon Nanocrystals  ap. 195-200.  aSilicon (Si) nanocrystals (NCs) with high boron (B) and phosphorus (P) concentration shells are dispersible in polar solvents without organic ligands. In order to understand the mechanism of the solution dispersibility, the surface structure is studied by infrared absorption spectroscopy. It is shown that water molecules are adsorbed at the B–oxygen (O) bond sites on NC surface with high hydrogen bond strength, and thus B and P co-doped Si-NCs are a kind of hydrate containing large amounts of water molecules (Si-NC·xH₂O). The current transport properties of Si-NC films made from the solutions are studied. It is found that the conductivity is very sensitive to the amount of adsorbed water molecules and changes by 8 orders of magnitude. The high affinity of the NC surface with water molecules is considered to be the origin of the high sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3adispersibility 3ahydrogen bonding 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aligands 3ananocrystals 3aphosphorus 3asilicon 3asolvents1 aKano, Shinya1 aSugimoto, Hiroshi1 aImakita, Kenji1 aFujii, Minoru0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Jan. 14, v. 120, no. 1 p.195-200dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b056043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245014700167520125400314592002801568650000801596650001601604650004301620650002501663650001101688650001401699650001201713650001601725650000901741650001601750650001001766650001801776650001701794650001901811650000901830650002701839650003001866650001701896653004101913653002901954653001401983653001401997653004302011700001802054700002002072700001802092700001802110700001802128700005402146700001802200700001602218700001902234700001602253700001702269773009602286856008702382852000902469655001202478IND60730129620221120194832.0220606e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073012962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1080512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, Shan10aDetection of stx1 and stx2 and subtyping of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli using asymmetric PCR combined with lateral flow immunoassay  aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is known as a kind of foodborne pathogens that can produce Shiga toxin type1, type 2, or both, encoded by stx1 and stx2 genes, respectively. Rapid and accurate detection of STEC and stx1/stx2 subtyping assay in food and environment is essential for foodborne outbreak investigation. In this study, a method for the accurate and rapid subtyping of STEC single colony using asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (asPCR) combined with lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) was established. AsPCR was conducted using biotinylated stx1 and digoxin-labeled stx2 primers to obtain several single stranded DNA amplicons labeled with biotin or/and digoxin. Subsequently, these amplicons were tagged with specific probes labeled with carboxylate-modified red polystyrene microspheres using sequential hybridization. Finally, STEC with different Shiga toxin gene types could be distinguished depending on the appearance of different test lines on an LFIA strip. Thus, the STEC single colony could be identified and subtyped accurately and conveniently using this method. This method showed high specificity. Twenty-four strains of STEC in milk were detected and subtyped using our method, which combines asPCR with LFIA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aShiga toxin 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3aappearance (quality) 3abiotin 3adetection 3adigoxin 3aenvironment 3aflow 3afood safety 3agenes 3ahybridization 3aimmunoassays 3amicroparticles 3amilk 3aoutbreak investigation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolystyrenes 0aAsymmetric polymerase chain reaction 0aLateral flow immunoassay 0aDetection 0aSubtyping 0aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli1 aHuang, Yanmei1 aHuang, Zhaohong1 aLong, Zhonger1 aLiu, Chengwei1 aZhao, Xuelong1 aXing, Keyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8883-78461 aXiao, Xiaoyue1 aLiu, Jintao1 aHuang, Yunhong1 aLai, Weihua1 aLiu, Daofeng0 tFood control.g2021 Aug., v. 126 p.108051-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1080513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03813naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245009900178300001600277520216700293592002802460650002102488650001702509650001202526650002602538650001302564650001102577650001302588650001202601650001402613650001802627650002002645650001502665650001202680650002202692650001102714650001402725650001502739650001702754650001302771650001102784650001602795650001002811650001502821650003102836650000902867651001202876700002802888700002202916700002602938700001802964700002102982700002503003773008803028856008603116852000903202655001203211IND60089136220221117193135.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008913622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKivimäenpää, Minna10aInfluence of tree provenance on biogenic VOC emissions of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stumps  ap. 477-485.  aResin-storing plant species such as conifer trees can release substantial amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere under stress circumstances that cause resin flow. Wounding can be induced by animals, pathogens, wind or direct mechanical damage e.g. during harvesting. In atmospheric modelling of biogenic VOCs, actively growing vegetation has been mostly considered as the source of emissions. Root systems and stumps of resin-storing conifer trees could constitute a significant store of resin after tree cutting. Therefore, we assessed the VOC emission rates from the cut surface of Scots pine stumps and estimated the average emission rates for an area with a density of 2000 stumps per ha. The experiment was conducted with trees of one Estonian and three Finnish Scots pine provenances covering a 1200 km gradient at a common garden established in central Finland in 1991. VOC emissions were dominated by monoterpenes and less than 0.1% of the total emission was sesquiterpenes. α-Pinene (7–92% of the total emissions) and 3-carene (0–76% of the total emissions) were the dominant monoterpenes. Proportions of α-pinene and camphene were significantly lower and proportions of 3-carene, sabinene, γ-terpinene and terpinolene higher in the southernmost Saaremaa provenance compared to the other provenances. Total terpene emission rates (standardised to +20 °C) from stumps varied from 27 to 1582 mg h⁻¹ m⁻² when measured within 2–3 h after tree cutting. Emission rates decreased rapidly to between 2 and 79 mg h⁻¹ m⁻² at 50 days after cutting. The estimated daily terpene emission rates on a hectare basis from freshly cut stumps at a cut tree density of 2000 per ha varied depending on provenance. Estimated emission ranges were 100–710 g ha⁻¹ d⁻¹ and 137–970 g ha⁻¹ d⁻¹ in 40 and in 60 year-old forest stands, respectively. Our result suggests that emission directly from stump surfaces could be a significant source of monoterpene emissions for a few weeks after logging in a Scots pine stand, but provenance properties strongly affect resin flow from root to stump surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aalpha-pinene 3aanimals 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acamphene 3acarene 3aconifers 3acutting 3aemissions 3aforest stands 3agamma-terpinene 3aharvesting 3alogging 3amechanical damage 3amodels 3apathogens 3aprovenance 3aroot systems 3asabinene 3astumps 3aterpinolene 3atrees 3avegetation 3avolatile organic compounds 3awind 3aFinland1 aMagsarjav, Narantsetseg1 aGhimire, Rajendra1 aMarkkanen, Juha-Matti1 aHeijari, Juha1 aVuorinen, Martti1 aHolopainen, Jarmo K.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 60 p.477-485dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245015500166300002000321520133100341592002801672650002001700650001901720650001701739650001601756650001101772650001501783650002601798650001701824650001801841650000901859650002001868650001401888650001401902650002101916650001101937650001301948650002001961650001501981650000901996653001302005653002702018653001502045653001902060700001502079700002002094700002202114700002002136700001902156773013502175856008202310852000902392655001202401IND60586431220180405000000.0171213e20171129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058643122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiether, Wiebke10aEnvironmental Growing Conditions in Five Production Systems Induce Stress Response and Affect Chemical Composition of Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) Beans  ap. 10165-10173.  aCocoa beans are produced all across the humid tropics under different environmental conditions provided by the region but also by the season and the type of production system. Agroforestry systems compared to monocultures buffer climate extremes and therefore provide a less stressful environment for the understory cocoa, especially under seasonally varying conditions. We measured the element concentration as well as abiotic stress indicators (polyamines and total phenolic content) in beans derived from five different production systems comparing monocultures and agroforestry systems and from two harvesting seasons. Concentrations of N, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Na, and Zn were higher in beans produced in agroforestry systems with high stem density and leaf area index. In the dry season, the N, Fe, and Cu concentration of the beans increased. The total phenolic content increased with proceeding of the dry season while other abiotic stress indicators like spermine decreased, implying an effect of the water availability on the chemical composition of the beans. Agroforestry systems did not buffer the variability of stress indicators over the seasons compared to monocultures. The effect of environmental growing conditions on bean chemical composition was not strong but can contribute to variations in cocoa bean quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3aabiotic stress 3aagroforestry 3acocoa beans 3acopper 3adry season 3aenvironmental factors 3aharvest date 3ahumid tropics 3airon 3aleaf area index 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen content 3asodium 3aspermine 3astress response 3aunderstory 3azinc 0aT. cacao 0atotal phenolic content 0apolyamines 0aabiotic stress1 aSmit, Inga1 aArmengot, Laura1 aSchneider, Monika1 aGerold, Gerhard1 aPawelzik, Elke0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Nov. 29, v. 65, no. 47 p.10165-10173dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b044903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003500188245016700223300001200390506007600402520177200478592002802250596005602278506003702334650002602371650001402397650003002411650001002441650001002451650001102461650001002472650002802482650001502510650002202525650001202547650001202559650001602571650004502587650001002632650001602642650001502658651001802673700002302691700002202714700002102736700003002757700002802787700003102815773011302846856008202959852000903041655001203050IND60624054520221207113626.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062405452DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-018-3190-02doi7 aPMC62678912pmcid7 a304975282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasconcelos dos Santos, Thiago10aEcological aspects of Phlebotomines (Diptera: Psychodidae) and the transmission of American cutaneous leishmaniasis agents in an Amazonian/ Guianan bordering area  ap. 612.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: An entomological study was conducted in the municipality of Oiapoque (lower Oyapock River Basin) in the Brazilian side bordering French Guiana to gain information on the transmission pattern of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in that region, presumed to reflect the classical Amazonian/Guianan enzootic scenario. METHODS: Three ecologically isolated forested areas near urban environments were surveyed during the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016, using a multi-trapping approach comprising ground-level and canopy light traps, black and white colored cloth Shannon traps and manual aspiration on tree bases. Female phlebotomines were dissected to find infections and isolate flagellates from Leishmania spp. The strains were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and compared with those of local ACL cases and World Health Organization reference strains. RESULTS: Nyssomyia umbratilis, Trichopygomyia trichopyga and Evandromyia infraspinosa were the most frequently found species. Findings on relative abundance, spatiotemporal vector/ACL congruence, natural infections and anthropophilic insights strengthened the Guianan classical transmission of Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis by Ny. umbratilis and suggested further investigations for Ev. infraspinosa. Nyssomyia umbratilis showed an eclectic feeding habit, including bird blood. Ecological data and literature reports also included Psychodopygus squamiventris maripaensis and Bichromomyia flaviscutellata on the list of suspected vectors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contributed to understanding ACL ecoepidemiology in the Amazonian/Guianan scenario. Local studies are required to better comprehend the Leishmania spp. enzootic mosaic in specific ecotopes.  aPublisher supplied data  a01/2018 PROPESP/UFPAcUniversidade Federal do Pará0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania guyanensis 3aLutzomyia 3aWorld Health Organization 3abirds 3ablood 3acanopy 3acolor 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3adry season 3aenzootic diseases 3afemales 3aforests 3alight traps 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3atrees 3aurban areas 3awatersheds 3aFrench Guiana1 aPrévot, Ghislaine1 aGinouvès, Marine1 aDuarte, Rosemere1 aSilveira, Fernando Tobias1 aPóvoa, Marinete Marins1 aRangel, Elizabeth Ferreira0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.612-612dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-3190-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011300170300001600283520103700299592002801336650001401364650001701378650002301395650002001418650001501438650002501453650001601478651001401494653001201508653001401520653002001534653002001554653001901574700002201593700001901615773011101634856008301745852000901828655001201837IND60544651020221120144543.0190417e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054465102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2015.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevitt, Karen R.10aAustralia’s protected area network fails to adequately protect the world’s most threatened marine fishes  ap. 401-411.  aIn order to maintain ecosystems and biodiversity, Australia has long invested in the development of marine and terrestrial protected area networks. Within this land- and sea-scape, northern Australia represents a global population stronghold for four species of the world’s most threatened marine fish family, the sawfishes (family Pristidae). The distribution of sawfishes across northern Australia has previously only been coarsely estimated, and the adequacy of their representation in protected areas has not been evaluated. The calculated range of each species was intersected with Australia’s marine and terrestrial protected area datasets, and targets of 10% marine and 17% inland range protection were used to determine adequacy of sawfish range protection. Marine targets have been achieved for all species, but the inland range protection targets have not been met for any species. Results indicate that further protection of inland habitats is required in order to improve sawfish protection and habitat connectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPristidae 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3ahabitat connectivity 3amarine fish 3aAustralia 0aSawfish 0aPristidae 0aProtected areas 0aMarine reserves 0aNational parks1 aAdams, Vanessa M.1 aKyne, Peter M.0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2015 Jan., v. 3 p.401-411dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2015.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010400155300002000259520114300279592002801422650002201450650003701472650001101509650002201520650001601542650003701558650002401595650000901619650001901628650001101647650003301658650001901691650001601710650001901726700001701745700001901762700001701781700001501798773012301813856007401936852000902010655001202019IND60641625820221120202057.0190505e20170530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064162582DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02893h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhuoqi10aOne-step hydrothermal preparation of Ce-doped MoO₃ nanobelts with enhanced gas sensing properties  ap. 28366-28372.  aRare earth ions are considered as the ideal dopants to modify the crystal structure, electronics structure, and gas sensing performance of metal oxides semiconductors. In this paper, Ce-doped MoO₃ nanobelts were successfully synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method. The morphology and microstructure were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). FESEM images demonstrate that the as-prepared products are uniform nanobelts with length of about 20 μm and width of 100–200 nm. EDS, XRD, and XPS spectroscopy show that Ce atoms were uniformly distributed in the crystal structure of MoO₃ nanobelts. In comparison with pure samples, Ce-doped MoO₃ nanobelts exhibited superior trimethylamine (TMA) sensing properties at a lower working temperature. The effects of Ce-doping on the trimethylamine sensing performance of MoO₃ nanobelts were discussed based on the experimental results. In addition, this study provided insights and strategies for designing high performance TMA gas sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acerium 3acrystal structure 3aelectronics 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahot water treatment 3aions 3amicrostructure 3aoxides 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemiconductors 3atemperature 3atrimethylamine1 aWang, Weijie1 aZhao, Zhicheng1 aLiu, Xinrong1 aSong, Peng0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 30, v. 7, no. 45 p.28366-28372dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02893h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245008600165300001800251520125100269592002801520650002201548650001301570650002301583650002201606650002001628650001701648650001601665650000901681700005601690773013501746856008001881852000901961655001201970IND60605549820221119165619.0180721e20180125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060554982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b070962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnand, Abhinav10aMechanism of Urea Crystal Dissolution in Water from Molecular Dynamics Simulation  ap. 1213-1222.  aMolecular dynamics simulations are used to determine the mechanism of urea crystal dissolution in water under sink conditions. Crystals of cubic and tablet shapes are considered, and results are reported for four commonly used water models. The dissolution rates for different water models can differ considerably, but the overall dissolution mechanism remains the same. Urea dissolution occurs in three stages: a relatively fast initial stage, a slower intermediate stage, and a final stage. We show that the long intermediate stage is well described by classical rate laws, which assume that the dissolution rate is proportional to the active surface area. By carrying out simulations at different temperatures, we show that urea dissolution is an activated process, with an activation energy of ∼32 kJ mol–¹. Our simulations give no indication of a significant diffusion layer, and we conclude that the detachment of molecules from the crystal is the rate-determining step for dissolution. The results we report for urea are consistent with earlier observations for the dissolution of NaCl crystals. This suggests that the three-stage mechanism and classical rate laws might apply to the dissolution of other ionic and molecular crystals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acrystals 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models 3asodium chloride 3asurface area 3atemperature 3aurea1 aPatey, G.

Previous studies have focused on the impacts of funds on agricultural production, but placed little emphasis on its role in agricultural land-use transformation. Thus, this study explores the quantitative relationship between agricultural credit and farmland abandonment from the perspective of rural revitalization. Using data on 8031 households from 27 provinces obtained from China’s Labor Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), this study uses a Tobit model to examine the quantitative impacts of informal and formal agricultural credit on farmland abandonment. The results indicate that: (1) Access to agricultural credit helps to reduce farmland abandonment. (2) Compared with formal agricultural credit (provided by institutions), informal agricultural credit (provided by family and friends) is more significant in reducing farmland abandonment. Thus, this study enhances our understanding of the relationship between agricultural credit and farmland use. It will also prompt policymakers to improve rural financial markets in order to reduce the misallocation of farmland resources, thereby improving food security and rural economies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabandoned land 3aagricultural credit 3aagricultural land 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3alabor force 3aland use 3amarkets 3amodels 3arural areas 3asurveys 3aChina1 aZeng, Miao 1 aXie, Zhengjuan 1 aWang, Shikun 0 tLand.g2019 Dec. 04, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land81201843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03820naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245019500180300001800375500001900393520203100412592002802443650002302471650002402494650001702518650002002535650000902555650002302564650002502587650000902612650001102621650001302632650001202645651000902657653002602666653003402692653002202726653002402748653002002772653000802792653000702800653001002807653001002817653000902827700001802836700001602854700002502870700002402895700001802919700001802937700002202955700005902977773009903036856008603135852000903221655001203230IND60710751720221119101657.0201025e20201014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071075172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.08.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrow-Lucal, Elisabeth R.10aImmune response at 12–23 months following a single dose of Vero cell culture-derived Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine in adults previously vaccinated with mouse brain-derived JE vaccine  ap. 6899-6903.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJapanese encephalitis (JE) virus is an important cause of neurological disease in Asia. JE vaccine is recommended for travelers with higher JE risk itineraries. Inactivated Vero cell culture-derived JE vaccine (JE-VC) is the only JE vaccine currently available in the United States. An inactivated mouse brain-derived JE vaccine (JE-MB) previously was available but production was discontinued. One JE-VC dose administered to adults previously vaccinated with ≥3 doses of JE-MB provides good short-term protection for at least one month, but data on longer-term protection are limited. We evaluated non-inferiority of the JE virus neutralizing antibody response at 12–23 months in JE-MB-vaccinated adults administered one JE-VC dose compared with JE vaccine-naïve adults administered a JE-VC two-dose primary series.We obtained archived sera from U.S. military personnel and performed a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test for anti-JE virus neutralizing antibodies. We compared the geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroprotection rate at 12–23 months after one JE-VC dose in previously JE-MB-vaccinated personnel and after the second JE-VC dose in previously JE vaccine-naïve personnel. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the GMT ratio in previously vaccinated to vaccine-naïve personnel was >1/1.5.The GMT in previously JE-MB-vaccinated persons was 75 (95% CI 63–90) and in previously JE vaccine-naïve persons was 12 (95% CI 11–14), and seroprotection rates were 94% (235/250) and 54% (135/250), respectively. The ratio of GMTs was 6.3 (95% CI: 5.0–7.7), satisfying the criterion for non-inferiority.One JE-VC dose in previously JE-MB-vaccinated military personnel provides good protection for at least 1–2 years. The benefits of administration of a single JE-VC dose in previously JE-MB-vaccinated adults include a shorter time to completion of re-vaccination before travel, a decrease in the risk of adverse events, and reduced costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibody formation 3aconfidence interval 3aencephalitis 3ahuman resources 3amice 3amilitary personnel 3aneutralization tests 3arisk 3atravel 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aAsia 0aJapanese encephalitis 0aJapanese encephalitis vaccine 0aVero cell-derived 0aMouse brain-derived 0aNon-inferiority 0aGMT 0aJE 0aJE-VC 0aJE-MB 0aPRNT1 aLaven, Janeen1 aPerry, Lori1 aBiggerstaff, Brad J.1 aJohnson, Barbara W.1 aHollis, Ewell1 aFischer, Marc1 aWoolpert, Tabitha1 aHills, Susan L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1408-60470 tVaccine.g2020 Oct. 14, v. 38, no. 44 p.6899-6903dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.08.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011000169300001800279520152600297592002801823650001201851650002401863650001901887650001001906650001301916650001901929650001101948650001301959700001601972700002701988700002302015700002102038773009902059856008602158852000902244655001202253IND60577640920221121233235.0170810e20170418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057764092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b036632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Mingming10aGeometry and Topology of Two-Dimensional Dry Foams: Computer Simulation and Experimental Characterization  ap. 3839-3846.  aPseudo-two-dimensional (2D) foams are commonly used in foam studies as it is experimentally easier to measure the bubble size distribution and other geometric and topological properties of these foams than it is for a 3D foam. Despite the widespread use of 2D foams in both simulation and experimental studies, many important geometric and topological relationships are still not well understood. Film size, for example, is a key parameter in the stability of bubbles and the overall structure of foams. The relationship between the size distribution of the films in a foam and that of the bubbles themselves is thus a key relationship in the modeling and simulation of unstable foams. This work uses structural simulation from Surface Evolver to statistically analyze this relationship and to ultimately formulate a relationship for the film size in 2D foams that is shown to be valid across a wide range of different bubble polydispersities. These results and other topological features are then validated using digital image analysis of experimental pseudo-2D foams produced in a vertical Hele–Shaw cell, which contains a monolayer of bubbles between two plates. From both the experimental and computational results, it is shown that there is a distribution of sizes that a film can adopt and that this distribution is very strongly dependent on the sizes of the two bubbles to which the film is attached, especially the smaller one, but that it is virtually independent of the underlying polydispersity of the foam.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3acomputer simulation 3adigital images 3afoams 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3atopology1 aCole, Katie1 aBrito-Parada, Pablo R.1 aNeethling, Stephen1 aCilliers, Jan J.0 tLangmuir.g2017 Apr. 18, v. 33, no. 15 p.3839-3846dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b036633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016400156300001800320520069700338592002801035650003101063650002401094650001401118650002301132650001401155650001401169700001701183700001501200700001301215700001201228700001201240773013401252856007401386852000901460655001201469IND60638675820221118050631.0190430e20160216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063867582DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc10292h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Ping14aThe enantioselective construction of chiral spirooxindole-based 4-thiazolidinone via asymmetric catalytic formal [3+2] annulation using a bifunctional catalyst  ap. 3418-3421.  a4-Thiazolidinone is regarded as a privileged structural unit in bioactive compounds.

A single parabolic band model with acoustic phonon scattering approximation was used to explain the transport phenomenon and density of states effective mass. The intrinsic samples (x = 0) show unipolar transport with holes as majority charge carriers. It was found that both the effective mass and carrier concentration decreased with increase in Zn concentration. From thermal conductivity measurements, evidence of bipolar carrier transport is found above 475 K in Zn containing samples and thus the possibility of involvement of other scattering mechanisms along with acoustic phonons is not ruled out. The Seebeck coefficient of the samples containing Zn show a negative value above 600 K whereby it is observed that substitution of Cu with Zn contributes electronic charge carriers in Cu₃₋ₓZnₓSbSe₄. The value of the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) in Zn substituted samples first increases till 475 K and then starts to decrease sharply due to bipolar charge transport, however, Cu₂.₅Zn₀.₅SbSe₄ (x = 0.5) shows the highest ZT compared to other samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aantimony 3acopper 3amelting 3amodels 3athermal conductivity 3azinc1 aDhama, P.1 aSaini, Deepash S.1 aBanerji, P.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 12, v. 6, no. 7 p.5528-5534dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra21165d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01701naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009900166300002000265520065000285592002800935650001400963650002500977650002301002650001201025650001401037700006001051700006401111773013601175856007901311852000901390655001201399IND60669577120221119041537.0190920e20190816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066957712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b017962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Joo Young10aSynthesis of the Tetracyclic Cores of the Integrastatins, Epicoccolide A and Epicocconigrone A  ap. 11935-11944.  aThe integrastatins, epicoccolide A and epicoccongirone A, are natural products containing a unique [6.6.6.6]-tetracyclic core framework that exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. A synthesis of the common core of epicoccolide A and epicocconigrone A has been achieved using an umpolung alkylation–lactonization to assemble an isochromanone from which the bridged 1,3-dioxane was readily assembled. A different strategy was required to access the core on the integrastatins; an initial aryllithium addition to an aldehyde, followed by oxidation and treatment of the masked dihydroxyketone with acid gave the desired core structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3abioactive properties 3achemical structure 3adioxane 3aoxidation1 aSperry, Jonathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7288-39391 aBrimble, Margaret A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7086-40960 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Aug. 16, v. 84, no. 18 p.11935-11944dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b017963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245014400179500001900323520133800342592002801680650002101708650001601729650001301745650001901758650002301777650001601800650000901816650001401825650001801839650001501857650002001872650000701892650002501899650002201924653002401946653002201970653002801992653001602020653002202036700001702058700002502075700002302100700002602123773010902149856008602258852000902344655001202353IND60731435020221116201009.0210401e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073143502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1101102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarshchi, Helale Kaboli10aSynthesis and characterization of nanoliposome containing Fe2+ element: A superior nano-fertilizer for ferrous iron delivery to sweet basil  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLime-induced Fe- deficient soil causes plant Fe-deficiency, which can be overcome with the foliar application of liposomal Fe fertilizers capable of delivering Fe efficiently to plant tissues. In the current investigation, the effect of foliar fertilization of the Fe-liposome (Fe-L) in two concentrations (2.5 and 5 fold diluted) on sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) was studied and vegetative growth, the ferrous/total Fe content, and also essential oil constituents were evaluated. In comparison, the FeSO₄- EDTA and vehicle (citrate buffer) were used. The experiment was conducted in Completely Randomized Design with four treatments and three replications. The sweet basil plants were grown in pots with calcareous loamy soil (pH ∼ 7.6, with an appropriate amount of N, K and P) in a greenhouse. Egg-derived phosphatidylcholine (EPC)/Fe-liposomes (200 nm in diameter and monodisperse size distribution) enhanced the fresh and dry weight, increased total leaf area, and improved chlorophyll, ferrous, and essential oil content of the plants compared to the FeSO₄ fertilizer. Moreover, methyl chavicol was found to be the primary compound in the essential oil using a gad-chromatogram-mass spectroscopy GC–MS. Overall, the Fe-liposome is a superior fertilizer than FeSO₄- EDTA in terms of Fe-delivery and plant recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3achlorophyll 3acitrates 3aessential oils 3afoliar application 3agreenhouses 3airon 3aleaf area 3alipid content 3aloam soils 3amethyl chavicol 3apH 3aphosphatidylcholines 3avegetative growth 0aPlant Fe-deficiency 0aPlant-Fe delivery 0aFe foliar fertilization 0aFe-liposome 0aVegetative traits1 aAzizi, Majid1 aTeymouri, Manouchehr1 aNikpoor, Amin Reza1 aJaafari, Mahmoud Reza0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 June 01, v. 283 p.110110-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1101103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245005000153300001500203500001900218520165400237592002801891650002501919650001201944650001001956650004101966650002302007650001002030650003202040650001002072700002002082773015202102856006902254856008202323990002302405852000902428655001202437IND60727903720221120061729.0210213e20210213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072790372DNAL7 a10.3791/609022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, David10aSampling and analysis of animal scent signals  ap. e60902.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe have developed an effective methodology for sampling and analysis of odor signals, by using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, to understand how they may be used in animal communication. This technique allows the semi-quantitative analysis of the volatile components of odor secretions by enabling the separation and tentative identification of the components in the sample, followed by the analysis of peak area ratios to look for trends that could signify compounds that may be involved in signaling. The key strengths of this current approach are the range of sample types that can be analyzed; the lack of need for any complex sample preparation or extractions; the ability to separate and analyze the components of a mixture; the identification of the components detected; and the capability to provide semi-quantitative and potentially quantitative information on the components detected. The main limitation to the methodology relates to the samples themselves. Since the components of specific interest are volatile, and these could easily be lost, or their concentrations altered, it is important that the samples are stored and transported appropriately after their collection. This also means that sample storage and transport conditions are relatively costly. This method can be applied to a variety of samples (including urine, feces, hair and scent-gland odor secretions). These odors consist of complex mixtures, occurring in a range of matrices, and thus necessitate the use of techniques to separate the individual components and extract the compounds of biological interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal communication 3aanimals 3afeces 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aodors 3asolid phase microextraction 3aurine1 aVaglio, Stefano0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2021 Feb. 13, , no. 168 p.e60902-e60902dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/609023Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/60902/sampling-and-analysis-of-animal-scent-signals  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003000154245013400184506002800318520205300346592002802399506003702427653012602464653004202590700002902632700002502661700003002686773011302716856008902829852000902918655001202927IND60739370520221215143048.0200806s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073937052DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2020.54.1.25782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGALÁN, RUBÉN DEL BARRIO10aDifferentiation of Spanish red wines by their Protected Designation of Origin or their category using physico-chemical parameters  aResource is Open Access  aAim: The aim of the work was to determine the physico-chemical variables that allow differentiating the red wines from “Castilla y León” Spanish region by their Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and wine category (young, “oak”, “crianza”, “reserve”). Methods and results: One hundred and thirty five commercial red wines from four Spanish PDOs sited in the region of Castilla and León were analysed. Forty physico-chemical parameters, related with classical enological parameters, phenolic and polysacharidic composition, and content of higher alcohols were evaluated. Differences in physico-chemical composition were found in red wines from different PDOs and different category. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) was applied to find a linear combination of the physico-chemical variables that separate and classify the red wines according to the PDO or category. One SLDA model selected fifteen physico-chemical variables that allowed a good discrimination and classification of the wines from different PDOs, and the other selected seven variables that discriminate between young wines and aged wines (“crianza” and “reserve”). Conclusions: Total polyphenols, total tannins, and absorbance values at 230 nm and 280 nm were the variables that most contributed to the separation of Tempranillo red wines. Polysaccharides with an average molecular weight of 10 kDa, flavanols, stilbenes and 2-methyl-1-butanol were the most associated with the differentiation of the wines elaborated with Mencía grape variety. The percentage of polymeric anthocyanins and absorbance at 230 nm could be proposed as good indicators for aged wines, and total tannins for young wines. Significance and impact of the study: This study reports a better knowledge of the physico-chemical variables that could be used as markers of the origin of wines and/or the grape variety (Tempranillo and Mencía). This study also reports the physico-chemical variables that allow differentiating young wines from those aged for a long time.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aRed wine categories; Protected Designation of Origin; phenolic compounds; polysaccharides; higher alcohols; organic acids 0astepwise linear discriminant analysis1 aPÉREZ-MAGARIÑO, SILVIA1 aHERRERA, MARTA BUENO1 aPEDRO LÓPEZ DE LA CUESTA0 tOENO One.g2020, v. 54, no. 1dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2020.54.1.25783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013500164300001600299520192800315592002802243650001302271650001702284650002002301650001402321650001502335650001102350650001102361650001502372650002402387650002002411650001902431650002502450650001202475650001302487650001502500650001402515650002902529651001002558700002202568773009702590856008502687852000902772655001202781IND60581021920221123032619.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058102192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNox, Rain10aWildfire mitigation behavior on single family residential properties near Balcones Canyonlands Preserve wildlands in Austin, Texas  ap. 222-233.  aWildfires have become an increasingly important issue in central Texas as more people move to the wildland-urban interface. Although mitigation can reduce the risk of damage from wildfire, not all homeowners choose to mitigate. Using the area surrounding the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve wildlands in Austin, Texas as a case study, this research examined the factors that lead to homeowners' decisions to or not to mitigate for wildfires. In particular, this study examined the difference between behavioral intention and behavior relating to wildfire mitigation.Study methods included a mail survey of residents living in subdivisions adjacent to the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve wildlands. This study adopted the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the conceptual framework to explain homeowners' behaviors and intentions. Statistical analysis was performed on survey responses relating to the conceptual variables in the TPB model. The Intention model indicated that Attitude was the most important variable (40.6% of total variance) relating to Intention, followed by Subjective Norm (10.1%), and Behavioral Control (1.3%). Risk Perception and Residency explained an additional 2.2% of the total variance.The Behavior models indicated that only Intention and Subjective Norm were predictors for Mitigation Behavior 1 (keeping gutters and roof free of leaves, needles, and branches), only Intention and Behavioral Control were predictors for Mitigation Behavior 2 (keeping tree limbs pruned at least 10 feet from the roof), and only Intention was a predictor for Mitigation Behavior 3 (keeping dead vegetation cleared within 30 feet of the house). The models explained 52.4% of the variance in performance of Mitigation Behavior 1, 38.9% in Mitigation Behavior 2, and 42.2% in Mitigation Behavior 3. The models were better at predicting respondents who did perform mitigation behaviors compared with those who did not.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3acase studies 3afire prevention 3ageography 3ahomeowners 3aleaves 3amodels 3aprediction 3aresidential housing 3arisk perception 3arisk reduction 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 3avariance 3avegetation 3awildfires 3awildland-urban interface 3aTexas1 aMyles, Colleen C.0 tApplied geography.g2017 Oct., v. 87 p.222-233dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011000166300001800276520064900294592002800943650001500971650001400986650002201000650001401022650002301036650001201059650001101071650001601082700001401098700001501112700001701127773009901144856008601243852000901329655001201338IND60577641020221121233250.0170810e20170418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057764102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b040682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Zhibin10aFabrication of Orientation-Tunable Si Nanowires on Silicon Pyramids with Omnidirectional Light Absorption  ap. 3569-3575.  aIn this work, the different orientation of SiNWs on Si pyramids by a two step MACE method have been fabricated.

However, these restraint methods may cause animal stress. The aim of this study was to determine whether the CT appearance of the lungs differs for ball pythons in a curled position vs. tube restraint. Whole body CT was performed on ten clinically healthy ball pythons, first in curled and then in straight positions restrained in a tube. Curved multiplanar reformatted (MPR) lung images from curled position scans were compared with standard MPR lung images from straight position scans. Lung attenuation and thickness were measured at three locations for each scan. Time for positioning and scanning was 12 ± 5 min shorter for curled snakes compared to tube restraint. Lung parenchyma thickness and attenuation declined from cranial to caudal on both straight and curled position images. Mean lung parenchyma thickness was greater in curled images at locations 1 (P = 0.048) and 3 (P = 0.044). Mean lung parenchyma thickness decreased between location 1 and 2 by 86–87% (straight: curled) and between location 1 and 3 by 51‐50% (straight: curled). Mean lung attenuation at location 1 was significantly greater on curled position images than tube restraint images (P = 0.043). Findings indicated that CT evaluation of the lungs is feasible for ball pythons positioned in curled recumbency if curved MPR is available. However, lung parenchyma thickness and attenuation in some locations may vary from those acquired using tube restraint.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPython regius 3aanesthesia 3aanimal stress 3acomputed tomography 3alungs 3asnakes 2aAnimals 2aBoidaexanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aLungxradiography. 2aMale 2aPosture 2aProspective Studies 2aTomography, X-Ray Computedxveterinary1 aEatwell, Kevin1 aSchwarz, Tobias0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2014 July, v. 55, no. 4 p.380-386dBlackwell SciencewJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.121403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245006200171300001300233506002800246520141300274592002801687506003701715650000801752650001001760650002301770650001101793650001201804650001001816650002901826650001101855650002001866650000901886651001401895653001001909653001101919653001901930653002101949653000801970700002201978700001802000773014502018856008102163852000902244655001202253IND60744811320221207083710.0210704e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074481132DNAL7 a10.20543/mkkp.v37i1.63072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanifarianty, Sherly14aThe eﬀect of additive dosages on crepe quality produced  ap. 7-16.  aResource is Open Access  aThin Pale Crepe (TPC) products are currently increasing in demand by rubber product manufacturers. Its production process is relatively more efcient than crumb rubber, which is Indonesia’s main product. The drying of TPC products still uses air drying from the burning of rubberwood. The use of rubberwood is predicted to be less economical in the future. With an increasing limited natural forest, rubberwood will be an alternative substitute for wood from natural forests. As a result, the economic value of rubberwood will be even greater which will have an impact on the increasing cost of TPC products if it continues to use rubberwood as fuel. Therefore, we need an alternative to rubberwood as an energy source for drying TPC. Sunlight can be an alternative source of energy that can be maximized for the drying process of natural rubber, including in TPC production. This research was conducted in two stages, namely 1) the production of TPC using latex from various clones with several additive dosages, and 2) TPC drying using various renewable energy sources. The results of research activities are in the form of a technology package regarding the TPC production process using renewable energy sources. The results showed that the TPC products produced with various treatments fulflled SNI 1903-2000. The three clones BPM 24, PB 260, and GT 1) were able to produce TPC with bright yellow color.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3acolor 3aeconomic valuation 3aenergy 3aforests 3alatex 3arenewable energy sources 3arubber 3asolar radiation 3awood 3aIndonesia 0acrepe 0adrying 0anatural rubber 0arenewable energy 0atpc1 aVachlepi, Afrizal1 aPurbaya, Mili0 tMajalah kulit, karet, dan plastik.g2021 June, v. 37, no. 1 p.7-16dCenter for Leather, Rubber, and PlasticswJournal:27776x2460-44617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20543/mkkp.v37i1.63073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009400170500001900264520180300283592002802086650002002114650001102134650001102145650001602156650001602172650002502188650002302213650001302236650001102249650001402260650000902274650001502283650001102298650001702309650002202326650001702348650001102365650001202376650001802388650002002406650001702426651001202443653001302455653001002468653002102478653002602499700003202525700005602557773010902613856008602722852000902808655001202817IND60731435220221116201151.0210401e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073143522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1101122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzabó, Andrea14aThe influence of hail net on the water balance and leaf pigment content of apple orchards  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aApple production accounts for 60–65 % of all fruit production in Hungary, as one of the most important areas of the fruit production sector. Extreme weather conditions in the continental climate can cause significant problems in apple production. The most important solutions to decrease their effects are irrigation and hail net. In addition to protection against hail damage, the hail net has effect on microclimatic factors, its shading effect has a positive effect on the growth of fruit trees and it reduces the risk of sunburn and transpiration. The aim of our research was to evaluate the effect of hail net on the water balance of Early Gold and Golden Reinders microclimatic factors on the basis of thermal imaging, water potential measurement, canopy dry matter content and to analyze the effect on pigment content. The research was carried out on a weekly basis in July and August 2019 at the Horticultural Unit of Pallag, University of Debrecen, Hungary. Based on our results, the air temperature was 2.91 % lower (p = 0.150) and the relative humidity was 3.16 % higher (p = 0.0001) under the hail net. Results also revealed that the foliage temperature was 7.28 % lower (p = 0.006), the water potential value of the foliage was 20.80 % higher (p = 0.399) under the hail net, while the dry matter content of the leaf was 4.76 % lower than in orchards outside the hail net. Canopy chlorophyll concentration was 10.24 % (p = 0.066) higher and carotenoid values were also higher (16.24 %, p = 0.004) in hail net protected circumstances. Based on the results, the hail net has a favorable effect on the water balance of apple orchards and pigment content of apple leaves through microclimatic conditions, partially offsetting the negative effects caused by summer heat and drought stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aapples 3acanopy 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acontinental climates 3adry matter content 3afruiting 3afruits 3ahail nets 3aheat 3airrigation 3aleaves 3amicroclimate 3arelative humidity 3astorm damage 3asummer 3asunburn 3atranspiration 3awater potential 3awater stress 3aHungary 0aHail net 0aApple 0aWater management 0aMicroclimatic factors1 aTamás, János,d1936-1995,1 aNagy, Attila1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1220-82310 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 June 01, v. 283 p.110112-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1101123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245011400156520190700270592002802177650002102205650001202226650001302238650001602251650001102267650001502278650000802293650001802301650002102319650002102340650001302361650001302374650002102387650002602408650001502434650001402449650001302463650002302476650001702499650001602516650001902532651001002551700001902561700001702580700001702597700001902614773011702633856007602750852000902826655001202835IND60682732020221123002920.0200720e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068273202DNAL7 a10.3390/land90100102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Pujia 10aShort Term Effects of Revegetation on Labile Carbon and Available Nutrients of Sodic Soils in Northeast China  aIn response to land degradation and the decline of farmers’ income, some low quality croplands were converted to forage or grassland in Northeast China. However, it is unclear how such land use conversions influence soil nutrients. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the influences of short term conversion of cropland to alfalfa forage, monoculture Leymus chinensis grassland, monoculture Leymus chinensis grassland for hay, and successional regrowth grassland on the labile carbon and available nutrients of saline sodic soils in northeastern China. Soil labile oxidizable carbon and three soil available nutrients (available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium) were determined at the 0–50 cm depth in the five land uses. Results showed that the treatments of alfalfa forage, monoculture grassland, monoculture grassland for hay, and successional regrowth grassland increased the soil labile oxidizable carbon contents (by 32%, 28%, 15%, and 32%, respectively) and decreased the available nitrogen contents (by 15%, 19%, 34%, and 27%, respectively) in the 0–50 cm depth compared with cropland, while the differences in the contents of available phosphorus and available potassium were less pronounced. No significant differences in stratification ratios of soil labile carbon and available nutrients, the geometric means of soil labile carbon and available nutrients, and the sum scores of soil labile carbon and available nutrients were observed among the five land use treatments except the stratification ratio of 0–10/20–30 cm for available phosphorus and the values of the sum scores of soil labile carbon and available nutrients in the 0–10 cm depth. These findings suggest that short term conversions of cropland to revegetation have limited influences on the soil labile carbon and available nutrients of sodic soils in northeastern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeymus chinensis 3aalfalfa 3acropland 3afarm income 3aforage 3agrasslands 3ahay 3alabile carbon 3aland degradation 3aland restoration 3aland use 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aregrowth 3asaline sodic soils 3asaline soils 3asodic soils 3asoil nutrients 3aChina1 aTang, Xuguang 1 aLiu, Shiwei 1 aLiu, Wenxin 1 aZhang, Aichun 0 tLand.g2020 Jan. 02, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land90100103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017200166300002000338520147100358592002801829596005401857650001901911650001501930650001401945650002701959650001301986650002501999650001202024650002202036650001202058650001802070700002402088700002102112700001702133773011402150856008302264852000902347655001202356IND60756307320221120220400.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075630732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04251-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarwar, Nasir10aCopper nanoparticles induced, trimesic acid grafted cellulose–an effective, non-hazardous processing approach for multifunctional textile with low chemical induction  ap. 11609-11624.  aCross-linkers have great importance in textile due to the widespread utilization of cellulosic fibers for clothing. Unfortunately, the acute toxicity of formaldehyde-based resins and the poor performance of non-formaldehyde resins still keep the research door open for scientists in this area. Herein, we demonstrated copper nanoparticles induced trimesic acid grafted cellulose as a sustainable solution for multifunctional easy-care clothing. Our treated fabric presents crease recovery angle value of 248° comparable to that of most promising citric acid-based cross-linkers at the chemical concentration of trimesic acid as low as 2% with a sweeping improvement of around 30% in strength retention, not reported earlier. The relatively low fabric stiffness, without any yellowing, is contributing to the comfort and aesthetic demand while nanoparticles induction promoting utmost antimicrobial need. For the first time, the superiority of the development was validated by interlacing the fabric/finish traits with sustainability building blocks that provide the step forward for rapid industrialization. Furthermore, environmental, health, and safety mapping comparison provides a better understanding of the intensity of hazards that different finishing crosslinkers pose on the environment and public health. With improved performance and superior sustainability, such fabric can act as a preferable alternative to the multifunctional easy-care fabric market.  aPublisher supplied data  a. 2019R1A6C1010031cKorea Basic Science Institute 3aacute toxicity 3aaesthetics 3acellulose 3achemical concentration 3aclothing 3acopper nanoparticles 3afabrics 3aindustrialization 3amarkets 3apublic health1 aBin Humayoun, Usama1 aDastgeer, Ghulam1 aYoon, Dae Ho0 tCellulose.g2021 Dec., v. 28, no. 18 p.11609-11624dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04251-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245018300175300001500358520142600373592002801799650002101827650001301848650001001861650001401871650002201885651002101907653002201928653001201950653001901962653002401981653001902005700002402024700006202048773009602110856008502206852000902291655001202300IND60581022020221122033730.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058102202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitterer, Jessica L.14aThe positive effects of increased foot patrols on the incidence of liquor infractions and assaults in the Granville Street Entertainment Area of Vancouver British Columbia Canada  ap. 97-105.  aEntertainment districts have high crime rates. Offences peak on the weekend during the operating hours of on-premises drinking establishments. To determine if proactive policing from May 1st to August 31st reduced the spatial density (kernel) or annual frequency of liquor infractions and assaults in Vancouver British Columbia Granville St. Entertainment Area (GEA) we analyzed the spatial and temporal pattern of crime pre (2006) and post (2010, 2013) the policing intervention. Crime occurred most frequently between 1:00am and 3:00am. The frequency of weekend liquor infractions significantly (α < 0.05) decreased during the proactive policing period. The magnitude of the reduction was greater for liquor infractions than assaults. Liquor infractions decreased from 121 events in 2006, to 53 events in 2010, to 91 events in 2013. Assaults decreased from 36 events in 2006, to 34 events in 2010, to 28 events in 2013. Future patrolling should focus on north-east end of Granville St. during early morning hours (1:00am-3:00am), and consider additional patrols, to increase crime reductions. In light of the recent trend to liberalize alcohol access across British Columbia we demonstrated that targeted policing strategies can reduce alcohol-attributable crime. We also provide fine temporal and spatial scale information on the patterns of crime creating evidence-based information to support policing strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol drinking 3aalcohols 3acrime 3ageography 3aissues and policy 3aBritish Columbia 0aliquor infraction 0aassault 0akernel density 0apolice intervention 0apolice patrols1 aNelson, Trisalyn A.1 aStockwell, Timothy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5696-68030 tApplied geography.g2017 Oct., v. 87 p.97-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007200172300001600244520124100260592002801501650002801529650001001557650001401567650001601581650001201597650003101609650002601640650001501666650001201681650001901693650002001712650002001732650001201752650001601764653002301780653004801803653002701851653003501878653003401913700002201947700002101969700001801990700001802008700005402026773009602080856008702176852000902263655001202272IND60639434020221118044040.0191227e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063943402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerhervé, S.O.10aOnline non-contact quality control of noodle dough using ultrasound  ap. 349-357.  aThe development of a non-contract ultrasonic technique is reported for online quality control of noodle dough without compromising food safety during production. The technique uses airborne ultrasound to measure mechanical properties of the dough without touching or deforming it; thus, food safety cannot be endangered during processing by contamination arising from direct contact with monitoring equipment. Measured mechanical properties are related to the texture of the final product, thereby providing information during processing that is relevant to product quality. The technique was first assessed in laboratory experiments and then tested online during production runs on a pilot plant noodle sheeting line. It was found that differences in mechanical properties of noodle doughs resulting from changes in formulation or processing conditions can be distinguished, and that flaws arising from thickness fluctuations in noodle sheets can be detected. These offline and online experiments show the feasibility of using non-contact ultrasound for real-time hygienic quality monitoring of noodles at critical control points in the sheeting process, thereby providing rapid feedback for improvements in process design and control.  aPublisher supplied data 3acritical control points 3adough 3aequipment 3afood safety 3ahygiene 3alaboratory experimentation 3amechanical properties 3amonitoring 3anoodles 3aprocess design 3aproduct quality 3aquality control 3atexture 3aultrasonics 0aAsian noodle dough 0aProcess control technique for sheeted foods 0aNon-contact ultrasound 0aMechanical properties of dough 0aHygienic food quality control1 aGuillermic, R.-M.1 aStrybulevych, A.1 aHatcher, D.W.1 aScanlon, M.G.1 aPage, J.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4104-24480 tFood control.g2019 Oct., v. 104 p.349-357dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245006700157520139100224592002801615650001701643650001201660650002001672650001501692650001201707650002301719650001201742650002301754650002201777650002201799650002001821650001201841650002101853650001401874650002301888651001101911651001301922700001801935700001801953700001601971700001801987700002202005773011702027856007602144852000902220655001202229IND60682732220221123003112.0200720e20200103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068273222DNAL7 a10.3390/land90100122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuden, A.S.10aBiodiversity Impacts of Increased Ethanol Production in Brazil  aGrowing domestic and international ethanol demand is expected to result in increased sugarcane cultivation in Brazil. Sugarcane expansion currently results in land-use changes mainly in the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes, two severely threatened biodiversity hotspots. This study quantifies potential biodiversity impacts of increased ethanol demand in Brazil in a spatially explicit manner. We project changes in potential total, threatened, endemic, and range-restricted mammals’ species richness up to 2030. Decreased potential species richness due to increased ethanol demand in 2030 was projected for about 19,000 km² in the Cerrado, 17,000 km² in the Atlantic Forest, and 7000 km² in the Pantanal. In the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, the biodiversity impacts of sugarcane expansion were mainly due to direct land-use change; in the Pantanal, they were largely due to indirect land-use change. The biodiversity impact of increased ethanol demand was projected to be smaller than the impact of other drivers of land-use change. This study provides a first indication of biodiversity impacts related to increased ethanol production in Brazil, which is useful for policy makers and ethanol producers aiming to mitigate impacts. Future research should assess the impact of potential mitigation options, such as nature protection, agroforestry, or agricultural intensification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3acerrado 3acrop production 3aecosystems 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aforests 3aindigenous species 3aintensive farming 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3amammals 3aspecies richness 3asugarcane 3athreatened species 3aBrazil 3aPantanal1 aVerweij, P.A.1 aFaaij, A.P.C.1 aBaisero, D.1 aRondinini, C.1 avan der Hilst, F.0 tLand.g2020 Jan. 03, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land90100123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014600166500001900312520182400331592002802155650001902183650001002202650001402212650002402226650001102250650001402261650001502275650001902290650001402309650000902323651001002332653002402342653001102366653002902377700001602406700001702422700001602439700001902455700001802474700001802492773010902510856008602619852000902705655001202714IND60731435420221116201218.0210401e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073143542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1101142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaxia10aEffects of exogenous germanium and effective microorganisms on germanium accumulation and nutritional qualities of garlic (Allium sativum L.)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganic germanium (Ge) compounds show vital beneficial effects for our health and are widely used as medical applications and dietary supplements. Inorganic Ge can be absorbed by plants and further accumulated and transformed into organic Ge compounds in plant tissues, which can be further consumed as Ge-rich foods. Meantime, the presence of Ge can improve the physiological functions of plants such as the salt tolerance and the peroxidase activities in leaves. Therefore, improving the Ge content of Ge-rich plants by fertilizing exogenous inorganic Ge is of important and an efficient way to obtain more organic germanium. Garlic is one of the natural Ge-rich plants and possesses prodigious medicinal and nutraceutical properties. The main edible parts of garlic include bulb, scape and seedling in China. However, the effects of exogenous Ge on the Ge accumulation and nutritional qualities of garlic are not apparent, and the suitable applying concentrations and frequencies are also poorly known. Here, using garlic cultivar G024 and GeO₂ as exogenous Ge, two experiments were performed to reveal the effects of exogenous Ge on garlic. Besides, a third experiment that brings in the factor of effective microorganisms (EM) inoculation was also conducted to evaluate the combined effects of exogenous Ge and EM application on garlic seedlings. Results showed that foliar spraying 6–72 mg/L GeO₂ solutions significantly affects the Ge accumulation and distribution in garlic plants; foliar spraying 9–12 mg/L GeO₂ at the bolting period is appropriate for producing the Ge-rich garlic scapes and bulbs; soil supplying 100 mg GeO₂ together with EM inoculation are suitable for obtaining Ge-rich garlic seedlings. The present study provided useful information for the field production of Ge-rich garlic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3abulbs 3acultivars 3adietary supplements 3agarlic 3agermanium 3aperoxidase 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asoil 3aChina 0aNutritional quality 0aGrowth 0aEffective microorganisms1 aPan, Yupeng1 aQi, Xiaofang1 aZhang, Siyu1 aZhi, Chengchen1 aMeng, Huanwen1 aCheng, Zhihui0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 June 01, v. 283 p.110114-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1101143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01459naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012600158300001800284520033000302592002800632650002400660650001400684650002300698650001600721650001300737650001900750650002400769650001900793700002100812700001400833700002000847700001400867773013300881856007401014852000901088655001201097IND60638676420221118050618.0190430e20160308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063867642DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc10311h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xinchun10aHighly efficient hydrogen generation from formic acid using a reduced graphene oxide-supported AuPd nanoparticle catalyst  ap. 4171-4174.  aHighly dispersed AuPd alloy nanoparticles have been successfully immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using a facile non-noble metal sacrificial method, which exhibit the highest activity at 323 K (turnover frequency, 4840 h⁻¹) for hydrogen generation without CO impurity from the formic acid/sodium formate system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3aformic acid 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen production 3asodium formate1 aPachfule, Pradip1 aChen, Yao1 aTsumori, Nobuko1 aXu, Qiang0 tChemical communications.g2016 Mar. 8, v. 52, no. 22 p.4171-4174dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc10311h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002100158245006500179300001600244500001500260520077700275592002801052650003101080650001301111650001901124650001401143650000901157650001301166650001601179650002001195650001201215650002801227650003901255650000901294650001501303650006501318650004301383650000901426650002801435650005801463650006201521650003401583653001001617700002101627700001801648773012801666856007301794852000901867655001201876IND60080479720221122070310.0140728e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008047972DNAL7 a238157702pmid7 a10.1111/vru.120742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuente, Cristian10aImaging diagnosis—spinal epidural hemangiosarcoma in a dog  ap. 424-427.  a2019-12-06  aAn 8‐year‐old, male Boxer was examined for an acute onset of ambulatory paraparesis. Neurologic examination was consistent with a T3‐L3 myelopathy. Myelography revealed an extradural spinal cord compression in the region of the T10‐T13 vertebrae. On magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, a well‐defined epidural mass lesion was detected. The mass was mildly hyperintense on T1‐weighted, hyperintense on T2‐weighted and STIR images compared to normal spinal cord and enhanced strongly and homogenously. Postmortem examination confirmed a primary epidural hemangiosarcoma. Findings indicated that the MRI characteristics of spinal epidural hemangiosarcoma may mimic other lesions including meningioma and epidural hemorrhages/hematomas of non‐neoplastic etiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aetiology 3aimage analysis 3avertebrae 3adogs 3anecropsy 3aspinal cord 3ahemangiosarcoma 2aAnimals 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxetiology. 2aDogs 2aEuthanasia 2aHematoma, Epidural, Spinalxdiagnosisxetiologyxveterinary. 2aMagnetic Resonance Imagingxveterinary 2aMale 2aMyelographyxveterinary 2aParaplegiaxdiagnosisxetiologyxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aSpinal Cord Compressionxdiagnosisxetiologyxveterinary. 2aThoracic Vertebraexpathology 0aBoxer1 aPumarola, Martí1 aAñor, Sònia0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2014 July, v. 55, no. 4 p.424-427dBlackwell SciencewJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.120743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01378naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014600156300001800302520030500320592002800625650002300653650001200676650001400688650001300702650002100715700001800736700001600754700001700770700001600787700002000803773013400823856007400957852000901031655001201040IND60638676520221118050523.0190430e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063867652DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc10315k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Yanmei10aLithium ion intercalation of 3-D vertical hierarchical TiO₂ nanotubes on a titanium mesh for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting  ap. 4541-4544.  aIn this communication, we report for the first time the demonstration of a lithium ion intercalation strategy to significantly enhance the photoelectrochemical water splitting performance on 3-dimensional vertical hierarchical top-porous-bottom-tubular TiO₂ nanotubes on a fabricable titanium mesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3alithium 3ananotubes 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide1 aCheng, Yuxiao1 aZhou, Yuyan1 aLi, Zhenzhen1 aWu, Hongjun1 aZhang, Zhonghai0 tChemical communications.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 52, no. 24 p.4541-4544dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc10315k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003000112245016900142300001600311506002800327520133000355592002801685506003701713650001301750650000901763650001601772650001501788650003501803650001901838650001901857650002501876653001601901653004201917653000901959700002701968700001501995773012902010852000902139655001202148IND60739371120221207113810.0210420e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073937112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasouli-Sadaghiani, M.

The factors were including P sources (tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and rock phosphate (RP)) and microbial inoculation (control, soluble P as KH2PO4 (Ps), inoculation with bacteria (PSB), inoculation with fungi (PSF), co-inoculation of PSB + PSF). At the end of growth period, plant dry weight and P content in plant and soil available-P were measured and then PACE, PUTE and phosphorus efficiency (PE) indices were calculated. The results showed that, the interaction of phosphate source and microbial inoculation was significant with respect to shoot P content, soil P, PUTE and PE. PSF-TCP treatment increased 7 times shoot phosphorus content compared to cont-RP treatment. PUTE in Cont-TCP treatment was 2.35 times higher than the TCP-PS. The inoculation of PSF increased the PACE 1.61 times compared to co-inoculation of PSB + PSF tretment. Also, the highest PE index (99%) was obtained from SF-TCP treatment. In general, in calcareous soils with low P availability, inoculation of PSM with insoluble phosphorus sources can meet the phosphate needs of the plant.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agreenhouses 3aphosphorus 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3arock phosphate 3asolubilization 3atricalcium phosphate 0aphosphorous 0aphosphate-solubilizing microorganisms 0acorn1 aKarimabad, R.

A conductive polymer, polypyrrole, was successfully incorporated into the pectin/BC hydrogel composite as a host of drug encapsulation for controlled release under applied electric field. Ibuprofen as a model drug was studied for its release behavior based on the effects of matrix composition, pH stimulation, matrix mesh size, and applied electrical potential by using a modified Franz diffusion cell. The drug release was optimized at 30 wt% BC and increased with applying electrical potential. The highest amount of drug release was 78% which was obtained on a drug-loaded polypyrrole-incorporated composite under applied electrical potential at 7 V. The hydrogel composites also presented the remarkable benefit of antibacterial activity for gram-positive bacteria. Thus, the hydrogel composites are valuable alternative materials for transdermal drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3acellulose 3aelectric field 3aencapsulation 3ahydrogels 3aibuprofen 3apH 3apectins 3apolymers 3apyrroles1 aImae, Toyoko,d1942-1 aParadee, Nophawan0 tCellulose.g2021 Dec., v. 28, no. 18 p.11451-11463dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04259-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245015200161300001600313520171900329592002802048650000902076650001602085650001302101650002302114650001802137650001502155650001902170650001802189650001502207650001902222650001102241650001402252650002202266650001502288650001602303651001002319700002002329700002202349700002402371700002002395773010102415856007302516852000902589655001202598IND60080479820221122070238.0140728e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008047982DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.121012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Futoshi14aThe Significance of Meander Restoration for the Hydrogeomorphology and Recovery of Wetland Organisms in the Kushiro River, a Lowland River in Japan  ap. 544-554.  aThe meanders and floodplains of the Kushiro River were restored in March 2011. A 1.6‐km stretch of the straightened main channel was remeandered by reconnecting the cutoff former channel and backfilling the straightened reach, and a 2.4‐km meander channel was restored. Additionally, flood levees were removed to promote river–floodplain interactions. There were four objectives of this restoration project: to restore the in‐stream habitat for native fish and invertebrates; to restore floodplain vegetation by increasing flooding frequency and raising the groundwater table; to reduce sediment and nutrient loads in the core wetland areas; to restore a river–floodplain landscape typical to naturally meandering rivers. In this project, not only the natural landscape of a meandering river but also its function was successfully restored. The monitoring results indicated that these goals were likely achieved in the short term after the restoration. The abundance and species richness of fish and invertebrate species increased, most likely because the lentic species that formerly inhabited the cutoff channel remained in the backwater and deep pools created in the restored reach. In addition, lotic species immigrated from neighboring reaches. The removal of flood levees and backfilling of the formerly straightened reach were very effective in increasing the frequency of flooding over the floodplains and raising the water table. The wetland vegetation recovered rapidly 1 year after the completion of the meander restoration. Sediment‐laden floodwater spread over the floodplain, and approximately 80–90% of the fine sediment carried by the water was filtered out by the wetland vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvertebrates 3alandscapes 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3amonitoring 3apollution load 3arivers 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation 3awater table 3aJapan1 aIshiyama, Nobuo1 aSueyoshi, Masanao1 aNegishi, Junjiro N.1 aAkasaka, Takumi0 tRestoration ecology.g2014 July, v. 22, no. 4 p.544-554dWiley Periodicals, Incx1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.121013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009600168300001600264520116300280592002801443650002301471650001501494650001001509650001401519650002001533650002401553650002101577650001201598650001701610653001501627653001501642653002101657653002501678700001901703700001801722700001801740700001601758773010801774856008601882852000901968655001201977IND60581022520221120044015.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058102252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2017.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Chun-Wei10aNumerical study on wave attenuation inside and around a square array of biofouled net cages  ap. 180-189.  aIn this study, waves propagating through a square array of 16 net cages with different levels of biofouling are numerically studied using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. A porous-media fluid model is adopted to simulate both clean and biofouled netting of a cage array in waves. A numerical wave tank is built, and the oscillating-boundary method is adopted to generate waves. The flow motion is solved by the Navier-Stokes equations, and the free water surface is captured using the volume of fluid (VOF) method. The numerical model is validated by comparing the numerical data with corresponding experimental measurements of a net-cage model with clean netting. To analyze wave attenuation, a numerical analysis of wave elevation both inside and around the cage arrays is presented, which considers the effect of biofouling. Based on the results of the present study, the effect of biofouling on wave elevation is noticeable; the damping effect of the cage array increases with increasing level of biofouling. Furthermore, the incident angle of waves has a noticeable effect on the wave field inside and around the cage array.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangle of incidence 3abiofouling 3acages 3aequations 3afluid mechanics 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3anetting 3aporous media 0aCage array 0aBiofouling 0aWave attenuation 0aNumerical simulation1 aZhao, Yun-Peng1 aDong, Guo-Hai1 aXu, Tiao-Jian1 aGui, Fu-Kun0 tAquacultural engineering.g2017 Aug., v. 78 p.180-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2017.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012500164300002000289520155500309592002801864650001401892650003101906650001301937650002401950650001601974650001401990650002102004650001302025650000902038700001802047700005702065700005602122700002002178773011402198856008302312852000902395655001202404IND60756308020221120230452.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075630802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04214-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuh, Eugene10aRISM-assisted analysis of role of alkali metal hydroxides in the solvation of cellulose in alkali/urea aqueous solutions  ap. 11247-11259.  aThe three-dimensional reference interaction site model theory with the Kovalenko–Hirata closure (3D-RISM–KH) combined with the Kirkwood–Buff integral (KBI) was used to clarify the role of alkali metal hydroxides (MOHs) in cellulose solvation in alkali/urea aqueous solutions. Pair distribution functions, KBI, and the excess number of MOHs showed that M⁺ hydrates were formed close to cellulose and that their distance was the same as the distance between M⁺ ions and water molecules in the hydrates. The most stable Li⁺ hydrate due to the highest Li⁺ charge density was the closest to the cellulose resulting in the most electrostatic interaction and possibly hydrogen bonding with the cellulose. However, K⁺ had the lowest charge density, formed the least stable hydrate, and had the least interaction with the cellulose. Hence, the direct solvation energy, which is part of the cellulose solvation energy and accounts for the solute–solvent interaction, was the most negative in the LiOH/urea solution. The solvent reorganization energy—which is another part of the cellulose solvation energy and arises from the clustering of urea, water, and MOH (i.e., ion hydrates) around cellulose—was the most negative in the LiOH/urea solution because of the highest probability and the closest positioning of the Li⁺ hydrate to the cellulose. Therefore, the calculation results obtained using 3D-RISM–KH and KBI explained the difference among the cellulose solubilities in the LiOH/urea, NaOH/urea, and KOH/urea aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen 3amathematical theory 3aprobability 3asolvation 3asolvation energy 3asolvents 3aurea1 aYang, Ji-Hyun1 aLee, Chang-Ha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8769-79361 aAhn, Ik-Sung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1347-20371 aMhin, Byung Jin0 tCellulose.g2021 Dec., v. 28, no. 18 p.11247-11259dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04214-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009700170300001800267520144900285592002801734650004401762650000801806650001901814650001501833650002201848650001201870650001501882650001201897650002201909650002001931700002301951700001801974700001801992700002102010700001902031700002102050700001602071773009902087856008602186852000902272655001202281IND60577641720221119085324.0170810e20170418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057764172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b044712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVrancken, Nandi10aSuperhydrophobic Breakdown of Nanostructured Surfaces Characterized in Situ Using ATR–FTIR  ap. 3601-3609.  aIn situ characterization of the underwater stability of superhydrophobic micro- and nanostructured surfaces is important for the development of self-cleaning and antifouling materials. In this work, we demonstrate a novel attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR–FTIR) spectroscopy-based method for large-area wetting characterization of silicon nanopillars. When air is present in between the structures, as is characteristic of the Cassie–Baxter state, the relative intensities of the water bands in the absorption spectrum change because of the wavelength-dependent attenuation of the evanescent wave. This phenomenon enables unambiguous identification of the wetting state and assessment of liquid impalement. Using mixtures of isopropanol and water with different concentrations, the breakdown of superhydrophobic states and the wetting hysteresis effects are systematically studied on uniform arrays of silicon nanopillars. A transition from the Cassie–Baxter to Wenzel state is observed when the isopropanol concentration exceeds 2.8 mol %, corresponding to a critical surface tension of 39 mN/m. Spontaneous dewetting does not occur upon decreasing the isopropanol concentration, and pure water can be obtained in a stable Wenzel state on the originally superhydrophobic substrates. The developed ATR–FTIR method can be promising for real-time monitoring of the wetting kinetics on nanostructured surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aair 3ahydrophobicity 3ahysteresis 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aliquids 3amonitoring 3asilicon 3aspectral analysis 3asurface tension1 aSergeant, Stefanie1 aVereecke, Guy1 aDoumen, Geert1 aHolsteyns, Frank1 aTerryn, Herman1 aDe Gendt, Stefan1 aXu, Xiumei,0 tLangmuir.g2017 Apr. 18, v. 33, no. 15 p.3601-3609dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b044713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012300168300001800291520120000309592002801509650002401537650002401561650002101585650002101606650001101627650002901638650001101667650001701678650001101695650001201706650002301718650001101741650001001752653001701762653002101779653000901800653001801809700001701827700001701844700001201861700001901873773012101892856008602013852000902099655001202108IND60749875620221119063202.0210910e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074987562DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2020.17377352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHungría, J.10aAnaerobic co-digestion of winery waste: comparative assessment of grape marc waste and lees derived from organic crops  ap. 3618-3626.  aGrapes are one the world’s leading fruit crops, with close to 77 million tonnes harvested per year. Grapes are commonly used to produce wine; a process which generates different wastes such as grape mark waste (skins, seeds and stalks), lees and other residues. This study evaluates the treatment of winery waste derived from ecological cultivation by anaerobic digestion to produce energy in the form of methane. Grape marc waste, Verdejo and Pedro Ximenez (PX) wine lees were digested under stable conditions at mesophilic conditions. The PX lees showed the highest methane yield production (433 LSTP CH₄/kg VS) with a maximum OLR of 4.58 kg VS/m³·d. In the evaluated range the process was stable with a range of biodegradability of 51–79%. Due to different types of winery waste are generated at consecutive stages of the main production process, the sequential treatment of PX lees, Verdejo lees and grape marc waste in the same anaerobic digester could be an interesting option. This procedure would facilitate the management of the residual streams generated in wineries during the year and promotes the circular economy in the Montilla-Moriles Protected Designation of Origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3acircular economy 3aenergy 3aenvironmental technology 3afruits 3agrape pomace 3agrapes 3amethane 3amethane production 3awastes 3awines 0aWinery waste 0agrape marc waste 0alees 0aorganic crops1 aSiles, J.

After 9 weeks of operation, the COD, BOD, ammonia and color values have been declined by 89.2%, 98.3%, 99.61% and 99.81%, respectively, While SEM-EDX results showed a variance in weight percent of various elements in TDR without biofilm i.e. raw TDR media, as well as in the 1st and 9th-week samples. Moreover, fine and strong peaks were observed in both the MB simulated wastewater and 9th week TDR samples at 1190, 1300, 1400, 1450, 1500 and 1618 cm⁻¹ respectively by Raman Spectroscopic analysis. Further, FTIR analysis was performed for the MB simulated wastewater, and absorbance peaks ranging from 1591 to 1363 cm⁻¹ and 3410 cm⁻¹ were observed in all the samples with different intensities. To assess the biodeterioration of the TDR media, ATR was performed for the raw, 1st, 2nd and 9th week TDR media samples and in the raw TDR, two important bands, 842 and 2962 cm⁻¹ were noticed representing –CH = CH and –CH₃. A clear variation of bands and peak intensities were observed in different support media samples. The results indicate that TDR media is a resilient, chemically resistant material and could be employed for the biofilm growth for biological treatment of textile dye wastewater.  aThis research project was funded jointly by the British Council, UK and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), MHRD, India under the Newton Bhabha Fellowship Program.  aPublisher supplied data  a345740936  a345740936 3aabsorbance 3aammonia 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3abiological treatment 3abioremediation 3acolor 3aenvironmental technology 3afabrics 3amethylene blue 3arubber 3aspectral analysis 3avariance 3awastewater 0aTire derived rubber (TDR) 0aMethylene blue dye wastewater1 aNaz, Iffat1 aAnand Kishore, K.1 aSaroj, Devendra0 tEnvironmental technology.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 42, no. 23 p.3627-3640dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2020.17377363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245007800157520125800235592002801493650001501521650001601536650001001552650001601562650001501578651001301593700002401606773011701630856007601747852000901823655001201832IND60682732820221123002958.0200720e20200111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068273282DNAL7 a10.3390/land90100182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJusto, Rui 14aThe Role of Vegetation in the Morphological Decoding of Lisbon (Portugal)  aIn the academic context, especially in the fields of architecture, landscape architecture, and urbanism, urban form studies are assumed to be a vehicle for reflection on the built and unbuilt city. This essay aims to challenge the most common and stabilized morphological approaches in the city reading process, invoking vegetation and its role as an element of urban composition that is recurrently left out of it. Methodologically, this work uses the city of Lisbon to carry out a morphological characterization of different homogeneous areas based on a decomposition process of urban systems and elements. The article focuses on the reading of the public component of three homogeneous areas in Lisbon—Alfama, Avenidas and Alvalade—and specifically on the role of urban greenery as a systemic element of the formal or informal composition of the city. Through an initial systematization process reflects upon the formal attributes of vegetation and trees in particular, this research may contribute not only to the development of the discipline of urban morphology applied to the city of Lisbon but also to the acknowledgment of urban greenery as a contributor to the creation of specific, unique, and unrepeatable spaces within urban landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3atrees 3aurban areas 3avegetation 3aPortugal1 aMatos Silva, Maria 0 tLand.g2020 Jan. 11, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land90100183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011700169300001400286520129600300592002801596650001601624650002101640650003101661650001301692650001501705650004101720650002901761650004401790650001601834653002101850653002501871653001501896653006201911700001301973700001801986700001102004700005502015773009402070856008702164852000902251655001202260IND60639434720221118044017.0190711e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063943472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chunjian10aSimultaneous detection of 4(5)-methylimidazole and acrylamide in biscuit products by isotope-dilution UPLC-MS/MS  ap. 64-70.  aAn ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of 4(5)-methylimidazole (4-MI) and acrylamide (AA) in biscuit products. The samples were extracted with methanol followed by dispersive primary secondary amine clean-up. The analytes were separated by reverse phase liquid chromatography, detected by tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, and quantified using internal standards of deuterium-labeled d6-4-MI and d3-AA. The method was validated with respect to linearity, limits of quantification, precision, trueness and measurement uncertainty. Good linearity (R2 > 0.999) for all calibration curves was obtained. The mean recoveries were from 93 to 108% for the analytes, with coefficients of variation less than 9.2% being observed. The limits of quantification of 5 and 10 ng/g were also achieved for 4-MI and AA, respectively. The expanded measurement uncertainty for these compounds was below 19%. Finally, the method has been applied to the analysis of 17 commercial biscuit samples, revealing that the wide presence of 4-MI and AA in biscuit products. The proposed method proved to be a reliable and sensitive tool for 4-MI and AA measurements in biscuit products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3achemical species 3aisotope dilution technique 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3auncertainty 0aIsotope-dilution 0a4(5)-Methylimidazole 0aAcrylamide 0aUltra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry1 aWang, Li1 aGuo, Xiaobing1 aLi, He1 aYu, Shujuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7958-00570 tFood control.g2019 Nov., v. 105 p.64-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245017300212300002000385520068000405592002801085650001601113650002301129650002301152650001301175650001201188650001401200700005501214700006401269773013601333856007901469852000901548655001201557IND60669578120221119042934.0190920e20190830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066957812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b019242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSontakke, Geetanjali S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1253-364010aRh(II)-Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transannulation of N-Sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazolyl Cyclohexadienones for the Synthesis of Benzofurans and Cyclopropa[cd]indole-carbaldehydes  ap. 12198-12208.  aA rhodium-catalyzed intramolecular denitrogenative transannulation of N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazole-tethered cyclohexadienones has been achieved for the synthesis of benzofurans and cyclopropa[cd]indole-carbaldehydes in an operationally simple procedure. Remarkably, the reaction pathway is fully dependent on the linker heteroatom (O or N) present between the cyclohexadienone unit and triazole moiety. In the case of O-linked triazoles, a cascade sequence consisting of intramolecular cyclopropanation and rearrangement takes place, leading to the formation of benzofurans, while, in the case of N-linked triazoles, cyclopropa[cd]indole-carbaldehydes were isolated exclusively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzofurans 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3amoieties 3arhodium 3atriazoles1 aPal, Kuntal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9005-08741 aVolla, Chandra M.

At least historically, pine barrens provided some of the highest quality terrestrial shrublands and young forests in the eastern North American sub‐boreal and northern temperate region. However, the mosaic open‐canopy, sparse‐shrub, and grassland early successional state is generally lacking in contemporary pine barrens. Many sites in the northeastern United States have converted to overgrown scrub oak (Quercus ilicifolia, Quercus prinoides) thickets and closed canopied pitch pine (Pinus rigida)‐dominated forests. Thinning pitch pine is a contentious issue for the imperiled pitch pine‐scrub oak barrens community type (G2 Global Rarity Rank, 6–20 occurrences). Here we provide a historical, ecological, and resource management rationale for thinning pitch pine forest to restore savanna‐like open barrens with a mosaic of scrub oaks, heath shrubs, and prairie‐like vegetation. We postulate that the contemporary dominance of pitch pine forest is largely of recent anthropogenic origin, limits habitat opportunities for at‐risk shrubland fauna, and poses a serious wildfire hazard. We suggest maintaining pitch pine‐scrub oak barrens at 10–30% average pitch pine cover to simultaneously promote shrubland biodiversity and minimize fire danger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus rigida 3aQuercus ilicifolia 3abiodiversity 3acoastal plains 3aconiferous forests 3afauna 3afire hazard 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3apine barrens 3aplant communities 3aresource management 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3atemperate zones 3awildfires 3aGreat Lakes region 3aMaine 3aNew England region 3aNew Jersey 3aNew York 3aPennsylvania1 aPatterson, William A., IIIcIII1 aGifford, Neil A.0 tRestoration ecology.g2014 July, v. 22, no. 4 p.442-446dWiley Periodicals, Incx1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.120973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011300173300001600286506002800302520117800330592002801508506003701536650001601573650001101589650001201600650001201612650001001624650003001634650001701664651001501681653001601696653001601712653001901728653001001747653002201757653001501779700001901794773019501813856008802008852000902096655001202105IND60744812720221207083715.0210629e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074481272DNAL7 a10.23885/181433262021171-1411532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasilenko, S.V.10aTo the knowledge of the fauna of geometrid moths (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) of Dzungarian Alatau, Kazakhstan  ap. 141-153.  aResource is Open Access  aThe annotated list of 133 species of geometrids (Lepidoptera) from Dzungarian Alatau in Kazakhstan is given; 42 species are recorded for this ridge for the first time.

By conducting qualitative semi‐structured interviews with visitors at a range of urban park types interspersed throughout a city, we explored vegetation preferences that may be used to improve park planning, design, and maintenance, as well as educate and engage visitors. SUMMARY: Urban parks provide numerous cultural and ecological benefits, but may not always meet diverse visitor preferences. There is a need for additional on‐site research, which has the potential to gauge vegetation preferences in a more authentic and multi‐sensory context. We asked: how does vegetation in urban parks currently meet visitor preferences? We performed on‐site semi‐structured interviews with visitors at 15 different parks of three general types (i.e., natural‐passive use, recreational‐active use, and multi‐use parks), using a case study of Portland, Oregon, a mid‐sized city in North America with a temperate climate. We transcribed the interviews and coded them for themes and patterns of meaning. Visitors across demographics groups discussed trees, size, and diversity/variety as some of their favorite aspects of the vegetation. Trees were important for visitors, particularly for their large size/shade, but vegetation preferences tended to vary across park type and slightly more than half of participants suggested changes. Many recreational‐active and multi‐use park visitors desired more flowers, color, grass, middle growth, trees, and food‐bearing plants, as well as improved placement, while visitors to natural‐passive use parks preferred additional invasive/harmful plant removal. Integrating visitor vegetation preferences into plant selection, layout, and maintenance has the potential to increase ecosystem services of urban parks. The incorporation of colorful, native flowers for visitors can also provide habitat for native species. Visitors across park types also desired to learn more about plants, and so additional interpretive signs/labels and multi‐sensory gardens can help to engage and educate visitors.  aPublisher supplied data  cOregon State University  a1444758cNational Science Foundation  cZuckerman STEM Leadership Program0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOregon 3acase studies 3acolor 3ademographic statistics 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3ahuman population 3aindigenous species 3aqualitative analysis 3arecreation users 3atemperate zones 3aurban parks 3avegetation1 aSantelmann, Mary V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1074-82371 aTilt, Jenna H.0 tPlants, people, planet.g2021 July, v. 3, no. 4 p.375-388dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27661x2572-26117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.101883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007600169300001800245520137800263592002801641650003701669650002101706650001801727650002801745650002001773650001901793650001901812650001301831650001901844650001301863650001301876650001601889700002001905700002001925700001901945773009901964856008602063852000902149655001202158IND60577639320171221000000.0170810e20170411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057763932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b001602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaure, William10aReversible Tethering of Polymers onto Catechol-Based Titanium Platforms  ap. 3434-3443.  aIn this article, we report on the reversible tethering of end-functionalized polymers onto catechol-based titanium platforms by exploiting the reversible Diels–Alder (DA) cycloaddition reaction. For this purpose, furan and maleimide end-functionalized polymers, prepared via reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, were covalently grafted through a DA reaction onto reactive titanium platforms elaborated from catechol-based anchors incorporating either the furan or the maleimide moiety. As a proof of concept, a hydrophilic poly(oligo(ethylene glycol)acrylate) (POEGA) and a hydrophobic poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl acrylate) (PTFEA) were grafted onto titanium surfaces and subsequently detached by exploiting the thermoreversible nature of the DA reaction [i.e., retro Diels–Alder (rDA)]. These polymers were interchanged by performing a second DA reaction, thereby allowing the titanium surface wettability to be switched from hydrophobic to hydrophilic on demand. The grafting of furan/maleimide end-functionalized polymers onto functionalized (maleimide/furan, respectively) catechol-based titanium platforms and the subsequent rDA/DA sequence used for switching the titanium surface were evidenced by attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical bonding 3acontact angle 3acycloaddition reactions 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atitanium 3awettability1 aFournier, David1 aWoisel, Patrice1 aLyskawa, Joël0 tLangmuir.g2017 Apr. 11, v. 33, no. 14 p.3434-3443dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b001603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002100197245008700218300001400305506007600319520188800395592002802283506003702311650001702348650001802365650002802383650001702411650001702428650002202445650002502467650001102492650001402503650001302517650001902530650001302549650002402562650001602586650004002602653002802642653003902670653003102709653002802740653002202768653003302790700002302823700001902846700003002865700002502895700002002920700006202940773007503002856009003077852000903167655001203176IND60581020120221207085803.0171005e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058102012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0212doi7 aPMC48664892pmcid7 a270612682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelair, David G.10aDifferential regulation of angiogenesis using degradable VEGF-binding microspheres  ap. 27-37.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) spatial and temporal activity must be tightly controlled during angiogenesis to form perfusable vasculature in a healing wound. The native extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates growth factor activity locally via sequestering, and researchers have used ECM-mimicking approaches to regulate the activity of VEGF in cell culture and in vivo. However, the impact of dynamic, affinity-mediated growth factor sequestering has not been explored in detail with biomaterials. Here, we sought to modulate VEGF activity dynamically over time using poly(ethylene glycol) microspheres containing VEGF-binding peptides (VBPs) and exhibiting varying degradation rates. The degradation rate of VBP microspheres conferred a differential ability to up- or down-regulate VEGF activity in culture with primary human endothelial cells. VBP microspheres with fast-degrading crosslinks reduced VEGF activity and signaling, while VBP microspheres with no inherent degradability sequestered and promoted VEGF activity in culture with endothelial cells. VBP microspheres with degradable crosslinks significantly reduced neovascularization in vivo, but neither non-degradable VBP microspheres nor bolus delivery of soluble VBP reduced neovascularization. The covalent incorporation of VBP to degradable microspheres was required to reduce neovascularization in a mouse model of choroidal neovascularization in vivo, which demonstrates a potential clinical application of degradable VBP microspheres to reduce pathological angiogenesis. The results herein highlight the ability to modulate the activity of a sequestered growth factor by changing the crosslinker identity within PEG hydrogel microspheres. The insights gained here may instruct the design and translation of affinity-based growth factor sequestering biomaterials for regenerative medicine applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal models 3abiocompatible materials 3acell culture 3acrosslinking 3aendothelial cells 3aextracellular matrix 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3amedicine 3amicroparticles 3apeptides 3apolyethylene glycol 3aresearchers 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aDegradable biomaterials 0aVascular endothelial growth factor 0aGrowth factor sequestering 0aBiomimetic microspheres 0aEndothelial cells 0aChoroidal neovascularization1 aMiller, Michael J.1 aWang, Shoujian1 aDarjatmoko, Soesiawati R.1 aBinder, Bernard Y.K.1 aSheibani, Nader1 aMurphy, William L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2145-38290 tBiomaterials.g2016 July, v. 93 p.27-37dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245021900170520152100389592002801910650001201938650001901950650001301969650001001982650001401992650000902006650002302015650000702038650002302045650001502068650001202083653001202095653001802107653001402125653003002139653003402169653002102203700002002224700002302244773011102267856008702378852000902465655001202474IND60710750020221119100140.0220103e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071075002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2020.1103522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, Tem Thi10aIndependent and combined effects of high pressure, microwave, soluble gas stabilization, modified atmosphere and vacuum packaging on microbiological and physicochemical shelf life of precooked chicken breast slices  aThe study aimed at extending shelf life without compromising quality of precooked chicken breast slices by various packaging and processing technologies. The slices were packaged in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP, 40% CO₂, 60% N₂), vacuum packaging (VAC, 93% vacuum), processed with high pressure (HPP, 600 MPa, 2 min), microwave volumetric heating (MVH, 1 kW, 3 × 15 s), soluble gas stabilization (SGS, 100% CO₂, 18 h, 1 °C) followed by MAP (SGS-MAP), SGS followed by VAC (SGS-VAC), SGS followed by HPP (SGS-HPP), and SGS followed by MVH (SGS-MVH). The eight treatments were studied for their microbial and physicochemical quality during 4 °C storage for maximum 119 d. The results showed that MAP, the most common commercial packaging of ready-to-eat chicken, was slightly superior to VAC but much inferior to HPP, MVH, and SGS in microbial control. HPP, with/without SGS, was the most efficient method extending the shelf life of precooked chicken to more than three months. SGS improved microbial inhibition compared to non-SGS, but synergetic effects with HPP or MVH on microbial and physicochemical quality were insignificant. All treated chickens shared relatively comparable color, texture, pH and drip loss. These quality attributes changed marginally during storage while lipid oxidation increased markedly. HPP and MVH reduced lipid oxidation right after treatment and during storage. SGS suppressed the lipid oxidation but this effect did not last longer than two weeks of storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreasts 3acarbon dioxide 3achickens 3acolor 3adrip loss 3aheat 3alipid peroxidation 3apH 3aready-to-eat foods 3ashelf life 3atexture 0aChicken 0aHigh pressure 0aMicrowave 0aSoluble gas stabilization 0aModified atmosphere packaging 0aVacuum packaging1 aRode, Tone Mari1 aSkipnes, Dagbjørn0 tJournal of food engineering.g2021 Mar., v. 292 p.110352-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2020.1103523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245012600159520157400285592002801859650001501887650001901902651001101921773011801932856007502050852000902125655001202134IND60682730120221123034700.0200131e20191208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068273012DNAL7 a10.3390/land81201872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBae, Yuh  Jin12aA Displaced Community’s Perspective on Land-Grabbing in Africa: The Case of the Kalimkhola Community in Dwangwa, Malawi  aIn recent years, the sugar industry in Malawi has been criticized for its connections to land-grabbing. The general trend in the current literature has been the attempt to identify the main actors and factors that were instrumental in the displacement of local communities. These studies often neglect the importance of each community’s in-depth perspectives on land-grabbing, which is essential in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of land-grabbing. By conducting field research based on in-depth interviews with the Kalimkhola community, this study had two main objectives: (1) to analyze the wider implications and effects of land-grabbing and displacement, other than its often-cited economic aspects; and (2) to analyze more specific reasons behind the community’s complaints and strong resistance to land-grabbing. The main findings of this research are that (1) land-grabbing leads to a loss of traditional cultural practices, and (2) the main reason for discontentment amongst community members is not the process of displacement, per se, but the worsening of their living and working environments. For those who were forcibly moved twice, their environmental change for the worse contributed to community resistance. These findings, along with the others in this paper, show that land-grabbing studies have the potential to broaden the research area. This can only be achieved by engaging in close interactions and in-depth interviews with specific local communities, which will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of land-grabbing in Dwangwa.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterviews 3asugar industry 3aMalawi0 tLand.g2019 Dec. 08, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land81201873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009600165300001400261506002800275520078100303592002801084506003701112650002801149650001101177650002101188650001401209650001301223653001601236653001601252653001101268653001101279700002501290700002801315773012401343856007801467852000901545655001201554IND60739368020221207114400.0110611s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073936802DNAL7 a10.2298/ZMSPN1019071J2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarak, Mirjana N.10aBenefits of inoculation with azotobacter in the growth and production of tomato and peppers  ap. 71-76.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of this research was to investigate the effects of Azotobacter chroococcum in tomato and pepper growth and production by using two types of inoculation - seed inoculation and seedling inoculation. The effect of inoculation was observed thirty days after sowing, thirty days after transplanting, and in the phase of technological maturity. The following were measured: height of the plants, dry matter of the plants and number and the weight of the fruits. Inoculation had a positive effect on these in both plants. With tomato, better results were achieved when seedlings were inoculated. With pepper, the length of the plant and the dry matter were greater with seedling inoculation, whereas the number and the weight of the fruits were greater with seed inoculation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAzotobacter chroococcum 3apepper 3aseed inoculation 3aseedlings 3atomatoes 0ainoculation 0aazotobacter 0atomato 0apepper1 aĐurić, Simonida S.1 aĐorđević, Biljana D.0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2010, v. 2010, no. 119 p.71-76dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x0352-49067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN1019071J3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009500167300001800262520149200280592002801772596002501800596002501825650002201850650002301872650002301895650001501918650001401933650001701947650001501964650000901979650001601988700006002004700007002064773011102134856008302245852000902328655001202337IND60756305120221121002051.0220310e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075630512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-021-02161-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBichara, Samir10aRoot morphological changes in response to low phosphorus concentration in eucalypt species  ap. 1933-1943.  aKEY MESSAGE: Eucalypt seedlings differently modulate root morphology in response to phosphorus availability, with changes in the length or density of root hairs being more common that changes in root length. Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development and thus can restrict biomass accumulation when it is at low levels in the soil. Eucalypts cover large areas of planted forests in the world, including regions with naturally low P availability. This study was conducted to evaluate the morphological changes in the roots of seedlings of five eucalypt species: Eucalyptus acmenoides, E. globulus, E. grandis, E. tereticornis and Corymbia maculata in response to low P concentration. Seedlings were grown in pots with vermiculite and received a nutrient solution of low (25 μM), and sufficient concentration (500 μM) of P. Root hair length and density were evaluated in secondary root segments, and the production of plant biomass and P concentration in the shoots were determined. The species modulated root morphology differently in response to P limitation. E. tereticornis showed the lowest plasticity of these morphological traits in response to P concentration. The total root length increased in some species, but changes in the length and/or density of root hairs were the commonest response to low P concentration. P concentrations in the shoots and biomass production were not related to increase of root length or root hair density and length.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/25498-0cFAPESP  a2019/03165-7cFAPESP 3aCorymbia maculata 3abiomass production 3anutrient solutions 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aroot hairs 3asoil 3avermiculite1 aMazzafera, Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9073-40561 ade Andrade, Sara Adrian L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9895-98200 tTrees.g2021 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1933-1943dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-021-02161-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094040001800116100002400134245014000158300001600298500001900314520075400333592002801087650001701115650002001132650001101152650001501163650001601178650001701194650001901211650000901230651001301239651001101252653001701263653001101280700001601291700001901307700001901326700001801345773014101363856006801504852000901572655001201581IND60713626820221121015700.0201023e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071362682DNAL7 a10.1645/19-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, A.

This species can be easily differentiated from its congeners by the presence of a tooth-like sclerotized piece that occupies half of the stoma and absence of spine projections on the tail of both males and females. Also, males of the new species lack caudal alae present in Oxyuricassis coronatus and Oxyuricassis hexaspinatus. Additionally, we observed a different number and pattern of the distribution of cloacal papilla; males of O. coronatus and O. hexaspinatus have 1 pair of pre-cloacal and 2 pairs of post-cloacal papillae; while the new species has 1 pre-cloacal and 3 post-cloacal pairs of papillae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoricariidae 3aPharyngodonidae 3acloaca 3aintestines 3anew species 3aparasitology 3asclerotization 3atail 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aOxyuricassis 0aAmazon1 aWilkens, Y.1 aMelo, F.

However, the relative contribution of various ROS and the influences of nontarget matrix constituents, on the degradation process are still unclear and yet to be answered. In this study, we confirmed the generation Co(IV) as dominant intermediate oxidant at acid medium by using methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) as a probe compound. Using chemical scavenging methods, the role of SO₄•⁻ and •OH was also identified, and the major ROS were converted from Co(IV) to radical species with the increase of PMS/Co(II) molar ratio as well as pH value. In addition, we found that their contributions to the abatement of organic contaminants are highly dependent on both their available amount and substrate-specific reactivity. Generally, organic substrates with low ionization potential (IP) are prone to react with Co(IV). More interestingly, in contrast to radical-based oxidation, Co(IV) exhibited the great resistance to humic acid (HA) and background ions. This study might shed new light on the PMS activation by cobalt(II) for degradation of organic contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3ahumic acids 3aionization 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3asulfates 3asulfoxides 0aCobalt(II) 0aPeroxymonosulfate 0aHigh-valent cobalt-oxo 0aIonization potential1 aGuo, Wanqian1 aWang, Huazhe1 aZheng, Shanshan1 aSi, Qishi1 aZhao, Qi1 aLuo, Haichao1 aRen, Nanqi0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 416 p.125679-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1256793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04091naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245011500177520208400292592002802376650001302404650001502417650001502432650002002447650002502467650001802492650004302510650002402553650002902577650001402606650001502620650001602635650001102651650001202662650001302674650001802687650001902705650001402724650003702738650002702775650001302802650001302815650002902828650004402857650001002901651001402911651001002925651001902935651001202954651001102966651001802977653001602995653001803011653001503029653001203044653001803056700002203074700002203096700001903118700001903137700002103156773011903177856008803296852000903384655001203393IND60687309820221123005042.0200601e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068730982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1381162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrbancova, Katerina10aComparison of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolite concentrations in urine of mothers and their newborns  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental contaminants produced during incomplete combustion of organic matter. Humans can be exposed to them via several pathways (inhalation, digestion, dermal exposure). The aim of this study was to assess the concentration of 11 monohydroxylated metabolites of PAHs (OH-PAHs) in 660 urine samples collected from mothers and their newborns residing in two localities of the Czech Republic — Most and Ceske Budejovice — in 2016 and 2017. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the target analytes were extracted from the urine samples using liquid-liquid extraction, with extraction solvent ethyl acetate and a clean-up step using dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) with the Z-Sep sorbent. For identification and quantification, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was applied. 2-OH-NAP was the compound present in all of the measured samples and it was also the compound at the highest concentration in both mothers' and newborns' urine samples (median concentration 5.15 μg/g creatinine and 3.58 μg/g creatinine). The total concentrations of OH-PAHs in urine samples collected from mothers were 2 times higher compared to their children. The most contaminated samples were collected in Most in the period October 2016–March 2017 from both mothers (12.59 μg/g creatinine) and their newborns (8.29 μg/g creatinine). The concentrations of OH-PAHs in urine samples, which were collected from both mothers and their newborns as presented in this study, are comparable with those found in our previous study between 2013 and 2014. In addition, they are slightly lower or comparable to other studies from Poland, USA, Germany, China, and Australia. The results might indicate that the population in the previously highly air-polluted mining districts carries some long-term changes (maybe existing changes in genetic information), which also affect the metabolism of PAHs. It could be related to the long-lasting effect, and thus corresponding to the shortened life expectancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3acombustion 3acreatinine 3adermal exposure 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethyl acetate 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhalation exposure 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3alongevity 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amining 3amothers 3aneonates 3aoral exposure 3aorganic matter 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorbents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 3aAustralia 3aChina 3aCzech Republic 3aGermany 3aPoland 3aUnited States 0aEnvironment 0aBiomonitoring 0aBiomarkers 0aOH-PAHs 0aUHPLC–MS/MS1 aDvorakova, Darina1 aGramblicka, Tomas1 aSram, Radim J.1 aHajslova, Jana1 aPulkrabova, Jana0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 25, v. 723 p.138116-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1381163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009800169520083200267592002801099650000801127650002101135650002701156650001101183650002001194650002201214650002001236650001901256650001101275650001101286650001201297650004301309650002501352650001401377650003001391650000901421653002701430653001101457653004301468653001501511700001501526700002001541700001501561700001801576700001701594700001601611700001601627700001601643773009901659856008501758852000901843655001201852IND60710750120221119100038.0210212e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071075012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1053702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Guanghui10aDetection of Peronophythora litchii on lychee by loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay  aDowny blight caused by Peronophythora litchii is one of the most destructive diseases of lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.). Early diagnosis of the P. litchii pathogen should be the top priority for addressing disease epidemics and management. In this study, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays targeting the M90 gene sequences were developed for specific detection of P. litchii. The detection limit of LAMP assay was 10 pg genomic DNA of P. litchii in 25 μL reaction mixtures. LAMP assay and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay showed higher sensitivity than conventional PCR. The LAMP assay could also detect the presence of P. litchii in infected leaves, fruits and soils.

Despite this, there is limited research into the factors that drive this resistance. The Port Stephens–Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP) and Batemans Marine Park (BMP), both situated in New South Wales (NSW) Australia, were established in December 2005 and April 2006 respectively. Both generated significant controversy and hostility, particularly from the recreational fishing sector. The controversy surrounding the declaration of these and other NSW marine parks continues and has been the subject of intense political interest and government enquiry. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with recreational, professional and indigenous fishers. They explored the social impacts of the declaration of PSGLMP and BMP and their link to marine park opposition. Opponents felt the marine parks had resulted in a variety of negative impacts ranging from a loss of enjoyment and convenience through to more serious impacts on wellbeing, livelihood and culture. Examination of the reasons why interview subjects participated in fishing provided further insight into their perception of the marine park and the impacts resulting from the declaration. Opposition to MPAs, however, cannot be explained by impact alone. All the marine park opponents interviewed represented themselves as ‘knowledge holders’ about their local marine area. This knowledge – predominately ‘fish’ knowledge – appears to have conflicted with a policy position which places biodiversity conservation as the primary objective of MPAs. This has led to a perception that the practical knowledge of users was not valued in the planning of each marine park. Incorporation of the goals and objectives of local communities into the development of MPA proposals may provide communities with a greater sense of ownership. Considering motivation to fish may allow for the development of more holistic management responses to mitigate and compensate users for social impacts that may arise from any necessary trade‐offs between these often competing objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acommunity development 3aconservation areas 3afish 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3alivelihood 3amotivation 3aownership 3aparks 3aplanning 3apolitics 3asport fishing 3aNew South Wales1 aGladstone, William1 aGoodall, Heather0 tAquatic conservation.g2014 Aug., v. 24, no. 4 p.441-462dWileyx1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.23633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245008400128300001600212506002800228520133600256592002801592506003701620650001301657650002901670650001401699650001901713650001901732650001301751650000901764650002401773650001801797650001301815653001401828653001301842653002901855653001301884653000901897773012901906852000902035655001202044IND60739368220221207114402.0210420e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073936822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRigi, M.

Six soils with different organic carbon contents were investigated in this study. Simazine sorption isotherms on soils were described by the linear equation, and the distribution coefficients without DOM (Kd) or with DOM (Kd*) were obtained. Generally, the values of Kd*/Kd were initially increased and then decreased with raising DOM concentrations of 0-65 mg DOC·L in the soil-solution system form. Critical concentrations of DOM (DOMnp) were obtained, and the value of Kd* was equal to Kd. The presence of DOM with concentrations lower than DOMnp promoted simazine sorption on the soils (Kd* > Kd), whereas the presence of DOM with concentrations higher than DOMnp tended to inhibit the simazine sorption (Kd* < Kd). Interestingly, DOMnp for the tested soils was negatively correlated to the soil organic carbon content, and the maximum of Kd*/Kd (Kmax) was correlated positively with the maximum of DOM sorption on the soil (Xmax). Further investigations also showed that the presence of the hydrophobic fraction of DOM evidently promoted the simazine sorption on soils, whereas the presence of hydrophilic DOM fraction obviously tended to inhibit the simazine sorption.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomposts 3adissolved organic matter 3aequations 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3asimazine 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil solution 3asorption 0apesticide 0asimazine 0adissolved organic matter 0asorption 0asoil0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2019 Mar., v. 22, no. 4 p.211-221dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245016500154300001600319520202900335592002802364650002002392650004102412650001402453650002502467650001402492650002202506650001602528650001402544651001502558651001102573700002202584700001902606700001402625700001402639773008502653856007202738852000902810655001202819IND60080477520221121213708.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008047752DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.23962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwimmer, Y.10aPost‐release mortality estimates of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) caught in pelagic longline fisheries based on satellite data and hooking location  ap. 498-510.  aThere are few reliable estimates of post‐release mortality for sea turtle species because of the many challenges and costs associated with tracking animals released at sea. In this study, the likelihood of sea turtle mortality as a result of interactions with longline fishing gear was estimated based on satellite telemetry data, such as the number of days an animal was successfully tracked, or days at liberty (DAL) and dive depth data, as well as anatomical hooking locations. Pop‐up satellite archival tags were deployed on 29 loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) caught by the North Pacific US‐based pelagic longline fishery operating from California and Hawaii between 2002 and 2006. Loggerhead turtles were catagorized by observers as shallow‐hooked (55%) if the animal was entangled in the line or the hook was in the flipper, jaw or mouth and could be removed, or deep‐hooked (45%) if the hook was ingested and could not be removed. The vertical movements of turtles were used to infer potential mortalities. Of the 25 tags that reported data, the DAL ranged from 3 to 243 days (mean = 68 days). The DAL was shorter (by nearly 50%) for shallow‐hooked (mean = 48 days, range: 3 to 127) compared to deep‐hooked turtles (mean = 94 days, range: 5 to 243), but these changes were not statistically significant (P = 0.0658). Although aspects of these analyses may be considered speculative, these data provide empirical evidence to indicate that deep‐hooking is not linked to shorter DAL. DAL, anatomical hooking location, and gear removal were evaluated with inferences about the extent of injuries and rates of infection to estimate an overall post‐release mortality rate of 28% (95% bootstrap CI: 16–52%). This range of estimates is consistent with those used to shape some US fisheries management plans, suggesting that conservation goals are being achieved at the expected level and ideally striking a balance between the interests of industry and those of protected species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaretta caretta 3aaquacultural and fisheries equipment 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3amortality 3aprotected species 3asea turtles 3atelemetry 3aCalifornia 3aHawaii1 aEmpey Campora, C.1 aMcnaughton, L.1 aMusyl, M.1 aParga, M.0 tAquatic conservation.g2014 Aug., v. 24, no. 4 p.498-510dWileyx1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.23963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245014300173300001400316520156700330592002801897650001601925650001601941650001601957650001401973650002101987650002302008650001002031650001402041650002002055650001302075650001902088650001102107650001502118650001702133650001702150650001102167650001802178650002102196650001802217650002002235650001802255650001902273650001402292653001902306653001902325653003802344653001402382653001802396653000802414700001702422700001502439700001702454773007502471856009002546852000902636655001202645IND60581020420221122033808.0171005e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058102042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Chaoxiu10aUltra-trace graphene oxide in a water environment triggers Parkinson's disease-like symptoms and metabolic disturbance in zebrafish larvae  ap. 83-94.  aOver the past decade, the safety of nanomaterials has attracted attention due to their rapid development. The relevant health threat of these materials remains largely unknown, particularly at environmentally or biologically relevant ultra-trace concentrations. To address this, we first found that graphene oxide (GO, a carbon nanomaterial that receives extensive attention across various disciplines) at concentrations of 0.01 μg/L–1 μg/L induced Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in zebrafish larvae. In this model, zebrafish showed a loss of more than 90% of dopamine neurons, a 69–522% increase in Lewy bodies (α-synuclein and ubiquitin) and significantly disturbed locomotive activity. Moreover, it was also shown that GO was able to translocate from the water environment to the brain and localize to the nucleus of the diencephalon, thereby inducing structural and morphological damage in the mitochondria. Cell apoptosis and senescence were triggered via oxidative stress, as shown by the upregulation of caspase 8 and β-galactosidase. Using metabolomics, we found that the upregulation of amino acid and some fatty acids (e.g. dodecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, octadecenoic acid, nonanoic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosanoic acid, propanoic acid and benzenedicarboxylic acid) metabolism and the downregulation of some other fatty acids (e.g. butanoic acid, phthalic acid and docosenoic acid) are linked to these Parkinson's disease-like symptoms. These findings broaden our understanding of nanomaterial safety at ultra-trace concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aLewy bodies 3aamino acids 3aapoptosis 3aarachidonic acid 3abeta-galactosidase 3abrain 3acaspase-8 3adodecanoic acid 3adopamine 3agraphene oxide 3alarvae 3ametabolism 3ametabolomics 3amitochondria 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3aoxidative stress 3apalmitic acid 3apelargonic acid 3aphthalic acid 3apropionic acid 3aubiquitin 0aNanotoxicology 0aGraphene oxide 0aParkinson's disease-like symptoms 0aZebrafish 0aMitochondrion 0aROS1 aHu, Xiangang1 aLi, Xueyan1 aZhou, Qixing0 tBiomaterials.g2016 July, v. 93 p.83-94dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013800165520140400303592002801707650001601735650001301751650001901764650002201783650001401805650001901819650001501838650001601853650002101869653002501890653001301915653001901928653002101947700001901968700001601987700001702003773011402020856008602134852000902220655001202229IND60731433420221116201631.0220802e20210805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073143342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1256812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Siqi10aHighly efficient photoelectrochemical removal of atrazine and the mechanism investigation: Bias potential effect and reactive species  aIn this work, efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) removal of atrazine, one of the most widely used chemical herbicides in the world, was obtained by adjusting the bias potential applied on the photo-anode, and the optimal atrazine removal efficiency reached 96.8% at the potential of 0.2 V vs. SCE in 2 h with the reaction rate constant of 1.72 h⁻¹. The results indicated at the optimal potential, the separation efficiency of photo-generated holes and electrons was the highest with the lowest electron transfer resistance. Mechanism investigation revealed that superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals and holes all contributed to atrazine degradation, and the bias potential on the photo-anode could influence atrazine removal efficiency by changing the generation amount and distribution of the reactive oxygen species (ROS). It was presumed the nucleophilicity of superoxide radical played an important role in atrazine dechlorination, leading to the enhanced removal efficiency. However, the bias potential did not show obvious influence on the degradation intermediates of atrazine in the PEC system compared with that in photocatalytic oxidation, since it was actually an electro-assisted photocatalytic process in the potential range investigated. The work will provide fundamental basis for establishing efficient PEC system for pollutant remediation experimentally and theoretically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aatrazine 3adechlorination 3aelectron transfer 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asuperoxide anion 0aPhotoelectrochemical 0aAtrazine 0aBias potential 0aReactive species1 aTang, Chunjing1 aShi, Huijie1 aZhao, Guohua0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 05, v. 415 p.125681-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1256813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009500168500001900263520136300282536015001645592002801795596001501823650001601838650001901854650001301873650001801886650001001904650001201914650001101926650002101937650003401958650002801992650002002020650002102040650001602061653003702077653000802114653002102122773012002143856008502263852000902348655001202357IND60727902320221122030943.0210213e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072790232DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2020.18681312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuh, Sung Un10aNew function of Hypoxia-responsive unknown protein in enhanced resistance to biotic stress  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSubmergence and waterlogging lead to significant reductions in crop productivity and trigger dramatic changes in gene expression of plant biotic/abiotic stress response. Several of the host factors are involved in low-oxygen stress that is induced by endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Hypoxia-response unknown protein (HUP) has been found as a host factor of hypoxia screening but HUPs function largely is unknown. In this study, we found the Arabidopsis HUP26 gene which was conserved in different plant species and responded to various oxidative stress. HUP26 promoter analysis showed GUS activity in root and leaf tissues was significantly responsive to oxidative stress. HUP26-GFP is predominantly located in the cytoplasmic region. HUP26 overexpression results in altered enhanced pathogenesis-related gene 1 gene expression and reduced ion leakage levels compared with hup26 knockout and WT plants after inoculation with Pst DC3000. HUP26 overexpression transgenic plants showed improved resistance to Pst DC3000, but hup26 knockout plants exhibited increased susceptibility. Collectively, these results indicate that HUP26 plays important role in responses to various oxidative stress and confers biotic stress resistance. Engineering of HUP26 gene expression may represent a strategy to enhance biotic stress resistance of crops.  aThis work was supported by the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (Project No. PJ01365301), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJ01365301 3aArabidopsis 3aabiotic stress 3abehavior 3abiotic stress 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3aleaves 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3areactive oxygen species 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3asubmergence 0aHypoxia-response unknown protein 0aROS 0acrop development0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 16, no. 3 p.1868131-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2020.18681313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002100135245011300156300001600269500001900285520116300304592002801467650001701495650001701512650001001529650002301539650001701562650002201579650002501601650001401626650001401640650001701654650001501671650001401686650001801700650002501718650001701743651002601760653002601786653001701812653001601829653002301845653002201868653001001890653002601900700003101926700003301957700002301990700002302013773014002036856006902176852000902245655001202254IND60713627120221122152832.0201023e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071362712DNAL7 a10.1645/20-512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemarcis, Thomas10aDetection of a Larva of Armillifer armillatus in a Potto (Perodicticus potto) from the Republic of the Congo  ap. 654-662.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe determined the complete sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a parasite discovered between the subcutaneous tissue and the peritoneum of an African nocturnal non-human primate (NHP). The parasite and host sequences were obtained by a combination of Sanger sequencing and nanopore MinION techniques. Analyses of mtDNA gene arrangements and sequences unambiguously showed that the parasite investigated was the pentastomid Armillifer armillatus, also commonly named the tongue worm. The full-length mitochondrial genome of A. armillatus, measuring 16,706 bp in length, contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes, an arrangement identical to that of previously described pentastomid mitochondrial genomes.

To identify the NHP host, maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of a 441-bp fragment on the 12S rDNA gene and of a 1,140-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b strongly support clustering with the African lorisid Perodicticus potto, a species that has rarely been reported as an intermediate host of this parasite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPentastomida 3acytochrome b 3agenes 3aintermediate hosts 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3ananopores 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3aperitoneum 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3astatistical analysis 3atransfer RNA 3aRepublic of the Congo 0aArmillifer armillatus 0aPentastomids 0aTongue Worm 0aPerodicticus potto 0aNon-Human Primate 0aSnake 0aNanopore Technologies1 aChesnais, Cédric Benjamin1 aSerge Pion, Sébastien David1 aBoussinesq, Michel1 aLocatelli, Sabrina0 tJournal of parasitology.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 106, no. 5 p.654-662dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/20-513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01480naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245010600161300002000267520036700287592002800654650001400682650001100696650002300707650002300730650001500753700001500768700001900783700002000802700001600822700001400838700005400852773013600906856007901042852000901121655001201130IND60669575820221119041315.0190920e20190821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066957582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b017032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Xiao-De10aSynthesis of Tetrahydro[1,3,4]triazepines via Redox-Neutral α-C(sp³)–H Amination of Cyclic Amines  ap. 11839-11847.  aA Brønsted acid-catalyzed α-C(sp³)–H amination of cyclic amines using hydrazines as coupling partners has been reported.

The recording of extracellular action potentials (APs) from cardiac cells is important for fundamental studies of AP propagation features reflecting cell activity and the influence of pharmacological substances on the signal. We applied a novel approach of using fabricated Si NW field-effect transistors (FETs) in combination with fluorescent marker techniques to evaluate the functional activity of cardiac cells. Extracellular AP signal recording from HL-1 cardiomyocytes was demonstrated. This method was supplemented by studies of the pharmacological effects of stimulations using noradrenaline (NorA) as a modulator of functional activity on a cellular and subcellular levels, which were also tested using fluorescent marker techniques. The role of calcium alteration and membrane potential were revealed using Fluo-4 AM and tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate (TMRM) fluorescent dyes. In addition, chemical treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solutions was tested. The results obtained demonstrate positive prospects for AP monitoring in different treatments for studies related to a wide range of myocardial diseases using lab-on-chip technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaction potentials 3abiosensors 3acalcium 3acardiomyocytes 3achemical treatment 3afluorescent dyes 3amonitoring 3amyocardial diseases 3ananowires 3anorepinephrine 3aperchlorates 3ascreening 3asilicon 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atransistors 0aBioelectronics 0aNanowire 0aCardiomyocytes 0aAction potential 0aFluorescence 0aLab-on-chip1 aHlukhova, Hanna1 aKutovyi, Yurii1 aHandziuk, Volodymyr1 aNaumova, Nataliia1 aOffenhaeusser, Andreas1 aVitusevich, Svetlana0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 July 15, v. 137 p.229-235dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.04.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245018900162300001800351520133100369592002801700596008301728596007701811596006001888596005301948650002102001650001802022650001102040650003202051650001802083650001502101650002002116650001302136650001202149650001702161650001802178650000902196650000702205650001402212650001802226650001602244700001502260700001302275700001802288700005202306773012202358856008302480852000902563655001202572IND60756305520221121001956.0211127e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075630552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-021-03203-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yue13aAn uncharacterized protein from the metagenome with no obvious homology to known lipases shows excellent alkaline lipase properties and potential applications in the detergent industry  ap. 2311-2325.  aA novel lipase, Lip486, which has no obvious homology with known lipases, was discovered using functional metagenomics technology. Phylogenetic tree analysis suggested that the enzyme belongs to a new subfamily called lipolytic enzyme family II. To explore the enzymatic properties, lip486 was expressed heterologously and efficiently in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme displayed the highest activity on the substrate p-nitrophenyl caprate with a carbon chain length of 10, and its optimum temperature and pH were 53 °C and 8.0, respectively. The recombinant Lip486 showed good activity and stability in strong alkaline and medium–low-temperature environments. The results of compatibility and soaking tests showed that the enzyme had good compatibility with 4 kinds of commercial detergents, and an appropriate soaking time could further improve the enzyme activity. Oil stain removal test results for a cotton cloth indicated that the washing performance of commercial laundry detergent supplemented with Lip486 was further improved. In addition, as one of the smallest lipases found to date, Lip486 also has the advantages of high yield, good stability and easy molecular modification. These characteristics reflect the good application prospects for Lip486 in the detergent and other industries in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019GDASYL-0501006cGDAS Special Project of Science and Technology Development  a2020A151501240cThe Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foudation  a2017B020202005cResearch Programs of Guangdong Province  a202103000065cThe Research Programs of Guangzhou 3aEscherichia coli 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acotton fabric 3adetergents 3aenzyme activity 3aindustry 3alaundry 3ametagenomics 3anew subfamily 3aoils 3apH 3aphylogeny 3astain removal 3atemperature1 aLiu, Yi-De1 aYuan, Ge1 aMao, Run-Qian1 aLi, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1550-17240 tBiotechnology letters.g2021 Dec., v. 43, no. 12 p.2311-2325dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-021-03203-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01917naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245011400172506002800286520086600314592002801180506003701208650001901245650001101264650000901275650001801284650000901302650002401311650001801335700001801353700002001371773009601391856008301487852000901570655001201579IND60739368720221207114355.0180904s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073936872DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201811000412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVladimir, Ufimtsev10aSoil cover under Betula pendula Roth.

Due to their involvement in many human diseases, they are recognized worldwide as valuable drug targets.Many experimental approaches help identify small molecules that target GPCRs, including in vitro cell-based reporter assays and binding studies. Most cell-based assays use one signaling pathway or reporter as an assay readout. Moreover, they often require cell labeling or the integration of reporter systems.Over the last decades, cell-based electrical impedance biosensors have been explored for drug discovery. This label-free method holds many advantages over other cellular assays in GPCR research. The technology requires no cell manipulation and offers real-time kinetic measurements of receptor-mediated cellular changes. Instead of measuring the activity of a single reporter, the impedance readout includes information on multiple signaling events. This is beneficial when screening for ligands targeting orphan GPCRs since the signaling cascade(s) of the majority of these receptors are unknown. Due to its sensitivity, the method also applies to cellular models more relevant to disease, including patient-derived cell cultures.Despite its advantages, remaining issues regarding data comparability and interpretability has limited implementation of cell-based electrical impedance (CEI) in drug discovery. Future optimization must include both full exploitation of CEI response data using various ways of analysis as well as further exploration of its potential to detect biased activities early on in drug discovery.Here, we review the contribution of CEI technology to GPCR research, discuss its comparative benefits, and provide recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aG-proteins 3abiosensors 3adrugs 3aelectric impedance 3ahuman diseases 3aligands 3amodels 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 0aG protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 0aLabel-free 0aCell-based 0aElectrical impedance 0aBiosensor 0aDrug discovery1 aVan Loy, Tom1 aLanduyt, Bart1 aLuyten, Walter1 aSchols, Dominique1 aSchoofs, Liliane0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 July 15, v. 137 p.33-44dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.04.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003200138245010800170300001600278520182800294592002802122650002202150650002202172650001402194650001502208650001002223650000902233650001102242650001502253651001902268651001302287651001302300651001502313651001402328651001102342651001102353651001202364651001402376651001802390700002302408700002202431700002102453700002302474773008502497856007202582852000902654655001202663IND60080477920221121215744.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008047792DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.23942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez‐Carvalho, Joana10aStatus and the potential for extinction of the largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis in the Atlantic Ocean  ap. 478-497.  aSawfishes currently are among the most threatened elasmobranchs in the world. Only two species inhabit Atlantic waters: the largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis) and the smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata), both having suffered dramatic declines in their ranges. The goal of this study was to evaluate the status of P. pristis in the Atlantic, and estimate local extinction risk based on historical and recent occurrence records. In order to accomplish these goals, a thorough search for historical and recent records of P. pristis in the Atlantic was conducted, by reviewing scientific and popular literature, museum specimens, and contacting regional scientists from the species’ historical range. In total, 801 P. pristis records (1830–2009) document its occurrence in four major regions in the Atlantic: USA (n = 41), Mexico and Central America (n = 535), South America (n = 162), and West Africa (n = 48). Locality data were not available for 15 records. Historical abundance centres were the Colorado‐San Juan River system in Nicaragua and Costa Rica (and secondarily Lake Izabal of Guatemala), the Amazon estuary, and coastal Guinea‐Bissau. Currently, the species faces drastic depletion throughout its entire former range and centres of abundance. It appears to have been extirpated from several areas. The probability of extinction was highest in the USA, northern South America (Colombia to Guyane), and southern West Africa (Cameroon to Namibia). Currently, the Amazon estuary appears to have the highest remaining abundance of P. pristis in the Atlantic, followed by the Colorado–San Juan River system in Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Bissagos Archipelago in Guinea Bissau.

The synthesis of GO and DGO is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection. The properties of AEMs including their water uptake, thermal stability, mechanical property and ionic conductivity are investigated. Compared with the plain quaternized polysulfone membrane, the composite membranes containing 1% GO or 0.5% DGO display higher water uptakes, stronger tensile strengths, a bigger elongation rate at break and better alkaline solution stability. The ionic conductivities of them are 1.08 × 10⁻² S cm⁻¹ and 1.07 × 10⁻² S cm⁻¹ at 60 °C, respectively.

However, multiple pressures from other human activities often compromise ecosystem service delivery from protected areas. It is thus fundamental for effective management to understand the recreational values and visitor behaviors in such areas. This paper undertakes a rapid assessment of the economic value of cultural ecosystem services related to recreation in a national park in Myanmar using two valuation techniques, the individual travel cost method (TCM) and the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA v.1.2). We focus on the Popa Mountain National Park, a protected area visited by approximately 800,000 domestic and 25,000 international tourists annually. Individual TCM estimates that each domestic visitor spent USD 20–24 per trip, and the total annual recreational value contributed by these visitors was estimated at USD 16.1–19.6 million (USD 916–1111 ha-1). TESSA estimated the annual recreational expenditure from domestic and international visitors at USD 15.1 million (USD 858 ha-1) and USD 5.04 million (USD 286 ha-1), respectively. Both methods may be employed as practical approaches to assess the recreational values of protected areas (and other land uses with recreational value), and they have rather complementary approaches. We recommend that both techniques be combined into a single survey protocol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aconservation areas 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3aland use 3anational parks 3arapid methods 3arecreation 3asocial welfare 3asurveys 3atourists 3atravel 3aMyanmar1 aSuzuki, Aya 1 aPeh, Kelvin S.-H.,1 aGasparatos, Alexandros 0 tLand.g2019 Dec. 14, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land81201943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245012000165300001600285500001900301520172200320592002802042650002702070650002202097650002002119650002202139650001002161650000902171650001202180650001802192650004302210650001802253650001802271650001302289650001302302651001902315653001202334653001002346653001502356700002502371700002202396700002002418700002602438700002802464773013202492856007502624852000902699655001202708IND60713627420221121025542.0201023e20201008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071362742DNAL7 a10.7589/2019-05-1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanders, Charles W.10aLeptospira, parvovirus, and toxoplasma in the north american river otter (lontra canadensis) in north carolina, usa  ap. 791-802.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is the largest mustelid in North Carolina, US, and was once extirpated from the central and western portions of the state. Over time and after a successful reintroduction project, otters are now abundant and occur throughout North Carolina. However, there is a concern that diseases may have an impact on the otter population, as well as on other aquatic mammals, either through exposure to emerging diseases, contact with domestic animals such as domestic cats (Felis catus), or less robust condition of individuals through declines in water quality. We tested brain and kidney tissue from harvested otters for the pathogens that cause leptospirosis, parvovirus, and toxoplasmosis. Leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis are priority zoonoses and are maintained by domestic and wild mammals. Although parvovirus is not zoonotic, it does affect pets, causing mild to fatal symptoms. Across the 2014–15 and 2015–16 trapping seasons, we tested 220 otters (76 females, 144 males) using real-time PCR for Leptospira interrogans, parvovirus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Of the otters tested, 1% (3/220) were positive for L. interrogans, 19% (41/220) were positive for parvovirus, and 24% (53/220) were positive for T. gondii. Although the pathogens for parvovirus and toxoplasmosis are relatively common in North Carolina otters, the otter harvest has remained steady and the population appears to be abundant and self-sustaining. Therefore, parvovirus and toxoplasmosis do not currently appear to be negatively impacting the population. However, subsequent research should examine transmission parameters between domestic and wild species and the sublethal effects of infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptospira interrogans 3aLontra canadensis 3aProtoparvovirus 3aToxoplasma gondii 3abrain 3acats 3akidneys 3aleptospirosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atoxoplasmosis 3awater quality 3awildlife 3azoonoses 3aNorth Carolina 0aDisease 0aotter 0aparvovirus1 aOlfenbuttel, Colleen1 aPacifici, Krishna1 aHess, George R.1 aLivingston, Robert S.1 aDePerno, Christopher S.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2020 Oct. 8, v. 56, no. 4 p.791-802dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2019-05-1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013000164520133500294592002801629650001901657650002501676650001501701650002101716650002801737650004301765650002101808650001801829650002301847650001601870650001501886650001401901650001001915650001101925650001301936650001601949650001601965650001501981653001001996653001602006653001402022653001902036700002202055700001802077700001802095773012202113856008302235852000902318655001202327IND60698391520221119104104.0200824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069839152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1016822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZafar, Hira10aZnO NPs reveal distinction in toxicity under different spectral lights: An in vitro experiment on Brassica nigra (Linn.) Koch  aMetallic nanoparticles (NPs) have been studied for their optimistic and pessimistic influence on plants growth and physiology under different light regimes. To investigate the influence of NPs under different light wavelengths, Brassica nigra (Linn.) Koch plants were grown on ZnO NPs supplemented media under the exposure of five different spectral lights (white, blue, red, yellow and green). ZnO NPs toxicity varied under different spectral lights. Difference in light wavelength significantly altered toxicity level of NPs on shoot root length and weight parameters of B. nigra. Free radical scavenging activity, total antioxidant response, and total reducing power potential also considerably varied in shoots and roots when plants were grown in presence of NPs and spectral lights. Concentration of total phenolics and flavonoids also changed in shoots and roots to combat NPs stress. HPLC analysis presented that chlorogenic acid upregulated under NPs influence in red and white light; while quercetin increased under NPs stress in blue light. The study shows that NPs have different toxicity response under different light wavelengths and plant behaves according to environmental conditions to mitigate NPs stress. However, detailed phytochemical and molecular studies are required to explain photodynamic toxicity of NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica nigra 3aantioxidant activity 3ablue light 3achlorogenic acid 3afree radical scavengers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro studies 3ananoparticles 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotoperiod 3aphysiology 3aquercetin 3aroots 3ashoots 3atoxicity 3awavelengths 3awhite light 3azinc oxide 0aPlant 0aAntioxidant 0aPhenolics 0aLight spectrum1 aGul, Faiza Zareen1 aMannan, Abdul1 aZia, Muhammad0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Aug., v. 27 p.101682-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1016823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015000157300001600307520112200323592002801445650001601473650001701489650001101506650002601517650001101543650001301554650001101567650001701578650001001595650000901605650001501614700001601629700001901645700001501664700001801679700001401697773011901711856007401830852000901904655001201913IND60640080220221119171643.0190504e20151222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064008022DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra21106a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Yongkun10aEffect of multifunctional samarium lysine dithiocarbamate on curing properties, static and dynamic mechanical properties of SBR/silica composites  ap. 269-280.  aIn this work, a novel multifunctional rubber agent named as samarium lysine dithiocarbamate (Sm-LDC) was synthesized by a nucleophilic addition reaction and coordination reaction. Then the influences of Sm-LDC on curing properties, and static and dynamic mechanical properties of SBR/SiO₂ composites were studied. The results showed that Sm-LDC is not only capable of accelerating the vulcanization of SBR compounds even without zinc oxide (ZnO) and stearic acid (SA), also conducive to improve the crosslinked network. Notably, SBR/Sm-LDC/SiO₂ composites exhibit superior static and dynamic mechanical properties in comparison with the SBR/SiO₂ composite containing conventional accelerator zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate (ZDC), and activators ZnO and SA. Such improvement is attributable to the improved dispersion of SiO₂, the enhanced filler–rubber interaction, and the high vulcanization and reinforcing efficiency of Sm-LDC. Accordingly, the excellent comprehensive performance may make Sm-LDC very competitive in the application in green tires and the preparation of high performance rubber composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3acrosslinking 3alysine 3amechanical properties 3arubber 3asamarium 3asilica 3astearic acid 3atires 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aHe, Jingwei1 aTang, Zhenghai1 aZhu, Lixin1 aLuo, Yuanfang1 aLiu, Fang0 tRSC advances.g2015 Dec. 22, v. 6, no. 1 p.269-280dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra21106a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015600166300001800322520117300340592002801513596008901541596010001630596008601730650002101816650002801837650001401865650002101879650001801900650001201918650002301930650001101953650001101964650000701975650002601982650001602008650001502024700001602039700001302055700001402068700001502082700001202097700001902109700001502128700001402143700001602157700005202173773012202225856008302347852000902430655001202439IND60756305820221121001910.0211127e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075630582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-021-03188-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Zhangde12aA novel thermophilic β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase with broad substrate specificity from the marine bacterium Candidatus Pelagibacter sp.

BCMO₇₂₁₁ was functionally overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by Ni–NTA affinity chromatography and Superdex-200 gel filtration chromatography. Labeling experiments with H₂¹⁸O demonstrated that the oxygen atom in the terminal aldehyde group of the produced retinal molecules was provided from both molecular oxygen and water, indicating that BCMO₇₂₁₁ is the first characterized bacterial β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase. BCMO₇₂₁₁ exhibited broad carotenoid substrate specificity toward α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, β-carotene, zeaxanthin, and lutein. The optimum temperature, pH, and concentrations of the substrate and enzyme for retinal production were 60 °C, 9.0, 500 mg β-carotene/L, and 2.5 U/ml, respectively.

Compared with the existing methodologies, the current protocol demands very simple and mild reaction conditions and is a metal-free catalyzed reaction.

A novel optical-nano configuration has been exploited by integrating BP nanosheets with a largely tilted fiber grating (BP-TFG), where the BP is bio-functionalized by the poly-L-lysine acting as a critical cross-linker to facilitate bio-nano-photonic interface with extremely enhanced light-matter interaction. BP nanosheets are synthesized by a liquid ultrasonication-based exfoliation and deposited on fiber device by an in-situ layer-by-layer method. The BP-induced optical modulation effects in terms of thickness-tunable feature, polarization-dependence and enhanced light-matter interaction are experimentally investigated. The anti-NSE immobilized BP-TFG biosensor has been implemented to detect NSE biomarkers demonstrating ultrahigh sensitivity with limit of detection down to 1.0 pg/mL, which is 4 orders magnitude lower than NSE cut-off value of small cell lung cancer. The enhanced sensitivity of BP-TFG is 100-fold higher than graphene oxide or AuNPs based biosensors. We believe that BP-fiber optic configuration opens a new bio-nano-photonic platform for the applications in healthcare, biomedical, food safety and environmental monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afiber optics 3afood safety 3agraphene oxide 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3aliquids 3alung neoplasms 3ananogold 3ananosheets 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aphosphorus 0aBlack phosphorus 0aOptical biosensor 0aFiber grating 0aLabel-free 0aNeuron-specific enolase 0aCancer biomarker1 aLiu, Chen1 aSun, Zhengbo1 aMao, Hongju1 aZhang, Lin1 aYu, Xuefeng1 aZhao, Jianlong1 aChen, Xianfeng0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 July 15, v. 137 p.140-147dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010300158300002000261520173400281592002802015650004402043650002302087650002202110650001902132650001402151650002202165650002302187650003402210650002802244650002102272650003702293650001302330650001902343650001402362650002102376650001302397650003702410650003702447650001102484650001902495700001902514700001902533700001602552700002702568700002302595700002102618700002002639700002702659700002802686773012402714856007402838852000902912655001202921IND60640080320221119171641.0190504e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064008032DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra21112c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Indranil10aSynthesis and characterization of graphene from waste dry cell battery for electronic applications  ap. 10557-10564.  aThis study demonstrates the electronic applications of graphene synthesized from the graphite electrode of waste dry cell zinc–carbon batteries. Graphite powder [G (R)] is successfully recovered from the graphite electrode of waste batteries by acid treatment and used as starting material for synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) following Hummers method. Finally, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was obtained from the chemical reduction of GO by hydrazine hydrate. RGO thus obtained was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, energy dispersive X-ray spectra and transmission electron microscopy to get detailed information about the structure and morphology of the RGO. All the above characterization results confirmed the restoration of sp² conjugation and removal of functional groups after the reduction of GO and also the sheet like morphology of RGO. The surface charge and stability of RGO in an aqueous medium are examined by measuring zeta potential. An electrochemical study demonstrated that, at different sweep rates, the current is the highest for RGO and lowest for GO and the current increases with an increasing sweep rate for all materials. The loop area of all the samples at the 100 mV s⁻¹ sweep rate is the highest. The galvanostatic charging/discharging measurements have also been performed for both the GO and RGO samples at a current density of 1 mA g⁻¹. Electro-conductivity measurement shows that RGO has higher conductivity than GO due to the restoration of the sp² structure. The current voltage (I–V) characteristics show a non-linear behavior of GO and the ohmic nature of RGO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid treatment 3abatteries 3acarbon electrodes 3achemical reduction 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrazine 3alight scattering 3amoieties 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awastes 3azeta potential1 aSarkar, Gunjan1 aMondal, Soumya1 aRana, Dipak1 aBhattacharyya, Amartya1 aSaha, Nayan Ranjan1 aAdhikari, Arpita1 aKhastgir, Dipak1 aChattopadhyay, Sanatan1 aChattopadhyay, Dipankar0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 6, no. 13 p.10557-10564dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra21112c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245015100130300001600281506002800297520162600325592002801951506003701979650002202016650002602038650001302064650001202077650001202089650001402101650001102115650001702126650001102143650001402154650001602168650001502184650001102199653003402210653001402244653003202258700002302290773014502313852000902458655001202467IND60739369020221207114223.0210504e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073936902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaryanta, Dwi14aThe Utilization of Sediment Mud In Water Channel And Urban Organic Compost Waste For Sunflower (Helianthus Anuus L.Var.

This research conducted by applying T1: river sediment mud, T2: pond sediment mud, T3: highway water channel sediment mud, T4: sediment mud of residential sewerage, and T5: garden soil as a comparison factor. While the treatment of second factor are amount (dose) of urban organic compost waste, namely B0: 0% compost as control, B1: 10%, B2: 20%, and B3: 30% compost. The experiment using a randomized block design is repeated three times. The experimental unit is a plant in a 50 cm diameter polybag that filled by 40 cm mud as media, filled with media as high as 40 cm. There are 60 sunflower plants for experiment. The results shows that there is no interaction between the treatment factors of sediment mud in water channel with the provision of municipal compost waste for all research variables. The treatment of sediment mud in water channel including the use of garden soil as a comparison factor is not significantly affect all research variables. As the result, sediment mud in water channel could be used as a substitute for garden soil. The treatment of urban organic compost waste has a significant influence on growth variables, they are increasing plant height, leaf number, leaf size, stem diameter, flower diameter, and shortening flowering life (7 days). The treatment of urban organic compost waste does not influence toward the production variables, which include plant height, flower bunch weight, seed weight, and seed yield toward flower bunches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHelianthus annuus 3aagricultural sciences 3acomposts 3aflowers 3agardens 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aplant height 3arivers 3asediments 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3awastes 0asediment mud in water channel 0asunflower 0aurban organic compost waste1 aRejeki, Fungki Sri0 tAgricultural Science.g2021 Apr., v. 4, no. 2 p.113-125dFaculty of Agriculture, Merdeka University SurabayawJournal:27900x2597-87137nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006400145245011700209300002000326520133300346592002801679650001601707650002201723650001201745650001301757650002301770650002301793650001101816650001001827650001301837650001301850650003601863650001201899650002301911700005901934773013601993856007902129852000902208655001202217IND60669576220200117000000.0190920e20190823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066957622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b017322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenberg, Murray G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8353-173610aBent Singlet Cyclobutylcarbene: Computed Geometry, Properties, and Product Selectivity of a Nonclassical Carbene  ap. 11873-11884.  aAb initio computations of cyclobutylcarbene (c-C₄H₇CH) were performed using the UMP4(fc)/6-311++G(2df,2p)//UMP2(full)/6-311++G(d,p) theoretical model. The carbene’s most striking feature is its :CH-group. It is markedly bent toward the elongated C1′–C2′ bond in the singlet ground-state but not in the triplet state, which is at least 1.1 kcal/mol higher in energy. Nonclassical 3C2E bonding among the C1, C1′, and C2′ atoms is prominent in the HOMO{−1}. The electron-donating ability of the nonbonding HOMO is thereby enhanced. The intensified nucleophilicity of the singlet carbene is manifested in quantifiable ways. For example, its hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) hardness, HSAB absolute electronegativity, and gas-phase proton affinity rival those of ylide-stabilized N-heterocyclic carbenes. It is computed to act as a nucleophile toward alkenes with higher HSAB hardness values. Transition states from singlet cyclobutylcarbene to bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, cyclopentene, and methylenecyclobutane were computed and confirmed by intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. Activation energies depend on the singlet’s conformation with regard to c-C₄H₇ ring-puckering, :CH-group rotation, and :CH-group bending. The singlet’s bent :CH-group favors bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane and cyclopentene formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aactivation energy 3aalkenes 3acarbenes 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aenergy 3agases 3ageometry 3ahardness 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3apentane 3atheoretical models1 aBrinker, Udo H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2859-65770 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Aug. 23, v. 84, no. 18 p.11873-11884dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b017323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04022naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245015300165300001600318500001900334520213500353592002802488650003502516650004702551650001402598650001902612650002402631650002002655650002502675650001502700650001402715650001902729650000902748650001302757651001302770651002902783651001402812653002202826653000702848653000902855653001202864653001902876653001502895653002602910700002302936700002002959700002002979700002502999700002003024700002003044700002103064700003103085700001703116700002603133700002103159773013203180856007503312852000903387655001203396IND60713627620221122182105.0201023e20201008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071362762DNAL7 a10.7589/2019-08-2032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardman, Rebecca H.10aGeographic and individual determinants of important amphibian pathogens in hellbenders (cryptobranchus alleganiensis) in tennessee and arkansas, usa  ap. 803-814.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWildlife diseases are a major threat for species conservation and there is a growing need to implement disease surveillance programs to protect species of concern. Globally, amphibian populations have suffered considerable losses from disease, particularly from chytrid fungi (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [Bd] and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans [Bsal]) and ranavirus. Hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) are large riverine salamanders historically found throughout several watersheds of the eastern and midwestern US. Populations of both subspecies (Ozark hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi; eastern hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis) have experienced precipitous declines over at least the past five decades, and emerging pathogens are hypothesized to play a role. We surveyed Ozark hellbender populations in Arkansas (AR) and eastern hellbender populations in Middle Tennessee (MTN) and East Tennessee (ETN) for both chytrid fungi and ranavirus from swabs and tail tissue, respectively, from 2011 to 2017. Overall, we detected Bd on hellbenders from nine out of 15 rivers, with total prevalence of 26.7% (54/ 202) that varied regionally (AR: 33%, 28/86; MTN: 11%, 4/36; ETN: 28%, 22/80). Ranavirus prevalence (9.0%, 18/200) was comparatively lower than Bd, with less regional variation in prevalence (AR: 6%, 5/ 85; MTN: 11%, 4/36; ETN: 10%, 8/79). We did not detect Bsal in any hellbender populations. We detected a significant negative correlation between body condition score and probability of ranavirus infection (β=–0.13, SE=0.06, 95% confidence interval: –0.24, –0.02). Evaluation of infection load of positive individuals revealed different trends than prevalence alone for both ranavirus and Bd, with MTN having a significantly greater average ranaviral load than both other regions. We documented a variety of lesions that likely have multiple etiologies on hellbenders located within all geographic regions. Our data represent a multiyear pathogen dataset across several regions of C. alleganiensis, and we emphasize the need for continued pathogen surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 3aCryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis 3aRanavirus 3abody condition 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3adisease surveillance 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3ariparian areas 3atail 3awildlife 3aArkansas 3aMidwestern United States 3aTennessee 0aAmphibian disease 0aBd 0aBsal 0achytrid 0aCryptobranchus 0ahellbender 0apathogen surveillance1 aSutton, William B.1 aIrwin, Kelly J.1 aMcGinnity, Dale1 aReinsch, Sherri Doro1 aFreake, Michael1 aColclough, Phil1 aMiller, Brian T.1 aDa Silva Neto, Jeronimo G.1 aSouza, Marcy1 aFitzpatrick, Benjamin1 aMiller, Debra L.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2020 Oct. 8, v. 56, no. 4 p.803-814dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2019-08-2033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013900168500001900307520073700326592002801063650002301091650001401114650002501128650001301153650001601166650001501182650002001197650001301217650001201230650001501242650001601257650001601273650001301289650002801302650001601330653000801346653000801354653000801362653000801370653000801378653000801386653000801394653000801402653000801410653002301418653001201441653001201453653001201465700001601477700001701493700006001510700001801570700001801588773010801606856008501714852000901799655001201808IND60731434020221116201126.0210415e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073143402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2021.1094162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVereecken, M.10aRestoration of the sensitivity of Eimeria acervulina to anticoccidial drugs in the chicken following use of a live coccidiosis vaccine  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe efficacy of the anticoccidial drugs amprolium, clopidol, diclazuril, monensin, monensin + nicarbazin, narasin, narasin + nicarbazin, and salinomycin against field isolates of Eimeria acervulina obtained from a commercial broiler enterprise before and after immunization with a coccidiosis vaccine was investigated.

In order to deduce structure property relations, our results on the interfacial molecular structure and lateral interactions of PSS–/CTA⁺ complexes were compared to the stability and structure of macroscopic foam as well as to bulk properties. For that, the CTAB concentration was fixed to 0.1 mM, while the NaPSS concentration was varied. At NaPSS monomer concentrations <0.1 mM, PSS–/CTA⁺ complexes start to replace free CTA⁺ surfactants at the interface and thus reduce the interfacial electric field in the process. This causes the O−H bands from interfacial H₂O molecules in our SFG spectra to decrease substantially, which reach a local minimum in intensity close to equimolar concentrations. Once electrostatic repulsion is fully screened at the interface, hydrophobic PSS–/CTA⁺ complexes dominate and tend to aggregate at the interface and in the bulk solution. As a consequence, adsorbate layers with the highest film thickness, surface pressure, and dilatational elasticity are formed. These surface layers provide much higher stabilities and foamabilities of polyhedral macroscopic foams. Mixtures around this concentration show precipitation after a few days, while their surfaces to air are in a local equilibrium state. Concentrations >0.1 mM result in a significant decrease in surface pressure and a complete loss in foamability. However, SFG and surface dilatational rheology provide strong evidence for the existence of PSS–/CTA⁺ complexes at the interface. At polyelectrolyte concentrations >10 mM, air–water interfaces are dominated by an excess of free PSS– polyelectrolytes and small amounts of PSS–/CTA⁺ complexes which, however, provide higher foam stabilities compared to CTAB free foams. The foam structure undergoes a transition from wet to polyhedral foams during the collapse.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3achemical structure 3aelectric field 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afoams 3ahydrophobicity 3arheology 3asodium 3asurfactants 3awater1 aBraunschweig, Björn0 tLangmuir.g2017 Apr. 11, v. 33, no. 14 p.3499-3508dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b004003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010200168300001600270500001900286520093600305592002801241650001301269650001201282650001301294650001101307650001101318650001001329650000901339650000901348650002301357650001401380650001101394650000701405650001101412650001201423650001301435650001301448650001301461650000901474651001701483653002101500653001901521653002101540700001701561700001801578773013301596856008501729852000901814655001201823IND60727902820221120061827.0210213e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072790282DNAL7 a10.2989/16085914.2020.17733892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPienaar, M.,10aInterannual variation in metal concentrations in surface waters of the Marico River, South Africa  ap. 123-127.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was conducted to establish the interannual variation in the concentration of metals regarded as toxic to aquatic fauna in the Marico River of South Africa. Five surveys were conducted between 2013 and 2015 at six sites in the river. Water samples were collected and analysed for metals by means of ICP-MS, whereas pH was measured in situ. From these results it is evident that all the metals generally regarded as toxic to macroinvertebrates namely aluminium, titanium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead, were detected at each of the sites, but not during every survey. Significant variations in the mean metal concentrations were demonstrated across all sites and surveys, with the intersurvey coefficient of variance exceeding 80% for all metals, except for Ti, Fe, Co and Ni. These results should be considered in defining the baseline metal concentrations of the Marico River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3afauna 3airon 3alead 3amacroinvertebrates 3amanganese 3anickel 3apH 3arivers 3asurveys 3atitanium 3atoxicity 3avariance 3azinc 3aSouth Africa 0aseasonal changes 0awater analyses 0awater management1 aWepener, V.,1 aWolmarans, CT0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 46, no. 1 p.123-127dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000041x1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2020.17733893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002200187245006900209300001800278506007600296520038000372592002800752506003700780650002200817650001100839650001000850650002200860700002200882700001700904700002700921773012700948856008001075852000901155655001201164IND60117752120221207130329.0141126e20140828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011775212DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00802-142doi7 aPMC41326222pmcid7 a251256462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeave, Matthew J.10aWhole-Genome Sequences of Three Symbiotic Endozoicomonas Strains  ap. e00802-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMembers of the genus Endozoicomonas associate with a wide range of marine organisms.

Unlike most interdigitated electrode biosensors, biorecognition happens in between the interdigitated electrodes, which enhances the sensitivity and limit of detection of the sensor. Using the Faradaic mode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique to quantify the PSA antigen, the developed sensing platform demonstrates a logarithmic detection of PSA ranging from 0.5 ng/ml to 5000 ng/ml, an estimated LOD down to 0.51 ng/ml in the serum, and a good sensor's reproducibility. The sensor's detection range covers the clinical threshold value at 4 ng/ml and the crucial diagnosis ‘grey zone’ of 4–10 ng/ml of PSA in serum for an accurate cancer diagnosis. The selectivity test revealed an excellent discrimination of other competing proteins, with a recorded detection signals at 5 ng/ml PSA as high as 7-fold increase versus the human serum albumin (HSA) and 8-fold increase versus the human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2). The stability test showed an acceptable stability of the aptasensor recorded at six (6) days before the detection signal started degrading below 10% of the peak detection value. The developed sensing scheme is proven to exhibit a great potential as a portable prostate cancer biosensor, also as a universal platform for bio-molecular sensing with the versatility to implement nanoparticles and other surface chemistry for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aaptasensors 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3achemistry 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahumans 3ananoparticles 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprostatic neoplasms 0aAptasensor 0aImpedance 0aInterdigitated microelectrodes 0aProstate-specific antigen 0aSelf-assembled monolayer1 aMd Arshad, M.K.1 aGopinath, Subash C.B.1 aNuzaihan M.N, M.1 aM.

Moreover, the effectiveness of soil fertilization in drylands is difficult to ensure due to immobilization of nutrients such as phosphorus and micronutrients. The use of foliar fertilization could overcome these difficulties, but its effectiveness has not been evaluated in wild dryland plants so far. In this study, we assessed the responses to foliar P, Fe, Mn and Zn fertilization before a rainfall event in two Mediterranean species with contrasting strategies to cope with drought/light stress, namely, Stipa tenacissima (poikilochlorophyllous) and Rosmarinus officinalis (photoprotective). We hypothesized that foliar fertilization can mitigate soil nutritional constraints and trigger physiological improvements enabling a more efficient use of water pulses. In non-fertilized plants, the rainfall event triggered increases in chlorophyll content, epoxidation of xanthophyll cycle pigments and PSII efficiency, indicating stress alleviation and photosynthesis improvement, but also induced decreases in foliar concentrations of several elements. Foliar fertilization increased the concentrations of sprayed nutrients in the leaves of both species. In R. officinalis, P and Zn fertilization also increased carotenoid concentrations, PSII photochemical efficiency and photosynthesis rates, and changed δ18O isotope ratios. While in S. tenacissima, Fe and Mn fertilization increased photosynthetic pigment concentrations without affecting PSII efficiency. The results obtained show that foliar fertilization can mitigate soil nutritional constraints affecting dryland vegetation, thereby promoting species-specific physiological responses to cope with water and/or light stress and ultimately leading to a more efficient use of rainfall pulses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aStipa tenacissima 3aarid lands 3achlorophyll 3adominant species 3adrought 3aecophysiology 3aecosystems 3aepoxidation reactions 3afertilizer application 3airon 3aleaves 3alutein 3amanganese 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aphysiological response 3aradiation resistance 3arain 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3astable isotopes 3avegetation 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3awater utilization 3azinc fertilizers 0aDryland 0afoliar fertilization 0arainfall-pulse use efficiency 0aRosmarinus officinalissoil nutrients availability 0aStipa tenacissima.1 aFernández, Victoria,1 aAbadía, J.q(Javier),1 aAbadía, Anunciación1 aQuerejeta, José Ignacio1 aAlbaladejo, Juan1 aBarberá, Gonzalo G.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2019 Aug. 08, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.1038543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04479naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245017600169300001600345520212500361592002802486650001902514650002302533650001102556650002602567650001002593650002802603650002302631650001802654650001502672650001002687650001002697650001902707650001402726650001702740650004002757650001802797650002502815650002902840650000902869650000902878650001102887650001702898650001902915650001602934650001902950650002802969653001802997653001703015653001703032653002303049653002703072653001603099653000903115653000803124653000903132653000703141653000803148653001003156653001003166653000803176653000803184653000703192653000803199653000603207653000903213653000703222700005903229700001903288700002003307700005903327773018303386856008303569852000903652655001203661IND60710751020221119101448.0220502e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071075102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2020.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStradling, Clare10aRandomized parallel-group pilot trial (Best foods for your heart) comparing the effects of a Mediterranean Portfolio diet with a low saturated fat diet on HIV dyslipidemia  ap. 860-869.  aMediterranean diets reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the effect is unknown in people living with HIV, who have an increased risk potentially due to the additional burdens of infection, inflammation and antiretroviral treatment (ART). We examined the feasibility of a 6-month dietary intervention in adults with HIV dyslipidemia using a sample size adequate to detect differences in LDL-cholesterol. Sixty adults with stable HIV infection on ART and LDL-cholesterol >3 mmol/l were recruited. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive dietary advice to reduce saturated fat intake to <10% of energy intake (Diet1), or supported to adopt the Mediterranean Portfolio Diet (Diet2) with additional cholesterol-lowering foods (nuts, stanols, soya, oats, beans) for 6 months. Recruitment, retention and intervention fidelity were monitored. Measurements were conducted at baseline, 6 and 12 months. A secondary analysis examined between group differences in CVD risk factors at month 6 adjusted for baseline values and potential confounders. Rates of recruitment, participation and attrition were 35%, 91%, and 12% respectively. Reported dietary adherence was 68% to Mediterranean foods and 59% to Portfolio components. At 6 months Diet2 participants (n = 29) had a significantly lower LDL-cholesterol (mean difference adjusted for baseline −0.4 mmol/l, 95%CI -0.7 to −0.1, P = 0.01), and systolic blood pressure (-7 mmHg, 95%CI -2 to −12, P = 0.008) compared to those in Diet1 (n = 31). These effects were not sustained at 1 year (LDL-cholesterol −0.05 mmol/l, 95%CI -0.33 to 0.23, P = 0.7; systolic blood pressure −3.5 mmHg, 95%CI -9.4 to 2.5, P = 0.2). We showed the feasibility of adopting a Mediterranean Portfolio diet in people living with HIV. Our findings suggest this intervention might equate to short term improvements in diet quality, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol. Further definitive evaluations are required to determine if this is a viable strategy to facilitate cardiovascular risk reduction. ISRCTN32090191 Best Foods For your heart trial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aMediterranean diet 3aadults 3aantiretroviral agents 3abeans 3acardiovascular diseases 3aclinical nutrition 3aenergy intake 3afat intake 3afoods 3aheart 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainfection 3ainflammation 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3anormal values 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritional intervention 3anuts 3aoats 3apeople 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3asample size 3asaturated fats 3asystolic blood pressure 0aHIV infection 0aDyslipidemia 0aDiet therapy 0aMediterranean diet 0aCardiovascular disease 0aCholesterol 0aAOAC 0aART 0aCACE 0aCI 0aCVD 0aDiet1 0aDiet2 0aHIV 0aMDS 0aMI 0aNHS 0aP 0aSPSS 0aUK1 aThomas, G.

First, these transformations construct valid moment conditions for the case with neither explanatory variables nor time dummies. Using valid moment conditions, we can obtain the first-order condition of the conditional maximum likelihood estimator proposed by Chamberlain (1985). Next, we derive valid moment conditions based on the transformations for the cases with strictly exogenous continuous explanatory variables and/or time dummies when the number of time periods is four or more. Transformations of these moment conditions exactly coincide with a subset of those obtained by Honoré and Weidner (2020) using the functional differencing approach proposed by Bonhomme (2012).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeconometrics 3ajournals 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 0aC33 0aC35 0aC36 0aDynamic fixed effects logit models 0aStrictly exogenous continuous explanatory variables 0aTime dummies 0aMoment conditions0 tJournal of econometrics.g2022 Aug., v. 229, no. 2 p.350-362dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01677naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245014900163300002000312520046800332592002800800650001500828650002300843650001400866650002300880650002100903650002900924650002000953650001300973650001100986700001800997700001801015700005801033773013601091856007901227852000901306655001201315IND60669576520221119041358.0190920e20190829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066957652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b017462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jing-Ya10aForging C–S Bonds through Nickel-Catalyzed Aryl Anhydrides with Thiophenols: Decarbonylation or Decarbonylation Accompanied by Decarboxylation  ap. 11891-11901.  aA nickel-catalyzed decarbonylation or decarbonylation accompanied by decarboxylation cross-coupling reaction of aryl anhydrides with thiophenols as coupling partners was disclosed.

This strategy was tried for micelles with poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) or poly(α-benzyl carboxylate-ε-caprolactone) (PBCL) cores. The surface of both micelles was also modified with the breast cancer targeting peptide, P18-4. The results showed the positive contribution of PBCL over PCL core on micellar thermodynamic and kinetic stability as well as accumulation in primary orthotopic MDA-MB-231 tumors within 4–96 h following intravenous administration in mice. This was in contrast to in vitro studies where better uptake of PEO-PCL versus PEO-PBCL micelles by MDA-MB-231 cells was observed. The presence of P18-4 enhanced the in vitro cell uptake and homing of both polymeric micelles in breast tumors, but only at early time points. In conclusion, the use of developed NIR labeling technique provided means for following the fate of PEO-poly(ester) based nano-carriers in live animals. Our results showed micellar stabilization through the use of PBCL over PCL cores, to have a more significant effect in enhancing the level and duration of nano-carrier accumulation in primary breast tumors than the modification of polymeric micellar surface with breast tumor targeting peptide, P18-4 peptide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3ain vitro studies 3aintravenous injection 3amice 3amicelles 3ananocarriers 3apolyethylene glycol 3athermodynamics 0aBreast cancer 0aNanocarriers 0aLiving imaging 0aPolymeric micelles 0aBiodistribution1 aPaiva, Igor M.1 aVakili, Mohammad R.1 aSoudy, Rania1 aAgopsowicz, Kate1 aSoleimani, Amir1 aHitt, Mary1 aKamalajīta Kaura,1 aLavasanifar, Afsaneh0 tBiomaterials.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01495naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245007900207300001800286506007600304520029600380592002800676506003700704650001100741650001300752650001100765650001000776650002300786650002500809650001000834650001400844650001400858700002100872773012700893856008001020852000901100655001201109IND60117752520221207130328.0141126e20140828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011775252DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00820-142doi7 aPMC41534862pmcid7 a251461362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Jeanette10aDraft Genome Sequence of Hawaiian Sea Slug Symbiont Vibrio sp.

Human biomonitoring (HBM) studies are the main tool to investigate human exposure to pesticides and other chemicals, but face limitations such as sampling biases, long time to complete and high costs. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an alternative approach that is centered on the chemical analysis of biomarkers of (pesticide) exposure in urban wastewater. The present study used WBE to assess human exposure to selected classes of pesticides, triazines, pyrethroids and organophosphates, in Norway. Untreated wastewater samples were collected from four cities, covering approximately 20% of the Norwegian population. The highest population weighted mass loads (mg/day/1000 inhabitants) were for alkyl phosphates and the lowest for triazines. Some differences were observed for the two metabolites, 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol (IMPY) and 3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl-(1-cyclopropane) carboxylic acid (DCCA), which were higher in the rural city of Hamar. WBE figures were comparable with HBM findings for the specific metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol; TCPY) but were different for the alkyl phosphates. Pyrethroid intake was calculated and was lower than the acceptable daily intake in all the cities, indicating low risk for human health. This is the most extensive WBE study performed to date to assess national human exposure to pesticides. This study demonstrated that WBE has the potential to be a useful complementary biomonitoring tool for assessing population-wide exposure to pesticides, overcoming some of the limitations of HBM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceptable daily intake 3abioactive properties 3abiomarkers 3acarboxylic acids 3achemical analysis 3achlorpyrifos 3acities 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aepidemiology 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3aphosphates 3apyrethrins 3atriazines 3awastewater 3aNorway 0aWastewater-based epidemiology 0aHuman urinary metabolites 0aPyrethroids 0aOrganophosphates 0aMass spectrometry 0aExposure assessment1 aGracia-Lor, Emma1 aReid, Malcolm J.1 aBaz-Lomba, Jose Antonio1 aRyu, Yeonsuk1 aZuccato, Ettore1 aThomas, Kevin V.1 aCastiglioni, Sara0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 25, v. 723 p.138132-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1381323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015800167300001800325520106000343592002801403650001501431650001101446650002101457650001401478650002001492650001501512650001501527651001301542653003801555653002301593653002201616653001801638653002201656700002201678700002101700700001701721700002901738700001801767700002301785773012501808856008501933852000902018655001202027IND60749874320221119062906.0210908e20210727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074987432DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2021.19371792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbba, S.

Besides being responsible for a blood-red discolouration of the water, the species is also toxic, causing fish mortalities. Samples from South Africa were dominated by E. sanguinea and very low concentrations and diversity of other algal species were present. Microscopic studies revealed that the size ranges and the morphology of the cells corresponded to descriptions of the species in literature. High quality micrographs, illustrating the general cell structure and most features used for accurate identification, are provided. Intensive literature searches allowed mapping of the worldwide geographical distribution of the species, which revealed that it was sparsely distributed throughout Africa, because it was reported from only seven countries. Only one previous record of its presence in experimental ponds in South Africa exists, rendering this study a second record for its presence in the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuglena 3aalgae 3acell structures 3adiscoloration 3afish 3ageographical distribution 3atoxicity 3aSouth Africa 0ablooms 0aeuglenophycin 0aglobal distribution 0ared scums 0ared water 0atoxic algae1 aLevanets, A0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2021 Jan. 2, v. 46, no. 1 p.110-122dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000041x1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2020.17997433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006400145245018200209300002000391520037600411592002800787650001300815650001700828650002300845650002300868650001900891700001900910700002100929700006500950700002001015700001901035700006001054700005701114773013601171856007901307852000901386655001201395IND60669576820200117000000.0190920e20190826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066957682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b017702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKriegelstein, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1085-107410aAxially Chiral Trifluoromethylbenzimidazolylbenzoic Acid: A Chiral Derivatizing Agent for α-Chiral Primary Amines and Secondary Alcohols To Determine the Absolute Configuration  ap. 11911-11921.  aRacemic 2-(2-trifluoromethyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (TBBA) was synthesized in three steps from 1-fluoro-2-nitrobenzene.

By integrating graphene/poly(vinyl alcohol) composites as the conductive sheath around yarn, and polyurethane yarn as the elastic core by using a layer-by-layer assembly method that is simple, scalable and low in cost, the merits of both types of materials are incorporated to fabricate sensors with enhanced performance. The combined effects of graphene concentration and number of coatings on sensor properties are elucidated, and on that basis, the electromechanical properties can be modified by adjusting the parameters. The sensors are characterized in terms of sensitivity, resistivity, linearity, repeatability, hysteresis and thermal stability. There are two sensors (graphene concentration of 0.8 wt% and 1.0 wt%, and 12 and 9 cycles of coating respectively) with high sensitivity (gauge factor of 28.48 and 86.86, respectively), good linearity between the change in relative resistance and applied strain (correlation coefficient of 0.95 and 0.97, respectively), good repeatability (repeatability error of 2.03% and 1.81%, respectively), low hysteresis (hysteresis error of 7.03% and 9.08%, respectively) and excellent thermal stability (within the range of 25 °C–310 °C).  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3afabrics 3agraphene 3ahysteresis 3apolyurethanes 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3athermal stability 0aElectromechanical 0aStrain sensor 0aGraphene 0aPolyurethane yarn1 aHua, Tao1 aXu, Bingang0 tCarbon.g2017 July, v. 118 p.686-698dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002700185245014800212300001600360520172400376592002802100650001302128650001402141650001702155650001402172650001002186650003502196650001502231650001602246650001102262650002402273650000902297650001502306650001902321650002102340650001402361650002902375651001502404651001302419700002202432700002402454700002402478700002602502700002102528700002302549700002402572773011202596856008102708852000902789655001202798IND60479666820221120101737.0160122e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047966682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-015-0257-62doi7 a10.1007/s10980-015-0257-62chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexandre, Patricia M.14aThe relative impacts of vegetation, topography and spatial arrangement on building loss to wildfires in case studies of California and Colorado  ap. 415-430.  aCONTEXT: Wildfires destroy thousands of buildings every year in the wildland urban interface. However, fire typically only destroys a fraction of the buildings within a given fire perimeter, suggesting more could be done to mitigate risk if we understood how to configure residential landscapes so that both people and buildings could survive fire. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to understand the relative importance of vegetation, topography and spatial arrangement of buildings on building loss, within the fire’s landscape context. METHODS: We analyzed two fires: one in San Diego, CA and another in Boulder, CO. We analyzed Google Earth historical imagery to digitize buildings exposed to the fires, a geographic information system to measure some of the explanatory variables, and FRAGSTATS to quantify landscape metrics. Using logistic regression we conducted an exhaustive model search to select the best models. RESULTS: The type of variables that were important varied across communities. We found complex spatial effects and no single model explained building loss everywhere, but topography and the spatial arrangement of buildings explained most of the variability in building losses. Vegetation connectivity was more important than vegetation type. CONCLUSIONS: Location and spatial arrangement of buildings affect which buildings burn in a wildfire, which is important for urban planning, building siting, landscape design of future development, and to target fire prevention, fuel reduction, and homeowner education efforts in existing communities. Landscape context of buildings and communities is an important aspect of building loss, and if taken into consideration, could help communities adapt to fire.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abuildings 3acase studies 3aeducation 3afuels 3ageographic information systems 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atopography 3aurban planning 3avegetation types 3awildfires 3awildland-urban interface 3aCalifornia 3aColorado1 aStewart, Susan I.1 aMockrin, Miranda H.1 aKeuler, Nicholas S.1 aSyphard, Alexandra D.1 aBar-Massada, Avi1 aClayton, Murray K.1 aRadeloff, Volker C.0 tLandscape ecology.g2016 Feb., v. 31, no. 2 p.415-430dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:26771x0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-015-0257-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245012100206300001400327500001100341520171900352592002802071650001402099650001502113650001202128650002302140650002202163650001702185650001402202650002202216700002302238700003902261773013102300856007902431852000902510655001202519IND60683171920221119152358.0200207e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068317192DNAL7 a10.1111/1747-0080.125462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleurke, Matthijs1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-417814aThe role of the dietitian in the management of malnutrition in the elderly: A systematic review of current practices  ap. 60-75.  aREVIEW  aAIM: The prevalence of age‐related malnutrition is increasing in almost all Western countries. Because of their expertise, dietitians should have a central role in the management of malnutrition. This review aimed to synthesise the literature on the role of the dietitian in the management of malnutrition in the elderly in comparison with other health professionals. METHODS: In November 2018, a search of Embase, Medline Ovid, Cinahl Ebscohost, Cochrane Central, Web of Science and Google Scholar was undertaken using ‘dietitian’, ‘elderly’ and ‘malnutrition’ as the main search terms. Qualitative and quantitative empirical research studies that focussed on the role of dietitians as the (main) subject of the study were included. Data extraction and data synthesis were performed by the three authors using a thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the coding and synthesis of the 21 included studies. The first theme demonstrates that other health professionals' time for, and knowledge of, screening policies negatively affects the role of the dietitian. The second theme demonstrates that the importance of nutritional care is acknowledged. However, this does not always imply familiarity with dietetics nor does it always mean that other health professionals think involving dietitians is worth the effort. The third theme demonstrates that issues of workload appeared to be especially important in crossing or guarding role boundaries. CONCLUSIONS: The role of dietitians in managing age‐related malnutrition is not always clear and coherent. Therefore, how dietitians shape their role to provide optimal management of malnutrition in the elderly is open to debate.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietetics 3adietitians 3aelderly 3aempirical research 3aissues and policy 3amalnutrition 3ascreening 3asystematic review1 aVoskuil, Dorien W.1 aBeneken genaamd Kolmer, Deirdre M.0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2020 Feb., v. 77, no. 1 p.60-75dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3613350x1446-63687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.125463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245020100178300001600379520160100395592002801996650002202024650001402046650001902060650001602079650001302095650001002108650001202118650001202130650002602142650002302168650001002191653000802201653002302209653001302232653001202245653001602257700002202273700001602295700001802311700002602329773007702355856008902432852000902521655001202530IND60531471820221121055734.0170719e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053147182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Gharabli, Samer10aEngineering of a highly efficient Xe2*-excilamp (xenon excimer lamp, λmax=172 nm, η=40%) and qualitative comparison to a low-pressure mercury lamp (LP-Hg, λ=185/254 nm) for water purification  ap. 811-815.  aExcilamps are mercury-free gas-discharge sources of non-coherent VUV or UV radiation with high radiant power and a long lifetime. The most efficient excilamp that is currently available on the market is a VUV xenon excilamp system (Xe2*-excimer lamp, λmax = 172 nm) with a stated radiant efficiency η of 40% at an electrical input power Pel of 20 W, 50 W or 100 W. In this paper, the use of this highly efficient Xe2*-excilamp (Pel = 20 W) for water treatment is demonstrated using a recirculating laboratory photoreactor system with negative radiation geometry. The efficiency in the 172 nm initiated bleaching of aqueous solutions of Rhodamine B is compared to that initiated by a common low-pressure mercury (LP-Hg) lamp (185 nm, TNN 15/32). The dependence of the pseudo zero order rate constant k´ of decolorization of RhB on the flow rate and on the initial concentration of RhB was investigated. Both lamps exhibited dependences of k´ on the initial concentration of RhB, which represents a typical saturation kinetical behavior. The saturation kinetics was very prominent in the case of the Xe2*-excilamp. Also, the Xe2*-excilamp treatment exhibited a significant influence on the flow rate of the RhB aqueous solution, which was not the case during the LP-Hg lamp initiated bleaching of RhB. The results of this paper demonstrate that Xe2*-excilamps can be used for VUV-initiated water purification. However, to reach the maximum efficacy of the Xe2*-excilamp for photo-initiated water purification further engineering optimization of the photoreactor concept is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3ableaching 3adecolorization 3aengineering 3ageometry 3alamps 3amarkets 3amercury 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater purification 3axenon 0aAOP 0aXenon-excimer lamp 0aExcilamp 0a172 nm 0aRhodamine B1 aEngeßer, Patrick1 aGera, Diana1 aKlein, Sandra1 aOppenländer, Thomas,0 tChemosphere.g2016 Feb., v. 144 p.811-815dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013000167300001600297520189000313592002802203650001702231650001002248650002002258650001102278650001502289650002202304650001702326650001902343650001202362650001502374650001302389651001302402700002302415700002002438773009702458856008102555852000902636655001202645IND60479666920221120091843.0160122e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047966692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-015-0256-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelaire, J. Amy10aDifferent social drivers, including perceptions of urban wildlife, explain the ecological resources in residential landscapes  ap. 401-413.  aCONTEXT: The conservation value of residential landscapes is becoming increasingly apparent in our urbanizing world. The ecological characteristics of residential areas are largely determined by the decisions of many individual “managers.” In these complex socio-ecological systems, it is important to understand the factors that motivate human decision-making. OBJECTIVES: Our first objective was to quantify wildlife resources and management activities in residential landscapes and compare vegetation in front and back yards. Our second objective was to test three hypotheses linked with variation in yards: socioeconomic characteristics, neighborhood design factors, and perceptions of neighborhood birds. METHODS: We conducted surveys of over 900 residents in 25 Chicago-area neighborhoods to examine the wildlife resources contained in front and back yards and the social factors associated with variation in yards. We used a multi-scalar approach to examine among-yard and among-neighborhood variation in residential landscapes. RESULTS: Results indicate that back yards contain more wildlife resources than front yards, including greater vegetation complexity, more plants with fruit/berries, and more plants intended to attract birds. Furthermore, different hypotheses explain variation in front and back yards. Perceptions of birds were most important in explaining variation in back yard vegetation and wildlife-friendly resources per parcel, while neighbors’ yards and socioeconomic characteristics best explained front yard vegetation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of back yards as an unexplored and underestimated resource for biodiversity. In addition, the results provide insight into the complex factors linked with yard decisions, notably that residents’ connections with neighborhood birds appear to translate to on-the-ground actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3adecision making 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aresidential areas 3asmall fruits 3asocial factors 3asurveys 3avegetation 3awildlife 3aIllinois1 aWestphal, Lynne M.1 aMinor, Emily S.0 tLandscape ecology.g2016 Feb., v. 31, no. 2 p.401-413dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-015-0256-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245015900173300001600332520117900348592002801527596008201555650001401637650002601651650001601677650000801693650001401701650002501715650003001740650001701770650001401787650001101801650001301812650001801825650001001843650004201853650001501895650003001910650001001940650001501950651001701965651001801982700002202000700002102022773014302043856008202186852000902268655001202277IND60682910220221118062244.0200204e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068291022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-019-00459-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDergousoff, Shaun J.10aIdentification of bacteria in the Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor andersoni, using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing  ap. 247-256.  aPCR-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses combined with DNA sequencing of the prokaryotic 16S ribosomal (r) RNA gene encompassing the hypervariable V4 region was used to determine the bacterial composition of Rocky Mountain wood ticks (Dermacentor andersoni) attached to Richardson’s ground squirrels (Urocitellus richardsonii) and questing on vegetation in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. The bacteria present in questing adult ticks from Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park included Rickettsia peacockii, a Francisella-like endosymbiont (FLE) and an Arsenophonus-like endosymbiont. Bacteria in the adult and nymphal ticks attached to U. richardsonii collected from Beechy included R. peacockii, a FLE, and several other genera (e.g., Ralstonia, Sphingobium, Comamonas and Pseudomonas). The bacteria detected in D. andersoni in the present study are consistent with the findings of other studies that have characterized the microbiome of this tick species in the USA using next generation sequencing. This result demonstrates that the SSCP-based approach used in this study is cost- and time-effective for examining bacterial composition in ticks.  aPublisher supplied data  aRGPIN-2015-06300cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aComamonas 3aDermacentor andersoni 3aPseudomonas 3aRNA 3aRalstonia 3aRickettsia peacockii 3aSpermophilus richardsonii 3aSphingomonas 3aacarology 3aadults 3abacteria 3aendosymbionts 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobiome 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aticks 3avegetation 3aSaskatchewan 3aUnited States1 aAnstead, Clare A.1 aChilton, Neil B.0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2020 Feb., v. 80, no. 2 p.247-256dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl37160x0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-019-00459-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008600166300001600252520127900268592002801547650001401575650002101589650001601610650002201626650001301648650001901661650000901680650001301689650002501702650002501727700001701752700001701769700001101786700001101797700001601808700001501824700001801839700001601857773008701873856008501960852000902045655001202054IND60566667420221120031721.0181002e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056666742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Dongmei10aStrong graphene-interlayered carbon nanotube films with high thermal conductivity  ap. 659-665.  aFast growing flexible and wearable electronics and devices require thermal management materials having not only high thermal conductivity but also structural flexibility with mechanical robustness. However, most developed thermal management materials are relatively rigid and have low strength. Herein, we report a carbon nanotube/graphene hybrid film that combines high thermal conductivity (up to 1056 W/(mK)), extraordinary structural flexibility, and high mechanical strength (∼1 GPa). Such film consists of alternately stacked aligned, long and thin carbon nanotube sheets, which provide a mechanically strong and thermally conductive scaffold, and graphene sheets, which act as a highly conductive component. The hybrid film was prepared by in-situ spraying graphene oxide sheet solution onto an aligned, freestanding carbon nanotube aerogel sheet during winding the sheet on a rotating mandrel, followed by high-temperature annealing. Experimental and theoretical results suggested that the removal of defects of the hybrid films and the formation of covalent bonding between carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets resulted in improved thermal conductivities and mechanical strength. Application of such film as an orientational heat spreader has been demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectronics 3afilms (materials) 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aheat 3aspraying 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal conductivity1 aGong, Wenbin1 aDi, Jiangtao1 aLi, Da1 aLi, Ru1 aLu, Weibang1 aGu, Bohong1 aSun, Baozhong1 aLi, Qingwen0 tCarbon.g2017 July, v. 118 p.659-665dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245009000154300001400244500002000258520103300278592002801311596005801339596002301397596004801420596003901468596002101507650002301528650001701551650001501568650001101583650001601594650002901610650001101639700001701650700001601667700002001683700002101703700003301724700002001757700002401777700001901801700002001820700002201840700001801862700002001880773013501900856007302035852000902108655001202117IND60765775920221122061042.0220202e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076577592DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.24172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCid, Núria10aFrom meta‐system theory to the sustainable management of rivers in the Anthropocene  ap. 49-57.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRegional‐scale ecological processes, such as the spatial flows of material, energy, and organisms, are fundamental for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in river networks. Yet these processes remain largely overlooked in most river management practices and underlying policies. Here, we propose adoption of a meta‐system approach, where regional processes acting at different levels of ecological organization – populations, communities, and ecosystems – are integrated into conventional river conservation, restoration, and biomonitoring. We also describe a series of measurements and indicators that could be assimilated into the implementation of relevant biodiversity and environmental policies. Finally, we highlight the need for alternative management strategies that can guide practitioners toward applying recent advances in ecology to preserve and restore river ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide, in the context of increasing alteration of river network connectivity worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  a01LN1320AcFederal Ministry of Education and Research  cAcademy of Finland  aERC‐STG 716196cEuropean Research Council  cEuropean Regional Development Fund  aN°869226cH2020 3aAnthropocene epoch 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental monitoring 3arivers1 aErős, Tibor1 aHeino, Jani1 aSinger, Gabriel1 aJähnig, Sonja C1 aCañedo‐Argüelles, Miguel1 aBonada, Núria,1 aSarremejane, Romain1 aMykrä, Heikki1 aSandin, Leonard1 aPaloniemi, Riikka1 aVarumo, Liisa1 aDatry, Thibault0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2022 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.49-57dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.24173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03863naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003700147245014600184520183600330592002802166650001402194650002002208650001902228650001302247650001402260650001502274650001802289650001602307650002102323650001602344650003802360650001602398650001202414650002002426650001202446650002202458650001702480650001702497650001102514650002202525650001502547650001802562650002302580650001402603650001802617650001302635650002202648650004302670650001702713650005202730650001602782653001502798653001602813700002002829700002502849700002802874700002202902700002802924700001802952700001802970773009802988856008203086852000903168655001203177IND60684577920221118224622.0200318e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068457792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1174422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚekhāvata, Raghunāthasiṃha,10aBerberine attenuated olanzapine-induced metabolic alterations in mice: Targeting transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 and 3 channels  aTransient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channels are emerging therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders. Berberine, which is a modulator of TRPV1, has proven antiobesity and antidiabetic potentials. The present study was aimed to investigate the protective effects of berberine in olanzapine-induced alterations in hypothalamic appetite control, inflammation and metabolic aberrations in mice targeting TRPV1 channels. Female BALB/c mice (18–23 g) were treated with olanzapine (6 mg/kg, p.o.) for six weeks to induce metabolic alterations, while berberine (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) and metformin (100 mg/kg, p.o) were used as test and standard interventions respectively. Weekly assessment of feed-water intake, body temperature and body weight was done, while locomotion was measured at the end of week 1 and 6. Serum glucose and lipid profile were assessed by biochemical methods, while other serum biomarkers were assessed by ELISA. qPCR was used to quantify the mRNA expression in the hypothalamus. Olanzapine treatment significantly increased the feed intake, weight gain, adiposity index, while reduced body temperature and locomotor activity which were reversed by berberine treatment. Berberine treatment reduced serum ghrelin and leptin levels as well decrease in hypothalamic mRNA expression of orexigenic neuropeptides, inflammatory markers and ghrelin receptor in olanzapine-treated mice. Olanzapine treatment increased expression of TRPV1/TRPV3 in the hypothalamus which was significantly decreased by berberine treatment. Our results suggest that berberine, by TRPV1/TRPV3 modulation, attenuated the olanzapine-induced metabolic alterations in mice. Hence berberine supplementation in psychiatric patients could be a preventive approach to reduce the metabolic adverse effects of antipsychotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aadverse effects 3aantipsychotics 3aappetite 3aberberine 3abiomarkers 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeed intake 3afemales 3agene expression 3aghrelin 3aghrelin receptors 3ahypothalamus 3ainflammation 3aleptin 3alipid composition 3alocomotion 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic diseases 3ametformin 3aneuropeptides 3apatients 3aprotective effect 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3atransient receptor potential vanilloid channels 3aweight gain 0aOlanzapine 0aTRPV1/TRPV31 aBansal, Yashika1 aSodhi, Rupinder Kaur1 aSingh, Dhirendra Pratap1 aBishnoi, Mahendra1 aKondepudi, Kanthi Kiran1 aMedhi, Bikash1 aKuhad, Anurag0 tLife sciences.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 247 p.117442-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1174423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245012600165520138200291592002801673650001401701650000801715650003301723650002301756650001201779650001501791650002401806650001901830650001501849650002001864650002001884700002201904773011901926856007302045852000902118655001202127IND60653496520221117082959.0190714e20190222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065349652DNAL7 a10.3390/w110203822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Bruin, Henk  A. R.12aA New Method to Estimate Reference Crop Evapotranspiration from Geostationary Satellite Imagery: Practical Considerations  aReference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) plays a role in irrigation advisory being of crucial importance for water managers dealing with scarce water resources. Following the ETo definition, it can be shown that total solar radiation is the main driver, allowing ETo estimates from satellite observations. As such, the EUMETSAT LSA-SAF operationally provides ETo primarily derived from the European geostationary satellite MSG. ETo estimations following the original FAO report require several meteorological observations gathered over actual well-watered grass. Here we will consider the impact of two effects on ETo using the LSA-SAF and FAO methodologies: (i) local advection, related to the impact of advection of surrounding warm dry air onto the reference non-water stressed surface; and (ii) the so-called surface aridity error, which occurs when calculating ETo according to FAO, but with input data not collected over well-watered grass. The LSA-SAF ETo is not sensitive to any of these effects. However, it is shown that local advection may increase evapotranspiration over a limited field by up to 30%, while ignoring aridity effects leads to a great overestimation. The practical application of satellite estimates of ETo provided by the LSA-SAF are discussed here, and, furthermore, water managers are encouraged to consider its advantages and ways for improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aair 3adry environmental conditions 3aevapotranspiration 3agrasses 3airrigation 3ameteorological data 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asolar radiation 3awater resources1 aTrigo, Isabel  F.0 tWater.g2019 Feb. 22, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110203823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014600165300001600311520224700327592002802574650001902602650001502621650001602636650001102652650000902663650001002672650001402682653001402696653001802710653001802728653002602746653002802772700002202800700001602822773010102838856008202939852000903021655001203030IND4471403820221120035812.0210302e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447140382DNAL7 a10.2478/s11687-011-0038-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠpakulová, M.10aResurrection of Pomphorhynchus tereticollis (Rudolphi, 1809) (Acanthocephala: Pomphorhynchidae) based on new morphological and molecular data  ap. 268-277.  aPomphorhynchus tereticollis (Rudolphi, 1809) is here redescribed on the basis of Rudolphi’s material, deposited in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, and on acanthocephalans recently collected from the type host Platichthys flessus (L.) and the region embodying the type locality. Out of the paratypes of P. tereticollis, the lectotype and paralectotypes have been designated. Their morphology fits well with that of newly collected material of P. tereticollis dissected from the type fish host from the Baltic coast near Stralsund. The resurrection of P. tereticollis, previously considered a synonym of Pomphorhynchus laevis (Zoega in Müller, 1779), is supported by several morphological features distinguishing the two Pomphorhynchus species: 1. The basal parts of the proboscis hooks located on the posterior proboscis half possess proximal projections in P. tereticollis but not in P. laevis. This shape of the hook bases is clearly visible only in unfixed fresh worms; 2. The last hooks are situated at the anterior part of the bulbus or rarely at the posterior-most end of the proboscis in P. tereticollis, while they lie anterior to the end of the proboscis in P. laevis; 3. The proboscis hooks No. 5 or 6 are markedly stout (robust) and clearly distinct in comparison with the surrounding hooks in P. tereticollis, while less robust and more similar to the hooks in P. laevis. In addition, genetic divergence between P. tereticollis and P. laevis based on ITS1, ITS2 and COI sequencing supports the existence of two distinct species and reveals that some isolates previously identified as P. laevis were actually P. tereticollis. Previous and present morphological and genetic data show that both Pomphorhynchus species occur in freshwaters throughout Europe and may infect the same fish hosts, such as chub and barbel, and also several species of isopods (Gammaridae). This study also provides morphological evidence that Pomphorhynchus intermedius Engelbrecht, 1957 is a synonym of P. tereticollis, because the only discrimination character of the former species, the “existing but small proximal projections of basal parts of the proboscis hooks located on the posterior proboscis half” are present also in P. tereticollis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aGammaridae 3aPlatichthys 3acoasts 3afish 3ahosts 3aproboscis 0alectotype 0aparalectotype 0aredescription 0aPomphorhynchus laevis 0agenetic differentiation1 aPerrot-Minnot, M.1 aNeuhaus, B.0 tHelminthologia.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 48, no. 4 p.268-277dVersitawJournal:jnl24740x1336-90837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11687-011-0038-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01528naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007300168300001800241520064900259592002800908650001000936650002400946650001900970650001400989650002201003650002001025700001601045773010801061856004801169852000901217655001201226IND50061565520221122220655.0130416e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006156552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-012-1101-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Hyun Kyung10aRecent updates on the development of ganetespib as a Hsp90 inhibitor  ap. 1855-1859.  aHeat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) plays a critical role in the maintenance of multiple oncogenic pathways and is a required protein for folding and stability of many oncoproteins that are related to the growth, proliferation, and survival of many kinds of cancers.

The branching significantly affects LCSTs, and they decrease with an increase in the branching density. The origin of the experimental results was theoretically analyzed on the basis of the concept of cooperative hydration, which is the sequential formation of hydrogen bonds between polymer chains and water molecules. Assuming that the cooperativity of hydration does not propagate beyond the branching points, we calculate the spinodal curves, binodal curves, and critical points and construct the phase diagrams. The degrees of hydration of the subchains, branching points, and end groups are also calculated to examine their hydration effect on the phase behavior. In this investigation, we consider the following two situations: (i) only subchains can be hydrated, and (ii) every part of HB polymers, including branching points and end groups, can be hydrated. We compare the theory with the reported observations of the cloud points of structurally well-controlled HB-PNIPAMs in water. Qualitative agreement is obtained by using the same value of cooperativity as the study of aqueous solutions of linear PNIPAMs. We also show that the hydration behavior of the end groups and the branching points strongly influences the phase behavior and illustrate that the binodal temperature is determined by the balance between the effect of promoting hydration by their hydration and suppressing hydration due to the inhibition of cooperative hydration by the branching points.  aPublisher supplied data  a21H05027cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a22J15991cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aJPMJSP2110cJapan Science and Technology Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002241 3ahydrogen 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aImamura, Yuji1 aLu, Yangtian1 aYamago, Shigeru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4112-72491 aKoga, Tsuyoshi0 tMacromolecules.g2022 Aug. 23, v. 55, no. 17 p.7932-7944dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c011623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001500189245012600204300001400330506007600344520131900420592002801739506003701767650001901804650002201823650001601845650002301861650002201884650001601906650001201922650003901934650002401973653001101997653002302008653001502031700002102046700002002067700002102087773014202108856008302250852000902333655001202342IND60557635920221207113808.0180905e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055763592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgeb.2016.03.0032doi7 aPMC62998952pmcid7 a306475952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Tuhin10aEvaluation of genetic diversity in some promising varieties of lentil using karyological characters and protein profiling  ap. 39-48.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSomatic chromosome study from root tip cells using the squash technique of the cytological method and seed protein profile of 5 varieties of Lens culinaris (Lentil) through SDS–PAGE were investigated. Karyotype analysis showed gross uniformity in morphology. Somatic chromosome number 2n=14 is constant for all the varieties. Chromosomes are mostly long to medium in length with secondary constrictions in one pair of chromosome. Primary constrictions in chromosome ranged from nearly median to nearly submedian in most of the cases. Notwithstanding the gross homogeneity, karyotype analysis revealed minute differences in details. Each lentil variety is thus characterized by its own karyotype, serving as one of the identifying criteria. The seed protein profile revealed that varieties are very close to each other with respect to similarity index that ranged from 0.594 to 0.690. With regard to seed protein banding patterns, slight polymorphism (14.285%) indicating low genetic diversity has been identified among the 5 varieties. A dendrogram indicates one variety is plesiomorphic and rest varieties are apomorphic. All the experimental varieties of lentil studied here show low genetic diversity due to their similar genetic base, indigenous genetic resources and conservative nature of the seed protein.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLens culinaris 3achromosome number 3achromosomes 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3akaryotyping 3alentils 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein composition 0aLentil 0aKaryotype analysis 0aSDS–PAGE1 aGhosh, Samanwita1 aMondal, Animesh1 aDe, Kalyan Kumar0 tJournal of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (Print).g2016 June, v. 14, no. 1 p.39-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23376x1687-157X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgeb.2016.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001800287520143300305592002801738653001101766653001701777653001701794653001401811653002401825700002401849700002501873700002101898700002801919700001901947773011601966856008102082852000902163655001202172IND60517009420221119055200.0160328e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051700942DNAL7 a10.1017/S14319276150153172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToledano, Manuel10aImproved Sealing and Remineralization at the Resin-Dentin Interface After Phosphoric Acid Etching and Load Cycling  ap. 1530-1548.  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate micro-morphology of the resin-dentin inter-diffusion zone using two different single-bottle self-etching dentin adhesives with and without previous acid-etching, after in vitro mechanical loading stimuli. Extracted human third molars were sectioned to obtain dentin surfaces. Two different single-bottle self-etching dentin adhesives, Futurabond U and Experimental both from VOCO, were applied following the manufacturer’s instructions or after 37% phosphoric acid application. Resin-dentin interfaces were analyzed with dye assisted confocal microscopy evaluation (CLSM), including the calcium-chelation technique, xylenol orange (CLSM-XO). CLSM revealed that resin-dentin interfaces of unloaded specimens were deficiently resin-hybridized, in general. These samples showed a Rhodamine B-labeled hybrid complex and adhesive layer completely affected by fluorescein penetration (nanoleakage) through the porous resin-dentin interface, but thicker after PA-etching. Load cycling promoted an improved sealing of the resin-dentin interface at dentin, a decrease of the hybrid complex porosity, and an increment of dentin mineralization. Load cycled specimens treated with the XO technique produced a clearly outlined fluorescence due to consistent Ca-mineral deposits within the bonding interface and inside the dentinal tubules, especially when the experimental adhesive was applied.  aPublisher supplied data 0adentin 0aload cycling 0afluoresceine 0aRhodamine 0aconfocal microscopy1 aCabello, Inmaculada1 aAguilera, Fátima S.1 aOsorio, Estrella1 aToledano-Osorio, Manuel1 aOsorio, Raquel0 tMicroscopy and Microanalysis.g2015 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.1530-1548dCambridge University Pressx1435-81157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14319276150153173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009700163520139700260592002801657650002601685650002401711650002201735650001501757650001301772650002501785650001501810650001901825650001301844650001401857650001401871653001901885653001301904653001201917700001701929700001401946700001901960700001701979700001801996700001802014700001302032700002102045773009702066856008202163852000902245655001202254IND60684578120221118224633.0200318e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068457812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1174442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Chunxue10aProteome array of antibody responses to Chlamydia trachomatis infection in nonhuman primates  aNonhuman primates have been used to investigate pathogenic mechanisms and evaluate immune responses following Chlamydia trachomatis inoculation. This study aimed to systemically profile antibody responses to C. trachomatis infection in nonhuman primates.Sera were obtained from 4 pig-tailed and 8 long-tailed macaques which were intravaginally or ocularly infected with live C. trachomatis organisms, and analyzed by C. trachomatis proteome array of antigens.The sera from 12 macaques recognized total 172 C. trachomatis antigens. While 84 antigens were recognized by pig-tailed macaques intravaginally infected with serovar D strain, 125 antigens were recognized by long-tailed macaques ocularly infected with serovar A, and 37 antigens were recognized by both. Ocular inoculation with virulent A2497 strain induced antibodies to more antigens. Among the antigens uniquely recognized by A2497 strain infected macaques, outer membrane complex B antigen (OmcB) induced robust antibody response. Although macaques infected by less virulent A/HAR-13 strain failed to develop antibodies to OmcB, reinfection by A2497 strain induced high levels of antibodies to OmcB.Proteome array has revealed a correlation of chlamydial infection invasiveness with chlamydial antigen immunogenicity, and identified antibody responses to OmcB potentially as biomarkers for invasive infection with C. trachomatis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia trachomatis 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aMacaca nemestrina 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abacterial infections 3abiomarkers 3aimmunogenicity 3aproteome 3aserotypes 3avirulence 0aProteome array 0aAntibody 0aPrimate1 aSun, Zhenjie1 aChen, Hui1 aChʻen, Li-li,1 aZhu, Cuiming1 aChen, Chaoqun1 aLi, Changqing1 aPeng, Bo1 aZhong, Guangming0 tLife sciences.g2020 May 01, v. 248 p.117444-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1174443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245013800166300001600304500001500320520094800335592002801283650002001311650001301331650000701344650000901351650002201360653001601382653001601398700001501414700001201429700001501441700001401456700001401470773008901484856008601573852000901659655001201668IND4446990520221118161706.0141111e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444699052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yating10aSpectrophotometric determination of melamine in milk by rank annihilation factor analysis based on pH gradual change-UV spectral data  ap. 745-750.  a2019-12-06  aA new spectrophotometric method has been developed in this paper to determine melamine in milk by applying rank annihilation factor analysis (RAFA) based on pH gradual change-UV spectral data (pH-spectra). In the proposed method, the spectra of the sample solutions at different pH data points were recorded and the pH-spectra bilinear data matrix was generated. Based on these data, the RAFA was then applied to calculate the concentration of melamine in milk. The experiments have been conducted and the results were satisfactory. Under the optimised conditions, linearity of the proposed method was in the range of 0.04–4.0μgmL⁻¹ for calibration samples, and 0.04–3.5μgmL⁻¹ for the mixed solutions of melamine with the background milk components. The detection limit (DL) was 12ngmL⁻¹. The relative predictive error (RPEs) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of applying RAFA were 0.91% and 0.0151, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3amelamine 3apH 3amilk 3aspectral analysis 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aDeng, Jian1 aAn, Lin1 aLiang, Jun1 aChen, Fei1 aWang, Hui0 tFood chemistry.g2011 May 15, v. 126, no. 2 p.745-750dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010000170300001600270520178900286592002802075650001402103650001302117650001302130650001302143650002202156650002602178650002902204650001002233650001002243650001802253650001902271650001102290650000702301650001202308650001202320650001602332650002602348651001202374653003802386653001802424653001302442653001302455653001902468700002002487700001902507700001802526773009802544856008402642852000902726655001202735IND60086298220221121031229.0190318e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008629822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2013.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDražina, Tvrtko10aSmall-scale patterns of meiofauna in a bryophyte covered tufa barrier (Plitvice Lakes, Croatia)  ap. 405-416.  aMeiobenthic fauna is complex and essential part of the stream benthos and it is known as intermediaries from bacteria to higher trophic levels. However, the dynamics and mechanisms regulating this community at small-scale largely have been neglected. This study was carried out to determine meiofaunal dynamics in a small scale-patterns influenced by flow velocity and other abiotic and biotic factors. We examined meiofauna within bryophytes on a tufa barrier in Plitvice Lakes National Park using a detailed taxonomic approach of various meiofaunal groups and their feeding guilds. We choose three microhabitats (slow, medium, fast) differing significantly in flow velocity above bryophytes. Bdelloid rotifers were the most abundant group in microhabitat with highest flow velocity, while in other two microhabitats nematodes and monogonont rotifers prevailed in abundance. Data on environmental variables and main meiofaunal taxa and feeding guilds were analyzed using redundancy analysis. This analysis indicated that microfilter feeding guild (e.g. bdelloid rotifers) was strongly affected by interaction of flow velocity and POM fractions. Other feeding guilds were influenced by temperature, oxygen and/or pH and did not prefer high flow velocity. Suction-feeder nematodes and microfilter-feeder rotifers were dominant on temporal and spatial scale, indicating their good adaptations on frequently disturbed conditions that prevailed on bryophyte covered tufa barrier. Our results provide comprehensive survey of diversity, density as well as trophic structure of meiofauna in aquatic bryophytes. Differences in meiofaunal composition and density between three microhabitats suggest that the meiofauna is relevant indicator of environmental changes even at small-scale pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryopsida 3aNematoda 3aRotifera 3abacteria 3abenthic organisms 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental indicators 3afauna 3alakes 3amicrohabitats 3anational parks 3aoxygen 3apH 3astreams 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atrophic relationships 3aCroatia 0aPermanent and temporary meiofauna 0aFlow velocity 0aNematoda 0aRotifera 0aFeeding guilds1 aŠpoljar, Maria1 aPrimc, Biserka1 aHabdija, Ivan0 tLimnologica.g2013 Nov., v. 43, no. 6 p.405-416dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2013.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245008500212300001600297506007600313520138000389592002801769506003701797650003401834650002401868650001901892650002501911650001701936650002501953650002401978650001202002650001802014650002202032650001702054650000902071650002102080650001102101650003202112650001202144650002202156650003502178650001602213650001302229650002302242650004402265650001502309650000902324650003702333653002402370653002302394653001502417653003002432700002302462700002302485700002202508700002002530700002502550773014402575856008302719852000902802655001202811IND60557636020221207110047.0180905e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055763602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgeb.2016.04.0012doi7 aPMC62999012pmcid7 a306476102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Sayed, Osama H.10aProduction of hydroxy marilone C as a bioactive compound fromStreptomyces badius  ap. 161-168.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHydroxy marilone C is a bioactive metabolite produced from the culture broth of Streptomyces badius isolated from Egyptian soil. Hydroxy marilone C was purified and fractionated by a silica gel column with a gradient mobile phase dichloromethane (DCM):methanol then Sephadex LH-20 column using methanol as a mobile phase. It was subjected to many procedures such as infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Mass spectroscopy (MS) and UV spectroscopy for elucidation of its structure. It was evaluated for antioxidant, cytotoxicity against human alveolar basal epithelial cell line (A-549) and human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) and antiviral activities; showed that the maximum antioxidant activity was 78.8% at 3mg/ml after 90min. and the IC50 value against DPPH radical found about 1.5mg/ml after 60min. Using MTT assay the effect of the pure compound on the proliferation of A-549 cells and MCF-7 cells was 443μg/ml and 147.9μg/ml, respectively, while for detection of antiviral activity using Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells the maximum cytotoxicity was at 27.9% and IC50 was 128.1μg/ml. The maximum concentration required for protecting 50% of the virus-infected cells against H1N1 viral cytopathogenicity (EC50) was 33.25% for 80μg/ml. These results indicated that the hydroxy marilone C has potential antitumor and antiviral activities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aStreptomyces badius 3aadenocarcinoma 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aantiviral properties 3abioactive compounds 3abreasts 3aculture media 3acytopathogenicity 3acytotoxicity 3adogs 3aepithelial cells 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akidneys 3amass spectrometry 3amedian effective concentration 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asilica gel 3asoil 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aStreptomyces badius 0aHydroxy marilone C 0aAnticancer 0aAntiviral and antioxidant1 aAsker, Mohsen M.S.1 aSwelim, Mahmoud A.1 aAbbas, Ibrahim H.1 aAttwa, Aziza I.1 aEl Awady, Mohamed E.0 tJournal of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (Print).g2016 June, v. 14, no. 1 p.161-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23376x1687-157X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgeb.2016.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008700168300001600255520086000271592002801131650003801159650001401197650001601211650002301227650002701250653002701277653001401304653001401318653001401332653001701346653001401363700001901377700002201396773011701418856008301535852000901618655001201627IND60611763720221120210433.0201125e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061176372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2018.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTichá, Anežka14aThe Rhomboid Superfamily: Structural Mechanisms and Chemical Biology Opportunities  ap. 726-739.  aThe rhomboid superfamily of transmembrane (TM) proteins includes intramembrane serine proteases and several classes of pseudoprotease. Rhomboid-like proteins occur widely across evolution and comprise biologically important regulators of fate of membrane proteins, influencing their proteolysis, trafficking, or degradation. In this review, we discuss how structural and mechanistic insights into the action of rhomboid proteases can inform on the mechanism of the pseudoproteases, and discuss the impact of structural understanding on the development of inhibitors and other chemical biology tools for these proteins. Development of modulators would be particularly relevant for the iRhoms, which are key regulators of ADAM17 and, hence, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, two medically important pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aevolution 3aproteolysis 3aserine proteinases 3atumor necrosis factors 0aintramembrane protease 0amechanism 0astructure 0ainhibitor 0apseudoenzyme 0asignaling1 aCollis, Blanka1 aStrisovsky, Kvido0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2018 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.726-739dElsevier LtdwJournal:6328x0968-00047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2018.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03803naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245018800176300001600364520237300380592002802753650001302781650001302794650001702807650001102824650001902835650002702854650001202881650001502893650001302908650001502921650000902936650001102945650003702956650001402993650002003007650001203027650003903039700002003078700002203098700002203120700001903142773010803161856005503269852000903324655001203333IND4475521620221119135044.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447552162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1475-2743.2011.00345.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurran Cournane, F.10aIs mechanical soil aeration a strategy to alleviate soil compaction and decrease phosphorus and suspended sediment losses from irrigated and rainâfed cattleâgrazed pastures?  ap. 376-384.  aAgriculture is a major source of phosphorus (P) and suspended sediment (SS) losses to aquatic ecosystems promoting eutrophication. Mechanical soil loosening equipments such as topsoil looseners or aerators have been reported to improve the physical quality and infiltration of soils susceptible to livestock damage resulting from treading. We hypothesized that soil aeration would significantly decrease the volume of surface runoff and consequent losses of P and SS compared with nonâaerated soil (control) in cattleâgrazed pasture on a poorly structured siltâloam soil. Hydrologically isolated plots (2âm longâÃâ1âm wideâÃâ0.15âm deep) were installed in aerated and control plots to collect surface runoff following irrigation or rainfall and analysed for P and SS losses for 1âyear. Soil physical properties [% macroporosity, bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Kunsat at â1kPa)] were measured in the aerated and control treatments and taken before each irrigation event (nâ=â12). Six months after mechanical aeration was employed, but before cattle grazing commenced, no significant differences in soil physical quality were found between aerated and control treatments, with the exception of a minor increase in Kunsat for the control plots. This lack of treatment difference continued after grazing and was largely attributed to the reâsettling of the poorly structured and dispersive soil. Flowâweighted mean concentrations and annual loads of dissolved reactive P (DRP) on the mechanically aerated soil (2.24âkg DRP/ha) were approximately double those from the control treatment (1.20âkg DRP/ha). However, no significant differences were observed between treatments for surface runoff volumes and losses of total P and total SS, which may reflect the similar soil physical conditions exhibited between treatments throughout most of the trial. As observed elsewhere, time (days) since grazing or fertilizer application was found to influence P and/or SS losses. We conclude that aeration did not decrease P and SS losses. Any changes in soil physical properties such as macroporosity were shortâlived and therefore unlikely to influence surface runoff and subsequent P and SS losses for this soil type.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aaerators 3abulk density 3acattle 3aeutrophication 3afertilizer application 3agrazing 3airrigation 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3arain 3arunoff 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asediments 3asoil compaction 3atopsoil 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity1 aMcdowell, R.

This study aims to evaluate an in-house quantitative RT-PCR for HCV RNA quantification in saliva. A total of 80 individuals (56 anti-HCV/HCV RNA + and 24 negative controls) donated serum and saliva, that were tested using an in-house quantitative PCR for HCV RNA. The median viral load was 4.77 log10 copies/mL (1.04–7.0 log10 copies/mL) in serum and 2.31 log10 copies/mL (1.0–3.84 log10 copies/mL) in saliva. A sensitivity of 80 % and specificity of 100 % were observed for HCV detection in saliva, which demonstrates the usefulness of in-house real-time PCR to quantify HCV RNA in saliva samples, which might increase the access of molecular diagnosis of HCV in laboratories that lack complex infrastructures for molecular testing and in individuals with poor venous access.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3ablood serum 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asaliva 3aviral load 0aHepatitis C virus 0aSaliva 0aQuantitative detection 0aHCV RNA 0aHCV diagnosis1 aPortilho, Moyra Machado1 ada Silva, Jessica Cavaleiro1 aCaetano, Amanda Rodrigues1 aLewis-Ximenez, Lia Laura1 aVillar, Livia Melo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7644-89690 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 Apr., v. 302 p.114470-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1144703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012200168300001600290520191900306592002802225650002202253650001902275650001202294650001802306650001002324650001302334650002302347650001102370650001402381650002102395650001202416650001802428650002202446653002202468653002802490653002702518653002802545653001902573700001902592773009802611856008402709852000902793655001202802IND60086298620221121041202.0190318e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008629862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2013.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRotvit, Lennie10aTemperature increase and respiratory performance of macroinvertebrates with different tolerances to organic pollution  ap. 510-515.  aRespiration rates (mgO2g−1 AFDWh−1) of Leuctra hippopus, Sericostoma personatum, Helodes minuta, Gammarus pulex and Asellus aquaticus were studied across an oxygen gradient at 2.8 and 6.3°C, corresponding to an expected 3.5°C increase in Danish winter stream temperature. Species were selected from the Danish Stream Fauna Index (DSFI), representing an expected hierarchy of tolerance towards water quality degradation. We expected that low-ranking, tolerant species (i.e. indicators of bad water quality) would have the capacity to regulate their oxygen uptake relatively independently of oxygen availability (oxy-regulators) and high-ranking, sensitive species (i.e. indicators of good water quality) would be less able to do so (oxy-conformers). For all species respiration rate was higher (although non-significantly) at 6.3°C. The species’ oxy-regulatory capacity did not consistently reflect their DSFI ranking. As expected, and in accordance with its DSFI ranking, A. aquaticus had the highest oxy-regulatory capacity with the ability to regulate O2 uptake until an oxygen saturation of only 20%, which did not change with increasing temperature, emphasizing the robustness of A. aquaticus towards changes in the environment. S. personatum, H. minuta and G. pulex revealed no oxy-regulatory capacity. In contrast, the plecopteran L. hippopus did display an unexpected oxy-regulatory capacity. Though an increase in temperature changed L. hippopus’ capacity to oxy-regulate (the critical limit increased from 32.5 to 43.5% oxygen), respiration rates did not change significantly in spite of the temperature increase. This result contradicts the general belief that stoneflies, because of their affinity to well oxygenated habitats, are conformers. Our findings call for further studies on the respiratory conformer–regulator concept and its role as an eco-physiological trait for bio-assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsellus aquaticus 3aGammarus pulex 3aLeuctra 3aecophysiology 3afauna 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3aoxygen 3apollution 3arespiratory rate 3astreams 3awater quality 3awater temperature 0aStream macrofauna 0aOxy-regulatory capacity 0aTemperature-dependence 0aEco-physiological trait 0aBio-assessment1 aJacobsen, Dean0 tLimnologica.g2013 Nov., v. 43, no. 6 p.510-515dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2013.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245012200161300001800283520087100301592002801172650002101200650002501221650001901246650001501265650002301280700002001303700005601323773013601379856008001515852000901595655001201604IND60686069020221121083917.0200312e20200217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068606902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b110282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Antai10aCharacterization of Photophysical Properties of Photoactivatable Fluorescent Proteins for Super-Resolution Microscopy  ap. 1892-1897.  aPhotoactivatable fluorescent proteins (PA-FPs) are widely used in photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), and information about their blinking properties is important for precise assembling of PALM images and for quantitative molecular counting with PALM. As the photophysical properties of fluorescent proteins depend sensitively on the local physiochemical environment, we developed a series of procedures to characterize the properties of the PA-FPs in fixed cells. As an example, we characterized the properties of Dendra2 in Escherichia coli and found that they are appreciably different from those in vitro. This highlights the importance of characterizing the photophysical properties of PA-FPs under the same experimental conditions as subsequent PALM imaging or molecular counting experiments. Other PA-FPs could be characterized using this strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3afluorescent proteins 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3aphysical chemistry1 aZhang, Rongjing1 aYuan, Junhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6437-06550 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 17, v. 124, no. 10 p.1892-1897dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b110283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245019300162300001800355500001900373520200200392592002802394650002302422650001702445650001902462650001402481650001202495650001702507650001402524650001202538650002302550650001202573650001002585650001202595650001302607650002102620651001602641700001402657700001902671700001902690700005902709773013702768856008202905852000902987655001202996IND60731833520221117161119.0210324e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073183352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-020-02329-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNolan, A.10aShort-term, but not acute, intake of New Zealand blackcurrant extract improves insulin sensitivity and free-living postprandial glucose excursions in individuals with overweight or obesity  ap. 1253-1262.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImpaired postprandial glucose handling and low-grade systemic inflammation are risk factors for developing insulin resistance in individuals with overweight or obesity. Acute ingestion of anthocyanins improves postprandial glucose responses to a single carbohydrate-rich meal under strictly controlled conditions. PURPOSE: Examine whether acute and short-term supplementation with anthocyanin-rich New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract can improve postprandial glucose responses to mixed-macronutrient meals. METHODS: Twenty-five overweight (BMI > 25 kg m²) sedentary individuals participated in one of the following double-blinded, randomised controlled trials: (1) ingestion of 600 mg NZBC extract or placebo prior to consumption of a high-carbohydrate, high-fat liquid meal (n = 12); (2) 8-days supplementation with NZBC extract (600 mg day⁻¹) or placebo, with insulin sensitivity and markers of inflammation assessed on day-7, and free-living postprandial glucose (continuous glucose monitoring) assessed on day-8 (n = 13). RESULTS: A single dose of NZBC extract had no effect on 3 h postprandial glucose, insulin or triglyceride responses. However, in response to short-term NZBC extract supplementation insulin sensitivity was improved (+ 22%; P = 0.011), circulating C-reactive protein concentrations decreased (P = 0.008), and free-living postprandial glucose responses to both breakfast and lunch meals were reduced (− 9% and − 8%, respectively; P < 0.05), compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: These novel results indicate that repeated intake, rather than a single dose of NZBC extract, is required to induce beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and postprandial glucose handling in individuals with overweight or obesity. Continuous glucose monitoring enabled an effect of NZBC extract to be observed under free-living conditions and highlights the potential of anthocyanin-rich supplements as a viable strategy to reduce insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aanthocyanins 3ablack currants 3abreakfast 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3aingestion 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aliquids 3alunch 3aobesity 3aplacebos 3atriacylglycerols 3aNew Zealand1 aBrett, R.1 aStrauss, J.

Parasite exit from infected cells requires the interplay of parasite-derived proteins and host actin cytoskeletal changes; however, the host proteins underlying these changes remain obscure. We report the identification of a Gαq-coupled host-signaling cascade required for the egress of both P. falciparum and T. gondii. Gαq-coupled signaling results in protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated loss of the host cytoskeletal protein adducin and weakening of the cellular cytoskeleton. This cytoskeletal compromise induces catastrophic Ca²⁺ influx mediated by the mechanosensitive cation channel TRPC6, which activates host calpain that proteolyzes the host cytoskeleton allowing parasite release. Reinforcing the feasibility of targeting host proteins as an antiparasitic strategy, mammalian PKC inhibitors demonstrated activity in murine models of malaria and toxoplasmosis.

Particularly, soft matter such as polymers or biological materials is highly susceptible and very much prone to react on electron/ion beam irradiation. Nevertheless, it is possible to turn degradation-dependent physical/chemical changes from negative to positive use when materials are intentionally exposed to beams. Especially, controllable surface modification allows tuning of surface properties for targeted purposes and thus provides the use of ultimate materials and their systems at the micro/nanoscale for creating functional surfaces. In this work, XeF₂ and I₂ gases were used in the focused ion beam scanning electron microscope instrument in combination with gallium ion etching of high-density polyethylene surfaces with different beam currents and accordingly different gas exposure times resulting at the same ion dose to optimize and develop new polymer surface properties and to create functional polymer surfaces. Alterations in the surface morphologies and surface chemistry due to gas-assisted etching-based nanostructuring with various processing parameters were tracked using high-resolution SEM imaging, complementary energy-dispersive spectroscopic analyses, and atomic force microscopic investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 0afocused ion beam 0agas-assisted etching 0asurface modification 0afunctionalized polymer surfaces 0ananostructuring1 aBakan, Feray0 tMicroscopy and Microanalysis.g2015 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.1379-1386dCambridge University Pressx1435-81157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14319276150153913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03779naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245012200209300001800331520207000349592002802419596004502447596008302492650001702575650001902592650002402611650001802635650002102653650002202674650003202696650001302728650001702741700002602758700002102784700002202805700002002827700002702847700002602874700002402900700002102924700002202945700001602967700002002983700002003003700002403023773013403047856008303181852000903264655001203273IND60753644720221123022432.0211016e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075364472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-021-02584-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorelli, Toni Lyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5865-529410aTranslational invasion ecology: bridging research and practice to address one of the greatest threats to biodiversity  ap. 3323-3335.  aEffective natural resource management and policy is contingent on information generated by research. Conversely, the applicability of research depends on whether it is responsive to the needs and constraints of resource managers and policy makers. However, many scientific fields including invasion ecology suffer from a disconnect between research and practice. Despite strong socio-political imperatives, evidenced by extensive funding dedicated to addressing invasive species, the pairing of invasion ecology with stakeholder needs to support effective management and policy is lacking. As a potential solution, we propose translational invasion ecology (TIE). As an extension of translational ecology, as a framework to increase collaboration among scientists, practitioners, and policy makers to reduce negative impacts of invasive species. As an extension of translational ecology, TIE is an approach that embodies an intentional and inclusive process in which researchers, stakeholders, and decision makers collaborate to develop and implement ecological research via joint consideration of the ecological, sociological, economic, and/or political contexts in order to improve invasive species management. TIE ideally results in improved outcomes as well as shared benefits between researchers and managers. We delineate the steps of our proposed TIE approach and describe successful examples of ongoing TIE projects from the US and internationally. We suggest practical ways to begin incorporating TIE into research and management practices, including supporting boundary-spanning organizations and activities, expanding networks, sharing translational experiences, and measuring outcomes. We find that there is a need for strengthened boundary spanning, as well as funding and recognition for advancing translational approaches. As climate change and globalization exacerbate invasive species impacts, TIE provides a promising approach to generate actionable ecological research while improving outcomes of invasive species management and policy decisions.  aPublisher supplied data  aBCS 1740267cNational Science Foundation  aICER-1852326 Belmont Forum Collaborative ResearchcNational Science Foundation 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aecological invasion 3aglobalization 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3anatural resource management 3apolitics 3astakeholders1 aBrown-Lima, Carrie J.1 aAllen, Jenica M.1 aBeaury, Evelyn M.1 aFusco, Emily J.1 aBarker-Plotkin, Audrey1 aLaginhas, Brittany B.1 aQuirion, Brendan R.1 aGriffin, Bridget1 aMcLaughlin, Blair1 aMunro, Lara1 aOlmstead, Nancy1 aRichburg, Julie1 aBradley, Bethany A.0 tBiological invasions.g2021 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.3323-3335dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02584-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010900164300001600273520095300289592002801242650002701270650002601297650002901323650001301352650001201365650001301377650001801390650002201408650001501430650001801445650001001463650003101473650002401504650002201528650002301550650001901573653001001592653004801602653002601650653002701676653001101703700001301714700001701727700001301744773012101757856008101878852000901959655001201968IND60566291720221120201915.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056629172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Haiying10aImproving anti-listeria activity of cheese packaging via nanofiber containing nisin-loaded nanoparticles  ap. 233-242.  aListeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) contamination in cheese production has received increasing attention. In order to inhibit the multiplication of the bacteria, the polyethylene oxide nanofibers containing nisin-loaded poly-γ-glutamic acid/chitosan (NGC) nanoparticles were engineered in this study. The physicochemical properties of NGC nanoparticles and anti-listeria activities of NGC nanoparticles-embedded polyethylene oxide nanofibers on cheese were investigated. The results indicated that NGC nanoparticles at 5 mg/mL of nisin had desirable polydispersity, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency and load capacity. NGC nanoparticles-embedded polyethylene oxide nanofibers displayed satisfactory antibacterial activity against L. monocytogenes on cheese, without impact on the sensory quality. Therefore, the polyethylene oxide nanofibers containing NGC nanoparticles could be a promising active packaging for food preservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aactive food packaging 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acheeses 3achitosan 3aencapsulation 3afood preservation 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3anisin 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolyglutamic acid 3asensory properties 3azeta potential 0aNisin 0aPoly-γ-glutamic acid/chitosan nanoparticle 0aElectrospun nanofiber 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aCheese1 aWu, Juan1 aLi, Changzhu1 aLin, Lin0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Aug., v. 81 p.233-242dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013400172520033800306592002800644650005200672650003400724650001400758653003000772653006500802653002000867700001500887700002200902700001700924700001800941700002000959700001800979700002600997700001901023700001901042773011201061856008701173852000901260655001201269IND60763904320221121025600.0220719e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076390432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1144772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOshiro, Satoshi10aAssessment of an immunochromatographic kit for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza viruses  aAn immunochromatographic kit was developed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses (A and B) on two detection positions of a single strip.

However, none of the single or even the triple NAS-TLR-deficient animals recapitulated the 3d susceptible phenotype to experimental toxoplasmosis. Investigating this further, we found that while parasite RNA and DNA activate innate immune responses via TLR7 and TLR9, TLR11 and TLR12 working as heterodimers are required for sensing and responding to Toxoplasma profilin. Consequently, the triple TLR7/TLR9/TLR11-deficient mice are highly susceptible to T. gondii infection, recapitulating the phenotype of 3d mice. Humans lack functional TLR11 and TLR12 genes. Consistently, human cells produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in response to parasite-derived RNA and DNA, but not to Toxoplasma profilin, supporting a more critical role for NAS-TLRs in human toxoplasmosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aToll-like receptor 3 3aToll-like receptor 7 3aToll-like receptor 9 3aToxoplasma gondii 3acytokines 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3amice 3amutation 3aparasites 3aphenotype 3atoxoplasmosis1 aSouza, Maria do Carmo1 aRamos-Martinez, Espiridion1 aNagpal, Kamalpreet1 aDutra, Miriam S.1 aMelo, Mariane B.1 aBartholomeu, Daniella C.1 aGhosh, Sankar1 aGolenbock, Douglas T.1 aGazzinelli, Ricardo T.,0 tCell host & microbe.g2013 Jan. 16, v. 13, no. 1 p.42-53dElsevier Inc.x1931-31287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2012.12.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015300170300001400323500001900337520122600356592002801582650001601610650001001626650001701636650001101653650001001664650002201674650001701696650002001713650001401733650001601747650001401763650001201777651001101789651001701800653001801817653003201835653002501867653003401892653001301926700002101939700002101960700002201981700002102003773010002024856008502124852000902209655001202218IND60695655120221118053136.0200518e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069565512DNAL7 a10.1080/00318884.2018.15175372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawai, Hiroshi10aProposal of a new brown algal species, Mesogloia japonica sp. nov.

It also suggests the occurrence of an undescribed species in the Seto Inland Sea and the Pacific coast of the Tohoku Region; whereas, S. ikomae is distributed in the Sea of Japan. The new species is genetically distinct from S. ikomae and is morphologically distinguishable in having thicker erect thalli with a more developed subcortical layer. In the phylogeny, the clade of Japanese Sauvageaugloia was sister to Mesogloia, both nesting in the clade of Cladosiphon species. Because ectocarpalean taxa are considered to be oversplit at generic rank compared to genetic divergence within the order, we refrain from describing a new genus for S. ikomae and the new species and instead suggest placing them in Mesogloia. We therefore propose the establishment of the new species Mesogloia japonica and a new combination M. ikomae. We also propose including Liebmannia leveillei in the genetically indistinguishable Mesogloia vermiculata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosiphon 3aalgae 3achloroplasts 3acoasts 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3amitochondria 3anew combination 3anew genus 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3athallus 3aEurope 3aSea of Japan 0aChordariaceae 0aMesogloia japonica sp. nov. 0aM. ikomae comb. nov. 0aMultigene molecular phylogeny 0aTaxonomy1 aHanyuda, Takeaki1 aAhibata, Kensuke1 aKamiya, Mitsunobu1 aPeters, Akira F.0 tPhycologia.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 58, no. 1 p.63-69dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00318884.2018.15175373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245009800205300001800303520099100321592002801312596007601340650001201416650002301428650002601451650002301477700006001500700005701560773012001617856008501737852000901822655001201831IND60792961120221121040938.0220914e20220824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079296112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c013092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Mengdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1626-250210aEffect of Tethering Anions in Block Copolymer Electrolytes via Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 7945-7955.  aIon-containing block copolymers (BCPs) are promising solid-state electrolytes as they can combine ion conduction and mechanical robustness via multiple microphases. However, salt-doped BCPs can have low ion conduction and transference number. One strategy to increase transference number is to tether anions to the polymer backbone (creating a single-ion conductor), though this may impact cation mobility. Leveraging coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we compare the effects of ion concentration and polymer dielectric constant on BCPs with and without bonding anions to the chain (without changing any other chemical properties). We find that single-ion BCPs have higher cation conductivity than analogous salt-doped BCPs, especially at moderate ion concentrations. We also compare several structural features of these systems; notably, tethering anions causes the ions to spread more evenly throughout the conducting phase, which is related to improved cation conduction.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-SC0014209cBasic Energy Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006151 3acations 3acomposite polymers 3adielectric properties 3amolecular dynamics1 aShen, Kuan-Hsuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9740-52041 aHall, Lisa M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3430-34940 tMacromolecules.g2022 Aug. 24, v. 55, no. 17 p.7945-7955dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c013093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015200167520117700319592002801496650001601524650001101540650002001551650001001571650001401581650001301595650000901608650001201617650001401629650001501643653001601658653002001674653001401694653001401708700001301722700001901735700001901754700001601773700001901789700001201808700001701820773010301837856008601940852000902026655001202035IND60763904520221121003031.0220314e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076390452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1060822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yaqiu10aLow concentrations of the antidepressant venlafaxine affect courtship behaviour and alter serotonin and dopamine systems in zebrafish (Danio rerio)  aVenlafaxine, a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, is a widely used antidepressant drug routinely detected in aquatic environments. However, its potential impact on courtship behaviour in zebrafish is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that venlafaxine disrupts brain monoamine levels and molecular responses essential for courtship behaviour in zebrafish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to venlafaxine (1, 10, and 100 μg/L) for 20 days. We evaluated the molecular levels and neuronal basis of the effect of venlafaxine on courtship behaviour. Here, we show that venlafaxine inhibited courtship behaviour in zebrafish and increased the transcript levels of 5-ht1a and 5-ht2c while decreasing the transcript levels of genes involved in the dopaminergic system, including th1, th2, drd1b, and drd2b. Venlafaxine upregulated 5-HT levels and downregulated dopamine levels. Moreover, the subordinate fish from the venlafaxine-exposed group had significantly lower motor activity than the subordinate fish of the control group. Collectively, our results reveal that venlafaxine can disturb brain monoamine levels, affecting courtship behaviour in adult zebrafish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aantidepressants 3abrain 3acourtship 3adopamine 3afish 3aneurons 3aserotonin 3atoxicology 0aEnvironment 0aAntidepressants 0aBehaviour 0aMonoamine1 aFan, Zhi1 aYang, Mengying1 aZhang, Shaozhi1 aLi, Meijuan1 aFang, Yongchun1 aLi, Jie1 aFeng, Xizeng0 tAquatic toxicology.g2022 Mar., v. 244 p.106082-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1060823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03908naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245017000178506010400348520207000452592002802522506003702550650001502587650002402602650001302626650001202639650003102651650001902682650001902701650001002720650001502730650002602745650002102771650001402792650001402806650001302820650001502833650002002848650001602868650001302884653001802897653001202915653001102927653001702938653000802955653001802963653002402981653002703005700001803032700002303050700001803073700002903091773010303120856008603223852000903309655001203318IND60763904620221207131944.0220314e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076390462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1060832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEriksson, Andreas N.M.10aExposure to retene, fluoranthene, and their binary mixture causes distinct transcriptomic and apical outcomes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) yolk sac alevins  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely spread environmental contaminants which affect developing organisms. It is known that improper activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by some PAHs contributes to toxicity, while other PAHs can disrupt cellular membrane function. The exact downstream mechanisms of AhR activation remain unresolved, especially with regard to cardiotoxicity. By exposing newly hatched rainbow trout alevins (Oncorhynchus mykiss) semi-statically to retene (32 µg l⁻¹; AhR agonist), fluoranthene (50 µg l⁻¹; weak AhR agonist and CYP1a inhibitor) and their binary mixture for 1, 3, 7 and 14 days, we aimed to uncover novel mechanisms of cardiotoxicity using a targeted microarray approach. At the end of the exposure, standard length, yolk area, blue sac disease (BSD) index and PAH body burden were measured, while the hearts were prepared for microarray analysis. Each exposure produced a unique toxicity profile. We observed that retene and the mixture, but not fluoranthene, significantly reduced growth by Day 14 compared to the control, while exposure to the mixture increased the BSD-index significantly from Day 3 onward. Body burden profiles were PAH-specific and correlated well with the exposure-specific upregulations of genes encoding for phase I and II enzymes. Exposure to the mixture over-represented pathways related to growth, amino acid and xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative stress responses. Alevins exposed to the individual PAHs displayed over-represented pathways involved in receptor signaling: retene downregulated genes with a role in G-protein signaling, while fluoranthene upregulated those involved in GABA signaling. Furthermore, exposure to retene and fluoranthene altered the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in calcium- and potassium ion channels, which suggests affected heart structure and function. This study provides deeper understanding of the complexity of PAH toxicity and the necessity of investigating PAHs as mixtures and not as individual components.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-proteins 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aagonists 3aalevins 3aaryl hydrocarbon receptors 3acardiotoxicity 3acell membranes 3aheart 3ametabolism 3amicroarray technology 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3apotassium 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atranscriptomics 3axenobiotics 3ayolk sac 0aTranscriptome 0aMixture 0aRetene 0aFluoranthene 0aPAH 0aRainbow trout 0aOncorhynchus mykiss 0aEarly life development1 aRigaud, Cyril1 aKrasnov, Alekseĭ,1 aWincent, Emma1 aVehniäinen, Eeva-Riikka0 tAquatic toxicology.g2022 Mar., v. 244 p.106083-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1060833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011400158300002000272520132200292592002801614650001501642650002001657650003401677650001001711650001001721650002101731650001901752650001601771650002601787650001601813650001501829700002001844700001901864700001901883773012401902856007402026852000902100655001202109IND60640417620221119214408.0190504e20160308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064041762DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra01750a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaikh, S.

ZnO thin films were synthesized by using inexpensive successive ionic layers by an adsorption and reaction method (SILAR) on the amorphous glass substrate. The fabricated metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) UV photoconductive detector shows excellent photoresponse with fast response and recovery times (18 s and 24 s) under UV illumination (wavelength −365 nm and power density −1.8 μW cm⁻²) at 5 V bias voltage. The detector shows an ohmic nature between metal semiconductor contacts with spectral responsivity 185 A W⁻¹. Gas sensing performance for detecting NO₂ gas was studied at a relatively low operating temperature of 175 °C and 20.52 response was observed for the optimized film for a 60 ppm gas concentration. The sensor has good repeatability along with a quick response time, whereas it has a relatively high recovery time. The sensor is highly selective towards NO₂ gas as compared to other gases, and has a lower detection limit of 10 ppm at an operating temperature of 175 °C. The present study opens up possibilities for the extensive study of ZnO thin film based sensor devices using a simple chemical deposition method (SILAR).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adetection limit 3aelectric potential difference 3agases 3aglass 3anitrogen dioxide 3asemiconductors 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths 3azinc oxide1 aGanbavle, V.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is associated with increased arterial calcification and increased fractures. This study investigates the effect of 6 months vitamin K2 supplementation on systemic arterial calcification and bone mineral density (BMD) in DM2 patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: In this pre-specified, post hoc analysis of a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial, patients with DM2 and CVD were randomized to a daily, oral dose of 360 µg vitamin K2 or placebo for 6 months. CT scans were made at baseline and follow-up. Arterial calcification mass was quantified in several large arterial beds and a total arterial calcification mass score was calculated. BMD was assessed in all non-fractured thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. RESULTS: 68 participants were randomized, 35 to vitamin K2 (33 completed follow-up) and 33 to placebo (27 completed follow-up). The vitamin K group had higher arterial calcification mass at baseline [median (IQR): 1694 (812–3584) vs 1182 (235–2445)] for the total arterial calcification mass). Six months vitamin K supplementation did not reduce arterial calcification progression (β [95% CI]: − 0.02 [− 0.10; 0.06] for the total arterial calcification mass) or slow BMD decline (β [95% CI]: − 2.06 [− 11.26; 7.30] Hounsfield units for all vertebrae) when compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Six months vitamin K supplementation did not halt progression of arterial calcification or decline of BMD in patients with DM2 and CVD. Future clinical trials may want to pre-select patients with very low vitamin K status and longer follow-up time might be warranted.

Based upon the phylogenetic studies of 16S rRNA, atpD, glnII, recA, rpoB, gyrB, nifH and nodC genes, the isolates originating from acid soils were identified as the phaseoli symbiovar of the Rhizobium leguminosarum-like group and Rhizobium grahamii, whereas the isolates from alkaline soils were defined as Ensifer americanum sv. mediterranense and Rhizobium radiobacter. The isolates of “R. leguminosarum” and E. americanum harbored nodC and nifH genes, but the symbiotic genes were not detected in the four isolates of the other two species. It was the first time that “R. leguminosarum” and E. americanum have been reported as bean-nodulating bacteria in Mexico. The high similarity of symbiotic genes in the Rhizobium and Ensifer populations showed that these genes had the same origin and have diversified recently in different rhizobial species. Phenotypic characterization revealed that the “R. leguminosarum” population was more adapted to the acid and low salinity conditions, while the E. americanum population preferred alkaline conditions. The findings of this study have improved the knowledge of the diversity, geographic distribution and evolution of bean-nodulating rhizobia in Mexico.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aEnsifer 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aRhizobium 3aacid soils 3aacid tolerance 3aalkaline soils 3abacteria 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3amicrosymbionts 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asalinity 3aMexico 0aRhizobia 0aBiogeography 0aPhylogeny 0aSoil pH 0aMobility 0aPhaseolus1 aZhang, Yu Jing1 aRivera-Orduña, Flor N.1 aCheng, Hai-Ping1 aSui, Xing Hua1 aWang, En Tao0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2014 Dec., v. 37, no. 8 p.605-612dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2014.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01467naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245016700152300001800319520031300337592002800650650001500678650002700693650002300720650001200743650002400755650001100779650001000790700001900800700001800819700001900837700001600856700001600872773013400888856007401022852000901096655001201105IND60659520920221117160418.0190823e20120620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065952092DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc30184a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Na10aToward highly-effective and sustainable hydrogen production: bio-ethanol oxidative steam reforming coupled with water splitting in a thin tubular membrane reactor  ap. 7137-7139.  aHighly-effective sustainable hydrogen production from ethanol and water was achieved in a tubular dense mixed-conducting oxygen permeable membrane reactor, in which water splitting took place at the tube side of the membrane and oxidative steam reforming of ethanol occurred at the shell side simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioethanol 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aethanol 3ahydrogen production 3aoxygen 3asteam1 aDong, Xueliang1 aLiu, Zhengkun1 aZhang, Guangru1 aJin, Wanqin1 aXu, Nanping0 tChemical communications.g2012 June 20, v. 48, no. 57 p.7137-7139dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc30184a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100006000186245007800246300001800324506007600342520126500418592002801683506003701711650000801748650001301756650001401769650001301783650002701796650000901823650002601832650001001858650002401868650001801892650001301910650001201923650001301935651001801948651001801966700006001984700002502044700002002069700006302089773014002152856007902292852000902371655001202380IND60599988320221207111107.0180702e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059998832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b019102doi7 aPMC57771752pmcid7 a286567522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarek, Rachel F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7898-290010aAirborne PCBs and OH-PCBs Inside and Outside Urban and Rural U.S. Schools  ap. 7853-7860.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPCBs appear in school air because many school buildings were built when PCBs were still intentionally added to building materials and because PCBs are also present through inadvertent production in modern pigment. This is of concern because children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of PCBs. Here we report indoor and outdoor air concentrations of PCBs and OH-PCBs from two rural schools and four urban schools, the latter near a PCB-contaminated waterway of Lake Michigan in the United States. Samples (n = 108) were collected as in/out pairs using polyurethane foam passive air samplers (PUF-PAS) from January 2012 to November 2015. Samples were analyzed using GC/MS-MS for all 209 PCBs and 72 OH-PCBs. Concentrations inside schools were 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than outdoors and ranged from 0.5 to 194 ng/m³ (PCBs) and from 4 to 665 pg/m³ (OH-PCBs). Congener profiles were similar within each sampling location across season but different between schools and indicated the sources as Aroclors from building materials and individual PCBs associated with modern pigment. This study is the first cohort-specific analysis to show that some children’s PCB inhalation exposure may be equal to or higher than their exposure through diet.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aaroclors 3abuildings 3achildren 3aconstruction materials 3adiet 3aenvironmental science 3afoams 3ainhalation exposure 3apolyurethanes 3asamplers 3aschools 3atoxicity 3aLake Michigan 3aUnited States1 aThorne, Peter S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5045-09291 aHerkert, Nicholas J.1 aAwad, Andrew M.1 aHornbuckle, Keri C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3478-32210 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2017 July 18, v. 51, no. 14 p.7853-7860dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b019103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012400165520212900289592002802418650001102446650001702457650001902474650001602493650001002509650001802519650001102537650001402548650001502562650001902577650002202596650002202618650001002640650001602650651001202666700002502678700002102703700002002724700002702744773012802771856007502899852000902974655001202983IND60703772320221121014747.0200721e20200106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070377232DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120102012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarczak, Paulina  T.10aPredicting Carbon Accumulation in Temperate Forests of Ontario, Canada Using a LiDAR-Initialized Growth-and-Yield Model  aClimate warming has led to an urgent need for improved estimates of carbon accumulation in uneven-aged, mixed temperate forests, where high uncertainty remains. We investigated the feasibility of using LiDAR-derived forest attributes to initialize a growth and yield (G&Y) model in complex stands at the Petawawa Research Forest (PRF) in eastern Ontario, Canada; i.e., can G&Y models based on LiDAR provide accurate predictions of aboveground carbon accumulation in complex forests compared to traditional inventory-based estimates? Applying a local G&Y model, we forecasted aboveground carbon stock (tons/ha) and accumulation (tons/ha/yr) using recurring plot measurements from 2012–2016, FVS1. We applied statistical predictors derived from LiDAR to predict stem density (SD), stem diameter distribution (SDD), and basal area distribution (BA_dist). These data, along with measured species abundance, were used to initialize a second model (FVS2). A third model was tested using LiDAR-initialized tree lists and photo-interpreted estimates of species abundance (i.e., FVS3). The carbon stock projections for 2016 from the inventory-based G&Y model) were equivalent to validation carbon stocks measured in 2016 at all size-class levels (p < 0.05), while LiDAR-based G&Y models were not. None of the models were equivalent to validation data for accumulation (p > 0.05). At the plot level, LiDAR-based predictions of carbon accumulation over a nine-year period did not differ when using either inventory or photo-interpreted species (p < 0.05). Using a constant mortality rate, we also found statistical equivalency of inventory and photo-interpreted accumulation models for all size classes ≥17 cm. These results suggest that more precise information is needed on tree characteristics than we could derive from LiDAR, but that plot-level species information is not as critical for predictions of carbon accumulation in mixed-species forests. Further work is needed on the use of LiDAR to quantify stand properties before this technique can be used to replace recurring plot measurements to quantify carbon accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aglobal warming 3ainventories 3alidar 3amixed forests 3amodels 3amortality 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3aspecies abundance 3atemperate forests 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aOntario1 aVan Ewijk, Karin  Y.1 aTreitz, Paul  M.1 aScott, Neal  A.1 aRobinson, Donald  C.E.0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Jan. 06, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120102013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04037naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006900139245019300208300001800401500002000419520236300439592002802802596007402830650001202904650002402916650001402940650001102954650001202965650001502977650001202992650001503004650001803019650003103037650001603068650001103084650001403095650001403109650002903123650001303152650001703165650001803182650001903200700002003219700002403239700006203263773012303325856007403448852000903522655001203531IND60765772820221122213024.0220202e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076577282DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.159952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonarakis, Alexander S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3194-168210aImpacts of the 2012–2015 Californian drought on carbon, water and energy fluxes in the Californian Sierras: Results from an imaging spectrometry‐constrained terrestrial biosphere model  ap. 1823-1852.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAccurate descriptions of current ecosystem composition are essential for improving terrestrial biosphere model predictions of how ecosystems are responding to climate variability and change. This study investigates how imaging spectrometry‐derived ecosystem composition can constrain and improve terrestrial biosphere model predictions of regional‐scale carbon, water and energy fluxes. Incorporating imaging spectrometry‐derived composition of five plant functional types (Grasses/Shrubs, Oaks/Western Hardwoods, Western Pines, Fir/Cedar and High‐elevation Pines) into the Ecosystem Demography (ED2) terrestrial biosphere model improves predictions of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and gross primary productivity (GPP) across four flux towers of the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (SSCZO) spanning a 2250 m elevational gradient in the western Sierra Nevada. NEP and GPP root‐mean‐square‐errors were reduced by 23%–82% and 19%–89%, respectively, and water flux predictions improved at the mid‐elevation pine (Soaproot), fir/cedar (P301) and high‐elevation pine (Shorthair) flux tower sites, but not at the oak savanna (San Joaquin Experimental Range [SJER]) site. These improvements in carbon and water predictions are similar to those achieved with model initializations using ground‐based inventory composition. The imaging spectrometry‐constrained ED2 model was then used to predict carbon, water and energy fluxes and above‐ground biomass (AGB) dynamics over a 737 km² region to gain insight into the regional ecosystem impacts of the 2012–2015 Californian drought. The analysis indicates that the drought reduced regional NEP, GPP and transpiration by 83%, 40% and 33%, respectively, with the largest reductions occurring in the functionally diverse, high basal area mid‐elevation forests. This was accompanied by a 54% decline in AGB growth in 2012, followed by a marked increase (823%) in AGB mortality in 2014, reflecting an approximately 10‐fold increase in per capita tree mortality from ~55 trees km⁻² year⁻¹ in 2010–2011, to ~535 trees km⁻² year⁻¹ in 2014. These findings illustrate how imaging spectrometry estimates of ecosystem composition can constrain and improve terrestrial biosphere model predictions of regional carbon, water, and energy fluxes, and biomass dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  aNNH11ZDA001N‐HYSPIRIcNational Aeronautics and Space Administration 3aQuercus 3aaboveground biomass 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3aclimate 3ademography 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aglobal change 3agross primary productivity 3ainventories 3amodels 3amortality 3amountains 3anet ecosystem production 3asavannas 3aspectroscopy 3atranspiration 3atree mortality1 aBogan, Stacy A.1 aGoulden, Michael L.1 aMoorcroft, Paul R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2876-46730 tGlobal change biology.g2022 Mar., v. 28, no. 5 p.1823-1852dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.159953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245008500157300001600242520218600258592002802444650001702472650001102489650001502500650001302515650001002528650001502538650001402553650000902567650002202576650001402598650001802612650002102630773009602651856007102747852000902818655001202827IND60518641220221120184256.0160418e197808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051864122DNAL7 a10.2307/19385442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeLong, Karl T.14aThe Effect of the Manipulation of Social Structure on Reproduction in House Mice  ap. 922-933.  aThe influence of social and demographic parameters on reproduction was examined by removing either adult ♂ ♂, breeding ♀♀, or subadults of both sexes from pairs of populations for 15 mo; the 4th pair of 8 populations was not manipulated. Removal of ♂ ♂ was associated with a decreased proportion of adult ♀♀ which became parous, low body growth rates for maturing ♀ ♀, low association of perforate and nonperforate ♀♀ with adult ♂ ♂, and a high association of adult ♂ ♂ with nonperforate ♀ ♀. Removal of parous ♀♀led to earlier maturation and breeding of ♂ ♂, negative association between perforate ♀♀ and adult ♂ ♂, and higher levels of aggression in the populations. Multiple regression techniques indicated that estrous cycling and lactation were best explained by the activity of nonperforate ♀♀ and their association with adult ♂ ♂, the number of young weaned the previous month, the percentage of adult ♂ ♂ in the populations, and the aggressive tendency of these ♂♂. Aggressive tendency was measured in ♂ ♂ removed from the populations and paired with nonaggressive control mice. Nulliparous ♀ ♀ were more sensitive than parous ♀ ♀ to changes in social] behavior or demography of a population; litters born to previously nulliparous ♀ ♀ were clustered on certain months, whereas litters of parous ♀ ♀ were born randomly. Although most ♀ ♀ failed to reproduce during the later stages of population growth, this inhibition of reproduction was not always permanent; when nonbreeding ♀ ♀ were removed from the populations, transferred to small cages, and paired with adult ♂♂ from the populations, one half reproduced within 1 mo. Nestling survival was influenced negatively by the number of aggressive acts, the proportion of adults of either sex in the population, and the proportion of perforate and lactating ♀ ♀. Only ♂ dominance had a positive correlation with litter survival. The sex ratio of recently weaned mice varied greatly and was similar to that found among adults, even when the removal of adults of 1 sex caused the adult sex ratio to be markedly unequal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMus musculus 3aadults 3aaggression 3abreeding 3acages 3ademography 3alactation 3amice 3apopulation growth 3asex ratio 3asocial change 3asocial structure0 tEcology.g1978 Aug., v. 59, no. 5 p.922-933dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19385443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010500169520158900274592002801863650001101891650002401902650002001926650002501946650001601971650002201987650001602009650001902025650003902044650002302083650002602106650002502132650001302157650001402170650001502184650002502199653004502224653003702269653003002306653006702336700001802403700001602421700002002437700002102457773011902478856008802597852000902685655001202694IND60717862420221119221429.0220328e20210225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071786242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1437642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongbo10aWeak electricity stimulates biological nitrate removal of wastewater: Hypothesis and first evidences  aNitrate pollution in water is a worldwide health and environmental concern. Biological nitrate removal of wastewater is widely used countering eutrophication of water bodies; however it could be troublesome and expensive when influent carbon source is insufficient. Here we present a novel process, the microbial fuel cell (MFC)-resistance-type electrical stimulation denitrification process (RtESD) using microbial weak electricity originated from the wastewater, to enhance nitrate removal. Results show that the optimal nitrate dependent denitrification rate (0.027 mg N/L·h) and nitrate removal efficiency (98.1%) can be achieved; partial autotrophic denitrification was enhanced in RtESD under stimulation of 0.2 V of microbial weak electricity (MWE). Aromatic proteins also increased in the presence of 0.2 V MWE stimulation according to three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy profiles, indicating that electron transfer could be improved in the case of MWE stimulation. Furthermore, the microbial community structure and diversity analysis results demonstrated that MWE stimulation inhibited the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and activated the autotrophic denitrifying bacteria in RtESD. Two hypotheses, enhancement of electron transfer and improvement of microorganism activity, were proposed regarding to the MWE stimulated pathways. This study provided a promising method utilizing MWE derived from wastewater to improve the denitrification rate and removal efficiency of nitrate-containing wastewater treatment processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3aelectrical treatment 3aelectricity 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironment 3aeutrophication 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial fuel cells 3anitrates 3apollution 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aNitrate (NO3−-N) containing wastewater 0aMicrobial weak electricity (MWE) 0aMicrobial fuel cell (MFC) 0aResistance-type electrical stimulation denitrification (RtESD)1 aOuyang, Feiyu1 aChen, Zihua1 aChen, Zhongbing1 aLichtfouse, Eric0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 25, v. 757 p.143764-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1437643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01357naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100002700168245005500195300001600250520043100266592002800697653001300725653001200738653002000750653001000770653001300780700002100793773012800814856011600942852000901058655001201067IND60125453220221121212223.0151103e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012545322DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745(2008)111[231:ZOITIP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalabrese, Graciela M.10aZygodon (Orthotrichaceae) in the Iberian Peninsula  ap. 231-247.  aThe genus Zygodon in the Iberian Peninsula is revised and six species are recognized: Zygodon catarinoi, Z. conoideus, Z. forsteri, Z. rupestris, Z. stirtonii and Z. viridissimus.

The camera calibration for UAV image blocks can be performed a priori or during the bundle block adjustment (self-calibration). For an area of interest with flat scene and corridor configuration, the focal length of camera is highly correlated with the height of the camera. Furthermore, systematic errors of camera calibration accumulate on the longer dimension and cause deformation. Therefore, special precautions must be taken when estimating camera calibration parameters. In order to better investigate the impact of camera calibration errors, a synthetic, error-free aerial image block is generated to simulate several issues of interest. Firstly, the erroneous focal length in the case of camera pre-calibration is studied. Nadir images are not able to prevent camera poses from drifting to compensate for the erroneous focal length, whereas the inclusion of oblique images brings significant improvement. Secondly, the case where the focal length varies gradually (e.g., when the camera subject to temperature changes) is investigated. The neglect of this phenomenon can substantially degrade the 3D measurement accuracy. Different flight configurations and flight orders are analyzed, the combination of oblique and nadir images shows better performance. At last, the rolling shutter effect is investigated. The influence of camera rotational motion on the final accuracy is negligible compared to that of the translational motion. The acquisition configurations investigated are not able to mitigate the degradation introduced by the rolling shutter effect. Other solutions such as correcting image measurements or including camera motion parameters in the bundle block adjustment should be exploited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3acameras 3adeformation 3aflight 3aphotogrammetry 3aremote sensing 3arolling 3atemperature 3atopography 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aRupnik, Ewelina 1 aMeynard, Christophe 1 aThom, Christian 1 aPierrot-Deseilligny, Marc 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Dec. 19, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120100223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245010200166520131200268592002801580650002401608650002901632650001201661650002001673650002501693650001101718650001401729650000901743650001101752650001101763650001201774700002401786700001701810700001901827700002101846700002401867773012001891856007302011852000902084655001202093IND60748526720221121032752.0210827e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074852672DNAL7 a10.3390/f120809702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJasińska, Karolina D.10aHabitat-Related Differences in Winter Presence and Spring–Summer Activity of Roe Deer in Warsaw  aPreliminary research conducted in Warsaw in the 1970s and 2000s showed that roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) stayed in forest habitat and avoided anthropogenic areas. Activity and exploration patterns of animals are shaped by indices of anthropogenic disturbances, elevated in large cities. The aims of the study were (1) to compare the presence of roe deer in natural and anthropogenic habitats of Warsaw during three periods: 1976–1978, 2005–2008 and 2017–2021, based on snow tracking on transect routes (681.2 km in total), and (2) to describe the presence and activity of roe deer in relation to human disturbances in selected urban forests in its reproductive period (March–August), based on camera trap survey (2019–2020, 859 observations, 5317 trap-days in total). The number of tracks was higher in natural habitat during all three periods, with the highest value in 2017–2021 (9.85/km/24h). The peak of roe deer activity was recorded at dusk, and it changed with moon phases between spring and summer. Landscape connectivity and level of light pollution did not affect the activity pattern of roe deer. Our research showed that roe deer inhabiting urban areas avoided human presence by using well-covered habitats and being active in periods when the level of human disturbance was lower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aanthropogenic activities 3acameras 3aforest habitats 3ahabitat connectivity 3ahumans 3apollution 3asnow 3aspring 3asummer 3asurveys1 aJackowiak, Mateusz 1 aGryz, Jakub 1 aBijak, Szymon 1 aSzyc, Katarzyna 1 aKrauze-Gryz, Dagny 0 tForests.g2021 July 22, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120809703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01905naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245005700172300001800229520101000247592002801257650002201285650001601307650001401323700002501337700001701362700003101379773011501410856008101525852000901606655001201615IND50069148120221123033412.0150208e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006914812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-012-0838-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosales-Cruzaley, E.10aSperm cells manipulation employing dielectrophoresis  ap. 1353-1362.  aInfertility studies are an important growing field, where new methods for the manipulation, enrichment and selection of sperm cells are required. Microfluidic techniques offer attractive advantages such as requirement of low sample volume and short processing times in the range of second or minutes. Presented here is the application of insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) for the enrichment and separation of mature and spermatogenic cells by employing a microchannel with cylindrical insulating structures with DC electric potentials in the range of 200–1500 V. The results demonstrated that iDEP has the potential to concentrate sperm cells and distinguish between mature and spermatogenic cells by exploiting the differences in shape which lead to differences in electric polarization. Viability assessments revealed that a significant percentage of the cells are viable after the dielectrophoretic treatment, opening the possibility for iDEP to be developed as a tool in infertility studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectrophoresis 3aspermatozoa 3aviability1 aCota-Elizondo, P.

This study quantified the levels of EPFRs in airborne PM with different aerodynamic diameters (dₐₑ) using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR spectra showed a single, unstructured signal from persistent semiquinone radicals. The average concentration of EPFRs in the airborne PM during haze events was 2.18 × 12²⁰ spins/g (range: 3.06 × 10¹⁹–6.23 × 10²⁰ spins/g), approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than that reported previously in the US atmosphere. Particle-size distributions of EPFRs in four different PM fractions (dₐₑ > 10 μm, 10 μm < dₐₑ < 2.5 μm, 2.5 μm <dₐₑ < 1 μm, dₐₑ < 1 μm) indicated the highest levels of EPFRs in the PM fraction with dₐₑ < 1 μm, with average 1/e lifetime of 59.2 days. A significant occurrence of EPFRs in PM samples collected from coal-burning activities (1.52 × 10²² spins/g), automobile exhaust (3.0 × 10²² spins/g), and biomass burning activities (1.14 × 10²² spins/g) was detected, which may be potential primary sources of EPFRs in airborne PM. The results in this study may help to understand the sources and potential risks of EPFRs in airborne fine particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3abiomass 3aburning 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenvironmental science 3afree radicals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticulates 3arisk 3aUnited States1 aLiu, Guorui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8462-67341 aZheng, Minghui1 aJin, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9677-61771 aZhu, Qingqing1 aZhao, Yuyang1 aWu, Xiaolin1 aXu, Yang0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2017 July 18, v. 51, no. 14 p.7936-7944dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b019293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245009200155300001800247520128100265592002801546650002601574650001501600650001201615650001001627650001101637650001301648650001301661650001501674650001501689650001801704650001701722650001001739650001401749650001101763700002301774773009801797856007101895852000901966655001201975IND60518641520221120173607.0160418e197808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051864152DNAL7 a10.2307/19385612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBest, Mary D.10aGrowth of Myriophyllum: Sediment or Lake Water as the Source of Nitrogen and Phosphorus  ap. 1075-1080.  aA series of laboratory culture experiments was designed to investigate uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen by roots and shoots of Myriophyllum spicatum in a number of lake water/substrate and nutrient medium/substrate environments. The plants were compared with respect to biomass, physical dimensions, and total P and N in the plant tissues. It appears that Myriophyllum spicatum can meet its requirements for N by root uptake from the sediment as well as by absorption from the water itself through stem and leaf tissue. It was also seen that Myriophyllum can absorb considerable quantities of P from the sediment via the root system and transport it to the shoot regions of the plant. Growth data suggest that N was growth—limiting for sand—grown plants in nitrate—deficient media, even though tissue N was high. Growth was not decreased in low—phosphate media, suggesting that phosphate—limiting conditions were probably not attained in these experiments. A synergistic relationship between P and N was noted; P in the water clearly affected the ability of Myriophyllum plants to take up nitrate from the water. These data suggest that the limiting concentration of nitrate for Myriophyllum might vary considerably depending in part on the phosphate concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3aabsorption 3abiomass 3alakes 3aleaves 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aplant tissues 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asediments 3ashoots1 aMantai, Kenneth E.0 tEcology.g1978 Aug., v. 59, no. 5 p.1075-1080dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19385613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100005900186245010400245300001800349506007600367520145900443592002801902506003701930650002001967650001301987650001502000650001402015650002602029650002102055650002002076650003102096650001002127650001102137650002402148650001302172650002502185650001002210650001402220650002102234650001702255650001902272650001802291650002902309650002602338650001602364700002002380700002202400700001602422700002302438700006002461700001602521700001902537700005902556700006102615773014002676856007902816852000902895655001202904IND60599988720221207112441.0180702e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059998872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b019672doi7 aPMC56109122pmcid7 a286363832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ying-Hsuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8904-128710aGene Expression Profiling in Human Lung Cells Exposed to Isoprene-Derived Secondary Organic Aerosol  ap. 8166-8175.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSecondary organic aerosol (SOA) derived from the photochemical oxidation of isoprene contributes a substantial mass fraction to atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅). The formation of isoprene SOA is influenced largely by anthropogenic emissions through multiphase chemistry of its multigenerational oxidation products. Considering the abundance of isoprene SOA in the troposphere, understanding mechanisms of adverse health effects through inhalation exposure is critical to mitigating its potential impact on public health. In this study, we assessed the effects of isoprene SOA on gene expression in human airway epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) through an air–liquid interface exposure. Gene expression profiling of 84 oxidative stress and 249 inflammation-associated human genes was performed. Our results show that the expression levels of 29 genes were significantly altered upon isoprene SOA exposure under noncytotoxic conditions (p < 0.05), with the majority (22/29) of genes passing a false discovery rate threshold of 0.3. The most significantly affected genes belong to the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor network. The Nrf2 function is confirmed through a reporter cell line. Together with detailed characterization of SOA constituents, this study reveals the impact of isoprene SOA exposure on lung responses and highlights the importance of further understanding its potential health outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aaerosols 3acell lines 3aemissions 3aenvironmental science 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainhalation exposure 3aisoprene 3aliquid-air interface 3alungs 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aparticulates 3aphotochemistry 3apublic health 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atroposphere1 aArashiro, Maiko1 aClapp, Phillip W.1 aCui, Tianqu1 aSexton, Kenneth G.1 aVizuete, William1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1399-29481 aGold, Avram1 aJaspers, Ilona1 aFry, Rebecca C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0899-90181 aSurratt, Jason D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6833-14500 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2017 July 18, v. 51, no. 14 p.8166-8175dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b019673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003900147245010000186300001600286500001900302520218400321592002802505650001402533650002302547650002302570650001102593650001302604650001402617650001902631650002802650650001002678650001402688651001002702653002202712653001602734653001302750653001202763700002902775700003702804700002202841700003102863700001602894773014802910856008203058852000903140655001203149IND60728467420221120155544.0210401e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072846742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2021.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssèdé, Eméline Sêssi Pélagie10aManaging woodland development stages in Sudanian dry woodlands to meet local demand in fuelwood  ap. 129-138.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWoodlands in the Sudanian zone are under different management regimes, including total protection and controlled use mainly for feeding livestock and collecting fuelwood. This study conducted in Sudanian woodlands of Benin, around the Biosphere Reserve of Pendjari (BRP) aimed to: (i) determine the effect of selective stem thinning and branch pruning on the production of standing biomass of the woodlands; and (ii) assess the effectiveness of Sudanian woodlands to meet the fuelwood demand of the local population. Three vegetation units of about 80 m × 80 m each were identified, relatively uniform floristically and structurally, and representing three woodland development stages in Sudanian woodlands. Three random blocks (replications) of 20 m × 20 m each were demarcated within each vegetation unit. Each block was then divided into four treatment plots of 10 m × 10 m each. Treatments were randomly allocated and consisted of i) no thinning (T1), ii) 30% thinning (T2), iii) 60% thinning (T3), and iv) 100% thinning (T4). Standard branch pruning was applied to all remaining stems. The species name, diameter and/or height of the remaining stems ≥ 1 m height were recorded twice during the year period between 2015 and 2016. A semi-structured questionnaire was randomly applied to 150 households to record detailed information on the tree species as well as the quantity of fuelwood used or sold each day. Thinning and pruning had a positive effect on biomass production. The best biomass production (0.88 t/ha/year or 15,028.5 t/year for an area of 16,938.7 ha) was obtained with 60% thinning and pruning. Whatever the treatment, the biomass production did not meet the demand for fuelwood of the local population around the BRP. A deficit between 69.5% (T1) and 64.6% (T3) was observed. The mean per capita fuelwood needs of the households was 1.3 kg/day, and decreased with increasing household size. Extending the experimentation over a longer period (at least ten years), and establishing and using the allometric equations of recorded tree species will improve the estimation of the biomass production of these woodlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3abiomass production 3aconservation areas 3aenergy 3afuelwood 3alivestock 3aquestionnaires 3asustainable development 3atrees 3awoodlands 3aBenin 0aSudanian Woodland 0aTree growth 0aThinning 0aPruning1 aAzihou, Fortuné Akomian1 aBiaou, Samadori Sorotori Honoré1 aMariki, Sayuni B.1 aGeldenhuys, Coert Johannes1 aSinsin, B.,0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2021 Apr., v. 61 p.129-138dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2021.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04755naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010100161520342100262592002803683650001603711650002503727650001203752650002803764650002103792650001103813650001603824650001303840650001203853650002403865650002103889650001503910650001203925650001503937650001003952650001903962650001403981650001103995650002104006651001304027700002104040700002204061773012004083856007304203852000904276655001204285IND60748527120221121045027.0210827e20210810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074852712DNAL7 a10.3390/f120810632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoods, Natasha N.10aLong-Term Community Dynamics Reveal Different Trajectories for Two Mid-Atlantic Maritime Forests  aMaritime forests are threatened by sea-level rise, storm surge and encroachment of salt-tolerant species. On barrier islands, these forested communities must withstand the full force of tropical storms, hurricanes and nor’easters while the impact is reduced for mainland forests protected by barrier islands. Geographic position may account for differences in maritime forest resilience to disturbance. In this study, we quantify two geographically distinct maritime forests protected by dunes on Virginia’s Eastern Shore (i.e., mainland and barrier island) at two time points (15 and 21 years apart, respectively) to determine whether the trajectory is successional or presenting evidence of disassembly with sea-level rise and storm exposure. We hypothesize that due to position on the landscape, forest disassembly will be higher on the barrier island than mainland as evidenced by reduction in tree basal area and decreased species richness. Rate of relative sea-level rise in the region was 5.9 ± 0.7 mm yr⁻¹ based on monthly mean sea-level data from 1975 to 2017. Savage Neck Dunes Natural Area Preserve maritime forest was surveyed using the point quarter method in 2003 and 2018. Parramore Island maritime forest was surveyed in 1997 using 32 m diameter circular plots. As the island has been eroding over the past two decades, 2016 Landsat imagery was used to identify remaining forested plots prior to resurveying. In 2018, only plots that remained forested were resurveyed. Lidar was used to quantify elevation of each point/plot surveyed in 2018. Plot elevation at Savage Neck was 1.93 ± 0.02 m above sea level, whereas at Parramore Island, elevation was lower at 1.04 ± 0.08 m. Mainland dominant species, Acer rubrum, Pinus taeda, and Liquidambar styraciflua, remained dominant over the study period, with a 14% reduction in the total number of individuals recorded. Basal area increased by 11%. Conversely, on Parramore Island, 33% of the former forested plots converted to grassland and 33% were lost to erosion and occur as ghost forest on the shore or were lost to the ocean. Of the remaining forested plots surveyed in 2018, dominance switched from Persea palustris and Juniperus virginiana to the shrub Morella cerifera. Only 46% of trees/shrubs remained and basal area was reduced by 84%. Shrub basal area accounted for 66% of the total recorded in 2018. There are alternative paths to maritime forest trajectory which differ for barrier island and mainland. Geographic position relative to disturbance and elevation likely explain the changes in forest community composition over the timeframes studied. Protected mainland forest at Savage Neck occurs at higher mean elevation and indicates natural succession to larger and fewer individuals, with little change in mixed hardwood-pine dominance. The fronting barrier island maritime forest on Parramore Island has undergone rapid change in 21 years, with complete loss of forested communities to ocean or conversion to mesic grassland. Of the forests remaining, dominant evergreen trees are now being replaced with the expanding evergreen shrub, Morella cerifera. Loss of biomass and basal area has been documented in other low elevation coastal forests. Our results indicate that an intermediate shrub state may precede complete loss of woody communities in some coastal communities, providing an alternative mechanism of resilience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer rubrum 3aJuniperus virginiana 3aLandsat 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aMorella cerifera 3aPersea 3aPinus taeda 3aaltitude 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3adominant species 3agrasslands 3aislands 3alandscapes 3alidar 3asalt tolerance 3asea level 3ashrubs 3aspecies richness 3aVirginia1 aTuley, Philip A.1 aZinnert, Julie C.0 tForests.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120810633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245007000156300001600226520115800242592002801400650002401428650002601452650001301478650003001491650002801521650001801549650001101567650002301578650001501601650001201616773009601628856007101724852000901795655001201804IND60518641620221120173638.0160418e197808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051864162DNAL7 a10.2307/19385432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Mary V.14aThe Role of Microhabitat in Structuring Desert Rodent Communities  ap. 910-921.  aInterspecific competition is thought to be important in determining patterns of resource use and species abundances in natural communities. However, there have been few field tests of competition—based models of community structure. In this study, experiments were conducted with 4 coexisting desert rodent species to see whether competition is a sufficient explanation for their resource use and abundance patterns. Results were consistent with 3 predictions from competition theory. (1) The 4 species differed in their use of a resource, foraging microhabitat, which is potentially limiting to their populations. (2) Each species shifted its use of microhabitats in predicted directions when competitors were removed from or added to outdoor enclosures. (3) Each species was most dense where its preferred microhabitat was abundant, and augmentation of 1 microhabitat led to an increase in the density of the appropriate microhabitat specialist. These results suggest that competition maintains interspecific differences in foraging microhabitat, and that the availability of appropriate microhabitats determines species abundances on a local scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3ainterspecific competition 3ainterspecific variation 3amicrohabitats 3amodels 3aoutdoor enclosures 3aprediction 3arodents0 tEcology.g1978 Aug., v. 59, no. 5 p.910-921dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19385433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003200166245007000198300001600268500001500284520159900299592002801898650001501926650001801941650001901959650002801978650001502006650001002021650001202031650001702043650001702060650003802077650002402115650001402139650001502153650002202168650001402190650002402204650002802228650001202256650002602268650001102294650004602305650001302351650005002364650001102414650001402425650001502439650002202454650001402476650001802490650001702508650003002525650006302555651001102618651002602629653002402655700003402679773011202713856004802825852000902873655001202882IND50072872620221119043235.0140211e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007287262DNAL7 a243073902pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-013-0514-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Jenevaldo Barbosa10aRisk factors for anaplasmosis in dairy cows during the peripartum  ap. 461-465.  a2019-12-06  aAnaplasma marginale is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas around the world. Some studies have suggested that cows during peripartum may present a transient immunosuppression state and development of clinical signs of anaplasmosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between some risk factors and the seroprevalence of A. marginale in dairy cows during peripartum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The risk factors analyzed in association with the prevalence of antibodies against A. marginale in dairy cows were calving season, reproductive experience, breed standard, tick infestations, stocking density, and milk yield. The antibodies against A. marginale were tested in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A primary screening using a 2 × k contingency table of the exposed variables with the outcomes was performed. All variables for which p < 0.20 were included in a fixed effects log regression. The risk factors investigated to anaplasmosis were calving (OR 2.61, IC 1.08–7.63), breed standard (OR 3.83, IC 0.08–0.28), reproductive experience (OR 33.7, IC 2.14–5.16), milk yield (OR 3.9, IC 2.24–7.03), Rhipicephalus microplus infestations (OR 10.3, IC 0.05–0.17), and stocking density (OR 22.3, IC 0.05–0.17). Low titers of antibodies against A. marginale during peripartum had been characterized as a period previous to development of clinical anaplasmosis. Thus, studies on anaplasmosis should consider each farm as an epidemiological unit, where environmental and immunological factors may influence the endemic status of the pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy cows 3astocking rate 3aseroprevalence 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aantibodies 3afarms 3acalving 3aanaplasmosis 3arisk factors 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aAnaplasma marginale 3ascreening 3amilk yield 3atick infestations 3apathogens 2aAnaplasma marginale 2aAnaplasmosisxpathology 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterial 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aDairying 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aOdds Ratio 2aPeripartum Period 2aPregnancy 2aRhipicephalus 2aRisk Factors 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aTick Infestationsxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 3aBrazil 0aBrazilxepidemiology. 0aBoophilus microplus1 ada Fonseca, Adivaldo Henrique0 tTropical animal health and production.g2014 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.461-465dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-013-0514-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001400142245011100156520082400267592002801091650001001119650001001129650001301139650002301152650002001175650001301195650001201208651001001220653000901230653001201239653001001251653001201261653001101273700001601284700002201300700001401322773010201336856007801438852000901516655001201525IND4464471020221118201238.0160209e20120608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446447102DNAL7 a10.1515/1556-3758.22912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui10aEffect of Sodium Chloride on the Color, Texture, and Sensory Attributes of Douchi During Post-Fermentation  aDouchi is a traditional fermented soybean food in China.

In this study, the effect of post-fermentation time and sodium chloride (NaCl) on Douchi fermented with Mucor wutungkiao were studied by measuring the color, texture and sensory attributes. The a* value and color differences (E) increased, while the hardness decreased during the post-fermentation. The results showed that post-fermentation time and NaCl content affected the color and texture significantly (p<0.05). The sensory attributes of Douchi with 12.5% NaCl content was more preferable than samples with 5%, 7.5% and 10% NaCl content in the post-fermentation, and 4 weeks of post-fermentation time was good for the formation of favorable sensory attributes in Douchi with 12.5% NaCl content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMucor 3acolor 3ahardness 3asensory properties 3asodium chloride 3asoybeans 3atexture 3aChina 0aNaCl 0atexture 0acolor 0asensory 0adouchi1 aYin, Li-Jun1 aCheng, Yong-Qiang1 aLi, Lide,0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2012 June 8, v. 8, no. 2dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/1556-3758.22913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010400163300002000267520136300287592002801650650001101678650001201689650003001701650002801731650001601759650002801775650002101803650002401824650000901848650001901857650002201876650001901898650001801917650002301935700001701958700001601975700001501991700001302006700005302019700005602072773013802128856008002266852000902346655001202355IND60657166220221119182442.0190816e20190725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065716622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b041612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Fanjun10aSynergistic Effect on the Improved Electrochemical Performance in the Case of Fe₁–ₓCdₓCO₃  ap. 19333-19339.  aThe large volume change and low electronic conductivity are the two main drawbacks for metal carbonates as promising anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. Metal doping is one of the most effective methods to address these issues. Herein, cadmium-doped ferrous carbonate Fe₁–ₓCdₓCO₃ (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) composites have been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method for the first time. The morphologies of FeCO₃ are evolved from microspheres to the agglomerated nanoparticles and then nanocubes with the increase of Cd doping. Fe₀.₈Cd₀.₂CO₃ microspheres deliver higher capacity and cycling stability in Fe₁–ₓCdₓCO₃ composites and better electrochemical performance than the corresponding 0.8FeCO₃ + 0.2CdCO₃ mixtures owing to an inner synergistic effect between Cd and Fe atoms in Fe₁–ₓCdₓCO₃. The density functional theory calculation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicate that Fe₀.₈Cd₀.₂CO₃ can maintain the similar electronic structure with good electric conductivity to FeCO₃ and lithium-ion diffusion coefficient with fast ion transport to CdCO₃. Our work can open a new door for the design to enhance electrochemical performance of metal carbonates and provide the scientific understanding of the synergistic effect on the metal carbonate electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acadmium 3adensity functional theory 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adiffusivity 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3ahot water treatment 3airon 3airon carbonate 3alithium batteries 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3aphysical chemistry1 aHan, Zhengsi1 aHe, Xiaolei1 aYu, Hailin1 aTao, Shi1 aQian, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8029-43061 aLuo, Hongmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9546-761X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 25, v. 123, no. 32 p.19333-19339dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b041613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010600160520153700266592002801803650002001831650002501851650002001876650001201896650002501908650002001933650001501953650002301968650002201991651002902013651001302042700002202055773012002077856007302197961001202270852000902282655001202291IND60748527320221121045022.0210827e20210810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074852732DNAL7 a10.3390/f120810652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenderson, Eric 10aSpatially Explicit Kirtland’s Warbler Habitat Management Scheduling in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula  aA spatially explicit management strategy is presented for Kirtland’s Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) habitat on the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The Hiawatha National Forest has a goal of continuously providing large patches of dense young jack pine for Kirtland’s warbler breeding habitat. The problem is challenging as patches of suitable habitat are relatively short lived, forcing large shifts in the location of large patches in the future. In this study, alternative management strategies for providing habitat are described, explicitly mapped, and compared on a 70,600 ha landscape in the context of implementing many desired conditions of the forest’s land management plan. Strategies are developed by using two interacting scheduling models. Comparisons address overall habitat levels, habitat spatial arrangement through time, and financial trade-offs. The financial cost of managing habitat is high and there are further financial trade-offs associated with aggregating habitat into large patches. Furthermore, the marginal cost of habitat increases as more habitat is added to the management system. Managers may use information about the added costs of spatially explicit habitat management to help evaluate the added benefits to the species. It is often expensive to establish wildlife habitat and desirable ecological conditions, but results show that there are potential benefits from using detailed computer-aided management scheduling tools to support the decision-making process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus banksiana 3aSetophaga kirtlandii 3adecision making 3aforests 3ahabitat conservation 3aland management 3alandscapes 3amanagement systems 3awildlife habitats 3aHiawatha National Forest 3aMichigan1 aHoganson, Howard 0 tForests.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120810653Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001500142245010700157520085900264592002801123650001101151650001001162650001201172650001401184650000901198650001201207650001101219650002401230650001301254650002001267650001201287650001601299650002001315653004201335653003101377653001801408653002401426653002201450700001201472700001301484773010301497856007801600852000901678655001201687IND4464471320221118201528.0160209e20120626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446447132DNAL7 a10.1515/1556-3758.27242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Quanyi10aFormation of Nε-(Carboxymethyl)lysine in Saccharide-Lysine Model Systems by Different Heat Treatments  aAdvanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) form when proteins are heated with reducing sugars. Nε-(Carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), as one of the common AGEs studied in consumed foods, was determined by HPLC-MS/MS in this experiment. The aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of forming CML incubated by different heat treatments in saccharide - lysine model systems. Different heating treatment such as water heating (W- heating), drying oven heating (D- heating) and microwave heating (M- heating) in saccharide-lysine model systems can affect the production of CML. M-heating method showed higher formation of CML capacity than W-heating method and D-heating method. The higher temperature and higher molar ratio of saccharide to lysine can increase the CML content. The order of reactivity for the formation of CML was lactose > glucose > sucrose.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrying 3afoods 3aglucose 3aglycation 3aheat 3alactose 3alysine 3amicrowave treatment 3aproteins 3areducing sugars 3asucrose 3atemperature 3awater treatment 0aadvanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) 0aNε-(carboxymethyl) lysine 0awater heating 0adrying oven heating 0amicrowave heating1 aLi, Lin1 aLi, Bing0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2012 June 26, v. 8, no. 3dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/1556-3758.27243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01178naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100002800168245005500196300001600251520025100267592002800518653002100546653002300567653001900590653001100609700002700620773012800647856011600775852000900891655001200900IND60125454020221121155453.0151103e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012545402DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745(2008)111[318:PCMAAM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuáárez, Guillermo M.10aPohlia Chilensis (Mniaceae), an Afro-American Moss  ap. 318-322.  aPohlia clavicaulis from Bolivia and Pohlia emergens from Argentina are reduced to synonymy under Pohlia chilensis (Mont.)

Anxiety is closely linked to, and may exacerbate, LOC eating. Yet, it remains unclear how anxiety relates to leptin, or if the relationship is moderated by the presence of LOC eating. We examined whether self-reported trait anxiety interacted with LOC eating in relation to leptin in a convenience sample of youths (n = 592; 13.1 &plusmn; 2.7 years; body mass index z-score (BMIz) = 0.9 &plusmn; 1.1; 61.8% girls; 53.5% non-Hispanic White; 36.6% with LOC eating). LOC eating was assessed by interview. Leptin was measured after an overnight fast. Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine anxiety and LOC eating in relation to laboratory intake patterns in three sub-samples. In a generalized linear model adjusting for relevant covariates, anxiety significantly interacted with LOC eating in relation to leptin (p = 0.02), such that greater trait anxiety related to higher concentrations of leptin only among youth with LOC eating. Trait anxiety was not significantly related to fasting serum leptin independently in a generalized linear model adjusting for age, race, height, sex, study type, and fat mass (kg). Exploratory mechanistic analyses of food intake patterns did not identify consistent results for participants with both anxiety and LOC eating. Among youth with LOC eating, anxiety may be associated with higher serum leptin. Prospective data are required to elucidate the directionality and mechanisms of these relationships.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadiposity 3aanxiety 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3afasting 3afood intake 3agirls 3aleptin 3alinear models 3ayouth1 aTanofsky-Kraff, Marian 1 aJaramillo, Manuela 1 aShank, Lisa  M.1 aLeMay-Russell, Sarah 1 aRubin, Sarah  G.1 aRamirez, Sophie 1 aAltman, Deborah  R.1 aSchvey, Natasha  A.1 aBrady, Sheila  M.1 aShomaker, Lauren  B.1 aCourville, Amber  B.1 aYang, Shanna  B.1 aKozlosky, Merel 1 aBroadney, Miranda  M.1 aYanovski, Susan  Z.1 aYanovski, Jack  A.0 tNutrients.g2019 Sept. 12, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110921983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007900169300001800248520144100266592002801707650001601735650001601751650002101767650001501788650001101803650002401814650002101838650002501859650001401884650001401898650002001912650003401932650001701966650001101983650001501994700002002009700002002029700001602049773011502065856008102180852000902261655001202270IND50069148720221123033522.0150208e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006914872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-012-0881-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEaktasang, Numfon10aControl of malodorous hydrogen sulfide compounds using microbial fuel cell  ap. 1417-1425.  aIn this study, a microbial fuel cell (MFC) was used to control malodorous hydrogen sulfide compounds generated from domestic wastewaters. The electricity production demonstrated a distinct pattern of a two-step increase during 170 h of system run: the first maximum current density was 118.6 ± 7.2 mA m⁻²followed by a rebound of current density increase, reaching the second maximum of 176.8 ± 9.4 mA m⁻². The behaviors of the redox potential and the sulfate level in the anode compartment indicated that the microbial production of hydrogen sulfide compounds was suppressed in the first stage, and the hydrogen sulfide compounds generated from the system were removed effectively as a result of their electrochemical oxidation, which contributed to the additional electricity production in the second stage. This was also directly supported by sulfur deposits formed on the anode surface, which was confirmed by analyses on those solids using a scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy as well as an elemental analyzer. To this end, the overall reduction efficiencies for HS⁻and H₂S₍g₎were as high as 67.5 and 96.4 %, respectively. The correlations among current density, redox potential, and sulfate level supported the idea that the electricity signal generated in the MFC can be utilized as a potential indicator of malodor control for the domestic wastewater system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aelectricity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aoff odors 3aoxidation 3aredox potential 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aspectroscopy 3asulfur 3awastewater1 aMin, Hyeong-Sik1 aKang, Christina1 aKim, Han S.0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2013 Oct., v. 36, no. 10 p.1417-1425dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-012-0881-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010400163300001600267500002000283520162400303592002801927650001901955650002301974650002401997650001402021650001402035650001402049650001702063650001702080650001802097650001902115650001002134650002002144650001602164650001302180650001102193650002602204650001702230650001902247650002102266650002802287650001802315650002502333650001002358651001002368700003502378700006402413700001502477700002902492700002902521773012502550856007402675852000902749655001202758IND60765773620221122051547.0220202e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076577362DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.234112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangavelu, Lakshmi10aAcacia catechu seed extract provokes cytotoxicity via apoptosis by intrinsic pathway in HepG2 cells  ap. 446-456.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAcacia catechu Willd (Fabaceae) is a thorny tree widely distributed in India and commonly used as traditional Ayurvedic medicine for various ailments. The current study evaluates the cytotoxic potentials of A. catechu ethanolic seed extract (ACSE) in HepG2 cells, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. The HepG2 cells were treated with 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1000 μg/ml of ACSE and the cytotoxic effect was evaluated by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage assays. The IC₅₀ of ACSE was found at 77.04 μg/ml and therefore, further studies were carried out with the concentrations of 35 and 70 μg/ml. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis‐related morphological changes were evaluated. Gene expressions of Bax, Bcl‐2, cytochrome C (Cyt‐c), caspases‐9 and 3 were analyzed by qPCR. The ACSE treatments caused LDH leakage was associated with an increased ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was associated with the downregulation of intracellular antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione content. AO/EB and PI staining also confirmed chromatin condensation and apoptosis. The flow cytometric analysis showed an accumulation of HepG2 cells at sub G0/G1 (apoptotic) phase upon ACSE treatments. The ACSE induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were related to increased apoptotic marker gene expressions such as Bax, Cyt‐c, caspase‐9 and 3, and decreased anti‐apoptotic marker Bcl‐2. The current finding suggests that ACSE has apoptosis‐inducing potential via the mitochondrial pathway in HepG2 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia catechu 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-9 3achromatin 3acytochrome c 3acytotoxicity 3aecotoxicology 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aglutathione 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3aseed extracts 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atrees 3aIndia1 aGeetha, Royapuram Veeraragavan1 aDevaraj, Ezhilarasan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5068-23831 aDua, Kamal1 aChellappan, Dinesh Kumar1 aBalusamy, Sri Renukadevi0 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2022 Mar., v. 37, no. 3 p.446-456dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl57773x1520-40817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.234113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100006600192245008100258300001800339506007600357520136000433592002801793506003701821650001701858650001501875650002001890650001701910650001301927650001501940650003601955650002001991650000902011653002402020653001702044653001502061653001502076653002302091653002002114653002002134653000902154700002602163700002102189700002302210700002002233700001802253700001802271700002402289700002202313700002202335700002202357700005902379700001902438700002202457700002102479773013402500856008602634852000902720655001202729IND60615185520221207144012.0181020e20180816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061518552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b003022doi7 aPMC64699312pmcid7 a301149072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutierrez, Danielle B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6355-213413aAn Integrated, High-Throughput Strategy for Multiomic Systems Level Analysis  ap. 3396-3408.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics generate comprehensive data sets, and current biocomputational capabilities allow their efficient integration for systems biology analysis. Published multiomics studies cover methodological advances as well as applications to biological questions. However, few studies have focused on the development of a high-throughput, unified sample preparation approach to complement high-throughput omic analytics. This report details the automation, benchmarking, and application of a strategy for transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses from a common sample. The approach, sample preparation for multi-omics technologies (SPOT), provides equivalent performance to typical individual omic preparation methods but greatly enhances throughput and minimizes the resources required for multiomic experiments. SPOT was applied to a multiomics time course experiment for zinc-treated HL-60 cells. The data reveal Zn effects on NRF2 antioxidant and NFkappaB signaling. High-throughput approaches such as these are critical for the acquisition of temporally resolved, multicondition, large multiomic data sets such as those necessary to assess complex clinical and biological concerns. Ultimately, this type of approach will provide an expanded understanding of challenging scientific questions across many fields.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidants 3aautomation 3adata collection 3ametabolomics 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranscriptomics 3azinc 0amechanism of action 0ametabolomics 0amultiomics 0aproteomics 0asample preparation 0asystems biology 0atranscriptomics 0azinc1 aGant-Branum, Randi L.1 aRomer, Carrie E.1 aFarrow, Melissa A.1 aAllen, Jamie L.1 aDahal, Nikesh1 aNei, Yuan-Wei1 aCodreanu, Simona G.1 aJordan, Ashley T.1 aPalmer, Lauren D.1 aSherrod, Stacy D.1 aMcLean, John A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8918-64191 aSkaar, Eric P.1 aNorris, Jeremy L.1 aCaprioli, R.

However, the regulation network and detailed molecular mechanisms underlying endosome trafficking remain unclear. Here, comparative proteomic analysis was carried out to survey the overall effect of NtGNL1 on pollen tube polar growth and NtGNL1-dependent endosome trafficking. With multiple comparative systems (RNAi, Wild type, and BFA or wortmannin treatments), 481 distinct proteins were identified including 43 common DEPs (differentially expressed proteins), of which 16 significant DEPs were common among RNAi, BFA, and wortmannin treated pollen tubes, indicating their close relation to the endosome trafficking. GO annotation indicates that the vesicle trafficking of gnl1ᴴᴱ pollen tubes differs from that of the BFA and wortmannin treated pollen tubes in the COPII-coated vesicle budding process. KEGG pathway analysis suggests that the Pentose phosphate pathway is critical for the NtGNL1-dependent endosome trafficking. Yeast two-hybrid further confirmed that the NtGNL1-Sec7 domain interacted strongly with VPS32.2, TCTP, PIS2, and PDIL2-1, suggesting that the core functional region of NtGNL1 is the Sec7 domain. Therefore, NtGNL1 likely functions via its Sec7 binding with these proteins to affect endosome trafficking. Our results provide a clear outline of proteins involving in NtGNL1-dependent endosome trafficking and valuable clues for understanding the regulatory mechanism of NtGNL1 guided pollen tube polar growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3apentose phosphate cycle 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3aproteomics 3atwo hybrid system techniques 0aEndosome trafficking 0aiTRAQ 0aNtGNL1 0aPolar growth 0aCOPII-Coated vesicle 0aPentose phosphate pathway1 aLi, Ling1 aLiao, Fanglei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4716-84441 aChen, Wenrong0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 161 p.200-209dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245012400158300001800282520221800300592002802518650004402546650002302590650002402613650001902637650001102656650002202667650001502689650001502704650001902719650003702738650002502775650001202800650001302812650000702825650001502832650001402847650001402861650001302875650002002888650001302908650001302921650001302934700001902947700001202966700001502978700001702993700001903010700001803029700006003047700002003107700001803127700003203145700005503177773014003232856007903372852000903451655001203460IND60599989120221119132519.0180702e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059998912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b020062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Lin10aSelenium Sequestration in a Cationic Layered Rare Earth Hydroxide: A Combined Batch Experiments and EXAFS Investigation  ap. 8606-8615.  aSelenium is of great concern owing to its acutely toxic characteristic at elevated dosage and the long-term radiotoxicity of ⁷⁹Se. The contents of selenium in industrial wastewater, agricultural runoff, and drinking water have to be constrained to a value of 50 μg/L as the maximum concentration limit. We reported here the selenium uptake using a structurally well-defined cationic layered rare earth hydroxide, Y₂(OH)₅Cl·1.5H₂O. The sorption kinetics, isotherms, selectivity, and desorption of selenite and selenate on Y₂(OH)₅Cl·1.5H₂O at pH 7 and 8.5 were systematically investigated using a batch method. The maximum sorption capacities of selenite and selenate are 207 and 124 mg/g, respectively, both representing the new records among those of inorganic sorbents. In the low concentration region, Y₂(OH)₅Cl·1.5H₂O is able to almost completely remove selenium from aqueous solution even in the presence of competitive anions such as NO₃–, Cl–, CO₃²–, SO₄²–, and HPO₄²–. The resulting concentration of selenium is below 10 μg/L, well meeting the strictest criterion for the drinking water. The selenate on loaded samples could be desorbed by rinsing with concentrated noncomplexing NaCl solutions whereas complexing ligands have to be employed to elute selenite for the material regeneration. After desorption, Y₂(OH)₅Cl·1.5H₂O could be reused to remove selenate and selenite. In addition, the sorption mechanism was unraveled by the combination of EDS, FT-IR, Raman, PXRD, and EXAFS techniques. Specifically, the selenate ions were exchanged with chloride ions in the interlayer space, forming outer-sphere complexes. In comparison, besides anion exchange mechanism, the selenite ions were directly bound to the Y³⁺ center in the positively charged layer of [Y₂(OH)₅(H₂O)]⁺ through strong bidentate binuclear inner-sphere complexation, consistent with the observation of the higher uptake of selenite over selenate. The results presented in this work confirm that the cationic layered rare earth hydroxide is an emerging and promising material for efficient removal of selenite and selenate as well as other anionic environmental pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aagricultural runoff 3aanion exchange 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbonates 3adesorption 3adrinking water 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aindustrial effluents 3aligands 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphates 3aselenates 3aselenites 3aselenium 3asodium chloride 3asorbents 3asulfates 3atoxicity1 aZhang, Linjuan1 aLi, Jie1 aZhang, Duo1 aChen, Lanhua1 aSheng, Daopeng1 aYang, Shitong1 aXiao, Chengliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5081-23981 aWang, Jianqiang1 aChai, Zhifang1 aAlbrecht-Schmitt, Thomas E.1 aWang, Shuao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1526-11020 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 51, no. 15 p.8606-8615dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b020063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011300160300002000273520096300293592002801256650002101284650001101305650002201316650002201338650001601360650001701376653002701393653003101420653002201451653003601473653002101509700002201530700005801552700005801610700001801668700002301686700003201709700002001741700006101761773014101822856007801963852000902041655001202050IND60595130120180622000000.0180528e20171227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059513012DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b100392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArora, Neha10aDonor–Acceptor-Type S,N-Heteroacene-Based Hole-Transporting Materials for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 44423-44428.  aTwo new donor–acceptor (D–A)-substituted S,N-heteroacene-based molecules were developed and investigated as hole-transporting material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Optical and electrochemical characterization brought out that the energy levels of both HTMs are suitable for their use in PSCs. Consequently, a power-conversion efficiency of 17.7% and 16.1% was achieved from PSCs involving the HTM-1 and HTM-2, respectively. The optoelectronic properties in terms of series resistance, conductivity, and charge carrier recombination were further examined to unfold the potential of these new HTMs. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy brought out that the hole injection from the valence band of perovskite into HTMs follows the trend, which is in accordance with the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital. Overall, our findings underline the potential of S,N-heteroacene co-oligomers as promising HTM candidates for PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3amaterials science 3aphotoluminescence 3asolar cells 3aspectroscopy 0aperovskite solar cells 0ahole-transporting material 0aS−N-heteroacene 0atime-resolved photoluminescence 0adonor−acceptor1 aWetzel, Christoph1 aDar, M.

Here we report for the first time that the development of a novel multivalent self-assembled DNA polymer, constructed through telomerase primer sequence (ITS) triggered hybridization chain assembly using two functional hairpin probes (tumor-trageting aptamer modified H1 and signal probe modified H2), for sensitive detection and imaging of telomerase activity in living cells. After internalizing into the tumor cells by multivalent aptamer targeting, the ITS on DNA polymers can be elongated by intracellular telomerase to generate telomere repeat sequences that are complementary with the signal probe, which can proceed along the DNA polymers, and gradually light up the whole DNA polymers, leading to an enhanced fluorescence signal directly correlated with the activity of telomerase. Our results demonstrated that the developed DNA polymer show excellent performance for specifically detecting telomerase activity in cancer cells, dynamically monitoring the activity change of telomerase in response to telomerase-based drugs, and efficiently distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells. The proposed strategy may afford a valuable tool for the monitoring of telomerase activity in living cells and have great implications for biological and diagnostic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomedical research 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aimage analysis 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymers 3atelomerase 3atelomeres1 aYe, Hongyan1 aLiu, Jin-Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9340-81091 aYu, Ru-Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7412-83601 aJiang, Jian-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1594-40230 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 90, no. 22 p.13188-13192dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b046313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100002000168245008600188300001600274520110900290592002801399653001501427653002701442653001401469653001801483653001601501653002001517653000801537653002301545700002601568700002601594773012901620856011601749852000901865655001201874IND60125454320221121155453.0151103e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012545432DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745(2008)111[363:HLINAC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrodo, Irwin M.10aHaematomma (Lecanoraceae) in North and Central America, Including The West Indies  ap. 363-423.  aThe North American, Central American and West Indian species of the lichen genus Haematomma are revised, with special emphasis given to the chemistry and distribution of the taxa.

This species and H. leprarioides are reported as new to North America. Notes on the chemistry and, in a few cases, the morphology, of 11 non-American species are also provided. Rosellinula kalbii was found growing as a parasite on H. guyanense, the first report on this host.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHaematomma 0aHaematomma caperaticum 0achemistry 0aNorth America 0aWest Indies 0aCentral America 0akey 0aRosellinula kalbii1 aCulberson, William L.1 aCulberson, Chicita F.0 tBryologist.g2008 Sept., v. 111, no. 3 p.363-423dThe American Bryological and Lichenological Society, Inc.x0007-27457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1639%2F0007-2745%282008%29111%5B363%3AHLINAC%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005500092040001800147072000900165100001300174245011700187300001600304500002400320520105400344650002001398650003001418650003001448650003101478650002701509650002701536650002101563650001301584650001401597650001401611650001901625650001901644651001301663653001601676700001401692700001501706773011701721852000901838856010501847930003301952945002501985946001302010655001202023IND4405321320221119082216.0080506e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440532132DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X(2008)37[505:IHFMDC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8211 aRuiu, L.10aImmature House Fly (Musca domestica) Control in Breeding Sites With a New Brevibacillus laterosporus Formulation  ap. 505-509.  aIncludes references  aA bacterial formulation containing spores of a Brevibacillus laterosporus strain from Sardinia, known to be toxic by ingestion to the house fly (Musca domestica), was assayed in laboratory, outdoor, and field conditions for the control of immature stages of this pest. In all laboratory assays, the bacterial formulation exhibited toxicity against house fly larvae. A concentration of 1 x 108 spores of B. laterosporus/g of diet caused 100% mortality of house fly immature stages. The same formulation, applied at a concentration of 1 x 108 spores/ml, equivalent to a dose of 2 liters/m2, caused a reduction in adult emergence from laboratory and natural breeding substrates (outdoor cage experiments) up to 80.3 and 57.8%, respectively. Similarly, this formulation applied in the cow pen of a diary farm at a dose of 2 liters/m2 produced a significant reduction (30%) in immature fly development. Therefore, the use of this bacterial preparation in microbiological control strategies for the integrated pest management of this species is promising. 3aMusca domestica 3abiological control agents 3aentomopathogenic bacteria 3aBrevibacillus laterosporus 3abacterial insecticides 3apesticide formulations 3abacterial spores 3atoxicity 3aimmatures 3amortality 3abreeding sites 3ainsect control 3aSardinia 0afly control1 aSatta, A.1 aFloris, I.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2008 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.505-509dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2008)37[505:IHFMDC]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20081002b20081101c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/10/02  aOther US 7aarticle02623naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245008800162300002000250520130700270592002801577650001101605650001901616650001401635650001501649650001901664650002101683650001301704650002101717650001401738650003301752650001601785653001501801653002101816653001801837653001901855653001201874700001901886700005601905773014101961856007802102852000902180655001202189IND60595130220221122191126.0180528e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059513022DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b103082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Wan Jae10aMonolithic Nanoporous In–Sn Alloy for Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide  ap. 43575-43582.  aNanostructured metal catalysts to convert CO₂ to formate, which have been extensively studied over decades, have many problems such as durability, lifetime, high process temperature, and difficulty in controlling the morphology of nanostructures. Here, we report a facile method to fabricate monolithic nanoporous In–Sn alloy, a network of nanopores, induced by electroreduction of indium tin oxide nanobranches (ITO BRs). The electroreduction process concentrated a local electric field at the tip of the nanostructure, leading to current-assisted joule-heating to form a nanoporous In–Sn alloy. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the nanopore size of In–Sn alloy could be controlled from 1176 to 65 nm by tuning the electroreduction condition: the applied potential and the time. As a result, formate Faradaic efficiency could be improved from 42.4% to 78.6%. Also, current density was increased from −6.6 to −9.6 mA/cm² at −1.2 VRHE, thereby resulting in the highest HCOO– production rate of 75.9 μmol/(h cm²). Detachment of catalysts from the substrate was not observed even after a long-term (12 h) electrochemical measurement at high potential (−1.2 VRHE). This work provides a design rule to fabricate highly efficient and stable oxide-derived electrocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3adurability 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3aformates 3aindium tin oxide 3ananopores 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 0ananoporous 0aelectroreduction 0aIn−Sn alloy 0acarbon dioxide 0aformate1 aYoo, Chul Jong1 aLee, Jong-Lam1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4502-97580 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 20, v. 9, no. 50 p.43575-43582dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b103083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005300145245010400198300001800302520135200320592002801672650001601700650001701716650000901733650001101742650002601753650001201779650000901791650003701800650001801837650002001855650002301875700005501898700005801953700001802011700001702029700001502046700001602061700001302077773014002090856007902230852000902309655001202318IND60599989420221119132451.0180702e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059998942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b020312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9677-617710aSecondary Copper Smelters as Sources of Chlorinated and Brominated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons  ap. 7945-7953.  aThe generation of and extent to which chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Cl/Br-PAHs) are formed and released from secondary copper smelters remain unknown. This field study, to our knowledge, is the first to identify secondary copper smelters as new sources of Cl/Br-PAHs. Mass concentrations of ∑₁₉Cl-PAHs and ∑₁₉Br-PAHs ranged from 5.8 to 271 ng Nm–³ and 0.59 to 52.4 ng Nm–³, respectively. A comparison of Cl/Br-PAH concentrations in stack gas and fly ash from secondary copper smelters indicated that the use of scrap copper as raw material or the addition of coal or heavy oil as reductant may contribute to the elevated formation and emission of Cl/Br-PAHs. Congener profiles of Cl/Br-PAHs in stack gas and fly ash from secondary copper smelters were different with those of Cl/Br-PAHs from waste incinerations and other previously reported sources, thus could be used as possible fingerprints and source apportionments of environmental Cl/Br-PAHs. Atmospheric levels of Cl/Br-PAHs in the workplace or smelter surroundings were determined and potential exposures were assessed. Although chlorination of PAHs was previously recognized as an important formation pathway of Cl/Br-PAHs, it was not verified to be the major formation pathway for Cl/Br-PAHs from secondary copper smelters in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromination 3achlorination 3acoal 3acopper 3aenvironmental science 3afly ash 3aoils 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3araw materials 3areducing agents 3aworking conditions1 aLiu, Guorui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8462-67341 aZheng, Minghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5270-67591 aJiang, Xiaoxu1 aZhao, Yuyang1 aYang, Lili1 aWu, Xiaolin1 aXu, Yang0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2017 July 18, v. 51, no. 14 p.7945-7953dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b020313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014000165300001600305520116000321592002801481650001501509650001301524650001501537650002101552650002001573650001401593650001201607650001201619650001301631653001001644653001401654653001401668653001301682653000901695653001201704700001401716700001701730700001601747700001701763700002101780700001601801773010201817856008201919852000902001655001202010IND60605718420221120224748.0180723e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060571842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2016.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernauer, M.10aProton proximity – New key parameter controlling adsorption, desorption and activity in propene oligomerization over H-ZSM-5 zeolites  ap. 157-172.  aThe proximity of protons (∼5Å) derived from the distribution of Al atoms in the H-ZSM-5 framework has been shown to substantially affect the rate of propene oligomerization. Two sets of H-ZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al 13–30) greatly differing in the occurrence of Al pairs (AlSiSiAl sequences in 6MRs) or distant Al atoms in the framework (both located prevailingly at the channel intersections) were synthesized to analyze the effect of the proton proximity. Propene adsorption and formation of oligomeric alkoxides is faster over distant isolated protons, while the close (5Å) positive charges of proximate protons result in faster olefin(s) release from H-bonded propene and oligomeric alkoxides. As the steady-state TOF of propene oligomerization to C4–C9 olefins at 473–533K over close protons exceeds 2–10 fold (with increasing Si/Al) those over isolated protons, the release of olefins from alkoxides is suggested to be an important reaction step. The distribution of framework Al atoms determining the mutual distances of protons represents a new parameter for evaluating rates of acid-catalyzed reactions and individual steps over H-zeolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3adesorption 3ahydrogen bonding 3aoligomerization 3apropylene 3aprotons 3asilicon 3azeolites 0aZSM-5 0aAl siting 0aSingle Al 0aAl pairs 0aFTIR 0aMAS NMR1 aTabor, E.1 aPashkova, V.1 aKaucký, D.1 aSobalík, Z.1 aWichterlová, B.1 aDedecek, J.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2016 Dec., v. 344 p.157-172dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.09.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009800167520148400265592002801749650001501777650001701792650002501809650001601834650002201850650001101872650002001883650001501903650001101918650001001929653003401939653002701973653002902000653003002029653004202059700005702101700001602158700005402174700005702228700005602285773009802341856008702439852000902526655001202535IND60719436820221119082930.0220404e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071943682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1162912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Renzhi10aData-driven real-time price-based demand response for industrial facilities energy management  aRecent advances in smart grid technologies have highlighted demand response (DR) as an important tool to alleviate electricity demand–supply mismatches. In this paper, a real-time price (RTP)-based DR algorithm is proposed for industrial facilities, aiming to minimize the electricity cost while satisfying production requirements. In particular, due to future price uncertainties, a data-driven approach is adopted to forecast the future unknown prices for supporting global time horizon optimization, which is realized by long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN). With the aid of predicted prices, the industrial facility energy management is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is then solved by Gurobi over a rolling horizon basis. Finally, an entire practical steel powder manufacturing process is selected as a case study to verify the RTP-based DR scheme. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to effectively shift energy consumption from peak to off-peak periods and reduce the electricity cost of the facility, while satisfying all of the operating constraints. The performance of the presented data-driven RTP forecasting approach is compared to different prediction methods, and error sensitivity analyses are also conducted to evaluate the impact of the RTP uncertainties and the robustness of the proposed RTP-based DR algorithm. Moreover, the DR capability to RTPs is investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aprices 3asteel 0aData-driven price forecasting 0aLong short-term memory 0aRecurrent neural network 0aReal-time demand response 0aIndustrial facility energy management1 aBai, Ruichang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4298-97611 aHuang, Yuan1 aLi, Yuting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5408-97981 aJiang, Junhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7667-47601 aDing, Yuemin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7697-21970 tApplied energy.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 283 p.116291-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1162913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245019200204506007600396520146800472592002801940506003701968650002002005650001302025650001302038650002102051650001302072650000902085650001202094650001802106700002202124700002602146700002402172700002102196700003302217700002202250700001902272700002002291700002602311700002002337773012302357856007402480852000902554655001202563IND60670132520221207132411.0190925e20190912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067013252DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110922022doi7 aPMC67699622pmcid7 a315473772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkrobot, Wojciech 10aEarly Rehabilitation Program and Vitamin D Supplementation Improves Sensitivity of Balance and the Postural Control in Patients after Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion: A Randomized Trial  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The introduction of early rehabilitation exercise is the foundation of treatment post-Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) surgery, and the search for additional sources of reinforcement physiotherapy seems to be very important. Methods: The patients were randomly divided into the vitamin D3 (n = 15; D3) supplemented group and received 3200 IU per day for five weeks before surgery and the placebo group (n = 18; Pl) received vegetable oil during the same time. The patients began the supervisor rehabilitation program four weeks after surgery. Results: The limits of stability (LOS) were significantly improved in the D3 group after 5 and 14 weeks (p < 0.05), while in the Pl group, progress was only observed after 14 weeks (p < 0.05). The LOS were also higher in the D3 group than in the Pl group after five weeks of supervised rehabilitation (p < 0.05). In the postural stability (PST) test, significant progress was observed in the D3 group after 14 weeks (p < 0.02). In addition, neither rehabilitation nor supplementation had significant effects on the risk of falls (RFT). Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation seems to ameliorate the effects of an early postoperative rehabilitation program implemented four weeks after posterior lumbar interbody fusion. Early physiotherapy treatment after PLIF surgery combined with vitamin D supplementation appears to be a very important combination with regard to the patients’ recovery process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acholecalciferol 3aexercise 3apatients 3aphysical therapy 3aplacebos 3arisk 3asurgery 3avegetable oil1 aLiedtke, Ewelina 1 aKrasowska, Katarzyna 1 aDzik, Katarzyna  P.1 aFlis, Damian  J.1 aSamoraj-Dereszkiewicz, Anna 1 aLibionka, Witold 1 aKortas, Jakub 1 aKloc, Wojciech 1 aAntosiewicz, Jedrzej 1 aKaczor, Jan  J.0 tNutrients.g2019 Sept. 12, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110922023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245013100176300001600307520104600323592002801369650001301397650001101410650001401421650002301435650002101458650001101479650001901490650001801509650001101527650001301538650002101551653002001572653001801592653002201610653002101632653003101653653002501684653002801709700003101737700003201768700003501800773010201835856008201937852000902019655001202028IND60605718520221120224803.0180723e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060571852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2016.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailón-García, Esther10aChemoselective Pt-catalysts supported on carbon-TiO2 composites for the direct hydrogenation of citral to unsaturated alcohols  ap. 701-711.  aA series of carbon xerogels-TiO2 composites with different TiO2 contents were prepared, exhaustively characterized and used as a Pt-support to develop selective hydrogenation catalysts. The carbon phase in the composite hinders the TiO2 crystal growth and the transformation to rutile during thermal treatments. Textural, chemical and catalytic properties are determined by the TiO2 content, with an optimum around 40wt.% of TiO2 content. The mesoporosity of the supports, the Pt-dispersion and Pt-support interactions are favoured in this sense. During the H2-pretreatment, the Pt and TiO2 phases were simultaneously reduced and the formation of oxygen vacancies leads to the mobility of Pt-species inside the TiO2 structure, avoiding sintering in surface and strongly improving both catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalytic performance was discussed on the basis of the sample characteristics. Unsaturated alcohols were obtained as main reaction products in all cases, being the only product in the case of the optimized catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemoselectivity 3acitral 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogenation 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3atitanium dioxide 0aCarbon xerogels 0aPt-dispersion 0aC/TiO2-composites 0aOxygen vacancies 0aMetal-support interactions 0aUnsaturated alcohols 0aSelective hydrogenation1 aCarrasco-Marín, Francisco1 aPérez-Cadenas, Agustín F.1 aMaldonado-Hódar, Francisco J.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2016 Dec., v. 344 p.701-711dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01281naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009200160300001800252520030000270592002800570650002700598650002300625650001300648650002000661650001500681650002100696650001500717700002000732773013200752856007400884852000900958655001200967IND60659522420221117160430.0190823e20120509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065952242DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc30449j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jong Hyeon10aHighly oriented nanoplates of layered double hydroxides as an ultra slow release system  ap. 5641-5643.  aA novel controlled molecular release based on highly oriented nanoplates of layered double hydroxide was fabricated on indium tin oxide substrates by electrophoretic deposition of exfoliated LDH nanosheets.

The newly prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), N₂ adsorption-desorption and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Their adsorption behaviors toward acetone vapor under dry and wet conditions were studied subsequently. Results showed that alkyl phosphonic acid was successfully grafted into MIL-53-Al skeleton through coordinating interaction with Al³⁺ generating MIL-53-Al@Cₓ (x = 12, 14, 18). The MIL-53-Al@Cₓ exhibited similar crystal structure and thermal stability to parent MIL-53-Al. Furthermore, the modified materials showed significantly enhanced hydrophobicity. The water vapor uptake of MIL-53-Al@C₁₄ decreased by 72.55% at 75% relative humidity (RH). Dynamic adsorption experiments demonstrated that water vapor had almost no effect on the acetone adsorption performance of MIL-53-Al@C₁₄. Under the condition of 90% RH, the acetone adsorption capacity of MIL-53-Al@C₁₄ was 102.98% higher than that of MIL-53-Al. Notably, MIL-53-Al@C₁₄ presented excellent adsorption reversibility and regeneration performance in 10 adsorption-desorption cycles. Taken together, the strategy of metal-OH group modification is an attractive way to improve the acetone adsorption performance over metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) under humid conditions. Besides, MIL-53-Al@C₁₄ would be deemed as a promising candidate for capturing acetone in high moisture environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetone 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acrystal structure 3ahydrophobicity 3aphosphorous acid 3arelative humidity 3askeleton 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3awater vapor 3aChina 0aHydrophobization 0aAlkyl phosphonic acid 0aAl-OH groups 0aAdsorption 0aMoisture1 aHan, Rui1 aLu, Shuangchun1 aLiu, Qingling0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2021 Sept., v. 107 p.111-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245009200205300001800297520126200315592002801577653002801605653002301633653002401656653002301680653003301703700002101736700001801757700002301775700002201798700002101820700002001841773011601861856008101977852000902058655001202067IND60517007420221119055326.0160328e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051700742DNAL7 a10.1017/S14319276150150072doi7 aPMC47295642pmcid7 a263432832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wenjin10aRobot-Guided Atomic Force Microscopy for Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer Specimens  ap. 1224-1235.  aAtomic force microscopy (AFM) and other forms of scanning probe microscopy have been successfully used to assess biomechanical and bioelectrical characteristics of individual cells. When extending such approaches to heterogeneous tissue, there exists the added challenge of traversing the tissue while directing the probe to the exact location of the targeted biological components under study. Such maneuvers are extremely challenging owing to the relatively small field of view, limited availability of reliable visual cues, and lack of context. In this study we designed a system that leverages the visual topology of the serial tissue sections of interest to help guide robotic control of the AFM stage to provide the requisite navigational support. The process begins by mapping the whole-slide image of a stained specimen with a well-matched, consecutive section of unstained section of tissue in a piecewise fashion. The morphological characteristics and localization of any biomarkers in the stained section can be used to position the AFM probe in the unstained tissue at regions of interest where the AFM measurements are acquired. This general approach can be utilized in various forms of microscopy for navigation assistance in tissue specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 0aatomic force microscopy 0arobotic microscopy 0awhole-slide imaging 0avirtual microscopy 0aserial sections registration1 aBrandes, Zachary1 aRoy, Rajarshi1 aChekmareva, Marina1 aPandya, Hardik J.1 aDesai, Jaydev P.1 aForan, David J.0 tMicroscopy and Microanalysis.g2015 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.1224-1235dCambridge University Pressx1435-81157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14319276150150073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04273naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245006900205300001100274520314600285592002803431596005403459650002703513650001503540650001403555650001003569650001403579650001403593650001703607650002403624700002003648700002703668773013603695856008303831852000903914655001203923IND60731831020221123014151.0210731e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073183102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-021-03008-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurali, Gopal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5307-325X10aBackground complexity and optimal background matching camouflage  ap. 69.  aCamouflage through background matching is a widespread antipredator strategy in which animals blend in with their background to avoid detection. To maximise survival in a variable natural environment, animals can have colourations that either match one of the backgrounds maximally (i.e. specialist strategy) or match multiple backgrounds partially (i.e. generalist strategy). Theoretical work indicates that the optimal strategy depends on the extent of visual difference between the backgrounds (i.e. heterogeneity) or how commonly the animal will encounter the background types. However, the role of another critical determinant of detection, the visual complexity of the background, on optimal camouflage strategy (specialist versus generalist) in the face of background heterogeneity, remains unknown. Here, we performed a virtual predation experiment employing humans as surrogate ‘predators’ and explored how background complexity influences camouflage in heterogeneous backgrounds. Under low heterogeneity, we found the latency to attack generalists was higher than that for specialists on a complex background, but there was no difference between specialists and generalists on a simple background. At intermediate heterogeneity, both specialist and generalist targets took a similar time to be attacked irrespective of complexity, suggesting that both the strategies may co-exist. In contrast, at high levels of heterogeneity, we found generalists were attacked sooner when compared to specialists irrespective of whether the background was simple or complex. Our results thus suggest that complex backgrounds favour the evolution of a generalist background matching strategy that maximises fitness in multiple backgrounds but only when the visual difference between the backgrounds is low. Overall, our study provides key insights highlighting the underappreciated role of background complexity on the optimization and evolution of camouflage colouration in a heterogeneous environment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Many animals often face the challenge of encountering multiple visually distinct backgrounds due to variation in their environment, i.e. background heterogeneity. How should animals optimise camouflage when there is background heterogeneity? Theoretical studies have proposed that animals may match one of the many backgrounds (specialise) or match multiple backgrounds partially (generalise) as an optimal solution. However, cognitive constraints from the predator’s perspective may also have a role to play in this optimization problem, but this has not been examined. Our experiments involving humans as ‘predators’ show that when background complexity renders the search task more difficult, generalist targets took a longer time to be attacked than specialist targets, but only in less heterogeneous backgrounds. However, irrespective of complexity, specialist targets are better than generalists at avoiding attack in highly heterogeneous backgrounds. Cognitive constraints of predators may, therefore, play a significant role in the optimization of camouflage colouration in heterogeneous environments.  aPublisher supplied data  aDST/INSPIRE/04/2013/000476cINSPIRE Faculty Award 3aantipredatory behavior 3acamouflage 3acognition 3acolor 3aevolution 3apredation 3asociobiology 3asystem optimization1 aMallick, Soumen1 aKodandaramaiah, Ullasa0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2021 Apr., v. 75, no. 4 p.69-69dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-021-03008-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014800170300001800318520171900336592002802055596006202083650001202145650001602157650001602173650002002189650000902209650002102218650002002239650001302259650002002272650001102292650003002303650002202333650001602355650001302371650001602384650001402400650001102414700006102425700002802486700002102514700002202535700002602557700002102583700002702604700002102631700002002652773010702672856008302779852000902862655001202871IND60753641820221120061120.0211016e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075364182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-021-03061-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCucina, Annamaria10aMeta-proteomic analysis of the Shandrin mammoth by EVA technology and high-resolution mass spectrometry: what is its gut microbiota telling us?  ap. 1507-1521.  aDuring the last decade, paleoproteomics allowed us to open a direct window into the biological past, improving our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of extant and extinct species, past human diseases, and reconstruction of the human diet. In particular, meta-proteomic studies, mainly carried out on ancient human dental calculus, provided insights into past oral microbial communities and ancient diets. On the contrary, very few investigations regard the analysis of ancient gut microbiota, which may enable a greater understanding of how microorganisms and their hosts have co-evolved and spread under the influence of changing diet practices and habitat. In this respect, this paper reports the results of the first-ever meta-proteomic analysis carried out on a gut tissue sample some 40,000 years old. Proteins were extracted by applying EVA (ethylene–vinyl acetate) films to the surface of the gut sample of a woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenus), discovered in 1972 close to the Shandrin River (Yakutia, Russia), and then investigated via a shotgun MS-based approach. Proteomic and peptidomic analysis allowed in-depth exploration of its meta-proteome composition. The results were validated through the level of deamidation and other diagenetic chemical modifications of the sample peptides, which were used to discriminate the “original” endogenous peptides from contaminant ones. Overall, the results of the meta-proteomic analysis here reported agreeing with the previous paleobotanical studies and with the reconstructed habitat of the Shandrin mammoth and provided insight into its diet.

Amylose is considered to be nutritionally desirable in North American and European markets, so there is interest in finding strategies to increase the amylose content of potato starch. There is also interest in marketing ‘baby’ potatoes, which are harvested when they are physiologically immature. This study was carried out to determine weekly changes in amylose content in potato tubers of 11 North American cultivars during the growing season. The trial was repeated across 3 years. RESULTS: We determined that amylose content is highest early and it decreases in a linear fashion as the growing season progresses. Mean amylose content across cultivars and years declined from 30.0% in late June to 26.8% in late August. The rate of decrease varied across years, with slopes of linear regression plots ranging from −0.17 in 2012 to −0.74 in 2011. Amylose content in tuber starch varied among cultivars, with the highest levels observed in Ranger Russet (30.7%) and White Pearl (31.6%); it was lowest in Kennebec (25.7%) and Langlade (25.6%). CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to a growing body of literature on the nutritional value of immature potato tubers. In addition to having higher levels of some phytonutrients, as reported in other studies, immature tubers have a higher proportion of amylose in the starch. This is nutritionally desirable in affluent regions where high fiber content is more important than calories from carbohydrates. Published 2016.

The prepared powders were employed as a support for preparation of 10 wt% Ni catalysts in biogas reforming, for the production of synthesis gas. This simple sol–gel method led to the preparation of powders with high BET surface area in the range of 252.8–301.6 m² g⁻¹ depending on the MgO/Al₂O₃ molar ratio after calcination at 700 °C. The samples also exhibited narrow single modal pore size distributions in the mesopore region. The H₂-TPR analysis revealed that increasing the MgO/Al₂O₃ molar ratio shifted the Tₘₐₓ of the reduction peaks to higher temperature, indicating the lower reducibility of the prepared catalysts with high MgO content. The NH₃-TPD also confirmed the increase in basicity of the prepared samples with increasing MgO/Al₂O₃ molar ratio. The prepared catalysts exhibited high potential as catalysts for biogas reforming with high stability, and the catalysts with higher content of MgO showed higher resistance against carbon formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3abiogas 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3agelation 3amagnesium oxide 3ananocrystals 3anickel 3aporosity 3aporous media 3apowders 3apropylene oxide 3asol-gel processing 3asurface area 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aArandiyan, Hamidreza1 aRezaei, Mehran0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 22, v. 6, no. 35 p.29576-29585dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra01656a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01379naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007600164300001600240520033300256592002800589650001600617650003000633650002000663653001900683653002300702653001300725653002500738653002700763700006300790773010900853856008200962852000901044655001201053IND60611761820221120220238.0180911e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061176182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2018.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Hyojeong10aAntibiotic Scars Left on the Gut Microbiota from the Stringent Response  ap. 735-737.  aCurrent research is primarily focused on compositional shifts and alterations in the metabolic status of the gut microbiota to elucidate the damage caused by antibiotics.

Here we investigated whether the interferon-induced viral restriction factor tetherin (CD317/BST2), which is known to inhibit HIV-1 particle release by physically tethering virions to the cell surface, has such a signaling role. We find that upon restriction of Vpu-defective HIV-1, tetherin acts as a virus sensor to induce NFκB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression. Signaling requires both tetherin’s extracellular domain involved in virion retention and determinants in the cytoplasmic tail, including an endocytic motif, although signaling is independent of virion endocytosis. Furthermore, recruitment of the TNF-receptor-associated factor TRAF6 and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase TAK1 are critical for signaling. Human tetherin’s ability to mediate efficient signaling may have arisen as a result of a five amino acid deletion that occurred in hominids after their divergence from chimpanzees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHominidae 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aPan troglodytes 3aamino acid deletion 3aantiviral proteins 3aendocytosis 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3areceptors 3avirion 3aviruses1 aLe Tortorec, Anna1 aPickering, Suzanne1 aKueck, Tonya1 aNeil, Stuart J.D.0 tCell host & microbe.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 12, no. 5 p.633-644dElsevier Inc.x1931-31287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2012.10.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006100170300001400231520116900245592002801414650002601442650001701468650001501485650001501500650001001515650002001525650001001545650001301555650001601568650004801584650001901632650001901651650001501670650001401685773010601699856008201805852000901887655001201896IND60611761920221120230330.0181220e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061176192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2018.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, Timothy J.10aCan β-Lactam Antibiotics Be Resurrected to Combat MRSA?  ap. 26-38.  aThe use of β-lactam antibiotics to treat infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus has been severely compromised by the acquisition by horizontal gene transfer of a gene that encodes the β-lactam-insensitive penicillin-binding protein PBP2a. This allows methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to proliferate in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics. Paradoxically the dependence on PBP2a for the essential transpeptidase activity in cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis is the ‘Achilles heel’ of MRSA. Compounds that disrupt the divisome, wall teichoic acid, and functional membrane microdomains act synergistically with β-lactams against MRSA. These include drugs such as statins that are widely used in human medicine. The antibiotics vancomycin and daptomycin are also synergistic with β-lactams, and combinations have been employed to treat persistent MRSA infections. An additional benefit of exposing MRSA to β-lactams could be a reduction in virulence mediated by interfering with the global regulator Agr. The mechanistic basis of synergy is discussed, and the possibility that β-lactams can be resurrected to combat MRSA infections is explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3adaptomycin 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3amedicine 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3apeptidoglycans 3ateichoic acids 3avancomycin 3avirulence0 tTrends in microbiology.g2019 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.26-38dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2018.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015500154300002000309520121100329592002801540650002101568650003101589650001301620650002301633650001701656650002101673650001901694650001501713650002201728650002801750650001901778650001601797700001501813700001501828700001801843700001401861700001401875700001501889700001601904700001601920773012401936856007402060852000902134655001202143IND60640414620221120132034.0190504e20160218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064041462DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra01660j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Rui10aHybrid photosensitizer based on amphiphilic block copolymer stabilized silver nanoparticles for highly efficient photodynamic inactivation of bacteria  ap. 20392-20398.  aWe report the development of a type of novel hybrid photosensitizers for photodynamic inactivation of broad-spectrum bacteria. A thiol-modified amphiphilic block copolymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-block-styrene), was synthesized and characterized. Subsequently, silver nanoparticles stabilized by poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-block-styrene) were synthesized and used to entrap hydrophobic photosensitizing molecules (such as hematoporphyrin). The resulting water-dispersible hybrid photosensitizers demonstrated enhanced singlet oxygen generation with a broadened excitation profile, as compared to the pristine hematoporphyrin molecules. Photodynamic inactivation of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli by the hybrid photosensitizer showed significantly enhanced killing efficacy, up to ∼5 orders of magnitude, under both white light and red/near-infrared light illuminations. The hybrid photosensitizers at the concentration used in the photodynamic inactivation assays displayed low cytotoxicity to Hela cells under ambient light conditions. These results demonstrate the great potential of such hybrid photosensitizers for photodynamic inactivation and photodynamic therapy applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3abacteria 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrophobicity 3ananosilver 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3asinglet oxygen 3awhite light1 aYu, Xinjun1 aWang, Peng1 aZhang, Jinnan1 aZhou, Yan1 aCao, Xian1 aTang, Hong1 aAyres, Neil1 aZhang, Peng0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 18, v. 6, no. 24 p.20392-20398dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra01660j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245014300211300001800354520153200372592002801904596008101932596008102013596008002094650001602174650002302190650001502213650001702228650001202245650002102257650002302278700006402301700002002365700002102385700006202406700006602468773012002534856008502654852000902739655001202748IND60792958920221120083250.0220914e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079295892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c009222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrundy, Lorena S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7706-221610aInaccessible Polarization-Induced Phase Transitions in a Block Copolymer Electrolyte: An Unconventional Mechanism for the Limiting Current  ap. 7637-7649.  aBlock copolymer electrolytes that microphase separate into mechanically rigid and ion-conducting domains are promising materials for lithium metal batteries. We present experimental data on a block copolymer electrolyte composed of polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (SEO) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) which, under equilibrium conditions, exhibits a hexagonally packed cylindrical (HEX) morphology at low salt concentrations and a body-centered cubic spherical (BCC) morphology at high salt concentrations. The limiting current, which causes the cell potential to diverge exponentially if exceeded, is usually reached when the salt concentration at the negative electrode approaches zero due to concentration polarization. We use in situ X-ray scattering to study the morphology of our SEO/LiTFSI electrolyte, which exhibits a BCC morphology at equilibrium, during polarization. We expected to obtain a HEX morphology near the negative electrode as the limiting current is approached and the salt concentration at the negative electrode approaches zero. Instead, we find that the cell potential diverges when the salt concentration at this electrode approaches the concentration at the BCC/HEX boundary at high current densities. The maximum current that can be carried by our electrolyte is thus not limited by the lack of salt at the negative electrode. Instead, it appears to be related to a phase transition that occurs readily in equilibrated samples but is inaccessible in a polarized cell.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-AC02-05CH11231cBasic Energy Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006151  aDE-AC02-76SF00515cBasic Energy Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006151  aDEAC02-06CH11357cBasic Energy Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006151 3aX-radiation 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3aphase transition 3asalt concentration1 aGalluzzo, Michael D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5776-05401 aLoo, Whitney S.1 aFong, Anthony Y.1 aBalsara, Nitash P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0106-55651 aTakacs, Christopher J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9126-69010 tMacromolecules.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 55, no. 17 p.7637-7649dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c009223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014200153300002000295520108600315592002801401650003001429650001301459650001201472650001501484650001501499650001301514650002001527650001901547650001101566650002001577650001501597700001301612700001301625700001501638700001401653700001501667700001501682773012401697856007401821852000901895655001201904IND60640414720221120132058.0190504e20160321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064041472DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra01663d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, R.10aBiofouling control in a membrane filtration system by a newly isolated novel quorum quenching bacterium, Bacillus methylotrophicus sp. WY  ap. 28895-28903.  aDuring membrane processes of wastewater treatment, biofouling is a critical issue affecting membrane performance. Interspecies quorum quenching (QQ) by bacterial cells has been reported as a novel approach for mitigating the biofouling via restraining quorum sensing (QS), where secreted signaling molecules, e.g., acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) being essential for biofilm formation are degraded by QQ bacteria. Herein, we isolated a novel indigenous QQ bacterium, Bacillus methylotrophicus strain WY from real wastewater sludge for controlling membrane biofouling. Strain WY was successfully characterized for QS and QQ activity and possessed a wide-ranging activity for degrading AHLs. More than 90% degradation for C8-HSL, C10-HSL, C12-HSL, C14-HSL, 3-oxo-C6HSL, 3-oxo-C8HSL and 3-oxo-C12HSL were achieved. Further, sodium alginate beads immobilized strain WY cells were applied to the microfiltration process. Compared to the vacant beads, using the beads with stain WY increased membrane flux by 3 to 4 times, demonstrating excellent biofouling control ability of strain WY.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus methylotrophicus 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abiofouling 3ahomoserine 3alactones 3amicrofiltration 3aquorum sensing 3asludge 3asodium alginate 3awastewater1 aShen, F.1 aKhan, K.1 aLiu, L.

Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), mainly located at the endoplasmic reticulum and also present in the cytosol, acts as both an enzyme and a molecular chaperone. PDI is observed to be S-nitrosylated in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients, but the mechanism has remained elusive. We herein report that both wild-type PDI and its quadruple cysteine mutant only having chaperone activity, significantly inhibit pathological phosphorylation and abnormal aggregation of Tau in cells, and significantly decrease the mitochondrial damage and Tau cytotoxicity resulting from Tau aberrant aggregation, highlighting the chaperone property of PDI. More importantly, we show that wild-type PDI is selectively recruited by liquid droplets of Tau, which significantly inhibits phase separation and stress granule formation of Tau, whereas S-nitrosylation of PDI abrogates the recruitment and inhibition. These findings demonstrate how phase separation of Tau is physiologically regulated by PDI and how S-nitrosylation of PDI, a perturbation in this regulation, leads to disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aS-nitrosylation 3abrain 3acysteine 3acytosol 3acytotoxicity 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3amitochondria 3amolecular chaperones 3amutants 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein disulfide-isomerase 3aseparation 0amolecular chaperone 0aprotein phase separation 0aprotein disulfide isomerase 0aTau protein 0aprotein aggregation 0aPDI 0aAD 0aSNO 0aER 0aBiFC 0aDAPI 0aDIC 0aPI 0aTAMRA 0aFRAP 0aTIA-1 0aThT 0aDTT 0aTEM 0aPMSF1 aLiu, Jia-Qi1 aZhong, Tao1 aLiu, Xiao-Ling1 aZeng, Yan1 aQiao, Xinhua1 aSun, Chloe Tse,1 aChen, Yuzhe1 aGao, Ying-Ying1 aTang, Bo1 aLi, Jia1 aZhou, Jun1 aPang, Dai-Wen1 aChen, Jie1 aChen, Chang1 aLiang, Yi0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Mar. 27, v. 432, no. 7 p.2141-2163dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245004500205300001800250520165900268592002801927650002301955650005201978650002702030650002602057650001502083650001602098650001302114650001302127650001102140650001802151650001402169650001202183700001702195700002402212700002402236700001802260700001802278700001802296700002102314700002702335700002002362700002002382700001802402700002302420773010702443856008302550852000902633655001202642IND60753642220221120061039.0211016e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075364222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-021-03081-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtila, Alptug1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7027-809X14aThe serum amino acid profile in COVID-19  ap. 1569-1588.  aThe pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 affects millions of people worldwide. There are still many unknown aspects to this infection which affects the whole world. In addition, the potential impacts caused by this infection are still unclear. Amino acid metabolism, in particular, contains significant clues in terms of the development and prevention of many diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to compare amino acid profile of COVID-19 and healthy subject. In this study, the amino acid profiles of patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 infection were scanned with LC–MS/MS. The amino acid profile encompassing 30 amino acids in 142 people including 30 control and 112 COVID-19 patients was examined. 20 amino acids showed significant differences when compared to the control group in COVID-19 patient groups with different levels of severity in the statistical analyses conducted. It was detected that the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) changed in correlation with one another, and L-2-aminobutyric acid and L-phenylalanine had biomarker potential for COVID-19. Moreover, it was concluded that L-2-aminobutyric acid could provide prognostic information about the course of the disease. We believe that a new viewpoint will develop regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis as a result of the evaluation of the serum amino acid profiles of COVID-19 patients. Determining L-phenylalanine and L-2-aminobutyric levels can be used in laboratories as a COVID-19-biomarker. Also, supplementing COVID patients with taurine and BCAAs can be beneficial for treatment protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acid metabolism 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3apandemic 3apatients 3apeople 3aphenylalanine 3aprognosis 3ataurine1 aAlay, Handan1 aYaman, Mehmet Emrah1 aAkman, Tugrul Cagri1 aCadirci, Elif1 aBayrak, Burak1 aCelik, Saffet1 aAtila, Nihal Efe1 aYaganoglu, Aycan Mutlu1 aKadioglu, Yucel1 aHalıcı, Zekai1 aParlak, Emine1 aBayraktutan, Zafer0 tAmino acids.g2021 Oct., v. 53, no. 10 p.1569-1588dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-021-03081-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166520119400264592002801458650001501486650001801501650001701519650002601536650001801562650001301580650002801593650001401621650001601635650002901651650001301680650002301693650001701716650001301733650002501746650001801771651001501789651001201804651001901816651001301835653001901848653002601867700001901893700002201912700002001934700002901954773012201983856008102105852000902186655001202195IND60684576820221118224246.0200405e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068457682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkpolat, Hacer10aPortable infrared sensing technology for phenotyping chemical traits in fresh market tomatoes  aOur objective was to develop predictive regression algorithms based on infrared spectroscopy to screen for selected quality traits directed at optimizing the selection capabilities of fresh market tomatoes. Fresh tomato (681) samples were harvested from multiple locations (Florida, Virginia, California and South Carolina) during the 2016 and 2018 seasons at various ripening stages. Spectra were collected by transmittance and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) either from the tomato surface or juice. Reference methods included soluble solid content, titratable acidity, sugars, organic acids, and lycopene. Partial least squares regression using surface spectra showed good correlation for lycopene and ascorbic acid (rcᵥ>0.9) but modest correlation coefficients (rcᵥ 0.54–0.80) for all other traits, while juice spectra gave high correlation coefficients (rcᵥ>0.94) and excellent predictive performance (RPD range 3–10) for all quality traits except ascorbic acid (rcᵥ>0.79). Multiple quality traits were simultaneously determined by using a single drop of sample providing fast (<1 min) measurements and minimal sample preparation based on unique spectral fingerprints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aascorbic acid 3afresh market 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aleast squares 3alycopene 3aorganic acids and salts 3aphenotype 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aripening 3atitratable acidity 3atomato juice 3atomatoes 3atotal soluble solids 3atransmittance 3aCalifornia 3aFlorida 3aSouth Carolina 3aVirginia 0aTomato quality 0aPrediction algorithms1 aBarineau, Mark1 aJackson, Keith A.1 aAykas, Didem P.1 aRodriguez-Saona, Luis E.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Apr., v. 124 p.109164-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013300163300002000296520154600316592002801862650001001890650000901900650001401909650001501923650001601938650002001954650001401974650001901988650001802007650002502025700002302050700002402073700001602097773012402113856007402237852000902311655001202320IND60640414920221120142631.0190504e20160208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064041492DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra01665k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaitland, Danielle10aControlling the resolution and duration of pulsatile release from injectable magnetic ‘plum-pudding’ nanocomposite hydrogels  ap. 15770-15781.  aManipulation of the relative swelling and volume fractions of the microgel and bulk hydrogel phases of nanocomposite hydrogels containing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) is demonstrated to enable higher on–off state resolution and enhanced total duration of pulsatile drug release potential when the nanocomposites are activated by an alternating magnetic field. Adjusting the microgel chemistry to create microgels that have less deswelling below 37 °C and more proportional deswelling between 37 °C and 43 °C, increasing the volume fraction of microgels in the nanocomposite (while maintaining the mechanical stability of the nanocomposite), and limiting the swelling capacity of the surrounding hydrogel were all found to improve the degree of enhanced release that occurs after an externally-operated AMF pulse. Collectively, these results serve both to optimize the function of these nanocomposite materials for pulsatile drug delivery as well as confirm the proposed mechanism of pulsatile release, by which free volume is generated within the nanocomposite at the thermoresponsive microgel–bulk hydrogel interface upon internal heating of the device via SPION-driven hysteresis heating of the nanocomposite in an alternating magnetic field. Coupled with the injectability, degradability, mechanical stability, and cytocompatibility of these nanocomposites, we anticipate potential applications as advanced ‘smart’ drug delivery technologies that can be operated via an external and non-invasive trigger.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aheat 3ahydrogels 3ahysteresis 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3amicrogels 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aswelling (materials)1 aCampbell, Scott B.1 aChen, Junyi,d1957-1 aHoare, Todd0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 08, v. 6, no. 19 p.15770-15781dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra01665k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01186naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245003300161300001600194520026900210592002800479650001000507650000900517650001900526650002600545650003700571650002200608700002800630773014000658856007700798852000900875655001200884IND60524076320221119155447.0160701e19930630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052407632DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.1993.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoźny, Adam,10aPlant cell responses to lead  ap. 101-105.  aCurrent views on plant cell reactions to lead are reviewed.

Our objective was to verify whether a fish metacommunity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest has a nonrandom structure along the longitudinal stream gradient. To do so, we applied the elements of metacommunity structure to examine fish distribution patterns at the micro-basin extent for 20 stream fish assemblages. Stream fish species were independently distributed following the Gleasonian pattern. The Gleasonian pattern suggested that the communities varied continuously over space, potentially reflecting the degree to which species tolerances overlap. The metacommunity structure may have resulted from the environmental gradient and has a high beta diversity. The upstream reaches have higher values from regional variables (confluence distance and declivity) and slower values on variables representing a local scale (temperature, conductivity, depth, and width). Knowing the type of structure and the drivers that shape a metacommunity, we suggested that ensuring the connectivity of streams is a good conservation strategy as the species move from one to another, being very dependent on the colonization source. This environmental management can affect biodiversity at local and regional scales, thus we would require devoting local conservation efforts to a large number of different reaches of streams and in a micro-basin regional scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental management 3afish 3aforests 3anatural resources conservation 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3atemperature 0aAssemblages 0aBiology conservation 0aCommunity ecology 0aNeotropical biology 0aRiver1 aCetra, Maurício0 tNatureza & Conservação.g2016 July,  Dec., v. 14, no. 2 p.112-119dElsevier Editora Ltda.aAssociação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e ConservaçãowJournal:23244x1679-00737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ncon.2016.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015300157520143300310592002801743650002801771650001201799650002101811650002301832650002101855650002001876650002501896650002501921650001201946700002001958700001801978700001801996700002002014773011902034856007302153852000902226655001202235IND60653495520221117082747.0190714e20190221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065349552DNAL7 a10.3390/w110203742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Taereem 14aThe Use of Large-Scale Climate Indices in Monthly Reservoir Inflow Forecasting and Its Application on Time Series and Artificial Intelligence Models  aClimate variability is strongly influencing hydrological processes under complex weather conditions, and it should be considered to forecast reservoir inflow for efficient dam operation strategies. Large-scale climate indices can provide potential information about climate variability, as they usually have a direct or indirect correlation with hydrologic variables. This study aims to use large-scale climate indices in monthly reservoir inflow forecasting for considering climate variability. For this purpose, time series and artificial intelligence models, such as Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), SARIMA with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Adaptive Neural-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Random Forest (RF) models were employed with two types of input variables, autoregressive variables (AR-) and a combination of autoregressive and exogenous variables (ARX-). Several statistical methods, including ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), were used to select the lagged climate indices. Finally, monthly reservoir inflow was forecasted by SARIMA, SARIMAX, AR-ANN, ARX-ANN, AR-ANFIS, ARX-ANFIS, AR-RF, and ARX-RF models. As a result, the use of climate indices in artificial intelligence models showed a potential to improve the model performance, and the ARX-ANN and AR-RF models generally showed the best performance among the employed models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aclimate 3adams (hydrology) 3ahydrologic factors 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 3astatistical analysis 3atime series analysis 3aweather1 aShin, Ju-Young 1 aKim, Hanbeen 1 aKim, Sunghun 1 aHeo, Jun-Haeng 0 tWater.g2019 Feb. 21, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110203743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01296naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245006900209300001600278520032000294592002800614650002400642650001000666650001700676650001900693650001300712650001200725650001200737773009500749856008200844990002300926852000900949655001200958IND60092792520221116185445.0141103e20121213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009279252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chom.2012.11.0052doi7 aPMC69327442pmcid7 a232453152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeib, David A.10aHerpes Simplex Virus Encephalitis: Toll-Free Access to the Brain  ap. 731-732.  aHerpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a devastating infection of the central nervous system (CNS).

Optimised conditions with regard to extraction temperature (66â129Â°C) and solvent concentration (32â88% methanol) were identified using response surface methodology (RSM). For all three spices results showed that 129Â°C was the optimum temperature in order to obtain extracts with high antioxidant activity. Optimal methanol concentrations with respect to the antioxidant activity of rosemary and marjoram extracts were 56% and 57% respectively. Oregano showed a different response to the effect of methanol concentration and was optimally extracted at 33%. The antioxidant activity yields of the optimal ASE extracts were significantly (p<0.05) higher than solid/liquid extracts. The predicted models were highly significant (p<0.05) for both total phenol (TP) and ferric reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) values in all the spices with high regression coefficients (RÂ²) ranging from 0.952 to 0.999.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriganum majorana 3aOriganum vulgare 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3amarjoram 3amethanol 3aoregano 3aresponse surface methodology 3arosemary 3aspices 3aUnited States1 aBarry-Ryan, C.1 aMartin-Diana, A.B.1 aBrunton, N.P.0 tFood chemistry.g2011 May 1, v. 126, no. 1 p.339-346dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.10.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002800189245010400217300001600321520103700337592002801374650002001402650001601422650001301438650001401451650001501465650001701480650001401497650001101511650003001522650001401552700002201566773009501588856008201683990002301765852000901788655001201797IND60092792620221116185244.0141103e20121213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009279262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chom.2012.10.0202doi7 aPMC37039492pmcid7 a232453242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaRock, Christopher N.14aThe Yersinia Virulence Effector YopM Binds Caspase-1 to Arrest Inflammasome Assembly and Processing  ap. 799-805.  aInflammasome assembly activates caspase-1 and initiates the inflammatory cell death program pyroptosis, which is protective against numerous pathogens. Consequently, several pathogens, including the plague causing bacterium Yersinia pestis, avoid activating this pathway to enhance their virulence. However, bacterial molecules that directly modulate the inflammasome have yet to be identified. Examining the contribution of Yersinia type III secretion effectors to caspase-1 activation, we identified the leucine-rich repeat effector YopM as a potent antagonist of both caspase-1 activity and activation. YopM directly binds caspase-1, which both inhibits caspase-1 activity and sequesters it to block formation of the mature inflammasome. Caspase-1 activation antagonizes Yersinia survival in vivo, and consequently YopM inhibition of caspase-1 is required for Yersinia pathogenesis. Thus, a bacterium obstructs pyroptosis utilizing a direct mechanism of caspase-1 inhibition that is distinct from known viral or host inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aYersinia pestis 3aantagonists 3abacteria 3acaspase-1 3acell death 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aplague 3atype III secretion system 3avirulence1 aCookson, Brad T.,0 tCell host & microbe.g2012 Dec. 13, v. 12, no. 6 p.799-805dElsevier Inc.x1931-31287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2012.10.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015800167300001800325500001100343520167500354592002802029650001302057650001202070650001302082650002502095650001202120650001402132650001802146650001902164650001202183650000902195650001302204650001702217650002202234650002202256700006302278700006102341700005902402700005402461773010702515856008302622852000902705655001202714IND60753642520221120052233.0211016e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075364252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-021-03072-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhatri, Mishti14aThe effects of collagen peptide supplementation on body composition, collagen synthesis, and recovery from joint injury and exercise: a systematic review  ap. 1493-1506.  aReview  aCollagen peptide supplementation (COL), in conjunction with exercise, may be beneficial for the management of degenerative bone and joint disorders. This is likely due to stimulatory effects of COL and exercise on the extracellular matrix of connective tissues, improving structure and load-bearing capabilities. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current literature available on the combined impact of COL and exercise. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, a literature search of three electronic databases—PubMed, Web of Science and CINAHL—was conducted in June 2020. Fifteen randomised controlled trials were selected after screening 856 articles. The study populations included 12 studies in recreational athletes, 2 studies in elderly participants and 1 in untrained pre-menopausal women. Study outcomes were categorised into four topics: (i) joint pain and recovery from joint injuries, (ii) body composition, (iii) muscle soreness and recovery from exercise, and (iv) muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and collagen synthesis. The results indicated that COL is most beneficial in improving joint functionality and reducing joint pain. Certain improvements in body composition, strength and muscle recovery were present. Collagen synthesis rates were elevated with 15 g/day COL but did not have a significant impact on MPS when compared to isonitrogenous higher quality protein sources. Exact mechanisms for these adaptations are unclear, with future research using larger sample sizes, elite athletes, female participants and more precise outcome measures such as muscle biopsies and magnetic imagery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollagen 3aelderly 3aexercise 3aextracellular matrix 3afemales 3amagnetism 3ameta-analysis 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3apain 3apeptides 3apremenopause 3aprotein synthesis 3asystematic review1 aNaughton, Robert J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9878-03961 aClifford, Thomas,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0484-29531 aHarper, Liam D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2089-47991 aCorr, Liam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7439-13720 tAmino acids.g2021 Oct., v. 53, no. 10 p.1493-1506dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-021-03072-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006100164300001800225520113000243592002801373653003701401653001901438653001501457653001601472653002401488700002001512700001901532700001801551700001601569700001801585773011601603856008101719852000901800655001201809IND60517008220221119055335.0160328e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051700822DNAL7 a10.1017/S14319276150151112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Shih-En10aDirect-Writing of Cu Nano-Patterns with an Electron Beam  ap. 1639-1643.  aWe demonstrate direct electron beam writing of a nano-scale Cu pattern on a surface with a thin aqueous layer of CuSO₄ solution. Electron beams are highly maneuverable down to nano-scales. Aqueous solutions facilitate a plentiful metal ion supply for practical industrial applications, which may require continued reliable writing of sophisticated patterns. A thin aqueous layer on a surface helps to confine the writing on the surface. For this demonstration, liquid sample holder (K-kit) for transmission electron microscope (TEM) was employed to form a sealed space in a TEM. The aqueous CuSO₄ solution inside the sample holder was allowed to partially dry until a uniform thin layer was left on the surface. The electron beam thus reduced Cu ions in the solution to form the desired patterns. Furthermore, the influence of e-beam exposure time and CuSO₄₍ₐq₎ concentration on the Cu reduction was studied in this work. Two growth stages of Cu were shown in the plot of Cu thickness versus e-beam exposure time. The measured Cu reduction rate was found to be proportional to the CuSO₄₍ₐq₎ concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 0aelectron beam-induced deposition 0adirect writing 0aCu pattern 0aliquid cell 0aelectron microscopy1 aHong, Ying-Jhan1 aChen, Yu Ting,1 aKang, Yu-Ting1 aZhang, Bin,1 aYew, Tri-Rung0 tMicroscopy and Microanalysis.g2015 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.1639-1643dCambridge University Pressx1435-81157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14319276150151113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009400165300001600259520110500275592002801380650002001408650001601428650002201444650001701466650003801483650001501521650001101536650002101547650001301568650001101581650002501592653001601617653001901633653001301652653001601665653002101681700001301702700001701715700001901732773012101751856008101872852000901953655001201962IND60566290220221120221458.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056629022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Jun-jie10aMultiple endothermic transitions of acid hydrolyzed and heat-moisture treated corn starch  ap. 195-201.  aThe multiple thermal transitions of acid-hydrolyzed and heat-moisture treated corn starch samples in excess water were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and interpreted using a polymer swelling and dissolution theory. The dual treatment of acid hydrolysis (AH) and heat-moisture treatment (HMT) with different extent of reaction generates starches with various degrees of residual crystalline structure. Multiple endothermic transitions (G and M1) were firstly observed in DSC traces even in excess water. In this study, the G and M1 endotherms were proposed to be related with the energy consumption associated with granule swelling and crystallites dissolution respectively. In contrast, only a single M1 endotherm transition from a broad to a sharp and narrow endotherm upon HMT was consistently observed for starch samples acid hydrolyzed for 48 and 72 h, which testified the dominance of rearrangement over the destruction upon HMT. This novel theory describing the multiple phase transition was also evidenced by the variation of swelling power and relative crystallinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3aphase transition 3apolymers 3astarch 3aswelling (materials) 0aCorn starch 0aGelatinization 0aSwelling 0aThermograms 0aEndothermic peak1 aLi, Dong1 aWang, Li-jun1 aAdhikari, Benu0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Aug., v. 81 p.195-201dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01818naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009000164300001600254520083100270592002801101650002001129650001201149650001701161650001101178650001001189650001001199700001801209700001701227700002201244773014001266856007701406852000901483655001201492IND60524076620221119155352.0160701e19921230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052407662DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.1992.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWłoch, Wiesław10aTransformation of the domain pattern in the development of Fagus silvatica L. cambium  ap. 331-341.  aThe domain pattern of cambium during the first year of its function in Fagus silvatica L. resembles a checkerboard. The longitudinal line along the leaf trace, its corresponding line on the opposite side of the internode and nodes comprise the domain borders. Starting from the formation of the first annual ring, this checkerboard pattern begins to undergo gradual transformation. A transitional domain pattern appears during the first few years; in each internode, due to the alternate disappearance of Z and S domains, a fragmentary domain of one type and an expanded domain of the opposite type occur in pairs. After further transformations, a regular pattern of transverse bands of domains moving along the stem appear on older stems (over ten years-old). This pattern is commonly found in other studied species of trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3acambium 3agrowth rings 3aleaves 3astems 3atrees1 aPopiel, Piotr1 aRusin, Marek1 aSłowioczek, Anna0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g1992 Dec. 30, v. 61, no. 3-4 p.331-341dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.1992.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245007300207300001400280506007600294520101700370592002801387506003701415650001001452650001201462650001501474650001201489650002301501650001301524650001301537650001401550650002601564650002001590650001801610650001601628653002301644653002601667653002601693653002801719653002601747653003301773700002101806773014201827856008301969852000902052655001202061IND60557634920221207100556.0180905e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055763492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgeb.2015.11.0032doi7 aPMC62998592pmcid7 a306476002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahendran, G.10aDirect somatic embryogenesis of Malaxis densiflora (A.

In the present study, in vitro seed derived protocorm explants were cultured on half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), Picloram and Dicamba individually and in combination with cytokinins BAP, TDZ and Kn for its effectiveness to induce the differentiation of somatic embryos. The best response was observed in protocorms cultured half strength MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D at 3.39μM and TDZ at 6.80μM. Both epidermal and sub epidermal cells were involved in the formation of embryos. The proembryos developed into globular stage and subsequently developed into protocoms. Complete plantlets were formed after 60days of culture. The plantlets were acclimatized in plastic pots containing sterilized vermiculite. The survival rate was 76%.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,4-D 3aMalaxis 3acytokinins 3adicamba 3aendangered species 3aexplants 3apicloram 3aplantlets 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos 3asurvival rate 3avermiculite 0aMalaxis densiflora 0aSomatic embryogenesis 0aHistological analysis 0aPlant growth regulators 0aPlantlet regeneration 0aScanning electron microscopy1 aNarmatha Bai, V.0 tJournal of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (Print).g2016 June, v. 14, no. 1 p.77-81dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23376x1687-157X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgeb.2015.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245004900161520126600210592002801476650002501504650001501529650002901544650002101573650001501594650001901609653001701628653003101645653002901676653002601705653001601731700001401747700002001761700001801781700001701799773011201816856008301928852000902011655001202020IND60763902420221118062743.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076390242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2022.1165312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Rong10aQuantum dots for electrochemical cytosensing  aQuantum dots (QDs), with confined size on the nanoscale (1–10 nm), are usually made of II−VI B group or III−V A group elements or their alloyed semiconductor materials. QDs are endowed with prominent electrochemical and photophysical properties, which makes QD-based assays powerful probes for electrochemical bioanalysis. Both excellent signal enhancement and functionalization have been explored and further developed. In this review, we start by briefly introducing the electrochemical and photophysical characteristics of QDs. Next, the mechanism of QDs for electrochemical cell analysis is systematically stated and critically reviewed from the three aspects of the main components, mechanism, and principle of QD-based electrochemistry (EC), electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and photoelectrochemistry (PEC) cytosensing, individually. The main context will focus on the critical comparison of advantages and disadvantages, similarities, and differences among EC, ECL and PEC. In addition, we summarize selected articles from 2017 to 2021 on QD-based electrochemical cytosensors and discuss the different detection abilities of specific targets, including quantitative cell detection, cell surface biomarkers, cell metabolism, and single-cell analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiomarkers 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3ametabolism 3asemiconductors 0aQuantum dots 0aElectrochemical techniques 0aElectrochemiluminescence 0aPhotoelectrochemistry 0aCytosensing1 aFeng, Zhe1 aZhang, Jingjing1 aJiang, Liping1 aZhu, Jun-Jie0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2022 Mar., v. 148 p.116531-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2022.1165313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
