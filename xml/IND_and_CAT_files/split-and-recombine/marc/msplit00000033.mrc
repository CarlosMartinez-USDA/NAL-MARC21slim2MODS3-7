Results indicate that the nitrophenols adversely affected the organic and NH₃–N removal of activated sludge and the adverse effect of nitrophenols on autotrophic bacteria was higher than that on heterotrophic bacteria. Further, 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) demonstrated the highest inhibitory effect, followed by 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and 2-nitrophenol (2-NP), and the combined effects of binary and ternary nitrophenols induced additive toxicity. At various concentrations and toxicant ratios, 2,4-DNP, as the dominant toxic nitrophenol, was the major contributor to the joint inhibition effects of the mixed nitrophenols. At lower concentrations of 2-NP (below 100 mg/L), 4-NP (below 50 mg/L), and 2,4-DNP (below 10 mg/L), large amounts of both tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) and loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS) were secreted for the normal physiological activities of the microbiological cells. After further stimulation with higher concentrations of 2-NP (above 100 mg/L), 4-NP (above 50 mg/L), and 2,4-DNP (above 10 mg/L), the inhibitory effect of nitrophenols on bacterial metabolism evidently increased. However, the EPS production sharply reduced, particularly with respect to protein production. Parallel factor analysis for TB-EPS and LB-EPS further confirmed that the major proteins were tyrosine, tryptophan, and aromatic proteins. Thus, this study provides new insights into the inhibitory effects of mixed nitrophenols, which are frequently found in pharmaceutical and petrochemical effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dinitrophenol 3aactivated sludge 3aadverse effects 3aenvironmental management 3afactor analysis 3ap-nitrophenol 3apolymers 3aprotein synthesis 3atoxicity 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 0aNitrophenols 0aJoint inhibitory effect 0aExtracellular polymeric substances 0aEvaluation modeling1 aYu, Yin1 aXi, Hongbo1 aZhou, Baoying,0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 294 p.112945-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245010900206520199300315592002802308650001902336650001902355650002902374650002602403650002102429650001802450650001202468650001802480650000702498650000902505650001502514650002202529650001602551650001602567650001902583651001002602653001902612653003702631653002102668653002402689653002202713653002902735700001702764700005402781700001702835700001302852773011902865856008602984852000903070655001203079IND60741096620221122155310.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074109662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xingkai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1646-831610aEffects of changes in throughfall on soil GHG fluxes under a mature temperate forest, northeastern China  aClimate change scenarios predict a change in the rainfall regimes for this current century, which has different impacts on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. However, how changes in annual rainfall affect annual GHG fluxes of forest soils remain unknown. A six-year field experiment with −25% and −50% throughfall (TF) and +25% TF manipulation was performed to explore the mechanisms involving GHG fluxes under a mature temperate forest, northeastern China and to work out whether the TF effect sizes on annual soil GHG fluxes vary with dry and wet years. The results showed that both −25% TF and −50% TF treatments depressed annual soil nitrous oxide (N₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions but increased annual soil methane (CH₄) uptake. A contrary pattern of annual soil GHG fluxes was observed in the +25% TF treatment. When annual TF input was decreased by 100 mm, annual soil N₂O and CO₂ emissions were decreased by 18.1 ± 3.1 mg N m⁻² and by 39.4 ± 6.1 g C m⁻² during the growing season, respectively, and annual soil CH₄ uptake was increased by 11.5 ± 3.4 mg C m⁻². Both −25% TF and −50% TF treatments reduced annual soil dissolved organic C (DOC) leaching by 29.3% and 45.6% and dissolved total N (DN) leaching by 30.8% and 39.6%, respectively. Contrary to annual soil N₂O and CO₂ emissions, annual soil CH₄ uptake during the growing season significantly decreased with an increase in the annual leaching fluxes of soil DOC, inorganic N, and DN. Besides soil moisture and temperature and pH, soil GHG fluxes under manipulating TF condition were regulated by soil labile C and N status. Our findings indicated that the TF effect sizes on both annual GHG fluxes and net annual GHG balance (GWP) of forest soils varied with dry and wet years in northeastern China. The results highlight the importance of altered annual rainfall in regulating annual soil GHG fluxes and the GWP in temperate forests under global climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental management 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouse gases 3alabile carbon 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3apH 3arain 3asoil water 3atemperate forests 3atemperature 3athroughfall 3atotal nitrogen 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aDissolved organic carbon dynamic 0aForest ecosystem 0aGreenhouse gas flux 0aNitrogen leaching 0aInter-annual variability1 aDuan, Cuntao1 aWu, Haohao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6978-91671 aLuo, Xianbao1 aHan, Lin0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 294 p.112950-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008800162300001600250500001900266520121800285592002801503650002201531650001301553650001601566650001401582650001201596650001401608650001901622650001901641650001601660650002601676651001001702653001601712653002801728653001801756653002901774700001601803700001801819700001901837700001501856700001301871700001301884773012301897856008202020852000902102655001202111IND60716303120221120215322.0210226e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071630312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2020.09.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Renjun10aRemoval of elemental mercury by photocatalytic oxidation over La2O3/Bi2O3 composite  ap. 384-397.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLa₂O₃/Bi₂O₃ photocatalysts were prepared by impregnation of Bi₂O₃ with an aqueous solution of lanthanum precursor followed by calcination at different temperatures. The composite materials were used for the first time for the photocatalytic removal of Hg⁰ from a simulated flue gas under UV light irradiation. The results showed that the sample containing 6 wt.% La₂O₃ and calcined at 500°C has the highest dispersion of the active sites, which was promoted by the strong interaction with the support (i.e., the formation of Bi-O-La species). Since they are fully accessible on the surface, the material also exhibits excellent optical properties while the heterojunction formed in La₂O₃/Bi₂O₃ promotes the separation and migration of photoelectron-hole pairs and thus Hg⁰ oxidation efficiency is enhanced. The effects of the various factors (e.g., the reaction temperature and composition of the simulated flue gas (i.e., O₂, NO, H₂O, and SO₂)) on the efficiency of the Hg⁰ photocatalytic oxidation were investigated. The results demonstrated that O₂ and SO₂ enhanced the efficiency of the reaction while the reaction temperature, NO, and H₂O had an inhibitory effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aflue gas 3airradiation 3alanthanum 3amercury 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3aChina 0aLa2O3/Bi2O3 0aCalcination temperature 0aHg0 oxidation 0aPhotocatalytic oxidation1 aZhou, Yanan1 aWang, Xueqian1 aWang, Langlang1 aNing, Ping1 aTao, Lei1 aCai, Jun0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2021 Apr., v. 102 p.384-397dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.09.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245010300207300001400310520159800324592002801922650001301950650002001963650001301983650001501996650001602011650001102027650002502038650001202063650002202075651001702097653001602114653002302130653001602153653002402169700001902193700001602212700001802228700001402246773010202260856008402362852000902446655001202455IND60605966420221122050344.0180724e20160429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060596642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattaglia, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3769-725410aFluorescent tracer tests for detection of dam leakages: The case of the Bumbuna dam - Sierra Leone  ap. 30-39.  aThe first impounding of the Bumbuna dam was subject to unexpected high seepages discharge (up to 550l/s) from the foundation drains. Fluorescent tracer tests, commonly used for hydrogeological study of porous and karst aquifer, were performed to locate the seepage zones. Solutions of 3 different fluorescent tracers (Uranine, Sulforhodamine-B and Tinopal CBS-X) were injected in the reservoir at regularly spaced points down to a depth of 80m. Tracer concentration in the seepage water from the foundation drains was continuously monitored by high resolution fluorometers with detection limit as low as 0.02ppb.A total of 107 tests were performed in two separate campaigns conducted in January–February and October–December 2009. Concentration curves recorded from each test were analyzed to determine the time of first response to the injection (detection time) and the quantity of tracer returned from each test (restitution). Maps of minimum detection time and maximum tracer restitution were generated to identify the position of leakages.Seepage mitigation works were planned on the base of test results and completed in the dry season after the drawdown of the reservoir. Works consisted in the additional grouting along the grout curtain, sealing of fissures on the bituminous layer and installation of a PVC membrane on the dam upstream face.Inspection of the upstream dam face confirmed the presence of damages in the areas identified by tracer tests. Since completion of seepage mitigation works the dam operated satisfactorily with maximum seepage from the foundation of 70l/s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adetection limit 3adrawdown 3adry season 3aengineering 3akarsts 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aseepage 3atracer techniques 3aSierra Leone 0aTracer test 0aFluorescent tracer 0aDam seepage 0aFoundation drainage1 aBirindelli, F.1 aRinaldi, M.1 aVettraino, E.1 aBezzi, A.0 tEngineering geology.g2016 Apr. 29, v. 205 p.30-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010800169520179400277592002802071650001902099650002302118650001102141650002902152650001502181650002702196650001102223653002502234653002302259653001902282653002302301700002202324700003202346773011902378856008602497852000902583655001202592IND60741097420221122180345.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074109742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsaleh, Mohd14aThe importance of worldwide governance indicators for transitions toward sustainable bioenergy industry  aThis study examined the impact of worldwide governance indicators on the sustainability of the bioenergy industry in selected European countries for the period 1996–2018. Applying the Fixed Effect (FE) Model, the results reveal that the bioenergy industry can significantly grow by improving the quality of worldwide governance indicators in European countries, especially in Western European Countries (WEC). Government effectiveness, rule of law, regulatory quality, and voice and accountability are found to be increasing the growth of the bioenergy industry. Precisely, the results further show that the magnitude of the effect of government effectiveness, voice and accountability, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on bioenergy output is higher in Western European Countries (WEC) as compared to the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). Also, the findings further elaborate that the significant positive impact of regulatory quality and rule of law on bioenergy output is higher in CEEC countries compared to the WEC countries. The finding implies that the growth of the bioenergy industry in European countries can be effectively increased by improving the practice and quality of worldwide governance indicators. The study recommends for European countries to increase the efficiency of worldwide governance in their bioenergy industry to increase the sustainability of bioenergy production and reduce Dioxide Carbon (CO2) emissions. Policymakers in these countries should also invest more in worldwide governance to increase its effectiveness and transparency in the bioenergy industry. The authorities should equally emphasize the effectiveness and transparency of worldwide governance indicators to attain bioenergy security and lessen the dependence on fossil fuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccountability 3abioenergy industry 3acarbon 3aenvironmental management 3agovernance 3agross domestic product 3amodels 0aWorldwide governance 0aBioenergy industry 0aSustainability 0aEuropean countries1 aAbdul-Rahim, A.S.1 aAbdulwakil, Mansur Muhammad0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 294 p.112960-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245016400171500001900335520166600354592002802020650001402048650001902062650001002081650001102091650002902102650001502131650000902146650001102155650001602166650002602182650002002208650002302228650001402251650003702265650002102302650001702323650001902340650001802359650002802377650001602405653000902421653002202430653003802452700001602490700001902506700001902525700002102544700001802565700001602583773012302599856008902722852000902811655001202820IND60716303920221120194051.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071630392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1120582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jiayin10aPhotocytotoxicity of white light-emitting diode irradiation on human lens epithelium and retinal pigment epithelium via the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWLEDs have lately been the preferred lighting device based on properties such as energy saving, high efficiency, longevity, and environmental protection. However, studies on the safety of white light-emitting diode (WLED) are limited. In our previous study, we found that WLED light (4000 K ± 500 K color temperature, 250 lx, and 20 min exposure) is photocytotoxic to three mammalian cell lines by causing cell lipid peroxidation. To further investigate the potential photocytotoxicity of WLEDs on the human body, we used two human eye cell lines SRA01/04 and D407 as target cells for evaluating its potential phototoxicity on the human eye in the present study based on cell viability, apoptosis, and intracellular oxidative stress assays, as well as the activation levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related apoptosis pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase (p38), using mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway assays. The results showed that WLED light has photocytotoxicities on SRA01/04 and D407 cells, which were both in a time-, irradiance-, and color temperature-dependent manner and strongest at the conditions of 2 h irradiation time, 60 W/m² irradiance, and 4000 K color temperature. Moreover, the photocytotoxicity of red light-emitting diode (LED) light was the strongest in the three tested monochromatic light compositions of WLED. Mechanism studies show that the potential phototoxicity of WLED on human lens epithelium and retinal pigment epithelium may be caused by its induced oxidative stress damage via the JNK and p38 MAPKs pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3acolor 3aenergy 3aenvironmental protection 3aepithelium 3aeyes 3ahumans 3airradiation 3alight emitting diodes 3alight intensity 3alipid peroxidation 3alongevity 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidative stress 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3aphototoxicity 3areactive oxygen species 3atemperature 0aWLED 0aPhotocytotoxicity 0aMitogen-activated protein kinases1 aLi, Daoyong1 aShan, Zhongshu1 aKurskaya, Olga1 aSharshov, Kirill1 aGao, Tingting1 aBi, Hongtao0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2020 Dec., v. 213 p.112058-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1120583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245012300176500001900299520122700318592002801545650002301573650002001596650001501616650001901631650001901650650002001669650001701689650002601706650001101732650001201743650001701755650001901772650001301791650001401804653001401818653002401832653002101856653001101877700002701888700002301915700002001938700002101958700002401979700002502003773012302028856008902151852000902240655001202249IND60716304020221120194300.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071630402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1120662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovickij, Vitalij10aBioluminescence as a sensitive electroporation indicator in sub-microsecond and microsecond range of electrical pulses  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe cell membrane permeabilization in electroporation studies is usually quantified using fluorescent markers such as propidium iodide (PI) or YO-PRO, while Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line frequently serves as a model. In this work, as an alternative, we propose a sensitive methodology for detection and analysis of electroporation phenomenon based on bioluminescence. Luminescent mice myeloma SP2/0 cells (transfected using Luciferase-pcDNA3 plasmid) were used as a cell model. Electroporation has been studied using the 0.1–5 μs × 250 and 100 μs × 1–8 pulsing protocols in 1–2.5 kV/cm PEF range. It was shown that the bioluminescence response is dependent on the cell permeabilization state and can be effectively used to detect even weak permeabilization. During saturated permeabilization the methodology accurately predicts the losses of cell viability due to irreversible electroporation. The results have been superpositioned with permeabilization and pore resealing (1 h post-treatment) data using PI. Also, the viability of the cells was evaluated. Lastly, the SP2/0 tumors have been developed in BALB/C mice and the methodology has been tested in vivo using electrochemotherapy with bleomycin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCricetulus griseus 3abioluminescence 3acell lines 3acell membranes 3acell viability 3aelectroporation 3afluorescence 3amembrane permeability 3amodels 3amyeloma 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3aplasmids 3apropidium 0aBleomycin 0aElectrochemotherapy 0aPermeabilization 0aTumors1 aZinkevičienė, Auksė1 aMalyško, Veronika1 aNovickij, Jurij1 aKulbacka, Julita1 aRembialkowska, Nina1 aGirkontaitė, Irutė0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2020 Dec., v. 213 p.112066-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1120663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010100169300001300270520148100283592002801764650001101792650000901803650001601812650001301828650001101841650001101852650001001863650001201873651000901885653001801894653001501912653002801927653001901955653002601974653001902000700002402019700001602043773010002059856008402159852000902243655001202252IND60605967120221116140451.0180724e20160517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060596712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElizalde, Ciel10aThrust fault nucleation due to heterogeneous bedding plane slip: Evidence from an Ohio coal mine  ap. 1-17.  aShales often form the roof and floor rocks of coal mines in the Appalachian Basin. From a geologic perspective, these mines offer outstanding 3D exposures of fresh rocks, otherwise only accessible via boreholes or heavily weathered surface outcrops, and present an excellent opportunity to directly observe pristine in situ natural fractures in shale. In Carroll County, Ohio, small thrust faults that predate mining operations are well exposed within the roof rocks and develop near areas where gradients of coal–shale contacts are steepest, causing ground instability. We hypothesize that bedding contact surfaces served as natural displacement discontinuities that perturbed the local stress state, resulting in localized thrust fault development. Using borehole and in-mine survey data, we digitally constrain bedding contact geometry to model slip along this interface and resolve related stress perturbations. Our modeling results suggest that inherited non-planarity of contact surfaces influenced the nucleation of secondary faults. Simulation results as constrained by the integrated field and modeling approach taken in this study help us to better understand the relationship between subsurface stress perturbations and the formation of secondary fractures. For mining purposes, recognizing subsurface stress heterogeneities due to variable bedding geometry within a regional stress field can improve our predictive capabilities of underground structural hazards.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acoal 3aengineering 3ageometry 3amining 3amodels 3ashale 3asurveys 3aOhio 0aThrust faults 0aSubseismic 0aBoundary element method 0aCoulomb stress 0aStrain energy density 0aGround control1 aGriffith, W.

Dynamic nutrient removal potential of R. rotundifolia was estimated using the Eco-tank system simulating natural eutrophic waters. The growth and physiological response of R. rotundifolia by cutting and division propagation to light (100%, 60%, and 20% natural light) were investigated. The results showed that R. rotundifolia was superior in removing N and P from eutrophic waters. As influent concentrations of NH₄⁺-N and total phosphorus (TP) were 4.81–5.87 and 0.61–0.78 mg L⁻¹, effluent concentrations of NH₄⁺-N, total nitrogen (TN), and TP were separately 0.06–1.10, 0.40–1.59, and 0.05–0.17 mg L⁻¹, with removal efficiencies of 93.6%, 84.6%, and 82.5% at a flow rate of 200 L d⁻¹. The growth and morphology of the plant under two propagation patterns were influenced by light and the responses were quite different. The biomass of the plant by cutting was higher at low light conditions, and the plant allocated more biomass on above ground. However, there was no significant difference in the height. By division, the plant preferred to high light. The biomass and height were significantly higher at 100% natural light. The peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and root activities of plant by cutting showed a trend of decrease and followed by an increase with light reduction, while by division, they increased with reduced light available. Variations of chlorophyll and soluble protein of the plant by cutting and division were contrary to the changes of POD activity. These results suggest that R. rotundifolia can be used to effectively remove nitrogen and phosphorus in eutrophic waters, and high light promotes the growth of the plant by division, while suitable shade is needed for the plant by cutting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotala rotundifolia 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aenvironmental management 3aeutrophication 3amacrophytes 3anitrogen 3aperoxidase 3aphosphorus 3aphysiological response 3asolar radiation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awinter 0aSubmerged macrophyte 0aDynamic nutrient removal 0aGrowth 0aMorphology1 aZhang, Xiaying1 aXiao, Jibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0431-38591 aChen, Ruihuan0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 293 p.112965-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010700169300001400276520119900290592002801489650001601517650002101533650001601554650001501570650001501585653001901600653001701619653002901636700001901665773010101684856008401785852000901869655001201878IND60605967720221116140122.0180724e20160517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060596772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Chi-Chin12aA general model for predicting the earthquake-induced displacements of shallow and deep slope failures  ap. 50-59.  aThe accurate assessment of the stability of slopes during earthquakes has become a critical issue in seismically active areas. To readily evaluate seismic slope hazards in a region, we developed an empirical model for estimating seismic slope displacements for both shallow and deep types of failures (i.e., rigid and flexible sliding mass, respectively). The prediction model is simply a function of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and mean period of ground motions (Tm). For predicting displacement of shallow failure, the PGA and Tm of incident motion can be directly used in the model. For predicting the displacement of deep failure, however, the dynamic response of flexible sliding block interacts with the incident motion. The changed PGA and Tm, defined as kmax and Tm,k for the seismic loading of flexible sliding mass, respectively, is estimated depending on the natural period of sliding mass (Ts). Therefore, the predicting displacement of flexible mass is achieved using kmax and Tm,k in lieu of PGA and Tm in the developed rigid model. This general model provides a consistent approach for predicting the sliding displacement of shallow (rigid) and deep (flexible) slope failures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3aempirical models 3aengineering 3ageophysics 3aprediction 0aNewmark method 0aDisplacement 0aShallow and deep failure1 aChien, Yu-Chun0 tEngineering geology.g2016 May 17, v. 206 p.50-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245019500176520153000371592002801901650001501929650002301944650002901967650002001996650001702016650001402033650001102047650001302058650002302071650001302094653001502107653001202122653001702134653002102151653001402172653001602186700002102202700002302223700002002246700002402266700002602290773011902316856008602435852000902521655001202530IND60741098720221121173956.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074109872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalam, Mohamed Abdel10aInsight into the role of the zeolitization process in enhancing the adsorption performance of kaolinite/diatomite geopolymer for effective retention of Sr (II) ions; batch and column studies  aDiatomite/kaolinite-based geopolymer (GP) was synthesized and incorporated in zeolitization process (Z/GP) to investigate the role of the zeolite phases in inducing its retention capacity of the dissolved Sr (II) ions in water. The retention of Sr (II) ions using Z/GP in comparison with GP was evaluated based on both batch and fixed-bed column studies. In the batch study, the zeolitized geopolymer (Z/GP) shows enhancement in the Sr (II) retention capacity (193.7 mg/g) as compared to the normal geopolymer (102 mg/g). Moreover, the recyclability studies demonstrate higher stability for Z/GP than GP with a retention percentage higher than 90% for five reusing runs. The kinetic and the equilibrium properties of the occurred Sr (II) retention reactions follow the assumption of the Pseudo-Second order model (R² > 0.96) and Langmuir model (R² > 0.97), respectively. The Gaussian energies (15.4 kJ/mol (GP) and 11.47 kJ/mol (Z/GP)) related to retention mechanism of chemical type and within the suggested range for the zeolitic ion exchange processes. The Sr (II) retention reactions by GP and Z/GP are of spontaneous and exothermic properties which qualifies the products to be used at low-temperature conditions (20 °C). The column studies also declared higher performance for the Z/GP fixed bed as compared to the normal GP bed considering the total Sr (II) retention percentage (72.9%), treated volume (8 L), saturation time (1620 min), and a maximum capacity of Z/GP particles in the bed (567.6 mg/g).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adiatomaceous earth 3aenvironmental management 3aheat production 3aion exchange 3akaolinite 3amodels 3apolymers 3asorption isotherms 3azeolites 0aGeopolymer 0aZeolite 0aSr (II) ions 0aBatch adsorption 0aFixed bed 0aEquilibrium1 aMokhtar, Mohamed1 aAlbukhari, Soha M.1 aBaamer, Doaa F.1 aPalmisano, Leonardo1 aAbukhadra, Mostafa R.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 294 p.112984-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245004700172506010400219506007600323520170100399592002802100506003702128650002902165650001102194650001502205650000902220650001102229650001502240651001002255653001502265653002602280653001802306653002202324700001902346700001702365700001902382700002502401700002102426773011902447856008602566852000902652655001202661IND60741098820221207123957.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074109882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchesini, Ivan10aData-driven flood hazard zonation of Italy  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present Flood-SHE, a data-driven, statistically-based procedure for the delineation of areas expected to be inundated by river floods. We applied Flood-SHE in the 23 River Basin Authorities (RBAs) in Italy using information on the presence or absence of inundations obtained from existing flood zonings as the dependent variable, and six hydro-morphometric variables computed from a 10 m × 10 m DEM as covariates. We trained 96 models for each RBA using 32 combinations of the hydro-morphometric covariates for the three return periods, for a total of 2208 models, which we validated using 32 model sets for each of the covariate combinations and return periods, for a total of 3072 validation models. In all the RBAs, Flood-SHE delineated accurately potentially inundated areas that matched closely the corresponding flood zonings defined by physically-based hydro-dynamic flood routing and inundation models. Flood-SHE delineated larger to much larger areas as potentially subject of being inundated than the physically-based models, depending on the quality of the flood information. Analysis of the sites with flood human consequences revealed that the new data-driven inundation zones are good predictors of flood risk to the population of Italy. Our experiment confirmed that a small number of hydro-morphometric terrain variables is sufficient to delineate accurate inundation zonings in a variety of physiographical settings, opening to the possibility of using Flood-SHE in other areas. We expect the new data-driven inundation zonings to be useful where flood zonings built on hydrological modelling are not available, and to decide where improved flood hazard zoning is needed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenvironmental management 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3arisk 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aItaly 0aInundation 0aStatistical modelling 0aHazard zoning 0aHydro-morphometry1 aSalvati, Paola1 aRossi, Mauro1 aDonnini, Marco1 aSterlacchini, Simone1 aGuzzetti, Fausto0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 294 p.112986-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03913naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245012100212520244900333592002802782650004102810650001702851650002002868650001602888650001202904650003502916650001002951650002402961650003002985650001703015650001803032650001503050651001003065653001703075653001903092653000803111653001003119653000803129653002003137700002203157700002403179700002603203773011903229856008603348852000903434655001203443IND60741098920221121173952.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074109892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMhaske, Sushil N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2448-785910aAssessment and management of soil erosion in the hilltop mining dominated catchment using GIS integrated RUSLE model  aThe Saranda forest region, which is well known for its biodiversity in India, is now confronted by rapid socio-economic development, particularly the hilltop mining activities. Hilltop mining areas of this region have always been responsible for producing excessive soil erosion in the associated river basin. This erosion phenomenon becomes hazardous during the rainy season, thereby contributing to various environmental problems, and consequently, necessitating soil erosion control planning in the Saranda forest. Hence, this study aimed to estimate average annual soil erosion in the Saranda region in terms of the spatial distribution using the Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The erosion was quantified at a spatial resolution of 10 m (pixel by pixel) using the GIS-based RUSLE inputs. This study also applies GIS integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to identify the favorable zones for sediment deposition in the study area. On the basis of erosion severity, the entire study area is classified into six categories (very low to extreme). The study reveals that the Saranda forest's average annual soil erosion is 76 tons per hectare per year (t/ha/yr). Approximately 63% of the total area is categorized under very low to low erosion category, and the relevant area is mainly covered by forest land, whereas the mining region comprises less than 1% of the total study area with extremely high soil erosion (156 t/ha/yr) potential. As envisaged from the present study, the erosion-prone mining areas are located within a 1–5 km range of the adjacent Karo and Koina rivers, thereby, necessitating the erosion control strategy to avoid the possible threats. From this perspective, the study also investigates the favorable zones for sediment deposition using the GIS integrated AHP model to suggest the appropriate erosion control measures. Finally, the RUSLE and AHP models are combined on the GIS platform to identify the distressed catchment area. Moreover, 42% (41,060 ha) of the total area is disturbed due to the present mining activities, which involves 11 sub-watersheds, and their associated 50 micro-watersheds. From the context of watershed conservation, erosion control measures are also recommended. The methodology adopted in this study can be easily extended to any global mining-dominated catchment for sustainable conservation planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation 3abiodiversity 3aerosion control 3aforest land 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ahills 3asediment deposition 3asocioeconomic development 3asoil erosion 3asubwatersheds 3awet season 3aIndia 0aSoil erosion 0aHilltop mining 0aGIS 0aRUSLE 0aAHP 0aErosion control1 aPathak, Khanindra1 aDash, Sonam Sandeep1 aNayak, Dibyendu Bikas0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 294 p.112987-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245010100210300001400311520114200325592002801467650001501495650001601510650001401526650001301540650001401553650001201567650001501579650001901594651001301613653001901626653001401645653002001659653001301679653002501692773010201717856008401819852000901903655001201912IND60605968320221122224359.0180724e20160603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060596832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaragai, Tetsuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9946-822514aThe effect of rock strength on weathering rates of sandstone used for Angkor temples in Cambodia  ap. 24-35.  aThis study determined the weathering rates from the depths of hollows formed by the deterioration of sandstone blocks used to build Angkor temples in the 7th–12th centuries. Due to capillary processes, these hollows generally develop at the bases of building components such as doorframes, false doorframes, window frames, and pillars. In this study, 55 locations in 29 temples were selected to measure maximum hollow depth. Based on the ages of the temples, the weathering rate was calculated to be in the range 7–92mmka⁻¹. The weathering rate was found to be independent of building component type and aspect. The calculated weathering rate corresponds to the physical weathering rate of sandstone caused by the wetting-drying cycles that result from the tropical environment along with the dry season. An equation that can estimate the maximum depth of a hollow in a sandstone block was proposed based on temple age and the coefficient obtained from two types of rock hardness values. The equation coefficient is an effective index that can help predict the deterioration of stone cultural artifacts such as the Angkor temples.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3aengineering 3aequations 3ahardness 3asandstone 3atropics 3aweathering 3awet-dry cycles 3aCambodia 0aAngkor temples 0aSandstone 0aWeathering rate 0aStrength 0aHistorical structure0 tEngineering geology.g2016 June 03, v. 207 p.24-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011100177520159800288592002801886650002301914650001901937650001901956650002901975650002602004650001502030650002102045650001702066653001502083653001702098653001902115653002602134653002302160700002502183700005802208700002102266773011902287856008602406852000902492655001202501IND60741099020221121173910.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074109902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivera, Diana Rose T.10aEnergy balance of torrefied microalgal biomass with production upscale approached by life cycle assessment  aTorrefaction is a thermochemical process used to convert the biomass into solid fuel. In this study, torrefaction increased the raw microalgal biomass’ energy content from 20.22 MJ⋅kg⁻¹ to 27.93 MJ⋅kg⁻¹. To determine if more energy is produced than energy consumption from torrefaction, this study identified the energy balance of torrefied microalgal biomass production based on a life cycle approach. The energy analysis showed that, among all processes, torrefaction had the least amount of energy demand. The experimental setup, defined as scenario A, revealed that the principal source of energy demand, about 85%, was consumed on the microalgal growth using a photobioreactor system. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the varying energy demand for torrefied microalgal biomass production. The different types of cultivation methods and various production scales were considered in scenarios B to D. Scenario D, which represented the commercial production-scale, the energy demand drastically decreased by 59.46% as compared to the experimental setup (scenario A). The open-pond cultivation system resulted in the least energy requirement, regardless of the production scale (scenarios B and C) among all the given scenarios. Unlike scenarios A and D, scenarios B and C identified the drying process to consume a high amount of energy. All the scenarios have shown an energy demand deficit. Therefore, efforts to decrease the energy demand on the upstream processes are needed to make the torrefied microalgal biomass a viable alternative energy source.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3aenergy balance 3aenergy content 3aenvironmental management 3alife cycle assessment 3amicroalgae 3aphotobioreactors 3atorrefaction 0aMicroalgae 0aTorrefaction 0aEnergy balance 0aLife cycle assessment 0aEnergy consumption1 aUbando, Aristotle T.1 aChen, Wei-Hsin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5009-39601 aCulaba, Alvin B.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 294 p.112992-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1129923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01319naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245007100205300001600276520036800292592002800660650001300688650001000701650001000711651001200721653001400733653001600747653002100763653001500784773011200799856008500911852000900996655001201005IND60716305420221121122248.0220531e20220720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071630542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrid, Lena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1375-681110aWorked goose radii from medieval England: What were they used for?  ap. 121-132.  aThis paper examines an artefact type of unknown function, found in several places across medieval England.

Specifically, the methodology is tailored for modeling groundwater flow and nitrates contamination in typical Mediterranean coastal plains with high anthropogenic pressures, as exemplified by the Arborea plain (central western Sardinia, Italy). The study started with development of an updated geological–depositional model based on sequential stratigraphy. Geological and geophysical data, processed in a geographic information system (GIS) environment, supported the definition of a 3D hydrogeological conceptual model and provided a solid basis for the interpretation of groundwater flow directions. The 3D hydrogeological model allowed constraining groundwater circulation, flow paths and distribution of nitrate concentrations in the aquifers. The methodology appears as a valid tool applicable in other coastal areas to determine geological and hydrogeological settings. The definition of a quantitative hydrogeological framework will support the effective management of local water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3acoastal plains 3acoasts 3aengineering 3ageographic information systems 3ageophysics 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3anitrates 3astratigraphy 3aItaly 3aSardinia 0a3D hydrogeological–conceptual model 0aGroundwater 0aNitrate pollution 0aNitrate Vulnerable Zone 0aDesertification 0aSardinia1 aCarletti, Alberto1 aDa Pelo, Stefania1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4069-40061 aCocco, Fabrizio1 aFunedda, Antonio1 aLoi, Alfredo1 aManta, Fabio1 aPittalis, Daniele0 tEngineering geology.g2016 June 03, v. 207 p.103-114dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245011500202520117000317592002801487650001501515650001701530650001401547650001601561650002001577650001701597650003301614650001101647650002101658650001701679650002401696650001701720650001601737650002001753653001701773653002401790653002401814653005501838653001001893653002401903700001801927700001601945700001701961700002001978700005801998773012102056856008202177852000902259655001202268IND60741100220221118002523.0210729e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074110022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2021.1113632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, JaeSang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3011-721310aSignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 as a potential therapeutic target for Graves’ orbitopathy  aThe roles of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in inflammation, oxidative stress, and adipogenesis during Graves’ orbitopathy (GO) are incompletely understood. Here, STAT3 expression in orbital tissues (from individuals with GO and healthy control subjects) was studied, and the role of STAT3 in GO pathogenesis was examined through small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing in primary orbital fibroblasts. STAT3 mRNA expression was higher in GO orbital tissues than in non-GO tissues. Treatment with proinflammatory cytokines, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or insulin-like growth factor-1 induced STAT3 mRNA in GO orbital fibroblasts, but not in non-GO cells. STAT3 silencing inhibited interleukin-1β-induced inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress-induced haem oxygenase-1 expression. STAT3 siRNA-transfected GO orbital fibroblasts showed decreased adipocyte differentiation. STAT3 affected proinflammatory cytokine production, oxidative stress responses, and adipogenesis in an in vitro model of GO, suggesting that STAT3 mediates GO pathology, and that modulating STAT3 expression may have therapeutic potential against GO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3acytokines 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3athyrotropin 3atransactivators 0aAdipogenesis 0aGraves' orbitopathy 0aOrbital fibroblasts 0aSignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 0aSTAT3 0aThyroid eye disease1 aKim, Ji-Young1 aKim, Bo Ram1 aLee, Eun Jig1 aKikkawa, Don O.1 aYoon, Jin Sook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8751-94670 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 534 p.111363-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2021.1113633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016100168520167100329592002802000650002402028650001402052650002502066650001202091650001002103650001102113650001802124650001302142650001102155650001502166650001302181650001902194650001602213651001002229653002402239653002302263653001202286653001702298653002602315700001602341700002002357700001402377700001502391700001802406773009902424856008602523852000902609655001202618IND60741100420221118002503.0210727e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074110042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weiwei10aDescription of a white spot disease of field cultivated kelp (Saccharina japonica) and evaluation of its influences on the growth and phytochemical contents  aDiverse diseases have been causing the serious biomass and economic losses of cultivated kelp, Saccharina japonica. In this study, we described a prevalent kelp disease, white spot disease, which was found in northern China in recent years, and evaluated its influences on kelp growth and phytochemical contents. The disease sustained a period from the fast-growing to the harvest of kelp, prevailing generally from March to May. The diseased kelps were scattered with irregular white spots in different sizes in the upper and middle parts of sporophytes, which were accompanied occasionally with blisters exceeding 10 cm as the maximum diameter. The medulla of diseased sporophytes became loose, but no change was found in their epidermis and cortex. White spot disease caused a loss of daily increase of sporophyte length by 42 % when it was intense. One to two thirds of diseased sporophytes self-healed up to some extent. The self-healed sporophytes recovered normal color, their white spots gradually disappeared and their daily increase of sporophyte length returned to that of the healthy ones. The self-healing of diseased sporophytes aided to recover the yield and quality of kelp products. However, the blisters tended to be residual and sometimes white spot reappeared in newly generated tissue of the self-healed sporophytes. The disease caused less accumulation of pigment with the growth of S. japonica, but more increases of total phenolic content, DPPH radical-scavenging activity and reducing power with an exception in June. The disease also affected iodine and crude protein contents, but not ash, mannitol, alginate and crude fucoidan contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharina japonica 3aalginates 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass 3acolor 3acortex 3acrude protein 3afucoidan 3aiodine 3amacroalgae 3amannitol 3aphytochemicals 3asporophytes 3aChina 0aSaccharina japonica 0aWhite spot disease 0aSymptom 0aSelf-healing 0aPhytochemical content1 aLi, Xiaojie1 aLiang, Guangjin1 aZhao, Nan1 aShi, Liang1 aYang, Guanpin0 tAquatic botany.g2021 July, v. 173 p.103414-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015900167300001600326520146600342592002801808650001301836650001701849650001601866650002301882650001601905650001301921650001501934650001101949650000901960650000901969650001801978650001201996650001502008650001502023653003402038653004302072653001802115653000902133653001202142653003902154700001602193773010402209856008402313852000902397655001202406IND60605969820221117160352.0180724e20160624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060596982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPegah, Ehsan10aApplication of near-surface seismic refraction tomography and multichannel analysis of surface waves for geotechnical site characterizations: A case study  ap. 100-113.  aIn this case study two geophysical methods based on seismic waves were employed to evaluate the geotechnical properties of the soil deposits at a site for a planned wind farm. Regional geological information shows that the study area is mainly covered by recent alluvium, which is classified as a mixture of fine sand and gravel. Twenty five seismic refraction surveys were carried out in the study area. The acquired shot gathers were processed, from which primary wave (P-wave) and shear wave (S-wave) velocities were derived. The P-wave velocities were obtained by using the Seismic Refraction Tomography method (SRT) while the S-wave velocities were extracted by utilizing the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) technique, which is established based on the dispersion characteristics of Rayleigh waves. Seismic hazard at the site was evaluated according to the Iranian code using the measured S-wave velocities, and the friction angles of the soil deposits were approximated using an empirical method and by making use of Jaky's formula for earth pressure at rest, which yielded similar values. The deformation properties of the foundation soil were also estimated based on the correlations between seismic wave velocities and elastic properties of soil as well as Janbu's formula for soil modulus. The findings of this study may serve as references for economic and non-destructive geotechnical site characterizations using seismic-wave methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvium 3acase studies 3adeformation 3aempirical research 3aengineering 3afriction 3ageophysics 3agravel 3asand 3asoil 3asurface waves 3asurveys 3atomography 3awind farms 0aSeismic refraction tomography 0aMultichannel analysis of surface waves 0aWave velocity 0aSoil 0aBedrock 0aGeotechnical site characterization1 aLiu, Huabei0 tEngineering geology.g2016 June 24, v. 208 p.100-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011200164300001400276500001900290520119000309592002801499650001701527650002201544650001501566650001501581650001501596651002201611653001601633653001301649653001501662653001901677653001201696653002401708700001801732700001501750700001901765700002201784700002301806773010501829856008501934852000902019655001202028IND60716307820221121122340.0210415e20210530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071630782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.10.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacko, S.10aStructural contraints of neotectonic activity in the eastern part of the Western Carpathians orogenic wedge  ap. 27-43.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe eastern part of the Western Carpathians orogenic wedge covering the territory eastward from the 20° meridian could serve as an example for close relation between basement rock structural anisotropy and the neotectonic morphostructural pattern. The neotectonic evolution of the region has been guided by crustal deformations of the entire main Western Carpathian fault systems, defined by steeply dipping faults of NE-SW, NW-SE, S–N and E-W directions. The fault sets bound morphostructural units and form the base for the Quaternary neotectonic activity and landscape development of the region. Closely linked to Western Carpathian lineaments they reflect both the Moho topography and directional orientation of adjoining platform margins. The fault sets represent inherited, poly-stage structures genetically correlating to Cretaceous fold pattern of the Western Carpathians being repeatedly reactivated during Cenozoic times. Summarising vertical movement ratios among neotectonic units, particularly between the highest uplifted/subsiding blocks, we have found the maximal Quaternary movements rate of the region reaching ca 1315 m and neotectonic movements rate of 1710 m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenozoic era 3aCretaceous period 3aanisotropy 3alandscapes 3atopography 3aCarpathian region 0aNeotectonic 0aPliocene 0aQuaternary 0aMovements rate 0aDataset 0aWestern carpathians1 aJacko sen, S.1 aLabant, S.1 aBátorová, K.1 aFarkašovský, R.1 aŠčerbáková, B.0 tQuaternary international.g2021 May 30, v. 585 p.27-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.10.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245020100179520167300380592002802053650002302081650002202104650003702126650002102163650002002184650002102204650001502225650002202240650001902262650001602281650001802297650001502315650002402330650001302354650001102367650001302378650003702391650003702428650001602465653000702481653001002488653000802498653000902506653001002515653000702525653000802532653000802540653001102548653000902559653000802568653000802576653000802584653000702592653001302599653000802612653002702620653002902647653002702676653002902703653001802732700001902750700002802769700001502797700006002812773011502872856008602987852000903073655001203082IND60741102820221118002450.0210904e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074110282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaik, Shreyanka Shankar10aRapid and highly selective electrochemical sensor based on ZnS/Au-decorated f-multi-walled carbon nanotube nanocomposites produced via pulsed laser technique for detection of toxic nitro compounds  aNovel ZnS/Au/f-multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanostructures were produced via a pulsed laser-assisted technique followed by a wet chemical process. ZnS nanospheres were synthesized via pulsed laser ablation of a Zn target in DMSO, which was used as a solvent and sulfur source. Notably, no additional sulfur sources, surfactants, or reducing agents were used during the synthesis. The structure and morphology of the prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The fabricated electrochemical sensor based on ZnS/Au/f-MWCNT nanocomposites exhibited rapid and highly selective detection of a toxic pollutant, namely 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). Linear sweep voltammetry analysis revealed that the optimized ZnS/Au10/f-MWCNT3 nanocomposite displayed a wide linear dynamic response (10–150 μM) with high sensitivity (0.8084μAμM⁻¹cm⁻²) and low limit of detection (30 nM). The excellent 4-NP sensing performance of the modified electrode was attributed to the availability of numerous active sites (electrochemical surface area=0.00369μFcm⁻²) and an enhanced electron transfer rate. Interference and stability studies were also conducted. A 100-fold excess of competing ions (Na⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻, 4-AP, AA, and 2-NP) did not interfere with the selective detection of 4-NP. The newly fabricated ZnS/Au10/f-MWCNT3 nanocomposite could be an effective sensor for the selective and sensitive detection of toxic organic nitro compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3ananocomposites 3ananospheres 3ap-nitrophenol 3apollutants 3asensors (equipment) 3asolvents 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avoltammetry 0aCV 0aFESEM 0aGLE 0aHPLC 0aHRTEM 0aLO 0aLOD 0aLSV 0aMWCNTs 0a4-NP 0aNPs 0aPLA 0aPLI 0aTO 0aUV–vis 0aXRD 0aPulsed laser synthesis 0aZnS/Au-decorated f-MWCNT 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aLinear sweep voltammetry 0a4-nitrophenol1 aLee, Seung Jun1 aTheerthagiri, Jayaraman1 aYu, Yiseul1 aChoi, Myong Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5729-54180 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 418 p.126269-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01581naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245005400177300001600231520069300247592002800940650002800968650002800996650001701024650001301041650001501054650001701069700002001086773010701106856005701213852000901270655001201279IND50068944220221121230400.0130831e197803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006894422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1978.tb02383.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchanan, R.

Recently, long single stranded DNA (lssDNA) donors have emerged as a popular choice of DNA donor, outperforming dsDNA templates in terms of knock-in efficiency for gene tagging and generating conditional alleles. The generation of these donors can be achieved through several methods that may introduce errors in the sequence, result in poor yields, and contain dsDNA contamination. We have developed our own cost-effective lssDNA synthesis methodology that results in high purity, sequence verified, low contamination lssDNA donors. We provide a detailed methodology on the design and generation of such donors for gene tagging experiments and generating conditional alleles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aCRISPR-associated endonuclease 9 3acost effectiveness 3agene targeting 3amice 3azygote 0aCRISPR-Cas9 0aLong single stranded DNA 0aMouse embryo 0aGene tagging 0aConditional allele1 aAguilar-Martinez, Elisa1 aAdamson, Antony D.0 tMethods.g2021 July, v. 191 p.3-14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011400176520128600290592002801576650002401604650001201628650001201640650002001652650001601672650001301688650001901701650001101720650001201731650001001743650001901753650001601772650001901788650002201807653001901829653001601848653001201864653002501876653001101901700005901912700002801971700002401999700006102023773011502084856008602199852000902285655001202294IND60741103720221118002334.0210904e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074110372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJavadian-Saraf, Aida10aGraphene oxide/polyaniline-based microwave split-ring resonator: A versatile platform towards ammonia sensing  aAmmonia gas sensors have always received significant attention as robust platforms for emission control, food safety, and monitoring human exhaled breath for the early diagnosis of diseases such as dysfunction of the kidney and liver. This study explores the development of a microwave-based split-ring resonator (SRR) sensor with enhanced sensitivity to detect ammonia gas at low concentrations. The sensor is based on a nanocomposite fabricated by incorporating 10 wt% of graphene oxide (GO) into polyaniline (PANI) via the in-situ polymerization of aniline monomers over the surface of the GO sheets. The addition of GO to PANI results in a high sensitivity of 0.038 dB ppm⁻¹ for low concentrations (1–25 ppm) and 0.0045 dB ppm⁻¹ for high concentrations (> 25 ppm) of ammonia gas, in a 150–400 s time interval at room temperature. The prepared sensor can selectively sense ammonia gas in the presence of other higher concentrations of hazardous gases and a wide range of relative humidity levels (15–90%). The response signal is repeatable after 30 days with less than 0.32% deviation. The developed low-cost and robust sensor has the potential to monitor ammonia gas in various applications, including medical, environmental, food, and agricultural sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aammonia 3aaniline 3aearly diagnosis 3afood safety 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aliver 3ananocomposites 3apolyaniline 3apolymerization 3arelative humidity 0aGraphene oxide 0aPolyaniline 0aAmmonia 0aSplit-ring resonator 0aSensor1 aHosseini, Ehsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4868-12341 aWiltshire, Benjamin D.,1 aZarifi, Mohammad H.1 aArjmand, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8812-56380 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 418 p.126283-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1262833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008200165300001400247520103000261592002801291650001301319650001601332650001201348650000901360650003701369650003001406650001601436650002701452650001601479651001401495653003601509653001801545653002301563653002001586653002601606700003001632700002401662773010201686856008401788852000901872655001201881IND60605971320221121044808.0180724e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060597132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.04.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Qian10aVariability in unsaturated hydraulic properties of residual soil in Singapore  ap. 21-29.  aResidual soil covers most of the land in Singapore and is commonly found in unsaturated conditions due to the deep ground water table. Matric suction in residual soil plays an important role on the stability of residual soil slopes against rainfall. Matric suction in the soil will change due to infiltration during rainfall, and infiltration is mainly controlled by the unsaturated hydraulic properties (i.e., soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) and hydraulic conductivity) of the residual soil. Variability in SWCC and hydraulic conductivity of residual soils in Singapore, such as Jurong Formation, Bukit Timah granite and Old Alluvium, were quantified and compared with the uncertainty of saturated soil properties. A new framework for the estimation of SWCC from the saturated hydraulic conductivity, ks, is proposed in this paper. The upper bound from the proposed framework is recommended for the infiltration analyses and the lower bound from the proposed framework is recommended for the slope stability analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvium 3aengineering 3agranite 3arain 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil water characteristic 3auncertainty 3aunsaturated conditions 3awater table 3aSingapore 0aSoil-Water characteristic curve 0aResidual soil 0aHydraulic property 0aSlope stability 0aInfiltration analyses1 aRahardjo, H.q(Harianto),1 aSatyanaga, Alfrendo0 tEngineering geology.g2016 July 15, v. 209 p.21-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245010900177500001900286520125300305592002801558650003001586650001901616650001501635650002801650650002401678650000901702650001801711650001301729650001401742650001701756653002701773653002101800653001401821653003601835653001601871700001901887773010301906856008902009852000902098655001202107IND60716308720221121183241.0201206e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071630872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2020.1044632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiddleton, Eric G.10aWildflower plantings in commercial agroecosystems promote generalist predators of Colorado potato beetle  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWildflower plantings in agroecosystems can support arthropod predators, and may have the potential to increase conservation biological control of pest species in nearby crops. Colorado potato beetle (CPB) is a significant defoliator of potato that is resistant to many forms of management. Promoting natural enemies of CPB by establishing perennial wildflower plantings in field margins may provide a measure of control for this pest. We examined the impacts of floral plantings on the abundance of known CPB predators, predation of CPB egg masses, and CPB populations in a commercial agroecosystem. Floral plantings increased the abundance of CPB predators, but did not significantly increase the rate of predation of sentinel CPB egg masses within field margins. Within nearby potato fields, predator abundance and predation rates on CPB eggs were unaffected by the presence of flowers. Colorado potato beetle abundance in potato fields was also not impacted by floral plantings. However, floral margins may provide improved overwintering opportunities for CPB, and further investigation is needed. Perennial wildflower plantings show potential for attracting predators that prey on CPB, but these benefits do not extend into nearby potato crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3aagroecosystems 3aarthropods 3abiological pest control 3adefoliating insects 3aeggs 3aoverwintering 3apotatoes 3apredation 3awild flowers 0aColorado potato beetle 0aFloral resources 0aPredators 0aConservation biological control 0aWildflowers1 aMacRae, Ian V.0 tBiological control.g2021 Jan., v. 152 p.104463-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2020.1044633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014100167520165600308592002801964650001501992650001502007650001502022650002202037650001502059650001302074650001202087650002102099650001902120650001802139650001902157650001702176650001302193650001502206653002402221653001902245653002502264653001902289653001702308653002302325700001602348700001702364700001702381700001702398700001302415700005602428773011502484856008602599852000902685655001202694IND60741104820221118001917.0210904e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074110482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1263002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Junyin10aMechanistically understanding adsorption of methyl orange, indigo carmine, and methylene blue onto ionic/nonionic polystyrene adsorbents  aThe involved interaction information concerning adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-adsorbent is indispensable for developing and optimizing adsorption treatment of dye wastewater. Single and bi-solute adsorption of methyl orange (MO), indigo carmine (IC), and methylene blue (MB) on polystyrene anion exchanger (PsAX), defunctionalized version of PsAX (DF-PsAX), and hyper-cross-linked polystyrene adsorbent (MN200) were investigated to obtain a mechanistic understanding. Under acidic condition, higher adsorption efficiencies of PsAX due to extra intermolecular interactions of MO between the protonated tertiary amine group and the sulfate groups were observed, while strong alkaline condition is favorable for the adsorption of IC and MB by PsAX. MN200 exhibited much larger adsorption capacity toward MB than that toward MO or IC, because the fused-rings structure of MB is more polarizable and can form stronger nonionic intermolecular attractions with the matrix structure of polystyrene adsorbents. Bi-solute adsorption reveals that MO has obvious competitive effect toward IC adsorption at low concentrations, but it is not the case for the adsorption at high concentrations, where IC molecules can form intermolecular H-bonding interactions to defend the competition. the thermodynamic parameters confirm the endothermic and spontaneous nature of MO adsorption by PsAX, and ≈ 48 KJ mol⁻¹ of the enthalpy change (∆H) imply the adsorption is not just physical absorption. Additionally, water/ethanol mixture solution of NaCl can almost thoroughly regenerate the exhausted PsAX, whereas only aqueous solution without ethanol is invalid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aendothermy 3aenthalpy 3aethanol 3ahydrogen bonding 3aindigo carmine 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3apolystyrenes 3asulfates 3awastewater 0aPolymeric adsorbent 0aDye wastewater 0aAdsorption mechanism 0aIntermolecular 0aInteractions 0aSynergistic effect1 aZhou, Lijia1 aChen, Haihua1 aLiu, Xiaohan1 aHong, Chenlu1 aChen, Du1 aPan, Bingjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3105-85150 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 418 p.126300-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1263003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245006900176300001400245520177900259592002802038650001002066650002002076650001502096650001702111650001502128650001302143650001002156650001002166653001002176653000802186653001602194653001602210653001602226653001702242700002002259700002702279700001802306700001802324773010202342856008402444852000902528655001202537IND60605971920221121014416.0180724e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060597192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaÿ-Gomord, Ophélie10aUnraveling chalk microtextural properties from indentation tests  ap. 30-43.  aThe petrographical, petrophysical and geomechanical properties of the less commonly studied low permeability or tight chalks are presented in this study. The latter are relevant as potential unconventional reservoirs or intra-reservoir seals. Tight chalks encompass different lithotypes, in which the main factors controlling the petrophysical properties as shown in this study are the non-carbonate content and the degree of cementation. Those parameters strongly modify chalk microtexture and thus its porous network, reducing pore-sizes hence altering poroperm properties. In order to better understand the characteristics of tight chalks, an integrated petrographical, petrophysical and geomechanical study was carried out on a set of 65 chalk samples from Northwestern European outcrops, covering a wide range of lithotypes. The dataset gathered covers a broad spectrum of values for the determined petrophysical (e.g. porosities from 9 to 45%) and geomechanical properties (e.g. strengths from 3 to 60MPa). In the framework of this study, indentation tests were performed on the chalk samples. This technique proved to be a successful method to quickly estimate rock strength. Indeed, a good linear correlation (R²=0.90) has been established between indentation strength and UCS. Furthermore, indentation tests yielded valuable information about the chalk properties, both in terms of petrographical (cementation/clay-content), petrophysical (exponential relationship with porosity) and geomechanical (in relation to the elastic parameter and plasticity index) properties. This cheap and easy-to-operate method is a promising tool to indirectly estimate the mechanical parameters of chalks, when core samples are unavailable for laboratory testing in oil-field wells.  aPublisher supplied data 3achalk 3adata collection 3aoil fields 3apermeability 3aplasticity 3aporosity 3aseals 3awells 0aChalk 0aUCS 0aPetrography 0aIndentation 0aCementation 0aMicrotexture1 aDescamps, Fanny1 aTshibangu, Jean-Pierre1 aVandycke, S.,1 aSwennen, Rudy0 tEngineering geology.g2016 July 15, v. 209 p.30-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245010200170500001900272520181500291592002802106650002502134650002702159650002302186650003002209650001202239650002102251650002302272650002502295650001502320650002202335650001002357651001002367653002102377653001002398653002402408653002202432653001602454700001402470700001402484700001802498700001202516700001702528700001902545700001202564700001302576700002402589773010302613856008902716852000902805655001202814IND60716309420221121032403.0201206e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071630942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2020.1044712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Chuan10aImpacts of a biocontrol agent on invasive Ageratina adenophora in Southwest China: Friend or foe?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClassical biological control of invasive plants depends on the introduction of host-specific natural enemies. Many natural enemies have provided successful control, but the impacts of herbivorous insects on their hosts are highly variable and context dependent. Under some circumstances, overcompensation can even occur, with plant reproduction temporarily increasing rather than decreasing in response to herbivory. The stem-galling fly Procecidochares utilis has been widely introduced to help control Ageratina adenophora, a globally significant weed, but its impact has been inconsistent and in places ineffective. Its galling is known to stimulate production of side branches in plants under laboratory conditions. We examined the abundance and impact of P. utilis at four A. adenophora sites of Southwest China that were invaded at different times and support different densities of the insect. Stems with galls were more likely to be branched and produced more capitula. Furthermore, seed numbers in capitula from galled and un-galled stems were similar, and galling resulted in only slightly reduced seed weights. However, the increase in above-ground vegetative biomass associated with branching resulted in less efficient capitulum production relative to vegetative growth. Clearly Procecidochares utilis is not providing effective biocontrol of Ageratina adenophora in Southwest China so far. In the long term, galled plants may display reduced competitive ability and lower lifetime reproductive success, but the short term increases in seed production it generates suggest it may be favouring its host’s range expansion. The fly has been a successful biocontrol agent in dry area of Hawii, so understanding the factors that determine its effectiveness represent a major challenge for the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratina adenophora 3aProcecidochares utilis 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abiomass 3ahost specificity 3aplant reproduction 3areproductive success 3astem galls 3avegetative growth 3aweeds 3aChina 0aApical dominance 0aGalls 0aInvasive Asteraceae 0aOver-compensation 0aTephritidae1 aWang, Qin1 aChen, Yan1 aZhang, Li-Dan1 aTan, Lu1 aFu, Rong-Hua1 aYang, Jin-Tian1 aLi, Yan1 aLiu, Mei1 aCompton, Stephen G.0 tBiological control.g2021 Jan., v. 152 p.104471-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2020.1044713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015200172520133500324592002801659650000901687650001501696650001701711650001101728650001501739650001801754650001301772650001601785650002501801653001901826653001601845653001301861653001701874653002201891700002301913700001901936773011501955856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60741105320221118001924.0210904e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074110532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1263062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongkun K.10aMicropollutants and biological effects as control indexes for the operation and design of shallow open-water unit ponds to polish domestic effluent  aAdditional control indexes should be considered for the operation and design of post-treatment systems, as the wastewater treatment objectives are developing toward protecting the safety of ecological environments. In this study, two control indexes were selected and examined systematically in pilot-scale shallow open-water unit (SOWU) ponds for domestic effluent polishing: micropollutants and biotoxicities. The total risk quotient (RQTₒₜₐₗ ≤ 1) and effect-based trigger value (EBT) were set as the thresholds for known micropollutants and biological effects, respectively. The results showed that RQTₒₜₐₗ of micropollutants (n = 46) could be mitigated to an acceptable level and the luminescent bacteria toxicity was in compliance with the EBT after SOWU polishing in the warm season. The reduction of micropollutants and biotoxicities in the SOWUs both fit the k–C* model well (R² > 0.9) in the warm and cold seasons. Finally, the k–C* model integrated with the control indexes was developed to design the SOWU dimensions, and the results indicated that a pond area of 21.7–108.5 m² was required for every 1 m³/d of effluent when micropollutants were set as the control index, while a pond area of 3.6–18.2 m² was required when luminescent bacteria toxicity was set as the control index.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acompliance 3aluminescence 3amodels 3apollutants 3arelative risk 3atoxicity 3awarm season 3awastewater treatment 0aMicropollutant 0aBiotoxicity 0aEffluent 0ak–C* model 0aEcological safety1 aWang, Xiaochang C.1 aMa, Xiaoyan Y.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 418 p.126306-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1263063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01168naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245006000152300001800212520028300230592002800513650001100541650001400552650001200566650001400578700001900592700002300611700001700634773013100651856007500782852000900857655001200866IND60539082720221122031039.0160815e20130306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053908272DNAL7 a10.1021/ja400648w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jian10aPalladium(0)-Catalyzed Alkynylation of C(sp3)–H Bonds  ap. 3387-3390.  aThe alkynylation of β-C(sp³)–H bonds in aliphatic amides with alkynyl halides has been enabled using Pd(0)/N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and Pd(0)/phosphine (PR₃) catalysts.

We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence techniques to determine the dynamics and thermodynamic parameters for the formation of complexes between CR and bovine serum albumin (BSA). CR interacts with BSA through a transition complex; the activation energy for association (Eact(a)) was determined to be 35.88kJmol⁻¹, while the activation enthalpy (ΔH‡), entropy (ΔS‡), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG‡) are 33.41kJmol⁻¹, 0.18Jmol⁻¹K⁻¹, and 33.35kJmol⁻¹, respectively. When this intermediate transforms into the final CR-BSA complex, the entropy of the system increases and part of the absorbed energy is released; this process is associated with a reverse activation energy (Eact(d)) of 20.17kJmol⁻¹, and values of ΔH‡, ΔS‡, and ΔG‡ of 17.69kJmol⁻¹, −162.86Jmol⁻¹K⁻¹, and 66.25kJmol⁻¹, respectively. A comparison of the SPR and fluorescence results suggests that there is more than one site where BSA interacts with CR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCongo red 3aGibbs free energy 3aactivation energy 3abovine serum albumin 3acolloids 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3afluorescence 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aFluorescence 0aRate constant 0aBinding constant1 aCoelho, Yara Luiza1 aAgudelo, Alvaro Javier Patiño1 aRezende, Jaqueline de Paula1 aFerreira, Gabriel Max Dias1 aFerreira, Guilherme Max Dias1 aPires, Ana Clarissa dos Santos1 ada Silva, Luis Henrique Mendes0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 159 p.737-742dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245018000167300001600347520166500363592002802028650001302056650001302069650001302082650003902095650001102134650001502145650001002160650001402170650001502184650001702199650001102216650001802227650001802245650001702263650001902280653002002299653001802319653001502337653001702352653001402369653001802383700001202401700001202413700001702425700002002442700001602462700002002478700001702498773010602515856008702621852000902708655001202717IND60583216420221121211627.0180914e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058321642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chang10aOcta-arginine modified lipid emulsions as a potential ocular delivery system for disulfiram: A study of the corneal permeation, transcorneal mechanism and anti-cataract effect  ap. 305-314.  aThe purpose of the study was to design a novel octa-arginine (R8) modified lipid emulsion (LE) system for the ocular delivery of the lipophilic drug disulfiram (DSF). The influence of the particle size of the lipid emulsions and the presence of R8 on corneal permeation was studied. DSF-loaded lipid emulsions with different particle sizes (DSF-LE1, DSF-LE2, DSF-LE3) and DSF-loaded lipid emulsions modified with R8 (DSF-LE1-R8 and DSF-LE2-R8) were prepared. The Zeta potential of the lipid emulsions was changed from negative to a positive value after modification of R8. The mucoadhesion of different preparations was investigated, and DSF-LE1-R8 was found to produce the strongest mucoadhesion. The in vitro corneal penetration study and in vivo ocular distribution study showed that the R8 modified lipid emulsion (DSF-LE1-R8) with a nano particle size, exhibited the highest permeability and the largest amount of DDC distributed in ocular issues. Coumarin-6 labelled LE1-R8 displayed more homogeneous fluorescence with the deeper penetration into the cornea compared with other preparations at various times. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that, in addition to paracellular routes, LE-R8 could also transport across the corneal epithelium by transcellular routes as a result of increased uptake due to the R8 modification. Furthermore, the anti-cataract effect was evaluated and it was found that DSF-LE1-R8 exhibited a marked anti-cataract effect. Therefore, the lipid emulsions with nano-sized particles and modification of R8 were proposed as a potential ocular delivery system to improve the corneal penetration and ocular delivery of DSF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3acataract 3acolloids 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acornea 3adisulfiram 3adrugs 3aemulsions 3aepithelium 3afluorescence 3alipids 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3azeta potential 0aLipid emulsions 0aOcta-arginine 0aDisulfiram 0aPermeability 0aMechanism 0aAnti-cataract1 aLan, Qi1 aHe, Wei1 aNie, Changlu1 aZhang, Chunjuan1 aXu, Tonghua1 aJiang, Tongying1 aWang, Siling0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 160 p.305-314dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.08.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012700168300001600295520176800311592002802079650002002107650001402127650001302141650001002154650002202164650001102186650001902197650002102216650001302237650001402250650001402264653003102278653001402309653002002323653001702343653002202360700002402382700002302406700002502429700002102454773010602475856008702581852000902668655001202677IND60583216520221121160812.0180914e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058321652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Lihui10aIn vitro evaluation of sunitinib loaded bioresorbable microspheres for potential application in arterial chemoembolization  ap. 705-711.  aDrug-loadable bioresorbable microspheres (BRMS) are designed for treating hypervascular tumors through chemoembolization, thereby reducing systemic side effects via controllable local delivery. The present study investigated the degradation and loading capability of bioresorbable microspheres with an anti-angiogenic agent, sunitinib, and then evaluated the release profiles in different media (PBS, 10μg/mL and 4mg/mL lysozyme solutions), and tested catheter deliverability as well as potential antiangiogenic effects of the loaded microspheres. The dry weight of the BRMS showed a consistent decrease over the period of incubation in a 10μg/mL lysozyme solution with 61.3% mass remaining on day 21. Sunitinib was loaded efficiently onto the microspheres, with smaller sizes exhibiting a slightly faster loading and release rate. At 2h, the loading percentages were 99.28%, 97.95%, and 94.39% for 100–300, 300–500, and 500–700μm microspheres, respectively. At 8h, the percentage of drug released were 78.4±5.8%, 71.7±0.3%, and 67.0±2.9% for 100–300, 300–500, and 500–700μm microspheres under static medium conditions, respectively. Under replacing-medium conditions, the presence of 10μg/mL lysozyme slightly delayed the drug release while 4mg/mL lysozyme significantly facilitated the drug release from the microspheres as compared with PBS solution. Confocal imaging revealed an even distribution of sunitinib throughout the microspheres. Drug loaded microspheres were delivered through microcatheters smoothly without any clogging. Sunitinib retained its efficacy at reducing the viability of human endothelial cells after elution from the microspheres. Thus, these bioresorbable microspheres are promising for arterial chemoembolization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acatheters 3acolloids 3adrugs 3aendothelial cells 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3ain vitro studies 3alysozyme 3aneoplasms 3aviability 0aBioresorbable microspheres 0aSunitinib 0aAnti-angiogenic 0aDrug release 0aChemoembolization1 aAkurati, Srilalitha1 aDonelson, Randy B.1 aRostamzadeh, Parinaz1 aGolzarian, Jafar0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 159 p.705-711dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013900169300001600308520123300324592002801557650001901585650001901604650001401623650002101637650001201658650001301670650001201683650001601695650001101711650003201722650001901754650001801773650000701791650001301798650001701811650001301828650001901841653002501860653002401885653001801909653002001927653001901947700001901966700001701985700001802002700001702020700001902037773010602056856008702162852000902249655001202258IND60583216720221121211725.0180914e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058321672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.08.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Song Yi10aFabrication of polymer matrix-free nanocomposites based on Angelica gigas Nakai extract and their application to breast cancer therapy  ap. 781-790.  aNanocomposites (NCs) based on the ethanol extract of Angelica gigas Nakai (AGN EtOH ext) were developed for breast cancer therapy. Polymer matrix-free nano-sized particles based on the extract of natural product were fabricated using a modified emulsification-solvent evaporation method. Without the use of polymer matrix, toxicity can be minimized and the clinical application may be assured. AGN NCs with approximately 200nm mean diameter, narrow size distribution, and negative zeta potential were prepared in this study. Sustained release of decursin (D) and decursinol angelate (DA) (as major components of AGN) from AGN NCs was observed at pH 7.4. Cellular accumulation efficiency and intracellular distribution of AGN NCs were evaluated in MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cells. According to the results of antiproliferation assay in MCF-7 cells, IC50 value of AGN NCs group (27.4±4.0μg/mL) was lower than that of AGN EtOH ext group (75.3±13.7μg/mL) (p<0.05). Also, the percentage of apoptotic events of AGN NCs group was significantly higher than that of AGN EtOH ext group (p<0.05). All these findings suggest that developed AGN NCs can be used as one of promising nanosystems for the therapy of breast cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngelica gigas 3aadenocarcinoma 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acolloids 3aethanol 3aevaporation 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolymers 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3azeta potential 0aAngelica gigas Nakai 0aAnticancer activity 0aBreast cancer 0aEthanol extract 0aNanocomposites1 aLee, Jeong-Jun1 aNam, Suyeong1 aKang, Wie-Soo1 aYoon, In-Soo1 aCho, Hyun-Jong0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 159 p.781-790dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.08.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012000158300001600278520168800294592002801982650001202010650001702022650001902039650001502058650001702073650001402090650001402104650001602118650001002134650002102144650002402165650001102189650001302200700002102213773014402234856007502378852000902453655001202462IND60539083720221122030845.0160815e20140108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053908372DNAL7 a10.1021/ja405614p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmacost, Kira10aExploring the Aldol Reaction using Catalytic Antibodies and “On Water” Organocatalysts from QM/MM Calculations  ap. 147-156.  aThe aldol reaction between benzaldehyde and acetone has been investigated using QM/MM Monte Carlo calculations and free-energy perturbation theory to determine the origin of the enhanced rates and enantioselectivities (% ee) derived from an enamine-based catalytic antibody 33F12 and a chiral organocatalyst. Electrostatic stabilization of the general acid/base TyrL36 by TrpH103, SerH100, and AsnL34 enabled the 33F12 active site to exclusively adopt an si-face benzaldehyde orientation for C–C bond formation with the LysH93-enamine. Whereas preorganization was responsible for the exclusive (S)-aldol product in the antibody, the organocatalyst featuring a chiral diphenyl amino alcohol moiety instead derived its preferred (R)-aldol product from an interplay between sterics and electronic stabilization. The si-face benzaldehyde conformation had unfavorable interactions with the organocatalyst in contrast to the re-face. Gas-phase calculations predicted a 73% ee; however, solution boosted the % ee values despite similar reaction geometries. An “on water” environment, defined as a reaction that proceeds in an aqueous organic emulsion, yielded a computed 94% ee (exptl 93% ee) compared to a calculated 87% ee in “neat” acetone (exptl 85% ee). Specific hydrogen bonding between the interfacial waters and an amide oxygen on the catalyst was found to control the % ee. A more compact si-face transition structure reduced solvent accessibility to the amide oxygen with a “closed state” steric barrier compared to an “open state” for the re-face. New insight into the synthetically important aldol reaction and state-of-the-art methodology is presented herein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aactive sites 3aamino alcohols 3aantibodies 3abenzaldehyde 3acatalysts 3aemulsions 3aenantiomers 3agases 3ahydrogen bonding 3amathematical theory 3aoxygen 3asolvents1 aAcevedo, Orlando0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Jan. 08, v. 136, no. 1 p.147-156dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja405614p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013200167300001600299520200500315592002802320650003002348650001702378650001002395650001402405650001202419650001602431650001802447650002002465650001402485650001202499650001902511650002602530650001102556650001902567650001902586650001802605650001402623650001802637650001302655650001302668650001402681653003002695653002802725653001902753653001902772653001502791653001102806700001702817773010502834856008502939852000903024655001203033IND60583217820221123033231.0190408e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058321782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Sun-Hwa12aA rapid screening method to assess soil algal toxicity: Non-destructive sampling of algal cells using culture medium extraction  ap. 143-152.  aPopulations of soil-living algae serve as important proxies for the level of metal toxicity in contaminated soils, therefore, there is a need for efficient bioassays to effectively monitor these populations. This study evaluated two approaches for the extraction of algal cells from soil for further analysis. One method employed direct solvent extraction of chlorophyll from the algae. A second method utilized indirect isolation of algal cells from culture media incubated for 24h. The utility of both methods was compared by estimating the relative viability of Chlorococcum infusionum and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grown in the presence of varying concentrations of Ni. The biomass of C. infusionum and C. reinhardtii decreased as a result of both extraction approaches. The direct extraction of algal chlorophyll with ethanol proved to be the simpler and more direct procedure; however, the process destroyed the cells and, therefore, only allowed for the measurement of a single endpoint. The indirect culture medium extraction was at least as sensitive as the direct extraction method in the measurement of chlorophyll, but allowed for the analysis of multiple endpoints. The culture medium method was used to characterize the biomass, photosynthetic activity, cell size, cell granularity, cell membrane permeability, and esterase activity of C. infusionum and C. reinhardtii to assess cell viability of cultures grown in increasing concentrations of Ni. Factors were measured by flow cytometry. Photosynthetic activity was inhibited, and cell size, membrane permeability, and esterase activity of C. reinhardtii were all affected when exposed to Ni-treated soil. This study demonstrated that the culture medium extraction method is preferable; allows for the analysis of multiple endpoints, such as photosynthetic and flow cytometric analyses of soil algae; has a shorter extraction period (24h); and can, therefore, be used as an efficient and effectively screening method for soil toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aChlorococcum 3aalgae 3abioassays 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3aethanol 3aflow cytometry 3amembrane permeability 3anickel 3aphotosynthesis 3apolluted soils 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3asoil toxicity 3asolvents 3atoxicity 3aviability 0aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 0aChlorococcum infusionum 0aFlow cytometry 0aPhotosynthesis 0aSoil algae 0aNickel1 aAn, Youn-Joo0 tApplied soil ecology.g2017 Nov., v. 120 p.143-152dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010000163500001400263520142200277592002801699650001901727650001101746650001501757650001101772650001701783650001501800650001401815650002301829650001501852650001901867650001501886650002001901650001201921650001001933650001601943650001001959651001401969700002401983700002802007700003102035700003102066773012202097856007502219852000902294655001202303IND60703494420221119133714.0200721e20200416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349442DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayatissa, Renuka 10aStable Iodine Nutrition During Two Decades of Continuous Universal Salt Iodisation in Sri Lanka  aNAL-light  aUniversal salt iodisation (USI) was introduced in Sri Lanka in 1995. Since then, four national iodine surveys have assessed the iodine nutrition status of the population. We retrospectively reviewed median urine iodine concentration (mUIC) and goitre prevalence in 16,910 schoolchildren (6–12 years) in all nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the mUIC of pregnant women, drinking-water iodine level, and the percentage of households consuming adequately (15 mg/kg) iodised salt (household salt iodine, HHIS). The mUIC of schoolchildren increased from 145.3 µg/L (interquartile range (IQR) = 84.6–240.4) in 2000 to 232.5 µg/L (IQR = 159.3–315.8) in 2016, but stayed within recommended levels. Some regional variability in mUIC was observed (178.8 and 297.3 µg/L in 2016). There was positive association between mUIC in schoolchildren and water iodine concentration. Goitre prevalence to palpation was a significantly reduced from 18.6% to 2.1% (p < 0.05). In pregnant women, median UIC increased in each trimester (102.3 (61.7–147.1); 217.5 (115.6–313.0); 273.1 (228.9–337.6) µg/L (p = 0.000)). We conclude that the introduction and maintenance of a continuous and consistent USI programme has been a success in Sri Lanka. In order to sustain the programme, it is important to retain monitoring of iodine status while tracking salt-consumption patterns to adjust the recommended iodine content of edible salt.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking water 3agoiter 3ahouseholds 3aiodine 3aiodized salt 3amonitoring 3anutrients 3anutritional status 3apopulation 3apregnant women 3aprevalence 3aschool children 3asurveys 3aurine 3avariability 3awater 3aSri Lanka1 aGorstein, Jonathan 1 aOkosieme, Onyebuchi  E.1 aLazarus, J.

Previous studies have shown a link between 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (vitamin D₃) concentration and liver disease. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been attributed to the inappropriate functioning of cell-mediated immunity. However, the effects of vitamin D₃, immune cell, and HBeAg status on HBV viral load in CHB patients are still unclear. We investigated the relationship between the serum concentration of vitamin D₃, percentage of immune cells in peripheral blood, and the HBV viral load of CHB patients. Sixty CHB patients were recruited, and their blood samples were collected and analyzed. Vitamin D level was measured using a chemiluminescence assay. A level of 30 ng/mL or above was defined as a vitamin D₃ sufficiency. We assigned vitamin D₃ status as either normal (≥30 ng/mL), insufficient (20–30 ng/mL), or deficient (<20 ng/mL). T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte surface markers in peripheral blood were detected using flow cytometry. The factors associated with HBV viral load were analyzed using univariate and multivariate-adjusted models. The mean serum vitamin D₃ concentration in the subjects was 20.9 ± 5.6 ng/mL. Up to 88.3% of the patients were either deficient in or had insufficient vitamin D₃. The gender, BMI, hepatitis B surface antigen levels, and ALT levels were significantly related to serum vitamin D₃ levels. Serum vitamin D₃ concentration, HBe status, HBs levels, ALT, and AST levels showed a statistically significant correlation with the HBV DNA levels. Serum vitamin D₃ concentrations and hepatitis B surface antigen levels were strongly correlated with HBV DNA levels. Vitamin D₃ levels were significantly associated with CD19 numbers (β:-6.2, 95% CI: -10.5). In multivariate analysis, vitamin D₃ levels in the deficient and insufficient groups, and the CD8, HBeAg, and WBC counts were significantly associated with HBV DNA levels. In the immune tolerance phase of HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection, vitamin D₃ may be a modulator of immune function via CD8, CD19, and HBV DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aHepatitis B virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acell-mediated immunity 3acholecalciferol 3achronic diseases 3achronic hepatitis B 3acorrelation 3aflow cytometry 3agender 3ahepatitis B antigens 3aimmune response 3aimmunosuppression 3ainfection 3aleukocyte count 3aluminescent assay 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3anutrients 3apatients 3aviral load1 aYang, Yen-Ping 1 aShen, Fang-Ping 1 aWu, Mu-Chen 1 aShih, Chia-Ju 1 aLu, Mei-Chun 1 aYan, Yuan-Horng 1 aChiou, Ya-Ling 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 16, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245019800167500001400365520148400379592002801863650001801891650001901909650001601928650002301944650001201967650001401979650001201993650002302005650002302028650001602051650001402067650001402081650001702095700002702112700002902139700002902168700002502197700002602222700002302248773012202271856007502393852000902468655001202477IND60703495120221119133812.0200721e20200417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349512DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoelho, Mariana  O.

Consumption of large boluses of nucleotides increases serum uric acid concentrations. We investigated the effect of a nucleotide-rich mixed meal on postprandial circulating uric acid, glucose, and insulin responses. Ten healthy adults participated in a randomised, controlled, double-blind, crossover trial in which they consumed a mixed-meal containing either nucleotide-depleted mycoprotein (L-NU) or high-nucleotide mycoprotein (H-NU) on two separate visits. Blood samples were collected in the postabsorptive state and throughout a 24 h postprandial period, and were used to determine circulating uric acid, glucose, and insulin concentrations. Mixed meal ingestion had divergent effects on serum uric acid concentrations across conditions (time x condition interaction; P < 0.001), with L-NU decreasing transiently (from 45 to 240 min postprandially) by ~7% (from 279 ± 16 to 257 ± 14 µmol·L⁻¹) and H-NU resulting in a ~12% increase (from 284 ± 13 to 319 ± 12 µmol·L⁻¹ after 210 min), remaining elevated for 12 h and returning to baseline concentrations after 24 h. There were no differences between conditions in blood glucose or serum insulin responses, nor in indices of insulin sensitivity. The ingestion of a nucleotide-rich mixed-meal increases serum uric acid concentrations for ~12 h, but does not influence postprandial blood glucose or serum insulin concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3across-over studies 3aglucose 3aingestion 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolic diseases 3anucleotides 3anutrients 3auric acid 3ayoung adults1 aMonteyne, Alistair  J.1 aKamalanathan, Ishara  D.1 aNajdanovic-Visak, Vesna 1 aFinnigan, Tim  J.

The effects of LF on bone formation at the metabolic level have been less explored. Urinary metabolic profiling of growing Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats LF-supplemented (1000 mg/kg bw) for four weeks were explored by Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The serum markers of bone formation and bone resorption, the bone mass, and the osteogenesis markers of femur were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, micro-computerized tomography, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Compared with the control, LF supplementation improved bone formation (p < 0.05), reduced bone resorption (p < 0.05), enhanced femoral bone mineral density and microarchitecture (p < 0.05), and upregulated osteocalcin, osterix, and Runx-2 expression (p < 0.05) of femur. LF upregulated 69 urinary metabolites. KEGG and pathway enrichment analyses of those urinary metabolites, and the Person’s correlation analyses among those urinary metabolites and bone status revealed that LF impacted on bone formation via regulatory comprehensive pathways including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The present study indicated the metabolomics is a useful and practical tool to elucidate the mechanisms by which LF augments bone mass formation in growing animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3abiosynthesis 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone formation 3abone health 3abone resorption 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afatty acids 3afemur 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alactoferrin 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anicotinamide 3anitrogen metabolism 3anutrients 3aosteocalcin 3aproline 3arats 3atandem mass spectrometry 3ataurine 3atomography1 aZhao, Tianyu 1 aRen, Haowei 1 aXie, Yindan 1 aAn, Jingjing 1 aShang, Jiaqi 1 aTabys, Dina 1 aLiu, Ning 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 17, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245005800163500001400221520120600235592002801441650001901469650001401488650002101502650001101523650002101534650002901555650001401584650001301598650001701611650001501628650001401643650001001657700002201667700002201689700002201711700002201733700002301755773012201778856007501900852000901975655001201984IND60703495320221119133434.0200721e20200417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349532DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUsai-Satta, Paolo 10aIrritable Bowel Syndrome and Gluten-Related Disorders  aNAL-light  aBackground: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently associated with celiac disease (CD) and nonceliac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS), but epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects are still unclear. Furthermore, a gluten-free diet (GFD) can positively influence IBS symptoms. Methods: A comprehensive online search for IBS related to CD, NCGS and GFD was made using the Pubmed, Medline and Cochrane databases. Results: Although a systematic screening for CD in IBS is not recommended, CD prevalence can be increased in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. On the other hand, IBS symptoms can be persistent in treated CD patients, and their prevalence tends to decrease on a GFD. IBS symptoms may overlap and be similar to those associated to nonceliac gluten and/or wheat sensitivity. Increased gut permeability could explain the gluten/wheat effects in IBS patients. Finally, a GFD could improve symptoms in a subgroup of IBS patients. Conclusions: The possible interplay between IBS and gluten-related disorders represents a scientifically and clinically challenging issue. Further studies are needed to confirm these data and better clarify the involved pathophysiological mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceliac disease 3adatabases 3adigestive system 3agluten 3agluten-free diet 3airritable bowel syndrome 3anutrients 3apatients 3apermeability 3aprevalence 3ascreening 3awheat1 aBassotti, Gabrio 1 aBellini, Massimo 1 aOppia, Francesco 1 aLai, Mariantonia 1 aCabras, Francesco 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 17, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012800172300001400300520112400314592002801438650003101466650002701497650002701524650001101551650004301562650002101605650002301626650001001649650001601659650002101675650001301696650001401709650002201723653003801745653001801783653003301801653003601834653001401870653003101884700002401915700002601939773010401965856008502069852000902154655001202163IND60583218820221120135447.0180831e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058321882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2017.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBond, Thomas E.H.12aA green fluorescent protein-based assay for high-throughput ligand-binding studies of a mycobacterial biotin protein ligase  ap. 35-39.  aBiotin protein ligase (BirA) has been identified as an emerging drug target in Mycobacterium tuberculosis due to its essential metabolic role. Indeed, it is the only enzyme capable of covalently attaching biotin onto the biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Despite recent interest in this protein, there is still a gap in cost-effective high-throughput screening assays for rapid identification of mycobacterial BirA-targeting inhibitors. We present for the first time the cloning, expression, purification of mycobacterial GFP-tagged BirA and its application for the development of a high-throughput assay building on the principle of differential scanning fluorimetry of GFP-tagged proteins. The data obtained in this study reveal how biotin and ATP significantly increase the thermal stability (ΔTm=+16.5°C) of M. tuberculosis BirA and lead to formation of a high affinity holoenzyme complex (Kobs=7.7nM). The new findings and mycobacterial BirA high-throughput assay presented in this work could provide an efficient platform for future anti-tubercular drug discovery campaigns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiotin 3abiotin-(acetyl-CoA-carboxylase) ligase 3achemical bonding 3acost effectiveness 3adrugs 3afluorometry 3aprotein subunits 3aproteins 3ascreening 3athermal stability 0aDifferential scanning fluorimetry 0aDSF-GTP assay 0aBiotin protein ligase (BirA) 0aGreen fluorescent protein (GFP) 0aIsoniazid 0aMycobacterium tuberculosis1 aSorenson, Alanna E.1 aSchaeffer, Patrick M.0 tMicrobiological research.g2017 Dec., v. 205 p.35-39dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2017.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012900161500001400290520127800304592002801582650001801610650002401628650001601652650001801668650001201686650001001698650001201708650001001720650001501730650001401745700002301759700001901782700001501801700002101816700002001837773012201857856007501979852000902054655001202063IND60703495820221119131723.0200721e20200417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349582DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshihara, Kengo 10aApplication of Continuous Glucose Monitoring for Assessment of Individual Carbohydrate Requirement during Ultramarathon Race  aNAL-light  aBackground: The current study intended to evaluate the feasibility of the application of continuous glucose monitoring to guarantee optimal intake of carbohydrate to maintain blood glucose levels during a 160-km ultramarathon race. Methods: Seven ultramarathon runners (four male and three female) took part in the study. The glucose profile was monitored continuously throughout the race, which was divided into 11 segments by timing gates. Running speed in each segment was standardized to the average of the top five finishers for each gender. Food and drink intake during the race were recorded and carbohydrate and energy intake were calculated. Results: Observed glucose levels ranged between 61.9–252.0 mg/dL. Average glucose concentration differed from the start to the end of the race (104 ± 15.0 to 164 ± 30.5 SD mg/dL). The total amount of carbohydrate intake during the race ranged from 0.27 to 1.14 g/kg/h. Glucose concentration positively correlated with running speeds in segments (P < 0.005). Energy and carbohydrate intake positively correlated with overall running speed (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring could be practical to guarantee optimal carbohydrate intake for each ultramarathon runner.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3acarbohydrate intake 3acorrelation 3aenergy intake 3afemales 3agates 3aglucose 3amales 3amonitoring 3anutrients1 aUchiyama, Natsuki 1 aKizaki, Shino 1 aMori, Emi 1 aNonaka, Tsutomu 1 aOneda, Hiroshi 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 17, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245007200155300001600227520073300243592002800976650002201004650001601026650001401042650001101056650001701067650002201084650001201106650001101118650001401129650002201143650000701165650001901172650001301191700001601204700001601220700002001236700002301256773012901279856007501408852000901483655001201492IND60539085320221120061658.0160815e20140108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053908532DNAL7 a10.1021/ja409267p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Teng12aA Biomimetic Copper Water Oxidation Catalyst with Low Overpotential  ap. 273-281.  aSimply mixing a Cu(II) salt and 6,6′-dihydroxy-2,2′-bipyridine (H₂L) in a basic aqueous solution afforded a highly active water oxidation catalyst (WOC). Cyclic voltammetry of the solution at pH = 12–14 shows irreversible catalytic current with an onset potential of ∼0.8 V versus NHE. Catalytic oxygen evolution takes place in controlled potential electrolysis at a relatively low overpotential of 640 mV. Experimental and computational studies suggest that the L ligand participates in electron transfer processes to facilitate the oxidation of the Cu center to lead to an active WOC with low overpotential, akin to the use of the tyrosine radical by Photosystem II to oxidize the CaMn₄ center for water oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomimetics 3acatalysts 3acopper 3aelectrolysis 3aelectron transfer 3aligands 3amixing 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3apH 3aphotosystem II 3atyrosine1 aWang, Cheng1 aLiu, Shubin1 aWang, Jin-Liang1 aLin, W.q(Wenbin),0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Jan. 08, v. 136, no. 1 p.273-281dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja409267p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245005100159300001400210520071100224592002800935650002400963650002300987650001701010650003301027650001801060650001901078650001301097650002401110700001801134700001401152700002601166700003001192700001701222773012701239856007501366852000901441655001201450IND60539085520170628000000.0160815e20140108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053908552DNAL7 a10.1021/ja409395y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrescher, Simon10aPolyelectrolyte as Solvent and Reaction Medium  ap. 12-15.  aA poly(ionic liquid) with a rather low glass transition temperature of −57°C was synthesized via free radical polymerization of an acrylate-type ionic liquid monomer.

FFA epoxides are quickly metabolized to biologically less active diols by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Inhibition of sEH, which increases EET levels, improves glucose homeostasis and CV health and is proposed as an effective strategy for the treatment of diabetes and CV diseases. Here, we show evidence that sEH activity is profoundly reduced in postprandial states in rats; plasma levels of 17 sEH products (i.e., FFA diols), detected by targeted oxylipin analysis, all decreased after a meal. In addition, the ratios of sEH product to substrate (sEH P/S ratios), which may reflect sEH activity, decreased ~70% on average 2.5 h after a meal in rats (P<.01). To examine whether this effect was mediated by insulin action, a hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp was performed for 2.5 h, and sEH P/S ratios were assessed before and after the clamp. The clamp resulted in small increases rather than decreases in sEH P/S ratios (P<.05), indicating that insulin cannot account for the postprandial decrease in sEH P/S ratios. Interestingly, in rats treated with antibiotics to deplete gut bacteria, the postprandial effect to decrease sEH P/S ratios was completely abolished, suggesting that a gut bacteria-derived factor(s) may be responsible for the effect. Further studies are warranted to identify such a factor(s) and elucidate the mechanism by which sEH activity (or sEH P/S ratio) is reduced in postprandial states.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibiotics 3adiabetes 3adigestive system 3aenzyme activity 3aepoxide hydrolase 3aepoxides 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3aglucose clamp technique 3aglycols 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aoxylipins 3arats 0aFFA epoxides 0aCardiovascular disease 0aOxylipin analysis 0aDietary potassium 0aDiabetes1 aOh, Young Taek1 aWan, Debin1 aWatanabe, Richard M.1 aHammock, Bruce D.1 aYoun, Jang H.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2017 Nov., v. 49 p.8-14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012900185300001800314520084800332592002801180650001201208650001001220650001801230650001301248650004101261650004001302650003301342650003801375650004301413650004101456650004801497650001701545650005601562650003001618650004201648650004801690650002501738650002801763700001801791700001901809700002501828700001901853773009601872856004801968852000902016655001202025IND4480987720221119172024.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448098772DNAL7 a213598502pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-011-9495-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirai, Tadayoshi10aUniform accumulation of recombinant miraculin protein in transgenic tomato fruit using a fruit-ripening-specific E8 promoter  ap. 1285-1292.  aThe E8 promoter, a tomato fruit-ripening-specific promoter, and the CaMV 35S promoter, a constitutive promoter, were used to express the miraculin gene encoding the taste-modifying protein in tomato. The accumulation of miraculin protein and mRNA was compared among transgenic tomatoes expressing the miraculin gene driven by these promoters. Recombinant miraculin protein predominantly accumulated in transgenic tomato lines using the E8 promoter (E8-MIR) only at the red fruit stage. The accumulations were almost uniform among all fruit tissues. When the 35S promoter (35S-MIR) was used, miraculin accumulation in the exocarp was much higher than in other tissues, indicating that the miraculin accumulation pattern can be regulated by using different types of promoters.

Sturgeon (Acipenser), an important fishery resource in China, contains an abundance of CS in their cartilage. In our previous study, we have extracted and purified CS from sturgeon cartilage. Herein, we further investigate the health benefits of sturgeon-derived chondroitin sulfate (SCS), especially for colorectal cancer treatment. The in vitro study indicated that SCS could inhibit the proliferation of the human colon cancer cell line HCT-116 in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with cell cycle arrest. In addition, SCS also led to extensive cellular apoptosis in colon cancer cell HCT-116 cells. Meanwhile, an in vivo study showed that SCS treatment significantly inhibited the tumor development of xenograft HCT-116 in mice via proliferation suppression and apoptosis induction. Further, a mechanistic study demonstrated that the apoptosis induction was mainly due to the activation of the Bcl-2 family-associated mitochondrial pathway. Overall, our results provided a basis for SCS as a promising agent against colon cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aapoptosis 3acartilage 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell lines 3achondroitin sulfate 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adose response 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3amice 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3anutrients 3asturgeon 3aChina1 aShang, Nan 1 aGui, Meng 1 aYin, Jian 1 aLi, Pinglan 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 17, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024004000115024004300155024001100198040001800209100001800227245010700245300001400352506017300366520128800539592002801827596004501855650001601900650002801916650001301944650001301957650002301970650002101993650002702014650002302041650001902064650001902083650001902102650001002121650001202131650001902143650002202162650002002184650001702204650001002221650002902231653002602260653002702286653001402313653001302327653002002340653001002360653000902370700001702379700001602396700002302412700002802435773009302463856008702556856011202643956009002755961000902845852000902854655001202863IND50072814320221123025743.0190408e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007281432DNAL7 a10113/583212hdl7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.11.0182doi7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.11.0182chorus8 ans3892  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Mingming10aAntimicrobial films and coatings for inactivation of Listeria innocua on ready-to-eat deli turkey meat  ap. 64-70.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aEdible antimicrobial coating solutions incorporating chitosan, lauric arginate ester (LAE) and nisin were developed to reduce foodborne pathogen contamination on ready-to-eat (RTE) meats. RTE deli meat samples were directly coated with the solutions, or treated with solution-coated polylactic acid (PLA) films. The antimicrobial efficacy of the coatings and films against Listeria innocua inoculated onto the surface of RTE meat samples was investigated. Antimicrobial coatings with 1.94 mg/cm2 of chitosan and 0.388 mg/cm2 of LAE reduced L. innocua by ca. 4.5 log CFU/cm2. Nisin (486 IU/cm2) showed less effectiveness than LAE (0.388 mg/cm2) and addition of nisin to the antimicrobial coatings or films containing LAE (0.388 mg/cm2) did not enhance the total antimicrobial effectiveness. Combining antimicrobial coatings or films with flash pasteurization (FP), which uses short burst of steam under pressure, further reduced L. innocua, achieving over a 5 log reduction. There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of antimicrobial films versus the coatings (p > 0.05). These data show the potential use of antimicrobial packaging alone, or in combination with FP, in preventing foodborne illness due to post-processing contamination of RTE meat products.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3aturkey meat 3abacterial contamination 3acoatings 3achitosan 3aready-to-eat foods 3aListeria innocua 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3afood contamination 3aluncheon meats 3afood packaging 3apasteurization 3asteam 3aturkeys 3afood pathogens 3afoodborne illness 3apolylactic acid 3aedible films 3anisin 3aantibacterial properties 0aAntimicrobial coating 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0apackaging 0aRTE meat 0aLauric arginate 0aNisin 0aFilm1 aJin, Tony Z.1 aWang, Luxin1 aScullen, O.

Nutritional abnormalities also have an impact on IPF clinical outcomes. Given the relevance of nutritional status in IPF patients, we sought to focus on some critical issues, highlighting what is known and what should be further learned about these issues. We revised scientific literature published between 1995 and August 2019 by searching on Medline/PubMed and EMBASE databases including observational and interventional studies. We conducted a narrative review on nutritional assessment in IPF, underlining the importance of nutritional evaluation not only in the diagnostic process, but also during follow-up. We also highlighted the need to keep a high level of attention on cardiovascular comorbidities. We also focused on current clinical treatment in IPF with Nintedanib and Pirfenidone and management of gastrointestinal adverse events, such as diarrhea, induced by these antifibrotic drugs. Finally, we concentrated on the importance of pulmonary rehabilitation program, including nutritional assessment, education and behavioral change, and psychological support among its essential components. More attention should be devoted to the assessment of the undernutrition and overnutrition, as well as of muscle strength and physical performance in IPF patients, taking also into account that an adequate clinical management of gastrointestinal complications makes IPF drug treatments more feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3abehavior change 3acomorbidity 3adatabases 3adiarrhea 3adrugs 3aeducation 3afibrosis 3agastrointestinal system 3ahypoxia 3ainflammation 3aliterature 3amalnutrition 3amuscle strength 3amuscles 3anutrients 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aresearch1 aBocchino, Marialuisa 1 aCaminati, Antonella 1 aFumagalli, Alessia 1 aGasbarra, Monica 1 aIovino, Paola 1 aPetruzzi, Alessandra 1 aScalfi, Luca 1 aSebastiani, Alfredo 1 aStanziola, Anna  Agnese1 aSanduzzi, Alessandro 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 17, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002300147245010300170500001500273520108200288592002801370650002501398650001701423650001701440650001501457650003001472650000801502650003001510650002001540650001101560650001101571650002201582653001701604653001001621700002201631700002301653773011701676852000901793856008401802655001201886IND4389847620221120155738.0181130s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438984762DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2007-0302-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOckels, Frances S.10aDesiccation at Ambient Temperature Effectively Preserves Plant Tissues Infected with Phytophthoras  a2019-12-06  aConventionally, plant samples collected in the course of field surveys for Phytophthora spp. (e.g., in the context of the US Forest Service-sponsored national P. ramorum survey of forest environments) are either processed immediately or stored at low temperatures and processed as soon as possible for detection by molecular methods. In order to extend the useful life of the sample, a method involving tissue desiccation was explored for effectively storing Phytophthora-infected plant leaves. In one experiment, rhododendron leaves inoculated with an unknown Phytophthora sp. and desiccated for seven days yielded DNA of sufficient quality for species identification via sequencing of the ITS region. In a second experiment, P. ramorum was successfully detected by PCR in inoculated leaves of California bay laurel, California buckeye, bigleaf maple, rhododendron, and viburnum that were desiccated and stored at room temperature for four months. Therefore, desiccation might be a viable, reliable, and less expensive alternative to storing foliar samples at low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3aRhododendron 3aforest trees 3aextraction 3afungal diseases of plants 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3afoliar diseases 3adrying 3aleaves 3adisease diagnosis 0aPhytophthora 0atrees1 aDiLeo, Matthew V.1 aBonello, Pierluigi0 tPlant health progress.g2007, v. 8, no. 1dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2007-0302-01-RS3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02810naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013800157500001400295520144600309592002801755650002401783650001301807650000901820650001901829650001601848650002001864650000901884650002401893650002101917650001201938650001501950650001401965650002101979650004002000650001802040650001402058650000902072650002202081650002102103700002202124773012202146856007502268852000902343655001202352IND60703497120221119131449.0200721e20200417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349712DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDicks, Lisa 10aEffect of the Intake of Oyster Mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) on Cardiometabolic Parameters—A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials  aNAL-light  aCardiometabolic diseases are a leading global health challenge. Their incidence as well as progression is strongly affected by diet. Consumption of Pleurotus ostreatus (P. ostreatus), an edible oyster mushroom rich in functional ingredients (e.g., β-glucans), may improve glucose and lipid metabolism, blood pressure, body weight and appetite sensations. Hence, this systematic review aimed to provide an overview on the effects of P. ostreatus intake on cardiometabolic parameters from clinical trials, taking into account risk of bias (RoB). Relevant studies were investigated for details with consideration of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool was used to assess the RoB. In total, eight trials included observed beneficial effects of P. ostreatus intake on glucose metabolism (reduction in fasting and/or 2 h postprandial glucose) and lipids (decrease in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and/or triglycerides), and some found a reduction in blood pressure. In contrast, body weight did not change. Appetite sensations were not assessed. In most studies, the RoB was high or unclear due to methodological weaknesses and/or inadequate reporting. Thus, P. ostreatus intake may improve cardiometabolic health, but evidence for this is low. Hence, further clinical trials with an adequate study design are warranted to validate these suggestions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aappetite 3abias 3ablood pressure 3abody weight 3aclinical trials 3adiet 3aexperimental design 3afunctional foods 3aglucose 3aguidelines 3aincidence 3alipid metabolism 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ameta-analysis 3anutrients 3arisk 3asystematic review 3atriacylglycerols1 aEllinger, Sabine 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 17, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03771naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010200170300001600272520246300288592002802751650002402779650002502803650001202828650001502840650001402855650002002869650002502889650001002914650001902924650002602943650001202969650001702981650001902998650002003017651000903037653003303046653001803079653002003097700001903117773009503136856008503231852000903316655001203325IND60583220620221120164927.0180831e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAleluia, João,10aAssessing the costs of municipal solid waste treatment technologies in developing Asian countries  ap. 592-608.  aThe management of municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the main costs incurred by local authorities in developing countries. According to some estimates, these costs can account for up to 50% of city government budgets. It is therefore of importance that policymakers, urban planners and practitioners have an adequate understanding of what these costs consist of, from collection to final waste disposal. This article focuses on a specific stage of the MSW value chain, the treatment of waste, and it aims to identify cost patterns associated with the implementation and operation of waste treatment approaches in developing Asian countries. An analysis of the capital (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) of a number of facilities located in countries of the region was conducted based on a database gathering nearly 100 projects and which served as basis for assessing four technology categories: composting, anaerobic digestion (AD), thermal treatment, and the production of refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Among these, it was found that the least costly to invest, asa function of the capacity to process waste, are composting facilities, with an average CAPEX per ton of 21,493 USD2015/ton. Conversely, at the upper end featured incineration plants, with an average CAPEX of 81,880 USD2015/ton, with this treatment approach ranking by and large as the most capital intensive of the four categories assessed. OPEX figures of the plants, normalized and analyzed in the form of OPEX/ton, were also found to be higher for incineration than for biological treatment methods, although on this component differences amongst the technology groups were less pronounced than those observed for CAPEX. While the results indicated the existence of distinct cost implications for available treatment approaches in the developing Asian context, the analysis also underscored the importance of understanding the local context asa means to properly identify the cost structure of each specific plant. Moreover, even though CAPEX and OPEX figures are important elements to assess the costs of a waste treatment system, these should not be considered on a standalone basis for decision making purposes. In complement to this internal cost dimension, the broader impacts – to the economy, society and the environment – resulting from the adoption of a certain treatment approach should be properly understood and, ideally, measured and expressed in monetary terms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiological treatment 3acapital 3acomposting 3adatabases 3adecision making 3adeveloping countries 3afuels 3aheat treatment 3amunicipal solid waste 3asociety 3asupply chain 3awaste disposal 3awaste treatment 3aAsia 0aWaste treatment technologies 0aCost analysis 0aDeveloping Asia1 aFerrão, Paulo0 tWaste management.g2017 Nov., v. 69 p.592-608dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245013300173500001400306520135100320592002801671650001501699650001201714650001401726650002401740650001401764650001901778650001901797700003101816700002601847700003801873700002701911700002801938773012201966856007502088852000902163655001202172IND60703497420221119131624.0200721e20200418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349742DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Gómez, Elisabet 10aContent Validation through Expert Judgement of an Instrument on the Nutritional Knowledge, Beliefs, and Habits of Pregnant Women  aNAL-light  aThe aim of this study was to conduct content validation through expert judgement of an instrument which explores the nutritional knowledge, beliefs, and habits during pregnancy. This is a psychometric study in which 14 experts participated in the evaluation of each of the questionnaire items, which were divided into two blocks according to the characteristics of sufficiency, clarity, coherence, and relevance. Fleiss’ κ statistic was used to measure strength of agreement. A pre-test with 102 participants was conducted to measure the degree of understandability of the instrument. The strength of agreement obtained for each of the dimensions was almost perfect. For each pair of experts, strength of agreement ranged between substantial and almost perfect. Sufficiency was the characteristic of the questionnaire that obtained the highest values in the two blocks, and was also the most statistically significant (p < 0.001). Coherence was the most statistically significant characteristic in the first block (p = 0.030). Clarity was the most statistically significant characteristic in the second block (p = 0.037). The wording of five of the twenty original items was corrected. The new version of the instrument attained a high degree of understandability. The results suggest that the instrument is valid and may therefore be applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3adimensions 3aexperts 3anutrients 3anutrition knowledge 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aquestionnaires1 aMartín-Salvador, Adelina 1 aLuque-Vara, Trinidad 1 aSánchez-Ojeda, María  Angustias1 aNavarro-Prado, Silvia 1 aEnrique-Mirón, Carmen 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 18, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011400171500002200285520134500307592002801652650001501680650001501695650003001710650001801740650001401758650001301772653003201785653001601817653001401833653003201847653003101879700002401910700002101934700002701955700002401982773007302006856008202079852000902161655001202170IND60583220820221120184618.0171008s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugumaran, Sathish10aNanostructured materials with plasmonic nanobiosensors for early cancer detection: a past and future prospect  aPre-press version  aEarly cancer detection and treatment is an emerging and fascinating field of plasmonic nanobiosensor research. It paves to enrich a life without affecting living cells leading to a possible survival of the patient. This review describes a past and future prospect of an integrated research field on nanostructured metamaterials, microwave transmission, surface plasmonic resonance, nanoantennas, and their manifested versatile properties with nano-biosensors towards early cancer detection to preserve human health. Interestingly, (i) microwave transmission shows more advantages than other electromagnetic radiation in reacting with biological tissues, (ii) nanostructured metamaterial (Au) with special properties like size and shape can stimulate plasmonic effects, (iii) plasmonic based nanobiosensors are to explore the efficacy for early cancer tumour detection or single molecular detection and (iv) nanoantenna wireless communication by using microwave inverse scattering nanomesh (MISN) technique instead of conventional techniques can be adopted to characterize the microwave scattered signals from the biomarkers. It reveals that the nanostructured material with plasmonic nanobiosensor paves a fascinating platform towards early detection of cancer tumour and is anticipated to be exploited as a magnificent field in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3ananomaterials 3aneoplasms 3apatients 0aNanostructured metamaterial 0aNanoantenna 0aMicrowave 0aSurface Plasmonic Resonance 0acancer biomarkers/proteins1 aJamlos, Mohd Faizal1 aAhmad, Mohd Noor1 aBellan, Chandar Shekar1 aSchreurs, Dominique0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008600160300001400246520080400260592002801064650002301092650002801115650002101143650001301164700002101177700002501198700002201223773012701245856007501372852000901447655001201456IND60539086820170629000000.0160815e20140108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053908682DNAL7 a10.1021/ja410467e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirkman, Paul M.10aSpatial and Temporal Control of the Diazonium Modification of sp2 Carbon Surfaces  ap. 36-39.  aInterest in the controlled chemical functionalization of sp² carbon materials using diazonium compounds has been recently reignited, particularly as a means to generate a band gap in graphene. We demonstrate local diazonium modification of pristine sp² carbon surfaces, with high control, at the micrometer scale through the use of scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). Electrochemically driven diazonium patterning is investigated at a range of driving forces, coupled with surface analysis using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. We highlight how the film density, level of sp²/sp³ rehybridization and the extent of multilayer formation can be controlled, paving the way for the use of localized electrochemistry as a route to controlled diazonium modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene1 aGüell, Aleix G.1 aCuharuc, Anatolii S.1 aUnwin, Patrick R.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Jan. 08, v. 136, no. 1 p.36-39dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja410467e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015700158300001600315520155100331592002801882650002201910650002101932650001601953650001401969650001101983650001201994700002002006700001402026700001802040700001702058700001502075700001802090700001702108700001702125700001602142773012902158856007502287852000902362655001202371IND60539086920221119184525.0160815e20140108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053908692DNAL7 a10.1021/ja410485g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yunfang,10aPalladium-Catalyzed Meta-Selective C–H Bond Activation with a Nitrile-Containing Template: Computational Study on Mechanism and Origins of Selectivity  ap. 344-355.  aDensity functional theory investigations have elucidated the mechanism and origins of meta-regioselectivity of Pd(II)-catalyzed C–H olefinations of toluene derivatives that employ a nitrile-containing template. The reaction proceeds through four major steps: C–H activation, alkene insertion, β-hydride elimination, and reductive elimination. The C–H activation step, which proceeds via a concerted metalation–deprotonation (CMD) pathway, is found to be the rate- and regioselectivity-determining step. For the crucial C–H activation, four possible active catalytic speciesmonomeric Pd(OAc)₂, dimeric Pd₂(OAc)₄, heterodimeric PdAg(OAc)₃, and trimeric Pd₃(OAc)₆have been investigated. The computations indicated that the C–H activation with the nitrile-containing template occurs via a Pd–Ag heterodimeric transition state. The nitrile directing group coordinates with Ag while the Pd is placed adjacent to the meta-C–H bond in the transition state, leading to the observed high meta-selectivity. The Pd₂(OAc)₄ dimeric mechanism also leads to the meta-C–H activation product but with higher activation energies than the Pd–Ag heterodimeric mechanism. The Pd monomeric and trimeric mechanisms require much higher activation free energies and are predicted to give ortho products. Structural and distortion energy analysis of the transition states revealed significant effects of distortions of the template on mechanism and regioselectivity, which provided hints for further developments of new templates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3achemical bonding 3amethodology 3apalladium 3asilver 3atoluene1 aCheng, Gui-Juan1 aLiu, Peng1 aLeow, Dasheng1 aSun, Tian-Yu1 aChen, Ping1 aZhang, Xinhao1 aYu, Jin-Quan1 aWu, Yun-Dong1 aHouk, K.

Olive oil production involves the generation of an aqueous phase defined as olive mill wastewater (OMWW), a polluting effluent rich in soluble polyphenols. Here, we assessed the cancer preventive properties exerted by a purified extract of OMWW (A009) for its activity on lung cancer cell lines. Hydroxytyrosol, the most abundant polyphenol present in our A009 extracts, was used as reference molecule in the assays performed. Extracts from OMWW from two different olive oil cultivars were used. We found that the A009 extracts limit lung cancer cell proliferation in a dose and time dependent manner. These effects were associated with the induction of apoptosis. A009 extracts were effective in inhibiting adhesion capabilities on a fibronectin layer accompanied with a reduction in their ability to generate invasive sprouts in a Matrigel layer. The production of chemokine CXCL12 and CXCR4 receptor were reduced by treatment with the extracts. Also, A009 interfered with the production of proangiogenic and pro-inflammatory VEGF, CXCL8, and CCL2 (as detected by FACS analysis) in the lung cell lines. A009 extracts were able to decrease STAT3 phosphorylation in lung cancer cells. Our results show that A009 extracts reduced activities related to tumor cell behavior in lung cancer cell lines, suggesting that they could have a potential cancer preventive role.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCXCR4 receptor 3aadhesion 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aassays 3abehavior 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3achemokine CXCL12 3acultivars 3adosage 3aextracts 3afibronectins 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3aneoplasm cells 3anutrients 3aolive mill wastewater 3aolive oil 3aphosphorylation 3apolyphenols1 aFesta, Marco 1 aCorradino, Paola 1 aSansone, Clementina 1 aAlbini, Adriana 1 aNoonan, Douglas  M.0 tNutrients.g2020 Mar. 26, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120409033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147245013100166500001500297520054600312592002800858650001800886650003000904650001200934650002000946650002400966650002100990650001801011650002101029650001001050651001501060653002501075653001301100700002201113700001301135773011701148852000901265856008401274655001201358IND4389848020221120155737.0181130s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438984802DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2007-0219-01-BR2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarbelotto, M.10aFirst Report of Fusarium circinatum, Causal Agent of Pitch Canker Disease, from the Roots of Mature Aleppo Pines in California  a2019-12-06  aA rapid decline of Aleppo pines was observed in the parking lot of the Legoland amusement park in San Diego Co., CA.

MIPs-based ECBSs attract much attention in medical diagnose, biological analysis, environmental monitoring, food safety evaluation, etc. Due to the capacity of highly specific recognition for target biomolecules, MIPs-based ECBSs have been smartly designed and extensively used for electrochemical sensing applications in recent years, exhibiting obvious superiority over other analytical techniques. In this review, firstly we systematically summarize the recent advances of MIPs-based ECBSs reported in recent years, referring to the preparation, structures and components of sensing systems. Secondly, we highlight the sensing applications for various significant biomolecules (proteins, antibiotics, pesticide, neurotransmitter, hormone, etc.), and demonstrate the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Finally, the rational summaries, present challenges and future prospects in the field of MIPs-based ECBSs have been discussed reasonably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afood safety 3amolecular imprinting 3aneurotransmitters 3apesticides 3apolymers 3aproteins 0aMolecularly imprinted polymers 0aElectrochemical sensors 0aBiosensors 0aBiomolecules1 aJin, Hui1 aGuo, Huijun1 aWang, Zonghua0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 100 p.56-70dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011000173300001600283520161800299592002801917650001801945650001401963650000901977650001301986650002501999650001302024650001502037650001802052650001902070650001602089650001502105650001202120650000902132650001902141650004302160650001302203650002102216650001302237651001102250653001802261653001002279653000902289653002102298653001202319653003202331700002202363700001402385700001502399700002102414700001802435700002502453700002302478773009502501856008702596852000902683655001202692IND60583221820221122003028.0200509e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.07.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaaum, Amanda M.10aComplementary molecular methods detect undeclared species in sausage products at retail markets in Canada  ap. 339-344.  aAccurate food labelling is of utmost importance for food safety and consumer choice in the food chain. Complete or partial substitution, whether intentional or unintentional, may introduce food pathogens or allergens to a product or affect personal or religious beliefs. Several studies around the world have reported different degrees of species substitution in meat products but no similar studies have been conducted in the Canadian market for sausage products. In this study, 100 raw meat sausage samples that were labelled as single meat species products (beef, pork, chicken or turkey) were collected from retail establishments across Canada and were surveyed for the presence of a panel of non-labeled species. The predominant meat species were determined using DNA barcoding and contaminant or unclaimed meat species were detected using digital droplet PCR using species specific primers and probes. All samples were also tested for presence of horse meat using real-time PCR. All samples contained the predominant species matching the label species except for five turkey sausage samples which contained chicken as the predominant species. Second, this analysis showed that 6% of beef sausages also contained pork, 20% of chicken sausages contained turkey while 5% contained beef, and 5% of pork sausages also contained beef. Five samples labeled as turkey sausage contained no turkey and one pork sample was found to contain horse meat. The overall mislabeling rate detected in this study was 20% and the results provide a baseline for assessing species mislabeling in processed meat products in Canada.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aallergens 3abeef 3achickens 3aconsumer preferences 3adroplets 3afood chain 3afood labeling 3afood pathogens 3afood safety 3ahorse meat 3amarkets 3apork 3aprocessed meat 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araw meat 3aretail marketing 3asausages 3aCanada 0aDNA barcoding 0addPCR 0aqPCR 0aMeat mislabeling 0aSausage 0aMeat species quantification1 aShehata, Hanan R.1 aChen, Shu1 aLi, Jiping1 aTabujara, Nicole1 aAwmack, David1 aLutze-Wallace, Cyril1 aHanner, Robert H.,0 tFood control.g2018 Feb., v. 84 p.339-344dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.07.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010300174300001600277520163600293592002801929650001501957650002901972650002202001650001602023650003802039650000902077650002002086650001802106650001502124650001802139650001002157650001602167653001602183653001002199653002702209653002202236653004102258700002102299700001802320700002102338700001902359773009502378856008702473852000902560655001202569IND60583222020221122223833.0200509e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendrickson, O.D.10aUltrasensitive magnetic ELISA of zearalenone with pre-concentration and chemiluminescent detection  ap. 330-338.  aIn this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) based on magnetic iron nanoparticles (MNPs) was developed. Highly dispersed MNPs used as carriers to immobilize anti-ZEN antibodies allowed the immunoassay to be carried out in a pseudo-homogeneous mode through the rapid formation of immune complexes in the reaction media, their separation by a magnetic field, and the heterogeneous detection of the bound peroxidase label. The traditional colorimetric substrate of a peroxidase label was changed to a highly sensitive chemiluminescent one for the detection of specific complexes’ formation. The developed analysis consisted of two main stages: first, the interaction of MNP-based immunosorbent with free ZEN in a large-volume sample and its transfer to a smaller volume (preliminary concentration of the analyte) and then binding with ZEN–peroxidase complexes. A proposed novel combination of a 50-fold pre-concentration of ZEN with chemiluminescence detection allows for the determination of zearalenone with the detection limit of 4 pg/mL. Therefore, more than an order of magnitude increase of the assay sensitivity was achieved compared with the same assay format with colorimetric detection (0.06 ng/mL) or chemiluminescent MNP–ELISA without a pre-concentration of the analyte (0.1 ng/mL). The analysis was validated for the determination of zearalenone in wine. An assay based on magnetic concentration and chemiluminescent detection can be proposed as a universal analytical tool for the rapid assessment of food contamination by mycotoxins and other hazardous substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigen-antibody complex 3achemiluminescence 3acolorimetry 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3airon 3amagnetic fields 3ananoparticles 3aperoxidase 3arapid methods 3awines 3azearalenone 0aZearalenone 0aELISA 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aPre-concentration 0aChemiluminescent peroxidase reaction1 aChertovich, J.O.1 aZherdev, A.V.1 aSveshnikov, P.G.1 aDzantiev, B.B.0 tFood control.g2018 Feb., v. 84 p.330-338dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017600158500001400334520137300348592002801721650001401749650001601763650003001779650002401809650001501833650001301848650001201861650001201873650001501885650001001900650001301910650001501923650001701938650001901955650000901974650001001983650004001993650001402033650002902047650001302076650001702089650001502106650001702121650001202138650001402150650001602164700002002180700002002200700001802220773012202238856007502360852000902435655001202444IND60703498620221119133522.0200721e20200419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349862DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hee-Jin 14aThe Different Relationship between Homocysteine and Uric Acid Levels with Respect to the MTHFR C677T Polymorphism According to Gender in Patients with Cognitive Impairment  aNAL-light  aIn an elderly population with cognitive impairment, we investigated the association between serum uric acid (sUA) and serum homocysteine (sHcy), known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. We also investigated the potential effect of the C677T polymorphism in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) to the sUA level in different dementia types. Participants underwent a battery of tests including measurements of sUA, sHcy, folic acid, and vitamin B12 as well as genotyping of the MTHFR locus. Data from 861 subjects (597 females to 264 males) were retrospectively analyzed. Subjects with hyperhomocysteinemia had lower serum folic acid and vitamin B12 and higher sUA than those with normal sHcy. sUA was significantly associated with serum creatinine, HbA1c, and sHcy regardless of gender. The TT genotype was found to be associated with hyperhomocysteinemia in both genders (p = 0.001). The levels of hyperlipidemia, sHcy, and sUA differed according to dementia subtypes. High sUA were associated with hyperhomocystenemia in TT genotype only in dementia with vascular lesion. This study reveals that sUA is positively associated with sHcy. We speculate that the two markers synergistically increase cerebrovascular burden and suggested that dietary intervention for sUA and sHcy would be helpful for cognitive decline with vascular lesion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3ablood serum 3acerebrovascular disorders 3acognitive disorders 3acreatinine 3adementia 3aelderly 3afemales 3afolic acid 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahomocysteine 3ahyperlipidemia 3aloci 3amales 3amethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 3anutrients 3anutritional intervention 3apatients 3apolymorphism 3apopulation 3arisk factors 3atesting 3auric acid 3avitamin B121 aSohn, Il  Woong1 aKim, Young  Seo1 aJun, Jae-Bum 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 19, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04281naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003100135040001800166100001300184245009300197300001200290506007600302520281300378592002803191506003703219650003403256650001503290650001203305650001403317650002803331650001103359650002503370650001703395650001703412650001503429650001103444650002003455650002503475650000703500650002103507650001303528650001103541650001203552650002203564700001203586700001203598773010003610856004403710852000903754655001203763IND50062924820221207114412.0140121e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006292482DNAL7 a233567962pmid7 aPMC35634902pmcid7 a10.1186/1754-6834-6-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, ZJ10aLignosulfonate and elevated pH can enhance enzymatic saccharification of lignocelluloses  ap. 229.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Nonspecific (nonproductive) binding (adsorption) of cellulase by lignin has been identified as a key barrier to reduce cellulase loading for economical sugar and biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. Sulfite Pretreatment to Overcome Recalcitrance of Lignocelluloses (SPORL) is a relatively new process, but demonstrated robust performance for sugar and biofuel production from woody biomass especially softwoods in terms of yields and energy efficiencies. This study demonstrated the role of lignin sulfonation in enhancing enzymatic saccharification of lignocelluloses – lignosulfonate from SPORL can improve enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses, contrary to the conventional belief that lignin inhibits enzymatic hydrolysis due to nonspecific binding of cellulase. RESULTS: The study found that lignosulfonate from SPORL pretreatment and from a commercial source inhibits enzymatic hydrolysis of pure cellulosic substrates at low concentrations due to nonspecific binding of cellulase. Surprisingly, the reduction in enzymatic saccharification efficiency of a lignocellulosic substrate was fully recovered as the concentrations of these two lignosulfonates increased. We hypothesize that lignosulfonate serves as a surfactant to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis at higher concentrations and that this enhancement offsets its inhibitive effect from nonspecific binding of cellulase, when lignosulfonate is applied to lignocellulosic solid substrates. Lignosulfonate can block nonspecific binding of cellulase by bound lignin on the solid substrates, in the same manner as a nonionic surfactant, to significantly enhance enzymatic saccharification. This enhancement is linearly proportional to the amount of lignosulfonate applied which is very important to practical applications. For a SPORL-pretreated lodgepole pine solid, 90% cellulose saccharification was achieved at cellulase loading of 13 FPU/g glucan with the application of its corresponding pretreatment hydrolysate coupled with increasing hydrolysis pH to above 5.5 compared with only 51% for the control run without lignosulfonate at pH 5.0. The pH-induced lignin surface modification at pH 5.5 further reduced nonspecific binding of cellulase by lignosulfonate. CONCLUSIONS: The results reported in this study suggest significant advantages for SPORL-pretreatment in terms of reducing water usage and enzyme dosage, and simplifying process integration, i.e., it should eliminate washing of SPORL solid fraction for direct simultaneous enzymatic saccharification and combined fermentation of enzymatic and pretreatment hydrolysates (SSCombF). Elevated pH 5.5 or higher, rather than the commonly believed optimal and widely practiced pH 4.8-5.0, should be used in conducting enzymatic saccharification of lignocelluloses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenergy 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afermentation 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3alignosulfonates 3anonionic surfactants 3apH 3asaccharification 3asoftwood 3asugars 3awashing 3awater utilization1 aLan, TQ1 aZhu, JY0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.229-229dSpringer-Verlagx1754-68347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-6-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245021000171300001600381520119400397592002801591650002401619650002901643650002501672650001701697650001201714650001301726650001301739650001001752650002001762650001501782650001701797650001901814650001201833650004101845650001101886650001801897650001801915650002701933650001501960650002101975650004401996650001902040653001902059653001902078653002502097653001702122653002502139653003002164653003402194653003802228653003702266653003002303653006102333653004702394700002002441700001702461773009502478856008702573852000902660655001202669IND60583222120221121024957.0200509e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoori, Soheila10aAntimicrobial and antioxidant efficiency of nanoemulsion-based edible coating containing ginger (Zingiber officinale) essential oil and its effect on safety and quality attributes of chicken breast fillets  ap. 312-320.  aNanoemulsion-based edible sodium caseinate coating containing ginger essential oil (GEO) (3 and 6% wt) was applied onto chicken breast fillet to extend its shelf life. GC-MS analysis showed that the most components of GEO were α-zingiberene (24.96%) and then β-sesquiphellandrene (12.74%). Comparison between conventional emulsion and nanoemulsion-based coatings was applied by particle size, polydispersity index and ζ-potential analyses. Antibacterial potential of active coatings was more than their antioxidant activity and it was significantly (p < 0.05) increased when nanoemulsion was fabricated. Nanoemulsion based edible coatings with 6% of GEO nanoemulsion caused to significant decrease of total aerobic psychrophilic bacteria of refrigerated chicken fillets during 12 days. The effect of GEO on TBARS levels of fillets was not significant. The lowest color difference and cooking loss were obtained for nanoemulsion coated samples. The highest total acceptance was recorded for coated fillets with 6% of GEO nanoemulsion during storage. Generally the GEO nanoemulsion was more effective than its conventional emulsion in extending the durability of chicken breast fillets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZingiber officinale 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abreasts 3achickens 3acoatings 3acolor 3acooking quality 3adurability 3aedible films 3aessential oils 3afillets 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aginger 3ananoemulsions 3aparticle size 3apsychrophilic bacteria 3ashelf life 3asodium caseinate 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3azeta potential 0aChicken breast 0aEdible coating 0aGinger essential oil 0aNanoemulsion 0aShelf life extension 0aGlycerol PubChem CID: 753 0aTween 80 PubChem CID: 5281955 0aChloramphenicol PubChem CID: 5959 0aGentamicin C1 PubChem CID: 72395 0aMethanol PubChem CID: 887 0a2,2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) PubChem CID: 74358 0a2-thiobarbituric acid PubChem CID: 27236281 aZeynali, Fariba1 aAlmasi, Hadi0 tFood control.g2018 Feb., v. 84 p.312-320dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245013600181300001600317520167300333592002802006650002702034650002302061650002502084650002902109650001002138650001702148650001702165650002602182650002002208650001302228650002402241650001502265650000902280650001802289650001602307653002502323653002702348653001502375653001802390653002602408700001902434700001902453700001902472773009502491856008702586852000902673655001202682IND60583222220221122223729.0200509e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJosewin, Sherrill Wesley10aAntibacterial effect of 460 nm light-emitting diode in combination with riboflavin against Listeria monocytogenes on smoked salmon  ap. 354-361.  aThis study investigated the antibacterial effect of a 460 nm light emitting diode (LED) in combination with riboflavin on the inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes on smoked salmon. The influence of irradiance and temperature on this inactivation was examined. Smoked salmon fillets, surface-inoculated with a 4-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes and topically administered with 25, 50 and 100 μM riboflavin, were illuminated by 460 nm LEDs at three different irradiances (15, 31 and 58 mW/cm²) and two temperatures (4 and 12 °C). Three conceptually different mathematical models - log-linear, modified Weibull and reduced Baranyi were used to fit the inactivation curves. The color of smoked salmon was also monitored during the illumination. A dosage of 2.4 kJ/cm² LED illumination in combination with riboflavin caused 0.7–1.2 log CFU//cm² reductions of L. monocytogenes at all irradiances and temperatures. Three-way ANOVA showed that all the three variables significantly influenced the inactivation of L. monocytogenes (P < 0.05). Significant interaction was observed between concentration and irradiance at 12 °C. Mathematical modeling suggested that the Weibull as well as the Baranyi model best fitted the inactivation curve and thus the Weibull model was subsequently used to compute the dose required for the first log reduction (δ). In most cases, the combination of LEDs and riboflavin was more effective than either treatment alone. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of 460 nm LEDs aided by riboflavin to minimize the risk of L. monocytogenes associated with smoked salmon during storage at food establishments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aWeibull statistics 3aanalysis of variance 3aantibacterial properties 3acolor 3afish fillets 3afood service 3alight emitting diodes 3alight intensity 3alighting 3amathematical models 3ariboflavin 3arisk 3asmoked salmon 3atemperature 0aLight emitting diode 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aRiboflavin 0aSmoked salmon 0aMathematical modeling1 aGhate, Vinayak1 aKim, Min-Jeong1 aYuk, Hyun-Gyun0 tFood control.g2018 Feb., v. 84 p.354-361dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245009200163500001400255520192400269592002802193650001302221650001402234650000802248650002002256650001502276650001202291650002302303650001702326650001102343650001902354650002002373650001802393650000902411650001602420650001402436650003102450650001602481650001002497700002202507700002402529700002502553700002202578700002802600700002402628700002102652700002302673773012202696856007502818852000902893655001202902IND60703499020221119133723.0200721e20200420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349902DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilmore, Linda  A.10aModifications to Infant Formula Instructions Improve the Accuracy of Formula Dispensing  aNAL-light  aReadability of infant formula preparation instructions is universally poor, which may result in inaccurate infant feeding. Given that inaccurate formula dispensing can lead to altered infant growth and increased adiposity, there is an increased need for easy to follow instructions for formula preparation. We hypothesize that altering infant formula instruction labels using feedback from iterative focus groups will improve the preparation accuracy of powdered infant formula in a randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited from the community, 18 years of age or older, willing to disclose demographic information for focus group matching, and willing to participate freely in the first (n = 21) or second (n = 150) phase of the study. In the second phase, participants were randomized to use the standard manufacturer instructions or to use the modified instructions created in the first phase. Accuracy was defined as the percent error between manufacturer-intended powder formula quantity and the amount dispensed by the participant. Participants who were assigned to the modified instructions were able to dispense the powdered formula more accurately than participants who used the standard manufacturer instructions (-0.67 ± 0.76 vs. -4.66 ± 0.74% error; p < 0.0001). Accuracy in powdered formula dispensing was influenced by bottle size (p = 0.02) but not by body mass index (p = 0.17), education level (p = 0.75), income (p = 0.7), age (p = 0.89) or caregiver status (p = 0.18). Percent error of water measurement was not different between the groups (standard: -1.4 ± 0.6 vs. modified: 0.7 ± 0.6%; p = 0.38). Thus, caloric density was more accurate in the modified instructions group compared to the standard manufacturer instructions group (-0.3 ± 0.6 vs.-2.9 ± 0.9%; p = 0.03). Infant formula label modifications using focus group feedback increased infant formula preparation accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aadiposity 3aage 3abody mass index 3acaregivers 3adensity 3aeducational status 3afocus groups 3aincome 3ainfant feeding 3ainfant formulas 3ainfant growth 3alead 3ameasurement 3anutrients 3arandomized clinical trials 3areadability 3awater1 aAltazan, Abby  D.1 aFlanagan, Emily  W.1 aBeyer, Alexandra  G.1 aOlson, Kelsey  N.1 aO’Connell, Alexis  A.1 aNguyen, Timothy  H.1 aBeyl, Robbie  A.1 aRedman, Leanne  M.0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 20, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245010600201300001400307506007600321520104300397592002801440506003701468650002101505650001701526650001001543650001201553650001701565650001901582700002201601700002201623700002201645700001801667700002001685773012701705856007501832852000901907655001201916IND60539088520221207084455.0160815e20140108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053908852DNAL7 a10.1021/ja410813j2doi7 aPMC39617112pmcid7 a243419822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLupoli, Tania
J.10aLipoprotein Activators Stimulate Escherichia coli Penicillin-Binding Proteins by Different Mechanisms  ap. 52-55.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Escherichia coli, the bifunctional penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), PBP1A and PBP1B, play critical roles in the final stage of peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis. These synthetic enzymes each possess a PG glycosyltransferase (PGT) domain and a transpeptidase (TP) domain. Recent genetic experiments have shown that PBP1A and PBP1B each require an outer membrane lipoprotein, LpoA and LpoB, respectively, to function properly in vivo. Here, we use complementary assays to show that LpoA and LpoB each increase the PGT and TP activities of their cognate PBPs, albeit by different mechanisms. LpoA directly increases the rate of the PBP1A TP reaction, which also results in enhanced PGT activity; in contrast, LpoB directly affects PGT domain activity, resulting in enhanced TP activity. These studies demonstrate bidirectional coupling of PGT and TP domain function. Additionally, the transpeptidation assay described here can be applied to study other activators or inhibitors of the TP domain of PBPs, which are validated drug targets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abiosynthesis 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3alipoproteins 3apeptidoglycans1 aLebar, Matthew D.1 aMarkovski, Monica1 aBernhardt, Thomas1 aKahne, Daniel1 aWalker, Suzanne0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Jan. 08, v. 136, no. 1 p.52-55dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja410813j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009500162500001400257520117900271592002801450650001901478650001601497650002401513650002301537650002301560650001401583650000901597650001901606650001501625650002301640650001401663650002001677650000901697650001601706700002201722700002501744700002701769700002401796700002001820700001801840700002101858700002801879773012201907856007502029852000902104655001202113IND60703499620221119133654.0200721e20200421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349962DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerasani, Jacopo 10aHuman Milk Feeding and Preterm Infants’ Growth and Body Composition: A Literature Review  aNAL-light  aPreterm infants may show a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, such as the development of metabolic syndrome and cognitive impairment. The most recent evidence highlights that nutrition, body composition development, and early postnatal growth may play a role in the programming of these processes. Human milk feeding has been recommended as the natural feeding for preterm infants and as a cost-effective strategy for reducing disease and economic burden. Considering that the postnatal growth retardation and aberrant body composition shown by preterm infants at the time of hospital discharge still remain important issues, we performed a literature review, aiming to provide an update about the effect of human milk feeding on these processes. On the basis of our findings, human milk feeding in preterm infants, although related to a slower weight gain than formula feeding, is associated with a better recovery of body composition through the promotion of fat-free mass deposition, which may ultimately lead to better metabolic and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Promotion and support of human milk feeding should be considered a priority in preterm infants’ care.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottle feeding 3abreast milk 3acognitive disorders 3acost effectiveness 3agrowth retardation 3ahospitals 3alead 3alean body mass 3aliterature 3ametabolic syndrome 3anutrients 3apremature birth 3arisk 3aweight gain1 aCeroni, Federica 1 aDe Cosmi, Valentina 1 aMazzocchi, Alessandra 1 aMorniroli, Daniela 1 aRoggero, Paola 1 aMosca, Fabio 1 aAgostoni, Carlo 1 aGiannì, Maria  Lorella0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 21, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017800160500001400338520150600352592002801858650002701886650002801913650001101941650001601952650001701968650001301985650001401998650002802012650002902040650001402069650001302083650001502096650002002111650001902131650001202150700002302162700002302185700001902208700002002227700002502247700002202272773012202294856007502416852000902491655001202500IND60703499920221119133751.0200721e20200421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070349992DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Erin  D.10aEfficacy of Lactobacillus paracasei HA-196 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 in Alleviating Symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study  aNAL-light  aSpecific probiotic strains can alleviate the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the efficacy of Lactobacillus paracasei HA-196 (L. paracasei) and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 (B. longum) in reducing the GI and psychological symptoms of IBS was evaluated in 251 adults with either constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed-pattern (IBS-M). Following a 2-week run-in period, participants were randomized to one of three interventions: L. paracasei (n = 84), B. longum (n = 83) or placebo (n = 81). IBS symptoms, stool frequency and consistency and quality of life were assessed by questionnaires. The differences from baseline in the severity of IBS symptoms at 4 and 8 weeks were similar between groups. Participants in this study were classified, after randomization, into subtypes according to Rome III. Within the L. paracasei group, complete spontaneous and spontaneous bowel movement frequency increased in participants with IBS-C (n = 10) after 8 weeks of supplementation (both p < 0.05) and decreased in participants with IBS-D (n = 10, p = 0.013). Both L. paracasei and B. longum supplementation improved the quality of life in emotional well-being and social functioning compared with baseline (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, L. paracasei and B. longum may reduce GI symptom severity and improve the psychological well-being of individuals with certain IBS subtypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium longum 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aadults 3acomorbidity 3aconstipation 3adiarrhea 3afrequency 3agastrointestinal system 3airritable bowel syndrome 3anutrients 3aplacebos 3aprobiotics 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3astrains1 aAntony, Joseph  M.1 aCrowley, David  C.1 aPiano, Amanda 1 aBhardwaj, Renu 1 aTompkins, Thomas  A.1 aEvans, Malkanthi 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 21, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010000168300001800268520203100286592002802317650002402345650003202369650001102401650001702412650001402429650002502443650001802468650002002486651001002506653002302516653002502539653002302564653002502587700001502612700001502627773011502642856008602757852000902843655001202852IND60583223520221120230241.0180831e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenjiang10aEnergy consumption and economic cost of typical wastewater treatment systems in Shenzhen, China  ap. S374-S378.  aWastewater treatment, a great potential alternative to alleviate water shortage, has been attached more and more importance in China, and has been developing very fast. The quantity of wastewater treatment plants in China has increased up to 3272 in June 2013, and has a total handling capacity of 0.14 billion t/day. However, wastewater treatment requires to consuming a lot of energy, and even energy consumption is often the main operation cost of wastewater treatment systems. Thus, it is very necessary to explore energy consumption of wastewater treatment systems and its influential factors, and seek for some possible pathways to save energy and lower cost. In this paper, we investigated the average energy consumption per unit wastewater treatment in Shenzhen, and analyzed the effect of treatment capacity and treatment technology on the energy cost per unit of wastewater treatment. The results showed that the average energy consumption of wastewater treatment plants in Shenzhen was about 0.20 ± 0.06 kWh/t, much less than those in some developed countries. This result may be related to the advanced wastewater treatment plants newly constructed and the low water quality requirements of wastewater treatment in Shenzhen. As the key to wastewater treatment, biochemical treatment sub-process consumed 50–70% of total energy cost in wastewater treatment. Secondly, the larger the treat capacity, the lower the energy cost per unit of wastewater treatment was. And the difference of treatment technologies can also significantly affect the energy consumption per unit of wastewater treatment. Finally, labor cost and electricity consumption respectively covered about 30.1% and 26.3% of total economic cost in the three typical wastewater treatment plants in original Shenzhen. Thus, upgrading treatment machines & equipment and improving management level are two effective alternatives to decrease energy consumption and lower total economic cost of wastewater treatment plants in Shenzhen and even China.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloped countries 3aelectric energy consumption 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aequipment 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3awater shortages 3aChina 0aEnergy consumption 0aWastewater treatment 0aTreatment capacity 0aTreatment technology1 aLi, Linjun1 aQiu, Guoyu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 163 p.S374-S378dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011000157500001400267520137400281592002801655650001301683650002801696650001501724650001201739650002001751650001501771650001601786650002201802650001401824650002501838650002501863650001201888650001101900650001001911650001501921650001801936650001801954650001101972700002201983700001602005700001702021700003302038773012202071856007502193852000902268655001202277IND60703500520221121234505.0200721e20200422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070350052DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTay, Wesley 10aCurrent Developments in Digital Quantitative Volume Estimation for the Optimisation of Dietary Assessment  aNAL-light  aObesity is a global health problem with wide-reaching economic and social implications. Nutrition surveillance systems are essential to understanding and addressing poor dietary practices. However, diets are incredibly diverse across populations and an accurate diagnosis of individualized nutritional issues is challenging. Current tools used in dietary assessment are cumbersome for users, and are only able to provide approximations of dietary information. Given the need for technological innovation, this paper reviews various novel digital methods for food volume estimation and explores the potential for adopting such technology in the Southeast Asian context. We discuss the current approaches to dietary assessment, as well as the potential opportunities that digital health can offer to the field. Recent advances in optics, computer vision and deep learning show promise in advancing the field of quantitative dietary assessment. The ease of access to the internet and the availability of smartphones with integrated cameras have expanded the toolsets available, and there is potential for automated food volume estimation to be developed and integrated as part of a digital dietary assessment tool. Such a tool may enable public health institutions to be able to gather an effective nutritional insight and combat the rising rates of obesity in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aartificial intelligence 3aautomation 3acameras 3acomputer vision 3aestimation 3ainformation 3amobile telephones 3anutrients 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition monitoring 3aobesity 3aoptics 3apaper 3apopulation 3apublic health 3asocial impact 3avolume1 aBhupindara Kaura,1 aQuek, Rina 1 aLim, Joseph 1 aHenry, Christiani  Jeyakumar0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 22, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245011200209300001800321520120100339592002801540650001701568650002501585650001301610650001401623650001401637650001701651650001701668650001601685650002001701651001001721653003401731653003301765653001101798653001801809653002101827700005401848700001901902700001801921700001401939773011501953856008602068852000902154655001202163IND60583224320221121211832.0180831e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Peiming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6381-826214aThe door-to-door recycling scheme of household solid wastes in urban areas: a case study from Nagoya, Japan  ap. S366-S373.  aThe objective of this study is to establish a better understanding of door-to-door recycling scheme of household solid wastes (HSW) in Nagoya, Japan. The details of door-to-door recycling scheme including the category of HSW, the procedure of door-to-door recycling scheme, and the treatment technology of the HSW in Nagoya were reported. Based on SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat) analysis, the internal (strength and weakness) and external (opportunity and threat) conditions of door-to-door recycling scheme of HSW were clearly presented. The study opens a window through which major stakeholders involved can perceive the favorable (strength and opportunity) and unfavorable (weakness and threat) conditions of HSW management. Four critical strategies including further developing the recycling awareness of residents, completing the insurance mechanism for implementation of recycling system, extending the responsibility of producer/industry, and developing deep research of waste treatment were proposed to maintain and develop the door-to-door recycling scheme of HSW. They may also be useful references for other developing countries intending to enhance HSW management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeveloping countries 3aindustry 3ainsurance 3arecycling 3asolid wastes 3astakeholders 3aurban areas 3awaste treatment 3aJapan 0aDoor-to-door recycling scheme 0aHousehold solid wastes (HSW) 0aNagoya 0aSWOT analysis 0aWaste management1 aZhang, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5945-03511 aZhang, Shuping1 aWang, Renqing1 aWang, Hui0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 163 p.S366-S373dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245007200152300001600224520092400240592002801164650001101192650001201203650001201215650001301227650001101240650001301251650001101264650001501275650001601290700001601306700002001322700001501342773012901357856007501486852000901561655001201570IND60539090020221122075629.0160815e20140108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053909002DNAL7 a10.1021/ja411272y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Peng10aDeep-Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystals: Ba3P3O10X (X = Cl, Br)  ap. 480-487.  aDeep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical (deep-UV NLO) crystals are of worldwide interest for the generation of coherent light with wavelength below 200 nm by the direct second-harmonic generation (SHG) output from solid-state lasers. The unprecedented deep-UV NLO phosphates representing their own structure types, Ba₃P₃O₁₀Cl (BPOC), Ba₃P₃O₁₀Br (BPOB), have been discovered, which display moderate powder SHG intensities in type I phase matchable behaviors with a short UV cutoff edge of 180 nm (measured by a single crystal, one of the shortest values among phosphates to date). Insightfully, the geometry and polarization of the C₁-P₃O₁₀⁵– building unit are affected by the crystal packing. DFT calculations and cutoff energy dependent SHG coefficient analyses reveal that the SHG origin is from the cooperation of asymmetric C₁-P₃O₁₀⁵– anion, Ba²⁺ cation, and Cl–/Br– anion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium 3abromine 3acations 3acrystals 3aenergy 3ageometry 3alasers 3aphosphates 3awavelengths1 aWu, Liming,1 aZhou, Liu-Jiang1 aChen, Ling0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Jan. 08, v. 136, no. 1 p.480-487dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja411272y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010100164300001600265520157100281592002801852650001101880650001501891650001601906650001901922650001501941650002701956650001101983650001101994650001902005650001902024650001602043650001702059650001502076650002102091653002302112653001702135653002802152653003102180653002102211700002102232700001802253700001602271700001302287773011302300856008602413852000902499655001202508IND60583225520221118073842.0180831e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wen12aA framework for the urban eco-metabolism model - Linking metabolic processes to spatial patterns  ap. 168-176.  aRapid urbanization disordered the urban metabolism, pressed the contradiction between resources supply and demand, and caused urban environment deterioration. Urban metabolism provides important insights into the characterization of material and energy flows and the relationships between anthropogenic urban activities and natural processes. However, linking socio-economic and ecologic models, and tracking the time-dependent distribution and configuration of material and energy flows across the entire city are imperatively needed in urban metabolism model development. In this study, the points, lines and areas concepts were introduced to connect the urban landscape patterns and eco-metabolic processes. A framework developed to simplify the urban landscape as areas, and use points and lines to depict the eco-metabolic processes in space. In application, a model framework of urban water metabolism was used as an example to analyze the natural hydrological processes and social water metabolism in an urban ecosystem. Water balance of a community was calculated by the model. The total input and output of the community’s water metabolism was 50189.6 m³ and 47343.5 m³ respectively. The community needed 1331.4 m³/d water input and discharge 1198.26 m³/d wastewater out. The runoff coefficient of the impervious area, pervious area and the community was 0.87, 0.30 and 0.55, respectively. The model has provided a tool for urban planners to improve landscape patterns and infrastructure layouts within urban ecosystem to build sustainable cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aecosystems 3aenergy flow 3ainfrastructure 3alandscapes 3amaterial flow analysis 3amodels 3arunoff 3asocioeconomics 3asupply balance 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awastewater 3awater metabolism 0aLandscape patterns 0aMass balance 0aEco-metabolic processes 0aMaterials and energy flows 0aWater metabolism1 aChang, Andrew C.1 aChen, Weiping1 aZhou, Weiqi1 aFeng, Qi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 165 p.168-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245011700178300001600295520119900311592002801510650001201538650001301550650000901563650001701572650001201589650001801601650001401619650001101633650001801644651001201662653004901674653002201723653001201745653001201757700002301769700002201792700002401814700002301838773011301861856008601974852000902060655001202069IND60583225920221118073900.0180831e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Adriana O.10aEvidence of reduced mercury loss and increased use of cyanidation at gold processing centers in southern Ecuador  ap. 836-845.  aDue to the strong price of gold, the number and capacity of gold processing centers in Portovelo-Zaruma in southern Ecuador have increased considerably in recent years. In turn, this has caused increasing environmental pollution of waterbodies with cyanide, mercury and other heavy metals. This paper provides an assessment of gold production methods at 52 processing centers in 2013 and 20 in 2015, including estimations of mercury (Hg) losses and releases, cyanide use and tailings management. Due to an increase in the price of mercury and other government initiatives to reduce and eliminate Hg use, there is evidence of a shift from amalgamation processes to increased employment of cyanidation techniques. It was estimated that the 87 processing centers released 1.9 million tonnes/a of tailings in 2015, including 2033 tonnes/a of cyanide and 222 kg/a of Hg. Furthermore, it was estimated that the burning of gold amalgams released 303 kg/a of Hg to the atmosphere. Although mercury use showed a 60% reduction from 2013 to 2015, while cyanidation processes increased 30% over the same time period, more needs to be done, as 65% of the centers still use Hg amalgamation to extract gold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acyanides 3agold 3aheavy metals 3amercury 3amine tailings 3apollution 3aprices 3asurface water 3aEcuador 0aArtisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) 0aMercury pollution 0aCyanide 0aEcuador1 aMarshall, Bruce G.1 aKaplan, Robert J.1 aMoreno-Chavez, Jose1 aVeiga, Marcello M.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 165 p.836-845dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002100146245008300167500000900250520120700259592002801466650002201494650001701516650001801533650001801551650000901569650001601578650001501594650002001609650002501629650002401654651001701678700002101695700002401716773010201740852000901842856008301851655001201934IND4389848520221121005258.0191122e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438984852DNAL7 a10.1094/CM-2006-1018-02-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarr, Patrick M.10aImpact of Tillage and Crop Rotation on Spring Wheat Yield: II. Rotation Effect  aepub  aNorth Dakota is the leading domestic producer of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) with almost 600,000 acres seeded in 2006. This level of production partially results from the belief that grain yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell.) is greater following field pea compared with a spring wheat monoculture. The reduction in tillage occurring in the Great Plains has generated interest among farmers in determining if crop rotation benefits of field pea extend to spring wheat across contrasting tillage systems. A six-year field study was conducted to determine the impact of field pea on grain and N yield of a subsequent spring wheat crop in clean-, reduced-, and no-till systems. A beneficial rotation effect occurred for spring wheat grain and N yield in four of the six years and ranged from 9 to 11 bu/acre and 13 to 28 lb/acre, respectively (P < 0.05). An interaction between cropping strategy (rotation and monoculture) and tillage system was not observed for either trait. These results suggest that the beneficial rotation effect of field pea is similar for spring wheat across different tillage systems and occurs in most but not all years, depending on environmental factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aspring wheat 3acrop rotation 3aPisum sativum 3apeas 3agrain yield 3ano-tillage 3areduced tillage 3aconventional tillage 3acontinuous cropping 3aNorth Dakota1 aMartin, Glenn B.1 aHorsley, Richard D.0 tCrop management.g2006 Oct., v. 5, no. 1dPlant Management NetworkwJournal:6161x1543-78337nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CM-2006-1018-02-RS3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03240naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002200172245013000194300001600324500001500340520168000355592002802035650002802063650001202091650002502103650001702128650001302145650000902158650001102167650001302178650001402191650004502205650004002250650001902290650006702309650005702376650003502433650001102468650002102479651001802500653000902518700002002527700001802547773008302565856008902648852000902737655001202746IND4466485220221119171605.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446648522DNAL7 a220240942pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.09.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkorie, Alexander10aEstimation of daily intake of potentially toxic elements from urban street dust and the role of oral bioaccessibility testing  ap. 460-467.  a2019-12-06  aThe pseudo-total and oral bioaccessible concentration of six potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in urban street dust was investigated. Typical pseudo-total concentrations across the sampling sites ranged from 4.4 to 8.6mgkg⁻¹ for As, 0.2–3.6mgkg⁻¹ for Cd, 25–217mgkg⁻¹ for Cu, 14–46mgkg⁻¹ for Ni, 70–4261mgkg⁻¹ for Pb, and, 111–652mgkg⁻¹ for Zn. This data compared favourably with other urban street dust samples collected and analysed in a variety of cities globally; the exception was the high level of Pb determined in a specific sample in this study. The oral bioaccessibility of PTEs in street dust is also assessed using in vitro gastrointestinal extraction (Unified Bioaccessibility Method, UBM). Based on a worst case scenario the oral bioaccessibility data estimated that Cd and Zn had the highest % bioaccessible fractions (median >45%) while the other PTEs i.e. As, Cu, Ni and Pb had lower % bioaccessible fractions (median <35%). The pseudo-total and bioaccessible concentrations of PTEs in the samples has been compared to estimated tolerable daily intake values based on unintentional soil/dust consumption. Cadmium, Cu and Ni are well within the oral tolerable daily intake rates. With respect to As and Pb, only the latter exceeds the TDIₒᵣₐₗ if we model ingestion rate based on atmospheric ‘dustiness’ rather than the US EPA (2008) unintentional soil/dust consumption rate of 100mgd⁻¹. We consider it unlikely that even a child with pica tendencies would ingest as much as 100mg soil/dust during a daily visit to the city centre, and in particular to the sites with elevated Pb concentrations observed in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceptable daily intake 3acadmium 3aaverage daily intake 3aDaily Values 3achildren 3asoil 3acities 3atoxicity 3aingestion 2aAutomobilesxstatistics & numerical data 2aCitiesxstatistics & numerical data 2aDustxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aHazardous Substancesxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMetalsxanalysis 3aUnited States 0apica1 aEntwistle, Jane1 aDean, John R.0 tChemosphere.g2012 Feb., v. 86, no. 5 p.460-467dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.09.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013100166500001400297520167000311592002801981650002702009650002502036650002002061650002702081650002402108650001102132650000902143650001002152650002402162650001402186650002502200650001402225650002402239650001302263650001302276650000902289650001202298650001602310651001402326651001602340700001902356700002402375700002202399773012202421856007502543852000902618655001202627IND60703502120221122042438.0200721e20200422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070350212DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120411792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Alexis  Ceecee10aOmega-3 Fatty Acids and Eye Health: Opinions and Self-Reported Practice Behaviors of Optometrists in Australia and New Zealand  aNAL-light  aThis study investigated optometrists’ attitudes and self-reported practice behaviors towards omega-3 fatty acids for eye health, and knowledge and understanding of their potential risks and benefits.

Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated recommending omega-3-rich foods for AMD management, while 62% indicated recommending omega-3 supplements. Most respondents (78%) indicated recommending omega-3-rich foods or supplements for DED. For DED, recommended omega-3 supplement dosages were (median [inter-quartile range, IQR]) 2000 mg [1000–2750 mg] per day. The main sources of information reported by respondents to guide their clinical decision making were continuing education articles and conferences. In conclusion, optometrists routinely make clinical recommendations about diet and omega-3 fatty acids. Future education could target improving optometrists’ knowledge of differences in the evidence for whole-food versus supplement sources of omega-3 fatty acids in AMD. Further research is needed to address uncertainties in the evidence regarding optimal omega-3 dosage and formulation composition in DED.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acontinuing education 3adecision making 3ademographic statistics 3adietary supplements 3adosage 3aeyes 3afoods 3ainformation sources 3aknowledge 3amacular degeneration 3anutrients 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apatients 3aresearch 3arisk 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand1 aSingh, Sumeer 1 aCraig, Jennifer  P.1 aDownie, Laura  E.0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 22, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120411793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013100177300001600308520137500324592002801699650001101727650001101738650001101749650001801760650001301778650002801791650002201819653005001841653002201891653002101913653003601934700002201970700002801992700002302020773011302043856008602156852000902242655001202251IND60583226120221118073848.0180831e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorabi Moghadam, Sara10aUrban energy planning procedure for sustainable development in the built environment: A review of available spatial approaches  ap. 811-827.  aUrban and Regional Integrated Energy Planning is crucial to define transition strategies toward sustainable development and post-carbon cities; particularly, in the built environment sector which is one of the main responsible for energy consumption and carbon emissions.The paper aims at offering a systematic review of existing urban and regional energy planning approaches. This analysis is based on literature review. The reviewed papers are critically analyzed and discussed through a Meta-analysis and a SWOT analysis. The papers are classified in order to highlight the main research trends and to illustrate the most relevant characteristics of the principal approaches.This critical analysis of the papers highlights the lack of an holistic and integrated framework which is able to take into account the large variety of dimensions related to sustainable planning. A major achievement of this study is to provide information on how the various existing approaches can be integrated to handle the entire planning procedure adequately.The result provides a preliminary theoretical framework to integrate different approaches, identify the main barriers and future challenges in the field of research. This framework will help urban actors to develop energy planning projects, guiding them in the choice among a significant number of existing planning approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acities 3aenergy 3ameta-analysis 3aplanning 3asustainable development 3asystematic review 0aUrban and regional integrated energy planning 0aBuilt environment 0aEnergy modelling 0aSpatial decision support system1 aDelmastro, Chiara1 aCorgnati, Stefano Paolo1 aLombardi, Patrizia0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 165 p.811-827dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013300167300001600300520184000316592002802156650001502184650002202199650002202221650001502243650002202258650002202280650001302302650001102315650001102326653002202337653002802359653002302387653003002410653003002440653003702470700002002507700001902527700001902546773011302565856008602678852000902764655001202773IND60583226220221118073859.0180831e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seokgi12aA dynamic control approach for energy-efficient production scheduling on a single machine under time-varying electricity pricing  ap. 552-563.  aThis paper proposes a dynamic control algorithm to enable an energy-aware single machine scheduling under the time-varying electricity pricing policy, in which price rates remain fixed day-to-day over the season. The key issue is to assign a set of jobs to available time periods where different electricity prices are assigned, while considering requested due dates of jobs so as to minimize total penalty costs for earliness and tardiness of jobs and total energy consumption costs, simultaneously. As the first contribution of this study, we develop a new mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that aims at determining job arrival times and resulting earliness and tardiness of jobs and energy consumption costs for machine idle and normal processing. Second, an efficient heuristic approach based on continuous-time variable control models and algorithm is developed. The proposed heuristic adaptively changes job arrival times and due dates, which finally determine production sequence over the time periods of different electricity prices, machine turn-off, and machine idle with minimum energy consumption costs and just-in-time (JIT) penalty. Energy and JIT performance of the proposed approach is examined using real energy and machining parameters of a HAAS machine and compared to those of the metaheuristic approach. For relatively large size data groups, the proposed approach incurs about 4∼11% higher energy consumption costs on average, which are offset by up to 99% lower JIT costs, resulting in 10∼94% lower total costs on average compared to the metaheuristic approach. The proposed time-scaled heuristic algorithm yields extremely short computational time, which enables production managers to flexibly select proper production strategies and to implement them for different production environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aearly development 3aelectricity costs 3aemployment 3aenergy efficiency 3aissues and policy 3amanagers 3amodels 3aprices 0aMachine idle time 0aJust-in-time production 0aEnergy consumption 0aSingle machine scheduling 0aMachine on-off scheduling 0aTime-varying electricity pricing1 aDo Chung, Byung1 aJeon, Hyun Woo1 aChang, Jaeyeon0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 165 p.552-563dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009600165300001600261520124000277592002801517650001101545650001901556650002501575650001301600650001901613651001001632653003101642653006001673653002101733653001001754700001801764700001401782700001901796773011301815856008601928852000902014655001202023IND60583226420221118073857.0180831e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058322642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yanni10aDid China's regional transport industry enjoy better carbon productivity under regulations?  ap. 777-787.  aDespite rapid economic development, the transport industry has been claimed to account for a major part of climate change. This paper investigates total factor carbon-sensitive productivity growth in the regional transport sector in China and decomposes its dynamic changes over time taking account of the regional heterogeneity of different provinces. Thus, the contemporaneous metafrontier Malmquist-Luenberger approach that combined with non-radial directional distance functions is proposed and define a new indicator called the contemporaneous metafrontier Malmquist-Luenberger carbon emission performance index (CMML). This total factor indicator includes the metafrontier efficiency-change index (MEC), the metafrontier technology-change index (MTC), and the metafrontier technology-gap-change index (TGC). Results show an about 4% increase in overall total factor carbon emission productivity during the period of 2000–2012. Different growth patterns are also observed in the transport sector across different area of China. In the eastern region, the growth of carbon productivity is driven mainly by pure efficiency changes, whereas the central region is driven mainly by innovations in the low-carbon transport technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3aindustry 3atransportation 3aChina 0aCarbon productivity growth 0aContemporaneous metafrontier Malmquist Luenberger index 0aTransport sector 0aChina1 aChoi, Yongrok1 aWei, Xiao1 aChen, Zhongfei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 165 p.777-787dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245007600167500001900243520116500262592002801427650001501455650001501470650001901485650002001504650002301524650002001547650001501567650001101582650001501593653002801608653003901636653002401675653002201699700001501721700001601736700001501752700001301767700001301780700001601793700001701809700001301826700001501839700001901854700001701873773010601890856008701996852000902083655001202092IND60716288120221120040330.0201216e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071628812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1243582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qiulai10aInteraction and removal of oxytetracycline with aerobic granular sludge  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAerobic granular sludge as a promising technology showed great resistance to adverse conditions. However, the interaction between oxytetracycline (OTC) and granular sludge was not studied sufficiently. This study therefore investigated OTC-tolerance ability of incomplete and complete granulation sludge from aspects of simultaneous nutrients removal, sludge characteristics, microbial activity, community changes, and vice versa OTC removal performance. Incomplete granulation sludge showed better denitrification performance and resistance. Whereas, denitrification and phosphorus removal of complete granulation sludge suffered a permanent collapse under 5 mg/L OTC. OTC could be removed by rapid adsorption and slow biodegradation via granular sludge. The EPS, especially TB-PS, played a significant role during the operational period subjected to OTC. The major genera of Lysobacter and Candidatus_Competibacter laid the biological basis for stability and functionality of granules, which acted as the putative contributors for resisting and removing OTC. This study showed that incomplete-granulated sludge qualified more promising application prospect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLysobacter 3aadsorption 3abiodegradation 3adenitrification 3amicrobial activity 3aoxytetracycline 3aphosphorus 3asludge 3atechnology 0aAerobic granular sludge 0aExtracellular polymeric substances 0aBacterial community 0aGranulation grade1 aXie, Zhiyi1 aFu, Zhidong1 aWang, Meng1 aXu, Peng1 aYu, Jian1 aMa, Jingwei1 aGao, Shuxian1 aChen, Li1 aZhang, Wei1 aSong, Jianyang1 aWang, Hongyu0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Jan., v. 320 p.124358-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1243583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007400166300001800240520166800258592002801926650002801954650001501982650001101997650001102008650001602019700002002035773013602055856008002191852000902271655001202280IND60605951020221120040500.0180723e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060595102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b015712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerlin, Yuri A.10aConduction of Metal–Thin Organic Film–Metal Junctions at Low Bias  ap. 7557-7563.  aA model for the low bias electric conductance of junctions, consisting of a thin organic film (TOF) positioned between two metallic electrodes (M), has been developed. In contrast with other theoretical studies, the proposed model relies on the energy band picture of M–TOF–M systems. Theoretical analysis of the band-like transport has shown that the electronic flow between metallic electrodes can exist in M–TOF–M junctions only if injected charge carriers are able to overcome the potential barrier with the thickness-dependent height. Such an obstacle to the motion of injected charges in the TOF conduction band arises due to the bending of this band caused by carriers localized in structural traps. Two regimes of the zero bias conductance of M–TOF–M junctions have been studied theoretically for situations, where charges overcome the thickness-dependent barrier undergoing either thermally activated or tunneling transitions. Analytical expressions derived for the zero bias conduction in these two regimes enable us to specify key physical parameters controlling charge transport across the film and provide results consistent with observations. On the basis of our findings, we infer that thermally activated and tunneling conductances can be distinguished by temperature and thickness dependencies. Theoretical results obtained for the electric conductance of M–TOF–M systems in the tunneling regime are compared with those obtained for assemblies in which TOF has been replaced by a single molecule. Distinctions between transport properties of these two systems and their similarities resulting from the present model are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3amodels 3atemperature1 aRatner, Mark A.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 122, no. 13 p.7557-7563dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b015713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011300175500001900288520114600307592002801453650001201481650001401493650001201507650001701519650002501536650001701561650002601578650001201604650001201616650001701628650000901645650001701654650001801671653000801689653000901697653000801706653000801714653000801722653000801730653000801738653000701746653000801753653000801761653000801769653000801777653001201785653000701797653001601804653001901820653002001839700002301859700001801882700001801900773010701918856008702025852000902112655001202121IND60716289220221122190904.0201227e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071628922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1058282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez-Rueda, Yamid10aSeashell waste-derived materials for secondary catalytic tar reduction in municipal solid waste gasification  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCatalytic tar removal from producer gas is critical for the economic feasibility of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) gasification in the waste-to-energy(WtE) approach. Nickel- and noble-metal catalysts have the highest tar cracking activities, but they increase costs, use scarce materials, and generate dangerous byproducts. To overcome these drawbacks, naturally occurring materials should be used for tar cracking. In this paper, two nanomaterials, synthesized from oyster and mussel waste shells respectively, are used to clean syngas from MSW in a secondary tar cracking unit. We observed that they reform class 1 tar (heavy tars that condense at high temperatures at very low concentrations) into class 3 tar (light hydrocarbons that are not important in condensation) and benzene. Although both catalysts’ composition and textural properties were identical, crystallite size and especially specific surface area variation was enough to generate a change in product selectivity. A larger crystallite size and SSA shows a soot yield reduction of 95% with respect to the non-catalytic case, simultaneously increasing the H2/CO at 1000 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acrystallites 3aeconomic feasibility 3agasification 3amunicipal solid waste 3amussels 3aoysters 3aproducer gas 3asoot 3asurface area 3asynthesis gas 0aSSA 0aELFM 0aNm3 0aMSW 0aWtE 0aWtM 0aPAH 0aGC 0aBET 0aBJH 0aXRF 0aXRD 0aSPA/SPE 0aER 0aTar removal 0aGreen catalyst 0aWaste-to-Energy1 aZaini, Ilman Nuran1 aYang, Weihong1 aHelsen, Lieve0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Dec., v. 143 p.105828-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1058283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245009100217500001900308520172600327592002802053650002502081650002302106650002202129650001402151650001202165650001502177650001102192650001402203650002402217650002202241650002102263653001902284653002102303653002902324653001902353653002702372700003602399700001902435700002802454773010702482856008702589852000902676655001202685IND60716290120221116214844.0201227e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071629012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1058392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuigai, Harrison Hihu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2042-990710aCo–pyrolysis of biomass blends: Characterization, kinetic and thermodynamic analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study has dealt with characterization and co–pyrolysis of binary and ternary blends of three biomass, viz. water hyacinth (WH), Thevetia peruviana (TP) and sugarcane bagasse (SCB). The biomass blends were characterized for proximate and ultimate analysis, surface morphology and functional groups. Co–pyrolysis of blends was carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) at heating rates of 8, 10, 15 and 30 °C min⁻¹. TGA data was analysed using Ozawa–Flynn–Wall (OFW), advanced isoconversional model of Vyazovkin (Vyazovkin _AIC) and distributed activation energy model (DAEM). The dominant reaction mechanism of co–pyrolysis at different stages of conversions was deduced using Criado plots. The kinetic parameters of activation energy and pre–exponential factor, and thermodynamic parameters of ΔH and ΔS showed large variation with conversion, which is indicative of complex chemistry of thermal conversion of various structural components of biomass with synergistic interactions. The activation energies for binary blends WH SCB, WH TP, TP SCB were in the range 122.90–237.53, 127.93–272.92, and 124.80–235.94 kJ mol⁻¹, respectively. For ternary blends WH 111, WH 211 and WH 311, activation energy varied in the range 119.64–194.31, 123.40–246.80, and 121.65–194.75 kJ mol⁻¹, respectively. The predominant reaction mechanism for all blends was ordered reaction (F1) in lower conversion range (α ≤ 0.25), and diffusion limited process (D1 or D2 or D3) in higher conversion range (α = 0.35–0.55). Positive ΔH for all blends indicated endothermic nature, while positive ΔS indicated more disordered system after reaction – typical of pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aThevetia peruviana 3aactivation energy 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3aendothermy 3amodels 3apyrolysis 3areaction mechanisms 3asugarcane bagasse 3athermogravimetry 0aBiomass blends 0aCharacterization 0aIsoconversional analysis 0aCo–pyrolysis 0aThermodynamic analysis1 aChoudhury, B.

Eugene10aEstuarine oiling increases a long-term decline in mussel growth  aThe ribbed mussel, Geukensia granosissima, cycles nutrients, contributes to soil stability, and can be a major component of predator-prey communities in salt marshes. Mussels were exposed to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and salt marshes remain contaminated eight years later. We hypothesized that the oiled mussels had reduced annual growth, altered population size frequency, and perhaps changed valve morphometrics. We sampled 10 marshes near Port Sulphur, LA, to measure the morphometrics of 133 mussels and their age-specific growth rate, and also the marsh oil content and percent vegetative cover. The relationships between valve weight, length and biomass weight were stable as mussels aged. A Year 1 growth decline from 1994 to 2018 is not easily explained by estuarine acidification, flooding, and temperature rise; freshening of estuarine waters is suggested to be a probable causal factor in the declining growth rate. The average valve length and dry biomass per valve declined with oiling in 2010. A multiple regression equation using the percent cover and oil concentration in 2018 described 70% of the variation in valve length. Sites with the highest oiling had few mussels with 14 annual growth bands and more of the younger mussels compared to sites with the lowest oiling. Valve growth in Year 1 declined for four years after the oil spill and was not compensated by higher growth rates in older mussels. Annual growth was below the amount predicted in a regression equation for the five years after the oil spill. Mussel populations may also have been structured by predators that were also responsive to oiling in subtle ways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3abiomass 3aequations 3aestuaries 3alipid content 3amorphometry 3amussels 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apollution 3apopulation size 3aregression analysis 3asulfur 3atemperature 3aGulf of Mexico 0aOil pollution 0aGeukensia granosissima 0aRibbed mussel growth 0aSalt marsh 0aSize1 aPlunket, Jennifer Spicer0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 284 p.117506-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1175063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245011600181520146300297592002801760650001101788650001401799650001801813650001801831650002901849650001801878650001201896650001501908651001701923653002701940653001101967653001601978653001701994653002402011700001802035700001702053700002202070700002202092700002102114700001902135700001802154700001802172773011102190856008602301852000902387655001202396IND60716291620221120185903.0220103e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071629162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1098102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrabo, Moustapha Soungalo10aMapping the variability in physical, cooking, and nutritional properties of Zamnè, a wild food in Burkina Faso  aZamnè is an Acacia seed used as a terroir food in Burkina Faso. It has been introduced as a famine-resilience crop and has become a cultural diet. However, little is known about its culinary and nutritional properties. This study aimed to explore the cooking and nutritional properties of Zamnè (Senegalia macrostachya (Reichenb. ex DC.) Kyal. & Boatwr.). Zamnè presented characteristics of medium size, flattened, dry, and hard-to-cook legume. The moisture, cylindrical ratio, diameter, thickness, weight, true density, coat percentage, coat thickness, and cooking time of the seeds were in the range of 4.5–5.8%, 1.1, 7.4–8.0 mm, 1.6–1.8 mm, 65.0–76.4 mg, 1.1 g/ml, 16.8–22.2%, 9.0–11.9 mg/cm², and 180 min, respectively. The raw Zamnè showed 39.8–43.6, 9.7–11.5, 16.6–29.4, 13.3–20.2, 16.6–26.4, and 3.7–3.9 (g/100 g dry weight) of protein, fat, total dietary fiber, insoluble dietary fiber, digestible carbohydrate, and ash contents, respectively. The traditional cooking process improved most of the parameters determining the proximate compositions but resulted in 51–52% of protein and 47–50% carbohydrate losses into the cooking wastewater. Besides, pseudoZamnè, a famine-emergency crop similar to Zamnè, revealed inferior cooking quality than Zamnè. The data reported here provide a basis for alternative cooking techniques and further investigations of Zamnè and pseudoZamnè seeds’ nutritional quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aSenegalia 3acarbohydrates 3adietary fiber 3adigestible carbohydrates 3afood research 3alegumes 3awastewater 3aBurkina Faso 0aSenegalia macrostachya 0aAcacia 0aWild legume 0aTerroir food 0aHard-to-cook defect1 aShumoy, Habtu1 aCisse, Hama,1 aParkouda, Charles1 aNikiéma, Fulbert1 aOdetokun, Ismail1 aTraoré, Yves,1 aSavadogo, Aly1 aRaes, Katleen0 tFood research international.g2020 Dec., v. 138 p.109810-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1098103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011000173300001600283520123700299536021101536592002801747596009401775650002301869650001401892650002401906650001901930650002401949650002801973650001802001650001202019650001602031650000802047650002502055650000902080650001502089650001902104650000902123650001002132650001002142651001002152653002302162653002502185653001202210700002202222700002102244700001602265700002302281700002702304700002002331700002502351700003102376700001802407700002402425700002002449773014102469856008502610852000902695655001202704IND60605954020221121223126.0180723e20180818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060595402DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2018.14422632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Amicis, Ramona10aMediterranean Diet and Cognitive Status in Free-Living Elderly: A Cross-Sectional Study in Northern Italy  ap. 494-500.  aObjective: Few data are available on the Italian elderly population with regard to adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and cognitive impairment. Our aim was to investigate adherence to the MD and its association with cognitive function in an Italian urban sample. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 279 participants aged ≥ 65 years (80 men, 199 women) was carried out at a nutritional center. Adherence to the MD was evaluated using a 14-item questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: The clinical and nutritional assessments performed revealed 30.1% to have a dietary pattern in accordance with the MD; 13.6% had suspected or mild cognitive impairment (MMSE score ≤ 23). The MD pattern was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR] = 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15–0.99; p = 0.045), as was the consumption of wine (OR = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16–0.84; p = 0.018) and nuts (OR = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.69, p = 0.005). No association was found with other food groups. Conclusion: A closer adherence to the MD was associated with a better cognitive status. Further cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are warranted.  aThis study was supported by “Nutrition and Prevention in Neurometabolic and Neurodegenerative Diseases,” CUP J42114000110001, 5 × 1000 2015, Carlo Besta Neurological Institute Foundation, Milan, Italy.  aPublisher supplied data  aJ42114000110001, 5x1000 2015cCarlo Besta Neurological Institute Foundation, Milan, Italy 3aMediterranean diet 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3aelderly 3afood groups 3amen 3anutrition assessment 3anuts 3aodds ratio 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3awines 3awomen 3aItaly 0aMediterranean diet 0acognitive impairment 0aelderly1 aLeone, Alessandro1 aFoppiani, Andrea1 aOsio, Diana1 aLewandowski, Lidia1 aGiustizieri, Valentina1 aCornelio, Paolo1 aCornelio, Ferdinando1 aFusari Imperatori, Susanna1 aCappa, S.

Complex coacervated capsules were produced by atomization, using emulsions with 1 and 6%(w/w) of gelatin and ginger oil atomized over a 1%(w/w) solution of gum Arabic, at constant polymer ratio of 1:2 (gelatin:gum Arabic) at pH 3.5. The air velocity at the nozzle varied from 72 to 168 m/s and the emulsion velocity at the nozzle varied from 0.4 to 0.6 m/s, maintaining the air to liquid velocity ratio at 170, 220 and 270. The mean diameter of the microcapsules produced varied from 52 to 75 μm and no crosslinking agents were used. The influence of atomization numbers Weber (We) and Ohnesorge (Oh), shear rate and shear stress on the encapsulation performance was carried out and a proposed model was able to predict the final size of the microcapsules produced at We ≥ 180 and Oh = 0.063. Encapsulation efficiency varied from 9 to 95%, and encapsulation yield varied from 50 to 99%.

The installation of a subsurface physical barrier (SPB) is one of the common methods employed to reduce or prevent SWI, but there are few studies on the impact of SPBs on NP in groundwater. Through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, the effects of the hydraulic gradient (HG), the nitrate concentration of the set groundwater nitrate pollution source, the relative height of the SPB (HP’) and the relative distance between the SPB and the saltwater boundary on the NP of groundwater in the presence of SWI, subsurface dams and cut-off walls were studied. Evaluation indicators were established to evaluate the degree and shape of the SWI and NP. To better describe the relationship between the velocity distribution and changes in the velocity distribution area and the degree of NP and SWI, the velocity distribution in the presence of SWI and a SPB was summarized separately. The results showed that when there was SPB, low-velocity zones were formed on both sides of the SPB, which not only slowed the migration of NO₃⁻ but also changed the shape of the NO₃⁻-contaminated area. The closer to the SPB area the pollutants were, the more obvious the obstruction effect. The obstruction effect of adding the cut-off wall on NP was more obvious than that of adding the subsurface dam wall. The selected HG and Hₚ’ were important factors affecting NP and SWI. The higher HG was, the more serious the NP, the lower the HG, and the stronger the degree of SWI. Adding SPBs reduces the impact of HGs on NP and SWI. Therefore, the design of SPBs in coastal areas should focus on aspects related to these two factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater 3anitrates 3apollution 3asaline water 3asaltwater intrusion 3aunconfined aquifer 0aNitrate contamination 0aSeawater intrusion 0aSubsurface physical barrier 0aSubsurface dam 0aCut-off wall1 aChen, Jiajun1 aZheng, Xilai0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 284 p.117528-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1175283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010400176506007600280520138600356592002801742506003701770650001301807650001701820650002201837650001801859650001801877650001301895650001101908650001901919650002001938650001801958653001901976653002201995653001902017653002402036653002802060700002702088700002802115700002702143700003002170700002802200700002302228700002902251700003402280700002902314773011102343856008602454852000902540655001202549IND60716293320221207061439.0220606e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071629332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1098382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira Mar, Josiana10aDevelopment of alginate/inulin carrier systems containing non-conventional Amazonian berry extracts  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDifferent carriers, such as the combination of sodium alginate and inulin, have been employed to protect foods against environmental effects. The goal of this work was to use the ionic gelation encapsulation process to produce microparticles containing Clidemia rubra extract, ranging the concentration of inulin from 1.5 to 3.5 g inulin.100 g⁻¹ of solution. Characteristic signals of sugars, organic acids and phenolic compounds were identified in the extract using the ¹H NMR technique. The carriers containing inulin presented significant difference in the moisture content when compared to the pure sodium alginate beads. The produced beads were found in the range of 0.81–1.06 mm. The addition of inulin to sodium alginate was significant for the encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the antioxidant compounds when compared to the beads formed only using pure sodium alginate. The microspheres presenting inulin and sodium alginate presented higher content of spherical particles. The addition of 2.5 g inulin.100 g⁻¹ of solution allowed its incorporation into the pores of the beads, favoring a possible chemical interaction between inulin and sodium alginate. This interaction resulted in a different crystal structure and better EE. Furthermore, beads containing inulin presented higher protection of the encapsulated bioactive compounds during the gastric phase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClidemia 3aantioxidants 3acrystal structure 3aencapsulation 3afood research 3agelation 3ainulin 3amicroparticles 3asodium alginate 3awater content 0aClidemia rubra 0aAmazonian berries 0aAlginate beads 0aBioactive compounds 0aSimulated digestibility1 aSouza da Silva, Laiane1 ada S.

Air pollutant exposure can be determined using dispersion models and refined with receptor models. Dispersion models offer the advantage of giving spatially distributed outdoor pollutants concentration while the receptor models offer the source apportionment of specific chemical species. However, the use of dispersion and/or receptor models in asthma research requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving experts on air quality and respiratory diseases. Here, we provide a literature review on the role of dispersion and receptor models in air pollution and asthma research, their limitations, gaps and the way forward. We found that the methodologies used to incorporate atmospheric dispersion and receptor models in human health studies may vary considerably, and several of the studies overlook features such as indoor air pollution, model validation and subject pathway between indoor spaces. Studies also show contrasting results of relative risk or odds ratio for a health outcome, even using similar methodologies. Dispersion models are mostly used to estimate air pollution levels outside the subject's home, school or workplace; however, very few studies addressed the subject's routines or indoor/outdoor relationships. Conversely, receptor models are employed in regions where asthma incidence/prevalence is high or where a dispersion model has been previously used for this assessment. Road traffic (vehicle exhaust) and NOx are found to be the most targeted source and pollutant, respectively. Other key findings were the absence of a standard indicator, shortage of studies addressing VOC and UFP, and the shift toward chemical speciation of exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair quality 3aasthma 3achemical speciation 3achemical species 3ahuman health 3aindoor air pollution 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3arelative risk 3atraffic 3aworking conditions 0aAsthma 0aAir pollution 0aExposure 0aSource apportionment 0aEpidemiology 0aHuman health1 aSantos, Jane Meri1 aGoulart, Elisa Valentim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0051-07781 aMill, José Geraldo1 aKumar, Prashant1 aReis Jr., Neyval Costa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6159-40630 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 287 p.117529-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1175293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245008400216300001600300520168100316592002801997650002202025650001102047650003102058650001502089650001202104650001102116650001402127650002302141650001002164650001202174653001302186653001502199653001602214653001302230653002502243653001502268653001402283773010302297856008702400852000902487655001202496IND60605956520221120073530.0180724e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060595652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonovan, Stephen K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3702-909610aProblematic aspects of the form and function of the stem in Palaeozoic crinoids  ap. 174-182.  aAlthough stemmed crinoids are well-known from modern oceans, the post-Palaeozoic Articulata represent a slender ‘twig’ that survived the demise of the many other clades forming a ‘bush’ of taxa that failed to survive the end-Permian mass extinction. Thus, although many aspects of form and ecology of extant stemmed crinoids can help explain the functional morphology and niche differentiation of Palaeozoic taxa, there are few close analogues among living members of the group. Most Palaeozoic crinoids have morphological features with no modern counterpart. This is particularly true of the stem – both column and attachment structure – which had a great variation of form, far wider than is recognized from the post-Palaeozoic. Primitive recumbent crinoids typically have a homeomorphic proxistele, which may also have been a feature of upright crinoids with only a weakly rheophilic habit. Primitive columns with broad, circular axial canals may be ‘hold overs’ from ancestral Hohlwurzeln (‘hollow roots’). This broad space may have been filled by perihaemal fluid, but it also may have included other, more ‘nutritious’ tissues attractive to predators and/or scavengers. Ordovician crinoid columnals had a greater range of symmetries than at any other time during the history of the group; many went extinct during or at the end of the period. Cyclic and pentagonal symmetry in the stems of extant crinoids may be due to the functional requirements of the crown. Attachment structures have a surprisingly poor fossil record, but it may be that some Palaeozoic crinoids were unattached as adults, yet retaining, at least in part, an erect attitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrdovician period 3aadults 3aecological differentiation 3aextinction 3afossils 3aoceans 3apredators 3arheophilic species 3astems 3atissues 0aCrinoids 0aPalaeozoic 0aAxial canal 0aSymmetry 0aAttachment structure 0aMorphology 0aEvolution0 tEarth-science reviews.g2016 Mar., v. 154 p.174-182dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013300165520186700298592002802165650002202193650001302215650002202228650001502250650002002265650000902285650001702294650001402311650001302325650001502338650001702353650001402370650001302384650002002397650002002417650000902437653001702446653001802463653002102481653002002502700001202522700001802534700001802552700001702570700001602587700005602603773011002659856008502769852000902854655001202863IND60741088620221122061138.0210820e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074108862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1175462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dong10aEffect of plastic film mulching and film residues on phthalate esters concentrations in soil and plants, and its risk assessment  aThe application of plastic film mulching can greatly improve dryland productivity, while the release of toxic phthalate esters (PAEs) from the plastic film has generated concern. This study investigated the effects of mulched plastic film and residual plastic film on the PAE concentrations in the soil-crop system and assessed the risks to people eating crop products. The PAEs concentration in the 0–25 cm soil layer of plastic mulched farmland was 0.45–0.81 mg/kg, while the average PAEs concentration of 0.37–0.73 mg/kg in non-mulched farmland decreased by 19%. The PAEs concentration in mulched soil reached the highest in July, being 0.80–0.84 mg/kg, while in the non-mulched soil, the PAEs also appeared and gradually decreased from May at 0.62–0.74 mg/kg to October, and the PAEs concentrations were almost the same in the mulched and non–mulched soils at the harvest time in October at 0.37–0.44 mg/kg. With the amounts of residual film in farmland increasing from 0 kg/ha to 2700 kg/ha (equivalent to the total amount of residual film after 60 years of continuous plastic film mulching), the PAEs concentrations were no significant changes, being 0.54–0.93 mg/kg. Maize (Zea mays L.) roots could absorb and accumulate PAEs, and the bio-concentration factor (BCF) was 1.6–2.3, and the average PAEs concentrations in stems, leaves, and grains were 79%–80% of those in roots at 0.77–1.47 mg/kg. For the ingestion of maize grains or potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers grown in plastic film mulched farmland or farmland containing residual film of 450–2700 kg/ha, the hazard index (HI) were less than 1, the carcinogenic risks (CRs) were 2.5 × 10⁻⁷–2.2 × 10⁻⁶, and the estrogenic equivalences were 6.17–17.73 ng E₂/kg.

Nanofibers usually perform well in hydrogels due to their unique properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of whey protein amyloid fibril (WPF) on the properties ofheat-set whey proteinisolate (WPI)gels with fine-stranded or particulate microstructure (at pH 7). The results show that by adding WPF, a homogenous and dense network was observed in fine-stranded gel, while the formation of a coarse and amorphous structure with microphase separation intensified in particulate gel. By adding 1% WPF, the elastic modulus of gels increased about 10.6 and 3.6 times in the case of fine-stranded and particulate gels, respectively. In fine-stranded gels, adding WPF to the gel led to a decrease in the Tg value (from 66.33 to 59.36 °C) and a decrease in tan δ (from 0.2328 to 0.0837), indicating an increase in gel strength because of WPF. In contrast, adding WPF to particulate gels did not cause significant changes in the Tg and tan δ. There was a decrease in the water holding property of particulate gels when WPF was added, whereas it did not change significantly in fine-stranded gels. These findings imply that the efficiency of WPF in WPI gels depends not only on the WPF concentration but also on the type of the WPI gel. In sum, WPF enhances order in the structural network of fine-stranded gels, while accelerating the formation of inhomogeneous random aggregates in particulate gels. Creating fiber-hydrogels with different microstructures and rheological properties can be possible by controlling WPI aggregation (as in amyloid fibril, fine-strand or particulate aggregates).  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3afood research 3agel strength 3ahydrogels 3amicrostructure 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananofibers 3apH 3awhey 3awhey protein isolate 0aWhey protein isolate 0aAmyloid fibril 0aComposite gel 0aRheology properties 0aFine-stranded microstructure 0aParticulate microstructure1 aSun, Cuixia1 aHe, Jun1 aLu, Wei1 aFang, Yapeng0 tFood research international.g2021 Feb., v. 140 p.109856-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1098563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008800170520093200258592002801190650002301218650001501241650001101256650001801267650001701285650001101302650001301313650003001326650001501356650001501371650002001386650001501406653001901421653001901440653001301459653002801472700001601500700001801516700001801534700001201552700001401564700001301578700001701591773011101608856008601719852000901805655001201814IND60716295320221120170725.0220606e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071629532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1098582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Qianqian10aReview of the relationships among polysaccharides, gut microbiota, and human health  aAs a complex ecosystem of the human body, the intestinal flora maintains a dynamic balance with the host and plays an irreplaceable role in life activities such as nutritional metabolism and host immunity.

Therefore, several studies have been conducted over the past decades to quantify gully headcut retreat (GHR) in different environments. Although these led to important site-specific and regional insights, the overall importance of this erosion process or the factors that control it at a global scale remain poorly understood. This study aims to bridge this gap by reviewing research on GHR and conducting a meta-analysis of measured GHR rates worldwide. Through an extensive literature review, GHR rates for 933 individual and actively retreating gullies have been compiled from more than 70 study areas worldwide (comprising a total measuring period of >19 600years). Each GHR rate was measured through repeated field surveys and/or analyses of aerial photographs over a period of at least one year (maximum: 97years, median: 17years). The data show a very large variability, both in terms of gully dimensions (cross-sectional areas ranging between 0.11 and 816m² with a median of 4m²) and volumetric GHR rates (ranging between 0.002 and 47 430m³year⁻¹ with a median of 2.2m³year⁻¹). Linear GHR rates vary between 0.01 and 135myear⁻¹ (median: 0.89myear⁻¹), while areal GHR rates vary between 0.01 and 3628m²year⁻¹ (median: 3.12m²year⁻¹). An empirical relationship allows estimating volumetric retreat rates from areal retreat rates with acceptable uncertainties. By means of statistical analyses for a subset of 724 gullies with a known contributing area, we explored the factors most relevant in explaining the observed 7 orders of magnitudes of variation in volumetric GHR rates. Results show that measured GHR rates are significantly correlated to the runoff contributing area of the gully (r²=0.15) and the rainy day normal (RDN; i.e. the long-term average annual rainfall depth divided by the average number of rainy days; r²=0.47). Other factors (e.g. land use or soil type) showed no significant correlation with the observed GHR rates. This may be attributed to the uncertainties associated with accurately quantifying these factors. In addition, available time series data demonstrate that GHR rates are subject to very large year-to-year variations. As a result, average GHR rates measured over short (<5year) measuring periods may be subject to very large (>100%) uncertainties. We integrated our findings into a weighted regression model that simulates the volumetric retreat rate of a gully headcut as a function of upstream drainage area and RDN. When weighing each GHR observation proportional to its measuring period, this model explains 68% of the observed variance in GHR rates at a global scale. For 76% of the monitored gullies, the simulated GHR values deviate less than one order of magnitude from their corresponding observed value. Our model clearly indicates that GHR rates are very sensitive to rainfall intensity. Since these intensities are expected to increase in most areas as a result of climate change, our results suggest that gully erosion worldwide will become more intense and widespread in the following decades. Finally, we discuss research topics that will help to address these challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3aclimate change 3adrainage 3agully erosion 3aland use 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3arain 3arain intensity 3aravines 3aregression analysis 3arunoff 3asoil types 3asurveys 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3avariance 0aGully erosion 0aData compilation 0aGlobal analysis 0aModel 0aClimatic impact 0aTemporal variability1 aPoesen, Jean1 aVan Mele, Bert1 aDemuzere, Matthias1 aBruynseels, Amber1 aGolosov, Valentin1 aBezerra, José Fernando Rodrigues1 aBolysov, Sergey1 aDvinskih, Aleksandr1 aFrankl, Amaury1 aFuseina, Yulia1 aGuerra, Antonio José Teixeira,1 aHaregeweyn, Nigussie1 aIoniță, Ion,1 aMakanzu Imwangana, Fils1 aMoeyersons, Jan1 aMoshe, Itshack1 aNazari Samani, Aliakbar1 aNiacsu, Lilian1 aNyssen, Jan1 aŌtsuki, Yoshinori,1 aRădoane, Maria,1 aRysin, Ivan1 aRyzhov, Yuri V.1 aYermolaev, Oleg0 tEarth-science reviews.g2016 Mar., v. 154 p.336-355dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2016.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001600147245013800163300001600301520086600317592002801183650001201211650002301223650001101246651000901257700002001266773010201286856008301388852000901471655001201480IND4447630220221119004523.0150810e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444763022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2010.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVos, Jeroen10aVolumetric water control in a large-scale open canal irrigation system with many smallholders: The case of Chancay-Lambayeque in Peru  ap. 705-714.  aVolumetric water control (VWC) is widely seen as a means to increase productivity through flexible scheduling and user incentives to apply just enough water. However, the technical and social requirements for VWC are poorly understood. Also, many experts assert that VWC in large-scale open canals with many smallholders is not feasible. This article debates the practice of VWC, drawing on field studies in the arid North Coast of Peru. Here the large-scale Chancay-Lambayeque irrigation system achieved high allocation, distribution and financial performance with on demand delivery to some 22,000 smallholdings, under a VWC approach, with full cost recovery for operation and maintenance. This study shows there are options to promote VWC if its different elements â volumetric allocation, distribution, metering and pricing â are planned together.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperts 3airrigation systems 3aprices 3aPeru1 aVincent, Linden0 tAgricultural water management.g2011 Feb., v. 98, no. 4 p.705-714dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2010.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008400163300001600247520169100263592002801954650002301982650001102005650001202016650001902028650001102047650002002058650001802078650001102096650001302107650000902120650001702129650001102146650001402157650002002171650001602191650001302207650001702220651001002237651001002247700002402257700001702281700001802298773011502316856008102431852000902512655001202521IND60119931220221121064023.0160228e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011993122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-014-0651-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Liang10aClimate-related flood risks and urban responses in the Pearl River Delta, China  ap. 379-391.  aGrowing concern on climate-related flood hazards has led to increasing interest in understanding the interactions between climate, flood, and human responses. This paper jointly investigates climate change trends, impacts on flood events, flood vulnerability and risk, and response strategies in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), a rapidly urbanizing coastal area in southeast China. Our analysis based on a reanalysis dataset and model projections are integrated with literature results, which indicates a climate scenario of increasing mean temperature, precipitation, sea level, typhoon intensity, and the frequency of extreme weather events in the PRD. These trends, together with the continuing urbanization in flood-prone areas, are expected to increase flood frequency and aggravate both the scale and degree of flooding in the PRD area. We further estimate the flood vulnerability of the 11 PRD cities using the indicator system method. The results suggest that the exposure and sensitivity of central cities (Hong Kong, Macao, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou) are very high because of highly exposed populations and assets located in lowland areas. However, the potential vulnerability and risk can be low due to high adaptive capacities (both by hard and soft flood-control measures). A novel framework on flood responses is proposed to identify vulnerable links and response strategies in different phases of a flood event. It further suggests that the flood risks can be mitigated by developing an integrated climate response strategy, releasing accurate early warning and action guidance, sharing flood-related information, and applying the advantages of online social network analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3acities 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aflood control 3ahumans 3alowlands 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asea level 3asocial networks 3atemperature 3atyphoons 3aurbanization 3aChina 3aMacau1 aScheffran, Jürgen,1 aQin, Huapeng1 aYou, Qinglong0 tRegional environmental change.g2015 Feb., v. 15, no. 2 p.379-391dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-37987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-014-0651-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01571naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245011300158300001800271520053700289592002800826650002300854650002700877650002300904650004400927650001900971650001600990700001801006700002301024773012901047856007201176852000901248655001201257IND60658526020221118031946.0190817e20091114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065852602DNAL7 a10.1039/b916457j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalter, Marc D.10aγ-Agostic interactions stabilize the propagating species in the vinyl addition polymerization of norbornene  ap. 6361-6363.  aCationic [(tmeda)Pd(OEt₂)(Me)][B(ArF)₄] was synthesized by protonation of (tmeda)PdMe₂ and allowed for the first time the nature of the propagating species in the vinyl addition polymerization of norbornene to be discerned.

However, the accuracy of existing electrochemical sensors is hurdled by the immobility of targeted ions, ion adsorption to soil particles, and sensor reading noise and drifting over time. In this study, polyacrylamide hydrogel with a thickness of 0.45 μm was coated on the surface of solid-state ion-selective membrane (S-ISM) sensors to absorb water contained in soil and, consequently, enhance the accuracy (R² > 0.98) and stability (drifting < 0.3 mV/h) of these sensors monitoring ammonium (NH₄⁺) and nitrate (NO₃⁻⁾ ions in soil. An ion transport model was built to simulate the long-term NH₄⁺ dynamic process (R² > 0.7) by considering the soil adsorption process and soil complexity. Furthermore, a soil-based denoising data processing algorithm (S-DDPA) was developed based on the unique features of soil sensors including the nonlinear mass transfer and ion diffusion on the heterogeneous sensor–hydrogel–soil interface. The 14 day tests using real-world soil demonstrated the effectiveness of S-DDPA to eliminate false signals and retrieve the actual soil nitrogen information for accurate (error: <2 mg/L) and continuous monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  a1706343cDivision of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systemsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000146  a1935599cDivision of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systemsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000146  a2001544cDivision of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000147  aNAcUniversity of Connecticutdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007710 3aadsorption 3aalgorithms 3aammonium 3aelectrochemistry 3aenvironmental science 3ahydrogels 3amass transfer 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3apolyacrylamide 3asoil 3atechnology 0asolid-state ion-selective membrane sensors 0apolyacrylamide hydrogel 0asoil nitrogen fate 0acontinuous monitoring 0a3D electrospray 0asoil-based denoising data processing algorithm1 aWang, Xingyu1 aQian, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8904-28021 aDixit, Anand1 aHerman, Brianna1 aLei, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0184-03731 aMcCutcheon, Jeffrey1 aLi, Baikun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5623-59120 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 Mar. 11, v. 56, no. 8 p.4905-4914dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c056613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016000163300001400323520170500337592002802042650002302070650001502093650001602108650001902124650001302143650002202156650001902178650002302197650001402220650001202234650003302246650002702279650001802306650001002324650002302334650001502357650001002372650001802382650001602400650002402416650001302440650001402453650001302467650001902480650001202499650002302511650001702534650002402551653002202575653001002597653001702607653002202624653002002646700002102666700001302687700001902700700001702719773011102736856008202847852000902929655001202938IND60553905920221120132439.0161023e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055390592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2015.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rui10aMolecular characterization of the Chinese alligator follicle-stimulating hormone β subunit (FSHβ) and its expression during the female reproductive cycle  ap. 49-57.  aThe Chinese alligator Alligator sinensis is an endangered species endemic to China, it has a highly specialized reproductive pattern with low fecundity. Up to date, little is known about the regulation of its female reproductive cycle. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a glycoprotein hormone, plays a key role in stimulating and regulating ovarian follicular development and egg production. In this study, the complete FSHβ cDNA from the ovary of the Chinese alligator was obtained for the first time, it consists of 843-bp nucleotides, including 120-bp nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR), 396-bp of the open reading frame, and 3′-UTR of 327-bp nucleotides. It encodes a 131-amino acid precursor molecule of FSHβ with a signal peptide of 18 amino acids followed by a mature protein of 113 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence shares high identities with the American alligator (100%) and birds (89–92%). Phylogenetic tree analysis of the FSHβ amino acid sequence indicated that alligators cluster into the bird branch. Tissue distribution analyses indicated that FSHβ mRNA is expressed in ovary, intestine and liver with the highest level in the ovary, while not in stomach, pancreas, heart, thymus and thyroid. Expression of FSHβ in ovary increases in May (breeding prophase) and peaks in July (breeding period), it is maintained at high levels through September, then decreases significantly in November (post-reproductive period) and remains relatively low from January to March (hibernating period). These temporal changes of FSHβ expression implicated that it might play an important role in promoting ovarian development during the female reproductive cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlligator sinensis 3aalligators 3aamino acids 3aanimal ovaries 3abreeding 3acomplementary DNA 3aegg production 3aendangered species 3afecundity 3afemales 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3afollicular development 3aglycoproteins 3aheart 3aindigenous species 3aintestines 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3apancreas 3aphylogeny 3aprophase 3asignal peptide 3astomach 3atemporal variation 3athymus gland 3atissue distribution 0aChinese alligator 0aFSHβ 0acDNA cloning 0aHomology analysis 0aGene expression1 aZhang, Shengzhou1 aZhu, Xue1 aZhou, Yongkang1 aWu, Xiaobing0 tComparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part B.g2015 May, v. 183 p.49-57dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2015.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01625naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011800164300001800282520053900300592002800839650001400867650002500881650001700906650002400923650002300947651002100970651002200991700002501013700002401038700003101062773010401093856008101197852000901278655001201287IND60585295120221119221028.0171108e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058529512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-017-9516-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSainz, Paula14aThe genus Artemisia: distribution and phytochemistry in the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary and Balearic Islands  ap. 1023-1043.  aThis review summarizes the species distribution of the genus Artemisia in the Iberian Peninsula and the Canarian and Balearic Archipelagos, describing their conservation status according to the European and the Spanish Red List.

There are two parts of laboratory and modeling in this study. In the laboratory part, hybrid nanofluid (HNF) with solid volume fractions (SVFs) of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1% and different temperatures of T = 5 , 15 , 25 , 35 , 45 and 55 °C and different shear rates (SRs) are prepared. Power-law index and shear stress changes show that HNFs have non-Newtonian behavior of the shear-thinning type. Increasing the temperature from T = 5-55 °C shows that the viscosity of HNFs decreases significantly by 82%. In general, the addition of NPs increases the viscosity, but at low SVFs, such as 0.05%, the addition of NPs reduces the viscosity of HNF. The proposed modeling for viscosity and relative viscosity have correlation coefficients of 0.9963 and 0.9585, respectively. Deviation from the standard is also in the range of (−10%,+12%). MWCNT-MgO/10 W40 HNF had better economic performance compared to MWCNT-ZnO/10 W40 and MWCNT-TiO₂ /10 W40 HNFs in SVF = 0.05%. In SVF = 1%, the greatest increase in sensitivity occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic performance 3ananofluids 3aoils 3ashear stress 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aViscosity 0aPrice analysis 0aMWCNT-MgO (1:1)/10W40 0aRheological properties 0aCorrelation 0aHybrid Nanofluid1 aMotallebi, Sayyid Majid1 aToghraie, Davood0 tPowder technology.g2022 June, v. 405 p.117472-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2022.1174723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002400156245011800180300001400298520183500312592002802147650002402175650002802199650001502227650001002242650001802252650002602270650001702296650001002313650001902323650001502342650003102357650001502388650002602403650002202429650001302451650000902464650001502473650001102488653001502499653002802514653001902542653002402561653001402585653001302599653001102612653002902623700002302652700002902675700001602704700002502720773009102745856009102836852000902927655001202936IND60625814120221119192606.0190131e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062581412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenderson, Cassi J.10aGene to diagnostic: Self immobilizing protein for silica microparticle biosensor, modelled with sarcosine oxidase  ap. 58-70.  aA rational design approach is proposed for a multifunctional enzyme reagent for point-of-care diagnostics. The biomaterial reduces downstream isolation steps and eliminates immobilization coupling chemicals for integration in a diagnostic platform. Fusion constructs combined the central functional assay protein (e.g. monomeric sarcosine oxidase, mSOx, horseradish peroxidase, HRP), a visualizing protein (e.g. mCherry) and an in-built immobilization peptide (e.g. R5). Monitoring protein expression in E.coli was facilitated by following the increase in mCherry fluorescence, which could be matched to a color card, indicating when good protein expression has occurred. The R5 peptide (SSKKSGSYSGSKGSKRRIL) provided inbuilt affinity for silica and an immobilization capability for a silica based diagnostic, without requiring additional chemical coupling reagents. Silica particles extracted from beach sand were used to collect protein from crude protein extract with 85–95% selective uptake. The silica immobilized R5 proteins were stable for more than 2 months at room temperature. The Km for the silica-R52-mCh-mSOx-R5-6H was 16.5 ± 0.9 mM (compared with 16.5 ± 0.4 mM, 16.3 ± 0.3 mM, and 16.1 ± 0.4 mM for R52-mCh-mSOx-R5-6H, mSOx-R5-6H and mSOx-6H respectively in solution). The use of the “silica-enzymes” in sarcosine and peroxide assays was shown, and a design using particle sedimentation through the sample was examined. Using shadowgraphy and particle image velocimetry the particle trajectory through the sample was mapped and an hourglass design with a narrow waist shown to give good control of particle position. The hourglass biosensor was demonstrated for sarcosine assay in the clinically useful range of 2.5–10 μM in both a dynamic and end point measurement regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiocompatible materials 3abiosensors 3acolor 3acrude protein 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescence 3agenes 3amicroparticles 3amonitoring 3aparticle image velocimetry 3aperoxidase 3apoint-of-care systems 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3asand 3asarcosines 3asilica 0aBiosensors 0aMultifunctional protein 0aImmobilization 0aProtein engineering 0aSarcosine 0aSilaffin 0aSilica 0aResource-poor production1 aPumford, Elizabeth1 aSeevaratnam, Dushanth J.1 aDaly, Ronan1 aHall, Elizabeth A.H.0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Feb., v. 193 p.58-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245008900174520176900263592002802032650002002060650001402080650001102094650001102105650001902116650002302135650001702158650001302175650001002188650002202198650001702220650001102237650002402248650001802272651001302290653002302303653001902326653002802345653001202373653002302385700001602408700001902424773009502443856008902538852000902627655001202636IND60655309720221119163345.0200103e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065530972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1041172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetri, Aaron C.10aPlanning the urban forest: Adding microclimate simulation to the planner’s toolkit  aWhile cities across the United States are developing urban forest plans to capitalize on a myriad of ecosystem services provided by trees, the tools that are used to support this planning do not necessarily meet the needs and achieve the desired results of these municipal initiatives. This paper highlights the disconnect between how planners and academics are approaching the task of planning and managing the urban forest for climate change adaptation. Although planners tend to focus on maximizing canopy coverage, academics utilize microclimate simulation to evaluate the impact of different interventions on heat island mitigation. We argue that while the i-Tree suite is the most commonly used tool and is immensely helpful for urban forest planners, cities and communities concerned with heat island mitigation should also leverage microclimate simulation tools to better understand the likely impacts of a plan. This study provides a general critique of the i-Tree tool for planning and illustrates how, when used with a microclimate simulation tool, the siting of street trees can have a greater impact on heat island mitigation. The focus here is on the community-scale impact of trees and a microclimate simulation model of a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois where tree canopy coverage is less than 10% and consistently declining is presented. We find that when microclimate is considered during the tree siting process, trees have a greater impact on surface and air temperatures during the summer. Reduced ground surface temperatures of around 3 ℃ to 7.5 ℃ were achieved around 13:00 (1:00 pm), whereas the impact of trees from shading had the greatest impact (0.75 ℃ to 7.75 ℃) on nearby buildings in the mid-afternoon (15:00 to 17:00 h).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abuildings 3acanopy 3acities 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3amicroclimate 3aplanning 3ashade 3asimulation models 3astreet trees 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3aurban forests 3aIllinois 0aUrban heat islands 0aUrban greening 0aMicroclimate simulation 0aChicago 0aClimate adaptation1 aWilson, Bev1 aKoeser, Andrew0 tLand use policy.g2019 Nov., v. 88 p.104117-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1041173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04274naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016300167300001400330520254000344592002802884650002002912650001102932650001202943650001602955650001202971650002002983650002503003650001903028650001503047650001803062650001503080650002403095650002303119650002203142650001103164650001103175650001803186650001903204650001803223650002103241650001703262651001003279653002003289653001003309653002903319653001803348653005603366700002003422700001903442700001303461700001703474773009803491856008603589852000903675655001203684IND60584246720221120143612.0201202e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058424672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jingbo14aThe establishment of season-specific eutrophication assessment standards for a water-supply reservoir located in Northeast China based on chlorophyll-a levels  ap. 11-20.  aEutrophication has become the primary problem facing most surface water bodies worldwide, especially when the water body serves as a water supply source. Substantial efforts have been made to prevent and control eutrophication from decades ago. Among them, the establishment of eutrophication assessment standards was rather essential. However, until now, there is no authoritative standard established for the assessment of eutrophication level in developing countries such as in China. For water bodies located in the Northeast China, the level of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), which is proportional to phytoplankton biomass, tends to be subjected to evident seasonal variations as the phytoplankton biomass and species composition are greatly impacted by the seasonally alternated climate, hydrology and pollutants source, which in turn complicated the eutrophication problem. The establishment of season-specific eutrophication assessment standards was thus extremely significant for water bodies located in regions with large air temperature variations. In this study, water quality parameters were detected over five consecutive years (2011–2015) to assess the seasonal trophic state of a water-supply reservoir located in Northeast China. Bivariate and multiple regression were performed between Chl-a and other water quality parameters in different seasons. The trophic state of each season was evaluated by the comprehensive trophic level index and the season-specific eutrophication assessment standards were established. The results showed that phosphorus was the predominant limiting nutrient of eutrophication and the Chl-a levels were seasonally different. The reservoir was generally in a light-eutrophic state. Mesotrophic assessment standards were established for spring, summer and autumn and light-eutrophic assessment standards for autumn based on the water quality data collected. As the predominant nutrient, the concentrations of total phosphorus for the mesotrophic state for spring, summer and autumn were 0.044, 0.028 and 0.038mg/L, respectively. Moreover, as shown by the mesotrophic and light-eutrophic standards of the autumn, the discrepancy of different parameters between the standards of different trophic level was were not necessarily varied in the same trend. In conclusion, the establishment of season-specific eutrophication standards for water bodies located in regions with large air temperature variations was significant for scientific trophic state evaluation and effective eutrophication control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adeveloping countries 3aeutrophication 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3apollutants 3aregression analysis 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3atrophic levels 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 3awater supply 3aChina 0aSeasonal shifts 0aChl-a 0aWater quality parameters 0aTrophic state 0aSeason-specific eutrophication assessment standards1 aZhang, Chongjun1 aZheng, Guochen1 aXue, Jie1 aZhang, Lanhe0 tEcological indicators.g2018 Feb., v. 85 p.11-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011100167300001400278520081900292592002801111650002201139650001101161650002501172650002301197650001101220650001701231650001601248650001601264650001301280650001001293700001701303700001801320700002001338700001701358700001601375773011401391856004801505990002301553852000901576655001201585IND50061668220221119004524.0130319e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006166822DNAL7 a10.1134/S10703284130100532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotovaya, A.

Isolated ommochromes showed fluorescence with emission maxima at 460–470 nm and 525–535 nm, the intensity of which increased abruptly during their oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. The method of chemiluminescence quenching of luminol was used to determine the antiradical activity of ommochromes; the constant value was (1.2 ± 0.5) × 10⁴ M–¹. A finely dispersed mixture of ommochromes in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing bovine serum albumin (2.0 mg/mL) showed antimicrobial activity against B. subtilis ATCC 6633, Candida albicans ATCC 2091, and Aspergillus niger INA 00760. The H. illucens imago was concluded to be a promising renewable source of natural pigments with good antioxidant characteristics and antibacterial properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCandida albicans 3aHermetia illucens 3aantibacterial properties 3abovine serum albumin 3abuffers 3achemiluminescence 3aeyes 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimagos 3aoxidation 3apH 3apigments 3apotassium phosphates1 aUshakova, N.

It offers an unprecedented opportunity to study impact-related phenomena as well the geology of the crust in the Amazonis Planitia region of Mars. For example, the nearly pristine condition enables the partial reconstruction of the sequence of events for crater formation, as well as facilitates a comparison to deposits seen at the Ries crater in Germany. High-resolution images taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) and Context Camera (CTX) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft have revealed a wealth of information on the distribution of features within the crater and beyond the rim: a large central peak, pitted material on the floor and terrace blocks, lobate flows interpreted to be sediment flows, impact melt sheets, four discrete layers of ejecta, and an asymmetric secondary crater field. Topographic data derived from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) and stereo HiRISE and CTX images show that the central peak is ∼1100m high, the lowest point of the crater floor is 1274m below the highest part of the rim, and the crater rim has ∼600m of variability around its perimeter. Layering within the cavity walls indicates ∼260m of structural uplift of the target material, which constitutes ∼35% of the total relief of the rim. Abundant evidence is found for water flowing down the cavity walls, and on the surface of the ejecta layers, both of which took place sometime after the impact event. Thickness measurements of the ejecta layers reveal that the continuous blanket is remarkably thin (∼3–5m) in some places, and that the distal ramparts may be ∼60m high. Crater counts made on the ejecta layers indicate a model age of <3Ma for the formation of Tooting crater, and that the target rocks have a model age of ∼240–375Ma. It is therefore possible that this may be the source of certain basaltic shergottite meteorites ejected at ∼2.8Ma that have crystallization ages which are comparable to those of the basaltic lava flows that formed the target materials for this impact event. The geology and geomorphology of Tooting crater may help in the interpretation of older large impact craters on Mars, as well as the potential role of target volatiles in the impact cratering process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aimage analysis 3alava 3amelting 3arocks 3aterraces 3aGermany1 aBoyce, Joseph,0 tChemie der Erde - Geochemistry - Interdisciplinary Journal for Chemical Problems of the Geosciences and Geoecology.g2012 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.1-23dElsevier GmbHx0009-28197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemer.2011.12.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013400164300001800298520168100316592002801997650001102025650002502036650002202061650001602083650003202099650003002131650001302161650001402174650002902188700005402217700001602271773014502287856008302432852000902515655001202524IND60767663120221119075957.0220220e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076766312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-021-01590-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Hayat10aEnvironmental innovation, trade openness and quality institutions: an integrated investigation about environmental sustainability  ap. 3832-3862.  aEnvironmental degradation has become an important issue for countries worldwide due to increase in carbon emission in recent years. It is an important concern for countries to achieve environmental sustainability; however, the debate on the role of innovation and institutions in environmental sustainability is still not adequate. There is a lack of understanding as to how countries can achieve higher economic growth as well to protect the quality of environment. Innovation is considered as effective tools as it enhances energy efficiency and cleaner production, which in turn lowers carbon emission. Quality institutions have also been considered as it enhances the quality of environment. Consequently, this study investigates trade openness, innovation and quality institutions in environmental sustainability in 176 countries of the world. By employing OLS regression, fixed effect and generalized method of moments, the results show that trade openness, renewable energy consumption and foreign direct investment are negatively associated with carbon emission, whereas most of institutional quality indicators significantly contribute to environmental sustainability; however, it is still below the desired level to enhance the quality of environment. Innovation positively and innovation square negatively affect carbon emission. Our analysis also confirms the existence of environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis and pollution halo hypothesis. The findings suggest policy makers on further improvement of trade policies, innovations, promotions of political and legal institutions and promotion of renewable energy sources to cope with environmental sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aeconomic development 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental Kuznets curve 3aforeign direct investment 3apolitics 3apollution 3arenewable energy sources1 aWeili, Liu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3795-87411 aKhan, Itbar0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2022 Mar., v. 24, no. 3 p.3832-3862dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01590-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04198naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245022400167500001900391520232000410592002802730650001402758650001602772650003702788650002102825650001602846650002102862650001702883650004902900650002002949650001302969650002402982650001603006650002603022650001703048650001903065650001803084650001303102650001303115650001403128650002603142650001003168653003303178653002503211653002803236653002003264653002003284700001703304700001703321700001703338700001703355700001603372700001703388773009703405856008503502852000903587655001203596IND60687288520221123030309.0210201e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068728852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1157242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhihong10aExtracellular polymeric substance decomposition linked to hydrogen recovery from waste activated sludge: Role of peracetic acid and free nitrous acid co-pretreatment in a prefermentation-bioelectrolysis cascading system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFree nitrous acid (FNA) has been recently reported to be an effective and eco-friendly inactivator for waste activated sludge (WAS), while the limited decomposition of the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix hampers resource recovery from WAS. This work employed peracetic acid (PAA) to assist FNA and explored the contribution of co-pretreatment to hydrogen recovery in a prefermentation-bioelectrolysis cascading system. The results showed that co-pretreatment led to approximately 8.8% and 20.4% increases in the exfoliation of particulate proteins and carbohydrates, respectively, from tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) over that of sole FNA pretreatment. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis verified that the synergistic effect of FNA, PAA and various generated free radicals was the essential process. This effect further promoted the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) after 96 h of prefermentation, and the peak concentration in co-pretreated WAS (AD-FPWAS) was approximately 2.5-fold that in sole FNA-pretreated WAS (AD-FWAS). Subsequently, the cascading utilization of organics in the bioelectrolysis step contributed to efficient hydrogen generation. A total of 10.8 ± 0.3 mg H₂/g VSS was harvested in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) fed with AD-FPWAS, while 6.2 ± 0.1 mg H₂/g VSS was obtained from AD-FWAS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the effective decomposition of the phospholipid bilayer in the cytomembrane and the transformation of macromolecular organics into VFAs and hydrogen in the cascading system. Further microbial community analysis demonstrated that co-pretreatment enhanced the accumulation of functional consortia, including anaerobic fermentative bacteria (AFB, 28.1%), e.g., Macellibacteroides (6.3%) and Sedimentibacter (6.9%), and electrochemically active bacteria (EAB, 57.0%), e.g., Geobacter (39.0%) and Pseudomonas (13.6%), in the prefermentation and MEC steps, respectively. The possible synergetic and competitive relationships among AFB, EAB, homo-acetogens, nitrate-reducing bacteria and methanogens were explored by molecular ecological network analysis. From an environmental and economic perspective, this promising FNA and PAA co-pretreatment approach provides new insight for energy recovery from WAS biorefineries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacter 3aPseudomonas 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivated sludge 3abiorefining 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy recovery 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3anitrous acid 3aperacetic acid 3aphospholipids 3apolymers 3aresearch 3asynergism 3atrophic relationships 3awater 0aWaste activated sludge (WAS) 0aPeracetic acid (PAA) 0aFree nitrous acid (FNA) 0aPrefermentation 0aBioelectrolysis1 aZhou, Aijuan1 aLiu, Hongyan1 aWang, Sufang1 aLiu, Wenzong1 aWang, Aijie1 aYue, Xiuping0 tWater research.g2020 June 01, v. 176 p.115724-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1157243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245010700168300001400275520155400289592002801843650001901871650002401890650001601914650001201930650001601942650001501958650001301973650001501986650001302001650001302014650002302027650001402050650001302064650001602077653001502093653002002108653000902128653001402137653002402151653001602175700001402191700001502205700001702220700001202237700001202249700001202261773007502273856008902348852000902437655001202446IND60561039520221119161521.0170713e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056103952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing14aThe role of ash content on bisphenol A sorption to biochars derived from different agricultural wastes  ap. 66-73.  aInorganic minerals are important compositions in biochars, but their roles in biochar functions are investigated limitedly, which restricted our understanding on biochar applications. This study applied different biomasses to produce biochars. Their properties as well as sorption to bisphenol A (BPA) were studied, with a major focus on the role of inorganic compositions. Oxalates, carbonates, as well as KCl crystals were observed in the produced biochars depending on the feedstocks and temperatures. Oxalates and KCl formed at relatively low temperature (200–300 °C), while carbonates generally formed at pyrolysis temperature above 400 °C. The separated insoluble crystal particles and the dissolved salts have limited contribution to the apparent BPA sorption, but ash content removal altered BPA sorption. The potential impact of inorganic composition to BPA sorption should be resulted from biochar properties. Based on biochar characterization and sorption comparison before and after ash removal, we proposed that the formation of inorganic mineral compositions in biochar particles may have blocked the inner pores, which limited the significance of these sorption sites. As a result, the interactions of BPA and biochars were mostly determined by biochar surface functional groups. The acid treatment removed most of the inorganic compositions, and exposed more sorption sites, which consequently increased BPA sorption. Biochar sorption capacity may be further increased if the accessibility of the inner pores could be enhanced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3aagricultural wastes 3aash content 3abiochar 3abisphenol A 3acarbonates 3acrystals 3afeedstocks 3aminerals 3aoxalates 3apotassium chloride 3apyrolysis 3asorption 3atemperature 0aAdsorption 0aCalcium oxalate 0aChar 0aDe-ashing 0aEndocrine disruptor 0aInner pores1 aLiang, Ni1 aJin, Xiuqi1 aZhou, Dandan1 aLi, Hao1 aWu, Min1 aPan, Bo0 tChemosphere.g2017 Mar., v. 171 p.66-73dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245007600209300001600285500002900301520112900330592002801459596002601487596003501513650001701548650002101565650002701586650002601613650002001639650001701659650001301676651001101689700002701700700002601727700002701753700002901780773009801809856008301907852000901990655001201999IND60719186420221122042720.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071918642DNAL7 a10.1007/s12228-020-09632-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Daniel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8621-022210aSpecies delimitation in the Echinocereus pulchellus complex (Cactaceae)  ap. 433-452.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aSpecies delimitation in Cactaceae is a challenging task due to the proliferation of species and subspecies names. Echinocereus pulchellus occurs across a wide geographical range in Mexico and presents numerous polymorphisms. The species complex has been considered to comprise five subspecies. In the present work, we analyze morphological variation across the E. pulchellus complex to establish the taxonomic limits of the complex, to delimit taxa within it, and to determine whether morphological variation is associated with climate variables. Multivariate analyses of 50 morphological characters were conducting in a sample of ten populations representing all five of the previously recognized subspecies of the E. pulchellus complex. The results support the recognition of four distinct species, one of which contains two subspecies, and necessitate three new combinations: Echinocereus acanthosetus, E. sharpii, and E. weinbergii subsp. venustus. Six vegetative and two floral characters define the morphological limits between taxa. Correlation with climate variables was detected in the populations of E. weinbergii.  aPublisher supplied data  aIN213217cUNAM PAPIIT  aproject 985cCátedras CONACYT 3aEchinocereus 3aclimatic factors 3afloral characteristics 3amultivariate analysis 3anew combination 3apolymorphism 3asampling 3aMexico1 aGómez-Quintero, David1 aVargas Ponce, Ofelia,1 aCarrillo Reyes, Pablo,1 aDávila-Aranda, Patricia0 tBrittonia.g2020 Dec., v. 72, no. 4 p.433-452dSpringer USwJournal:jnl49542x0007-196X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12228-020-09632-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010000161300001600261500001500277520127100292592002801563650001401591650002201605650002601627650001501653650001401668650001301682650001101695650001401706650002701720650003701747650005201784650001401836650000701850650002501857650001501882650002401897650001501921650001601936650001801952653001201970653003601982653002102018653001502039653002002054700001602074700001502090700001602105700001502121773007802136856008102214852000902295655001202304IND60519871720221117213927.0160511e20110220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051987172DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-011-0014-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bo10aCloning and functional expression of α-galactosidase cDNA from Penicillium janczewskii zaleski  ap. 205-212.  a2019-12-06  aIn recent years, α-galactosidase has been attracting more and more attention because of its potential applications in many aspects. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, a full-length cDNA sequence composed of 2,439 bp was cloned from Penicillium janczewskii zaleski and was subcloned into pPICZαA and transformed into Pichia pastoris strain X-33. In a 10-L fermentor, the recombinant yeast expressed α-galactosidase with a yield of 254 U/mL by methanol induction for 120 h. The recombinant enzyme showed the optimal activity at 40°C and pH 5.2. The K m values of the recombinant enzyme using p-nitrophenyl-α-D-galactopyranoside (pNPG), melibiose, raffinose and stachyose as substrates were 1, 16, 17.8 and 5.3 mM, respectively. V max values were 227.3, 116.7, 104.8, and 80.6 μM/min using pNPG, melibiose, raffinose and stachyose as substrates, respectively. The α-galactosidase exhibited no sensitivity to various metal ions and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose and stachyose with different levels of galactose release. The biochemical characteristics of the α-galactosidase suggest that the enzyme may have a prospective application in feed industry as an additive.  aPublisher supplied data 3amelibiose 3acomplementary DNA 3aKomagataella pastoris 3afermenters 3agalactose 3amethanol 3ayeasts 3araffinose 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astachyose 3apH 3anucleotide sequences 3ahydrolysis 3aalpha-galactosidase 3ametal ions 3aPenicillium 3afeed industry 0acloning 0aPenicillium janczewskii zaleski 0aα-galactosidase 0aexpression 0aPichia pastoris1 aChen, Yiqun1 aLi, Zhimin1 aLu, Wenqing1 aCao, Yunhe0 tBiologia.g2011 Feb. 20, v. 66, no. 2 p.205-212dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-011-0014-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014000175300001600315500001900331520061200350592002800962596001400990650001601004650001401020650001901034651001101053700002701064773009801091856008301189852000901272655001201281IND60719186520221120124956.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071918652DNAL7 a10.1007/s12228-020-09614-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith-Braga, Nayara S.10aLytoneuron (Pteridaceae) of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, Brazil, including three new combinations and descriptions of two new taxa  ap. 362-380.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, 11 species of Lytoneuron occur, of which one is new to science, L. poseidonii.

Winter-feeding systems included (i) grazing standing whole-plant corn (STCOR; Zea mays L. ‘DKC 26-25’; 10.0% CP, 67.6% TDN); (ii) grazing swathed whole-plant barley (SWBAR; Hordeum vulgare L. ‘Ranger’; 11.5% CP, 60.5% TDN); and (iii) drylot feeding barley hay (DLHAY; Ranger; 10.3% CP, 54.2% TDN). In study 2 (yr 1 and yr 2), 9 ruminally cannulated beef heifers (529 ± 39 kg) cycled through the 3 winter systems in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design, with 21-d periods to evaluate the effects of system and day of forage allocation on ruminal fermentation.Forage utilization was greatest (P = 0.01) for the DLHAY (84.4 ± 5.9%), intermediate for SWBAR (63.9 ± 2.5%), and least for STCOR (51.1 ± 4.4%) system. Winter-feeding system did not differ (P = 0.21) for initial BW (665 ± 17 kg), final BW (679 ± 25 kg), initial (4.2±0.94 mm) and final rib fat thickness (4.9±0.86 mm), and BCS (P = 0.36; final BCS = 2.8 ± 0.10; BCS change = 0.07 ± 0.14; 5-point scale). Mean ruminal pH was greatest (P = 0.02) for DLHAY (6.59) compared with SWBAR and STCOR forages (6.42 and 6.44, respectively). The area (pH × min/d) and duration that pH was <5.8 (min/d) was greater (P = 0.02) for SWBAR (50.8 and 231.6, respectively) compared with DLHAY (4.9 and 53.6, respectively) but similar to STCOR forage (52 and 129.3, respectively). Ruminal pH increased (P = 0.01) from d 1 to 3 of forage allocation, and duration and area when pH was below 5.8 decreased (P = 0.03) from d 1 to 3 of forage allocation.These results suggest that grazing either standing corn or swathed barley during winter can reduce (P = 0.01) costs by 25 and 36%, respectively, with no negative effects on cow performance and minimal effects on ruminal fermentation compared with feeding cows barley hay in drylot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aHordeum vulgare 3aZea mays 3aarea 3abarley 3abeef cows 3abiomass 3acannulas 3acorn 3adesign 3aduration 3afat thickness 3aforage 3agrazing 3ahay 3apH 3arumen fermentation 3awinter 0acorn grazing 0aextensive winter system 0adrylot feeding 0arumen metabolism 0aswathed barley grazing1 aLarson, K.1 aMcKinnon, J.J.1 aPenner, G.B.1 aDamiran, D.1 aLardner, H.A.(Bart)0 tApplied animal science.g2020 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.731-744dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27212x2590-28657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/aas.2020-019833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245016200175300001600337520172800353592002802081650001302109650001902122650002402141650002202165650001702187650002102204650002202225650001502247650002902262650001502291650003002306650002802336650001102364650001502375650005002390650002102440650001802461650002702479651001002506653002502516653006102541653001702602653003702619653002902656700001402685700001502699700001602714700001402730700001602744773007702760856008902837852000902926655001202935IND60561039720221119160804.0170713e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056103972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shengxin10aDerivation of freshwater water quality criteria for dibutyltin dilaurate from measured data and data predicted using interspecies correlation estimate models  ap. 142-148.  aDibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) is an organotin compound that has been widely detected in aquatic environments. However, the ecological risk assessment for DBTL is hard to perform due to the absence of water quality criteria (WQC) and lack of toxicity data. In this study, toxicity data were obtained from acute and chronic toxicity tests using aquatic species resident in China. Based on the species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) constructed from these test data, the acute water quality criterion (AWQC) and chronic water quality criterion (CWQC) were then derived to be 132 μg/L and 31.9 μg/L for DBTL. In order to valid the predicted data in the application to the protective criteria development and hazard assessment, the web-based interspecies correlation estimation (Web-ICE) system was used to estimate acute toxicities. Here two acute toxicity data groups for surrogate species were chosen from experimental data and QSAR Toolbox-predicted data separately, giving estimated data for prediction species using Web-ICE software. According to Kolmogorov–Smirnov test results, Web-ICE-based SSDs and measurement-based SSD were not significantly different. The results showed that the differences between measurement-based (132 μg/L) and Web-ICE-based AWQCs (39.7 μg/L and 58.5 μg/L) were statistically acceptable. Under certain conditions, it is therefore worth considering using the QSAR Toolbox plus Web-ICE method here to provide a beneficial supplement for developing preliminarily screen level toxicities in WQC when little or no relevant information are available. Besides, the geographic distribution of species was demonstrated not to be a significant factor in SSD establishment and WQC derivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aacute toxicity 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic organisms 3abiogeography 3achronic toxicity 3acomputer software 3adibutyltin 3aenvironmental assessment 3afreshwater 3ageographical distribution 3ahazard characterization 3amodels 3aprediction 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3atoxicity testing 3awater quality 3awater quality criteria 3aChina 0aDibutyltin dilaurate 0aWeb-based interspecies correlation estimations (Web-ICE) 0aQSAR-Toolbox 0aSpecies sensitivity distribution 0aAquatic quality criteria1 aWang, Lei1 aWang, Zhen1 aFan, Deling1 aShi, Lili1 aLiu, Jining0 tChemosphere.g2017 Mar., v. 171 p.142-148dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012200158300002000280520172200300592002802022650001602050650002202066650002402088650001402112650002302126650001202149650001302161650001202174650004402186650001102230650001302241700002602254700002102280700002002301773013402321856007502455852000902530655001202539IND60539441620221118161320.0160816e20140730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053944162DNAL7 a10.1021/ja50556872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSattler, Aaron10aLewis Acid Promoted Titanium Alkylidene Formation: Off-Cycle Intermediates Relevant to Olefin Trimerization Catalysis  ap. 10790-10800.  aTwo new precatalysts for ethylene and α-olefin trimerization, (FI)Ti(CH₂SiMe₃)₂Me and (FI)Ti(CH₂CMe₃)₂Me (FI = phenoxy-imine), have been synthesized and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction. (FI)Ti(CH₂SiMe₃)₂Me can be activated with 1 equiv of B(C₆F₅)₃ at room temperature to give the solvent-separated ion pair [(FI)Ti(CH₂SiMe₃)₂][MeB(C₆F₅)₃], which catalytically trimerizes ethylene or 1-pentene to produce 1-hexene or C₁₅ olefins, respectively. The neopentyl analogue (FI)Ti(CH₂CMe₃)₂Me is unstable toward activation with B(C₆F₅)₃ at room temperature, giving no discernible diamagnetic titanium complexes, but at −30 °C the following can be observed by NMR spectroscopy: (i) formation of the bis-neopentyl cation [(FI)Ti(CH₂CMe₃)₂]⁺, (ii) α-elimination of neopentane to give the neopentylidene complex [(FI)Ti(CHCMe₃)]⁺, and (iii) subsequent conversion to the imido-olefin complex [(MeOAr₂N)Ti(OArHCCHCMe₃)]⁺ via an intramolecular metathesis reaction with the imine fragment of the (FI) ligand. If the reaction is carried out at low temperature in the presence of ethylene, catalytic production of 1-hexene is observed, in addition to the titanacyclobutane complex [(FI)Ti(CH(CMe₃)CH₂CH₂)]⁺, resulting from addition of ethylene to the neopentylidene [(FI)Ti(CHCMe₃)]⁺. None of the complexes observed spectroscopically subsequent to [(FI)Ti(CH₂CMe₃)₂]⁺ is an intermediate or precursor for ethylene trimerization, but notwithstanding these off-cycle pathways, [(FI)Ti(CH₂CMe₃)₂]⁺ is a precatalyst that undergoes rapid initiation to generate a catalyst for trimerizing ethylene or 1-pentene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3aethylene 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aolefin 3atitanium1 aVanderVelde, David G.1 aLabinger, Jay A.1 aBercaw, John E.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 July 30, v. 136, no. 30 p.10790-10800dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja50556873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010900165300001400274520150900288592002801797650001601825650001201841650003001853650001101883650001101894650001801905650002401923650001601947650001301963653000801976653002201984653001602006653001602022653001202038653002302050653002602073653002702099700003002126700003102156700001802187773010002205856008202305852000902387655001202396IND60603019120221118071357.0180712e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060301912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2015.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohn, Mathew10aReaction path analysis for 1-butanol dehydration in H-ZSM-5 zeolite: Ab initio and microkinetic modeling  ap. 28-45.  aDispersion corrected periodic density functional theory (DFT) is used to construct a microkinetic model for 1-butanol dehydration in H-ZSM-5. The latter is applied to determine the effect of reaction conditions on dehydration rates, product selectivity and dominant reaction pathway. The consecutive reaction scheme of 1-butanol dehydration to ether followed by ether decomposition offers lower energy barriers as compared to the direct conversion of 1-butanol to 1-butene. The direct dehydration of 1-butanol to 1-butene occurs via an E2 (anti) elimination at low 1-butanol partial pressure and shifts to a 1-butanol assisted 1,2-syn-elimination with increasing 1-butanol partial pressure. The ether formation reaction proceeds via an SN2-type nucleophilic substitution mechanism, involving substitution of the –OH2 group of the protonated alcohol by 1-butanol, while ether decomposition predominantly occurs via a 1,2-syn-elimination mechanism. The effect of reaction conditions viz. reaction temperature, site time, 1-butanol and water partial pressure is studied. The reaction conditions govern the coverage of key surface species which in turn has a significant role in determining the dominant reaction mechanism and product selectivity. Under industrially relevant conditions, the presence of water has no significant effect on 1-butanol conversion and product selectivity. A higher reaction temperature, higher site time and lower 1-butanol partial pressure favor a higher 1-butene selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3abutanol 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3amodels 3apath analysis 3areaction mechanisms 3atemperature 3azeolites 0aDFT 0aDispersion energy 0aBio-butanol 0aDehydration 0aZeolite 0aReaction mechanism 0aMicrokinetic modeling 0aReaction path analysis1 aAlexopoulos, Konstantinos1 aReyniers, Marie-Françoise1 aMarin, Guy B.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2015 Oct., v. 330 p.28-45dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2015.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017900172300001400351520177400365592002802139650001302167650001702180650001302197650001202210650001702222650001102239650002802250650001502278650001602293650002502309650001102334650001902345650001402364650001402378650001302392650001102405650001602416650001502432650002602447650001802473651001202491700001602503700001702519773018502536856008402721990002302805852000902828655001202837IND60093680120221116191107.0141103e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009368012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemer.2011.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharef, Abdelkrim10aImpact of natural and human processes on the hydrochemical evolution of overexploited coastal groundwater: Case study of the Mornag aquifer refill (South-East Tunis, Tunisia)  ap. 61-69.  aThe Mornag coastal groundwater underlies the plain of this region. It is in northern Tunisia and 20km SW of Tunis City. This region is known for its important agricultural activity. This aquifer is the main groundwater resource of the department of this region. To limit the overexploitation, there is a creation of some perimeters in the Naasen and Irrisala localities where wastewater is used. To maintain the hydrostatic groundwater balance, freshwater is injected (artificial refill). In the Nassen area treated wastewater irrigation is slowed and then stopped while the Irrisala perimeter is still irrigated by the same water type. To maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the aquifer, water from the Méjerda Canal (M.C.) was injected. A geochemical study of the different parts of this groundwater is carried out, in order to clarify the salinisation origin and the hydrochemical evolution of the Mornag groundwater and to estimate the possible relationships between the natural processes (marine water intrusion), the water quality used either for irrigation or for artificial refill, and the geologic environment on the water quality of this aquifer. Its salinity, pH, temperature and electrical conductivity were measured and their respective averages are 3.1g/l, 7.4, 18.7°C and 4.4mS/cm. The concentrations of sodium, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, chloride, sulphate, potassium and bromides were measured and their respective averages are 29.0, 15.1, 10.9, 4.8, 26.8, 10.5, 0.3 and 0.0482mg/l. rMg²⁺/rCa²⁺ and rBr⁻/rCl⁻ ratios were calculated. The results suggest that the Mornag groundwater can be divided into 4 areas where the water chemistry depends on the natural processes and the water quality used for irrigation and artificial recharge:  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abicarbonates 3abromides 3acalcium 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aelectrical conductivity 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahumans 3ahydrochemistry 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asodium 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awastewater irrigation 3awater quality 3aTunisia1 aAyed, Lamia1 aAzzouzi, Rim0 tChemie der Erde - Geochemistry - Interdisciplinary Journal for Chemical Problems of the Geosciences and Geoecology.g2012 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.61-69dElsevier GmbHx0009-28197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemer.2011.11.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03772naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245004700200300001800247500002000265520101700285592002801302650001301330650001401343650002501357650002201382650001301404650001101417650001601428700006201444700006101506700002401567700002101591700005601612700005601668700002201724700005901746700006001805700006101865700001801926700002001944700006901964700001802033700006102051700005902112700006202171700002102233700006602254700005802320700005602378700002302434700002202457700002402479700002402503700001602527700006802543700002102611700002302632700006102655700006202716700001902778700006602797773011602863856007402979852000903053655001203062IND60749421720221121054027.0210903e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074942172DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.055452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Max D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2860-158010aTesting Bergmann's rule in marine copepods  ap. 1283-1295.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMacroecological relationships provide insights into rules that govern ecological systems. Bergmann's rule posits that members of the same clade are larger at colder temperatures. Whether temperature drives this relationship is debated because several other potential drivers covary with temperature. We conducted a near‐global comparative analysis on marine copepods (97 830 samples, 388 taxa) to test Bergmann's rule, considering other potential drivers. Supporting Bergmann's rule, we found temperature better predicted size than did latitude or oxygen, with body size decreasing by 43.9% across the temperature range (‐1.7 to 30ºC). Body size also decreased by 26.9% across the range in food availability. Our results provide strong support for Bergman's rule in copepods, but emphasises the importance of other drivers in modifying this pattern. As the world warms, smaller copepod species are likely to emerge as ‘winners', potentially reducing rates of fisheries production and carbon sequestration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3abody size 3acarbon sequestration 3afood availability 3alatitude 3aoxygen 3atemperature1 aSchoeman, David S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1258-08851 aVenables, William1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8432-33651 aAbu‐Alhaija, Rana1 aBatten, Sonia D.1 aChiba, Sanae1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2838-18401 aComan, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6743-51541 aDavies, Claire H.1 aEdwards, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5716-47141 aEriksen, Ruth S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5184-24651 aEverett, Jason D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6681-80541 aFukai, Yutaka1 aFukuchi, Mitsuo1 aEsquivel Garrote, Octavio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2462-66091 aHosie, Graham1 aHuggett, Jenny A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9315-86721 aJohns, David G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3270-67641 aKitchener, John A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4642-30441 aKoubbi, Philippe1 aMcEnnulty, Felicity R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3819-044X1 aMuxagata, Erik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4210-52521 aOstle, Clare1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6923-55351 aRobinson, Karen V.1 aSlotwinski, Anita1 aSwadling, Kerrie M.1 aTakahashi, Kunio T.1 aTonks, Mark1 aUribe‐Palomino, Julian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6867-21081 aVerheye, Hans M.1 aWilson, William H.1 aWorship, Marco M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5775-79691 aYamaguchi, Atsushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5646-36081 aZhang, Wuchang1 aRichardson, Anthony J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9289-73660 tEcography.g2021 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.1283-1295dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.055453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011000211300001600321500001900337520143200356592002801788650002201816651000901838651001101847651002001858773009801878856008301976852000902059655001202068IND60719186820221120124930.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071918682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12228-020-09631-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolski, Grzegorz J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1480-800310aReassessing the taxonomic diversity of Plagiothecium section Orthophyllum in the North American bryoflora  ap. 337-350.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Plagiothecium nemorale s.l. and P. succulentum, both belonging to P. sect. Orthophyllum, were considered to be distributed across almost the entire Northern Hemisphere. However, in the mid-twentieth century these taxa were recircumscribed resulting in their exclusion from the North American bryoflora and restricting their distributions to Asia and Europe, and in the case of Plagiothecium nemorale s.l., also North Africa. More recently, it was found that P. nemorale s.l. is a taxonomic complex comprising three distinct species: P. nemorale s.s., P. longisetum, and P. angusticellum. I revised the North American material of P. section Orthophyllum deposited in three herbaria (NY, FH, F) and found that five examined taxa of the section are present in the North America. Two of the species P. angusticellum and P. longisetum, have not been recorded from North America previously, while two others, P. nemorale and P. succulentum, had not been listed in the North American bryoflora for 50 years. One taxon is new for the U.S.A. – P. succulentum f. propaguliferum. Here I provide detailed descriptions of the anatomical and morphological features of the recorded taxa along with photographic documentation of their most important characteristics. I also summarize their known distributions in North America and ecological preferences and provide a key for their identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aspecies diversity 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aNorthern Africa0 tBrittonia.g2020 Dec., v. 72, no. 4 p.337-350dSpringer USwJournal:jnl49542x0007-196X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12228-020-09631-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009100165300001600256520151300272592002801785650002701813650002201840650002101862650002101883650001301904650001001917650002001927650002401947650001401971650001301985650001301998650003002011650002202041653001602063653002002079653002202099653001902121700001802140773007802158856008102236852000902317655001202326IND60519872020221117213541.0160511e20110220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051987202DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-011-0017-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrones, Peter10aNucleotide sequence analysis of small cryptic plasmid pGP2 from Acetobacter estunensis  ap. 221-228.  aComplete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pGP2 from Acetobacter estunensis GP2 was identified after initial cloning of EcoRI fragment followed by preparation of deletion derivatives. Its size was defined to 2,797 bp and several sites for several restriction enzymes were revealed by DNA sequencing. Sequence analysis predicts three putative open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 shows significant identity with the bacterial excinuclease α-subunit, ORF2 is a putative replication protein with low similarity with other Acetobacter plasmid’s replication proteins, and ORF3 encodes a class B acid phosphatase/phosphotransferase. The replication module comprises a DnaA box like sequence, direct repeats, a potential prokaryotic promoter and a rep gene. The rep module is similar with several θ-replicating, iteron-containing modules from plasmids, suggesting pGP2 replication may follow the same course. Any phenotypic character determinant gene is absent in pGP2, suggesting this plasmid to be cryptic. However, a pGP2 derivative plasmid, containing the putative pGP2 rep region, can replicate and is stably maintained in Acetobacter and Escherichia coli strains; it can also carry foreign DNA fragments. Thus, pGP2-X could serve as a cloning shuttle vector between these bacteria.

Rock and plant samples were collected from an area near Essimi, north-eastern Greece, which is known for its Cu–Pb–Zn mineralization and analyzed for their content in 14 elements (Fe, Mn, Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Zn and V). The data illustrate positive linear correlation between the concentrations of Zn, Fe and Cu in plant ash and rock samples. In particular, these correlations are 0.99 for Zn, 0.97 for Fe and 0.97 for Cu and are significant at the 99.9% confidence level. Therefore, S. compacta could be used as a plant indicator for Zn, Fe and Cu mineralization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilene 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aindicator species 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amineralization 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3atin 3azinc 3aGreece1 aPapastergios, Georgios1 aKantiranis, Nikolaos1 aMichailidis, Kleopas1 aChatzikirkou, Athanasios1 aKatirtzoglou, Kostas0 tChemie der Erde - Geochemistry - Interdisciplinary Journal for Chemical Problems of the Geosciences and Geoecology.g2012 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.71-76dElsevier GmbHx0009-28197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemer.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011400177500001900291520211100310592002802421650001702449650001902466650001202485650001202497650001202509650001802521650001702539650001402556650003102570650001002601650002602611650001802637650001302655650001302668650001202681650001702693650001002710650002302720653001302743653004002756653001502796653001902811653001802830700001602848700002402864700002602888773009702914856008503011852000903096655001203105IND60687288920221120022940.0210201e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068728892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1157382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Mercedes Cecilia10aNitrifying niche differentiation in biofilms from full-scale chloraminated drinking water distribution system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTropical conditions favour the auto-decomposition of monochloramine (MCA) leading to disinfectant decay and free ammonia in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS); thus, they promote the growth of nitrifiers and the development of biofilms on the inner-pipe surface. Biofilms can adversely impact the provision of safe and biologically stable water. Moreover, there is a general lack of understanding of the role of microbial communities in DWDS in regions with warm temperatures and no distinct seasons. Here, we report a survey on biofilms from full-scale monochloraminated DWDS in a highly urbanised metropolis using next generation sequencing tools. The monitoring campaign consisted of sampling biofilms and bulk waters from 21 in-service pipes. We characterized the microbial community with emphasis on nitrifying bacteria and archaea using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and potential nitrification activity. Samples grouped into two clusters, characterized by their low (Cluster LD) and high (Cluster HD) α-diversity. Both clusters harbour microorganisms related to nitrification: i) Nitrosomonas (24.9–68.8%), an ammonia oxidising bacterium (AOB) that dominated Cluster LD, and ii) a co-aggregation of genus Nitrospira (9.8–32.5%), a nitrite oxidising bacterium (NOB), and Thaumarchaeota (1.4–10.9%), chemolithotrophic ammonia oxidising (AOA) archaea that were among the most abundant OTUs in Cluster HD. Activity tests performed with fresh biofilm samples confirmed that these two clusters represent distinctive biofilm niches performing different stages of the nitrification process. Cluster LD correlated with a high concentration of MCA, which caused dysbiosis and resulted in high unevenness of the cluster. In cluster HD, with more biomass, chemical reactions involving nitrite increased the MCA demand, releasing ammonia and allowing more nitrifiers to grow, like AOA and NOB. From this study, we conclude that an MCA residual gradient along the DWDS drives and shapes the microbial community assembly and should be considered when designing effective disinfection strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aThaumarchaeota 3aammonia 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3adysbiosis 3aecological differentiation 3agenes 3amicrobial communities 3anitrification 3anitrites 3aresearch 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3awater 3awater distribution 0aBiofilms 0aDrinking water distribution systems 0aNitrifiers 0aMonochloramine 0aMetabarcoding1 aWoo, Yissue1 aFlemming, Hans-Curt1 aWuertz, S.q(Stefan),0 tWater research.g2020 June 01, v. 176 p.115738-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1157383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01521naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245012600170300001800296520056200314592002800876650001000904650001000914650001900924650001500943651001000958700002800968700003200996773010801028856007401136852000901210655001201219IND60727414720221121235922.0210211e20201111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072741472DNAL7 a10.15560/16.5.15192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aContreras Bravo, Patricio10aNew record of Barrio’s Frog, Insuetophrynus acarpicus Barrio, 1970 (Anura, Rhinodermatidae), in Los Ríos region, Chile  ap. 1519-1522.  aA new record of the Endangered, Chilean endemic Insuetophrynus acarpicus (Barrio 1970) is reported from Alerce Costero National Park, Chile.

This paper used data from 390 small-scale maize farmers in Kilosa, Tanzania to analyse the impact of post-harvest management training and the supply of hermetic bags on food insecurity status in a framed field experiment setting with two treatments. In the first treatment group, farmers were trained on post-harvest management, and in the second treatment they were given the same training as the first treatment group and were, in addition, provided with hermetic bags for storing maize. Our estimations show that the interventions had an impact in reducing maize PHL and household food insecurity. The intervention combining training and supply of hermetic bags abated maize PHL by 53%, whereas the training intervention alone abated PHL by 26%. Further, the intervention combining training and supply of hermetic bags reduced the household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS) score by 30.9% while the training intervention alone reduced it by 10.8% relative to the control group. The two interventions also lowered the probability of treated households experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity, and increased the probability of households being food secure or mildly insecure relative to the control group. Notably, the intervention which combined training and supply of hermetic bags had a significantly larger impact compared to the one providing training only. These results imply that more investment should be done on interventions to reduce PHL to complement efforts to improve food security. They also point to possible affordable interventions to reduce maize PHL and the importance of supplying material support in addition to training to minimize PHL and improve food security in Tanzania.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairtight storage 3abags 3acomplement 3acorn 3afarmers 3afield experimentation 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3apaper 3apostharvest losses 3apostharvest technology 3aprobability 3asupply 3aTanzania1 aLokina, Razack1 aMwakaje, Agnes G.0 tFood security.g2020 Dec., v. 12, no. 6 p.1299-1316dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-020-01052-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002600175245007000201300001400271520131400285592002801599650001701627650001201644650001201656650001101668700002101679700002001700700001701720700002301737700001601760773014901776856006801925856010101993990002302094852000902117655001202126IND60643332120221120104727.0190510e20111205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064333212DNAL7 a10.3791/34182doi7 aPMC33696692pmcid7 a221577332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbraham, Elizabeth J.10aScale-up of mammalian cell culture using a new multilayered flask  ap. e3418.  aA growing number of cell-based applications require large numbers of cells. Usage of single layer T-flasks, that are adequate during small-scale expansion, may become cumbersome, laborious and time-consuming when large numbers of cells are required. To address this need, the performance of a new multi-layered cell culture vessel to facilitate easy scale up of cells from single layered T-flasks will be discussed. The flasks tested are available in 3- and 5-layer format and enable culture and complete recovery of three and five times the number of cells respectively, compared to T-175 flasks. A key feature of the BD Multi-Flask is a mix/equilibration port that allows rapid in-vessel mixing as well as uniform distribution of cells and reagents within and between layers of each vessel and consistently produce cells that can be cultured in an environment that is congruent to T-175 flasks. The design of these Multi-Flasks also allows for convenient pipette access for adding reagents and cells directly into the flasks as well as efficient recovery of valuable cells and reagents and reduces risk of contamination due to pouring. For applications where pouring is preferred over pipetting, the design allows for minimal residual liquid retention so as to reduce wastage of valuable cells and reagents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell culture 3aliquids 3amammals 3amixing1 aSlater, Katie A.1 aSanyal, Suparna1 aLinehan, Ken1 aFlaherty, Paula M.1 aQian, Susan0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2011 Dec. 05, , no. 58 p.e3418-e3418dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/34183Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3418/scale-up-of-mammalian-cell-culture-using-a-new-multilayered-flask  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009400172300001500266520160200281592002801883650001101911650005301922650001901975650001501994650001102009650001402020650001702034650001502051650002202066650001102088650001602099650001102115650001202126650002402138651001902162653001002181653001802191653002002209653001602229653001502245653001902260653000802279653000802287653000802295653000802303653000802311653001102319653001002330653000902340700001502349700002202364700002402386700001702410700002002427773007602447856008902523852000902612655001202621IND60561040120221121145722.0170713e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056104012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsik, Petr10aNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the watercourses of Elbe basin in Czech Republic  ap. 97-105.  aNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) belong to most used pharmaceuticals in the human and veterinary medicine. The widespread consumption of NSAIDs has led to their ubiquitous occurrence in water environment including large river systems. In the present study, concentrations of the five most frequently used NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, ketoprofen and indomethacin) were determined in the watercourses of the river Elbe basin in Czech Republic. The presence of the pharmaceuticals was measured at 29 sampling sites including urban and rural areas, small creeks and main tributaries of the Elbe monthly from April to December of 2011. For the NSAIDs quantitation, the comprehensive analytical method combing pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) derivatization with highly sensitive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS) was developed. Although the content of all NSAIDs varied at the particular sampling points significantly, total amount of particular compounds was relatively stable during all monitored periods with only non-significant increase in the spring and autumnal months. Ibuprofen was found to be the most abundant drug with maximum concentration of 3210 ng/L, followed by naproxen, diclofenac and ketoprofen (1423.8 ng/L, 1080 ng/L and 929.8 ng/L, respectively). Indomethacin was found only at several sampling sites (maximum concentration of 69.3 ng/L). Concentrations of all compounds except ibuprofen were significantly higher at sampling sites with low flow rates (creeks), followed by the biggest watercourses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3aderivatization 3adiclofenac 3ahumans 3aibuprofen 3aindomethacin 3aketoprofen 3amass spectrometry 3arivers 3arural areas 3aspring 3astreams 3aveterinary medicine 3aCzech Republic 0aNSAID 0aSurface water 0aPharmaceuticals 0aGCxGC-TOFMS 0aElbe basin 0aCzech Republic 0aDIC 0aIBU 0aIND 0aKET 0aNAP 0aNSAIDs 0aPFBBr 0aWWTP1 aRezek, Jan1 aŽidková, Monika1 aKramulová, Barbora1 aTauchen, Jan1 aVaněk, Tomáš0 tChemosphere.g2017 Mar., v. 171 p.97-105dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245013000162300001800292520157000310592002801880650000901908650001801917650002101935650001201956650002301968650002201991650001102013700005402024700001802078700001802096700005402114700001702168700001402185700005402199773011402253856008402367852000902451655001202460IND60688084020221121055623.0200407e20200228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068808402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c001832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yun10aEffects of Layer-Charge Distribution of 2:1 Clay Minerals on Methane Hydrate Formation: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study  ap. 3323-3335.  aMolecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the effects of the external surface of a 2:1 clay mineral with different charge amounts and charge locations on CH₄ hydrate formation. The results showed that 5¹², 5¹²6², 5¹²6³, and 5¹²6⁴ were formed away from the clay mineral surface. The surface of the clay mineral with high- and low-charge layers was occupied by Na⁺ to form various distributions of outer- and inner-sphere hydration structures, respectively. The adsorbed Na⁺ on the high-charge layer surface reduced the H₂O activity by disturbing the hydrogen bond network, resulting in low tetrahedral arrangement of H₂O molecules near the layer surface, which inhibited CH₄ hydrate formation. However, more CH₄ molecules were adsorbed onto the vacancy in the Si–O rings of a neutral-charge layer to form semicage structures. Thus, the order parameter of H₂O molecules near this surface indicated that the arrangement of H₂O molecules resulted in a more optimal tetrahedral structure for CH₄ hydrate formation than that near the negatively charged layer surface. Different nucleation mechanisms of the CH₄ hydrate on external surfaces of clay mineral models were observed. For clay minerals with negatively charged layers (i.e., high and low charge), the homogeneous nucleation of the CH₄ hydrate occurred away from the surface. For a clay mineral with a neutral-charge layer, the CH₄ hydrate could nucleate either in the bulk-like solution homogeneously or at the clay mineral–H₂O interface heterogeneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aclay minerals 3ahydrogen bonding 3amethane 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models 3asodium1 aChen, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1878-22611 aLiu, Chanjuan1 aSong, Hongzhe1 aYuan, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6492-05091 aZhang, Baifa1 aLiu, Dong1 aDu, Peixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8393-07260 tLangmuir.g2020 Feb. 28, v. 36, no. 13 p.3323-3335dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c001833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011900165300001600284520117200300592002801472650002201500650003701522650001301559650001401572650002301586650001701609650001701626650000901643650001601652650001801668650001801686650003301704650001201737650003701749650003701786653001401823653001301837653002201850653001501872700001501887700001301902700002001915700001801935700001801953700001701971700001201988773010202000856008202102852000902184655001202193IND60603019620221118071332.0180712e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060301962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2015.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Pengfei10aCatalytic decomposition of N2O over Fe-ZSM-11 catalysts prepared by different methods: Nature of active Fe species  ap. 311-322.  aA series of Fe-ZSM-11 catalysts were prepared by different methods and tested in N2O decomposition. First, Fe-ZSM-11 catalysts with different Si/Al ratios (15, 25, 36) were prepared by wet ion exchange. The Fe content and catalytic activity were highest for the catalyst with Si/Al ratio 15. Additional Fe-ZSM-11 catalysts with higher Fe contents were prepared by semicontinuous ion exchange or by using alkaline-treated ZSM-11 as the precursor for wet ion exchange. While the catalyst prepared by semicontinuous ion exchange showed low activity, the catalyst prepared using alkaline-treated ZSM-11 turned out to be the most active in this study. Relevant characterization was conducted using X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, inductively coupled plasma, N2 adsorption–desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, ⁵⁷Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, magnetization tests, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Our data indicate that small FeOx nanoparticles and large iron oxide particles are the predominant Fe species, and small FeOx nanoparticles with low nuclearity are the active Fe species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afluorescence 3aion exchange 3airon 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3anitrous oxide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aFe-ZSM-11 0aFe-ZSM-5 0aN2O decomposition 0aFe species1 aLuo, Yajun1 aMa, Zhen1 aHuang, Chengyun1 aMiao, Changxi1 aYue, Yinghong1 aHua, Weiming1 aGao, Zi0 tJournal of catalysis.g2015 Oct., v. 330 p.311-322dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2015.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011400165520130600279592002801585650001801613650001201631650002001643650001001663650003901673650001501712653000901727653001401736653001801750653000901768700001601777700001401793700001801807700001901825773011701844856008601961852000902047655001202056IND60743867720221117103117.0220207e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074386772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1137702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Liwen10aSir2 family proteins regulate terpenoid synthesis by deacetylation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase  aTerpenoids are the main components of plant essential oils, and each stage of their synthesis pathway has been identified. However, there are few reports on the regulatory mechanism of this synthesis pathway. Our previous research showed that increasing the gene expression level of one of the key rate-limiting enzymes in the pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS), can promote this synthesis pathway. In this study, we cloned Sir2 deacetylase family genes in the essential oil-producing plant Litsea cubeba, analysed their functions, and found that overexpression of this gene family can also effectively increase the type and production of terpenoids. In addition, overexpression of this gene family induced phenotypes such as excessive growth and enlarged vegetative organs in plants. Subsequently, we analysed the regulatory mechanism of the Sir2 family and found that these proteins can increase the enzymatic activity of HMGS through deacetylation, thereby promoting the synthesis of terpenoids as the final product. This study discovered a posttranslational regulatory mechanism in the terpenoid synthesis pathway. In addition, this study also provides an effective metabolic engineering method to increase the yield of plant terpenoids while increasing the biomass of plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitsea cubeba 3abiomass 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 3aterpenoids 0aSir2 0aTerpenoid 0aDeacetylation 0aHMGS1 aChen, Yicun1 aGao, Ming1 aZhao, Yunxiao1 aWang, Yangdong0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 170 p.113770-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1137703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012700168300001600295520104400311592002801355650003101383650002901414650003001443650002301473650001301496650003001509650002801539650002701567650001101594650002501605650001001630650001301640650001801653651001101671651001801682653003001700653001301730653001501743653002601758653002201784700002001806700001701826773007801843856008101921852000902002655001202011IND60519872420221117213509.0160511e20110220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051987242DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-011-0021-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuratoglu, Hacer14aThe first investigation of the diversity of bacteria associated with Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)  ap. 288-293.  aColorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is a devastating pest of potatoes in North America and Europe. L. decemlineata has developed resistance to insecticides used for its control. In this study, in order to find a more effective potential biological control agent against L. decemlineata, we investigated its microbiota and tested their insecticidal effects. According to morphological, physiological and biochemical tests as well as 16S rDNA sequences, microbiota was identified as Leclercia adecarboxylata (Ld1), Acinetobacter sp. (Ld2), Acinetobacter sp. (Ld3), Pseudomonas putida (Ld4), Acinetobacter sp. (Ld5) and Acinetobacter haemolyticus (Ld6). The insecticidal activities of isolates at 1.8×109 bacteria/mL dose within five days were 100%, 100%, 35%, 100%, 47% and 100%, respectively, against the L. decemlineata larvae.

Focus of this study was on development of eco-friendly process for the production of flavonoid acetates. By using phloridzin as model compound and triacetin as acetyl donor and solvent, 100% conversion and high productivity (23.32gl⁻¹day⁻¹) were accomplished. Complete conversions of two other glycosylated flavonoids, naringin and esculin, in solvent-free system were achieved, as well. Comprehensive kinetic mechanism based on two consecutive mono-substrate reactions was established where first one represents formation of flavonoid monoacetate and within second reaction diacetate is being produced from monoacetate. Both steps were regarded as reversible Michaelis-Menten reactions without inhibition. Apparent kinetic parameters for two consecutive reactions (Vm constants for substrates and products and Km constants for forward and reverse reactions) were estimated for three examined acetyl acceptors and excellent fitting of experimental data (R²>0.97) was achieved. Obtained results showed that derived kinetic model could be applicable for solvent-free esterifications of different flavonoid glycosides. It was valid for entire transesterification course (72h of reaction) which, combined with complete conversions and green character of synthesis, represents firm basis for further process development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aglycosylation 3akinetics 3amodels 3anaringin 3aphloridzin 3asolubility 3asolvents 3atransesterification 3atriacetin 0aFlavonoid acetylation 0aLipase 0aSolvent-free 0aKinetic parameters 0aCOPASI1 aĆorović, Marija1 aCarević, Milica1 aBanjanac, Katarina1 aVujisić, Ljubodrag1 aVeličković, Dušan1 aBezbradica, Dejan0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 128 p.106-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2017.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245011700176300001600293520172600309592002802035650001802063650001602081650001902097650001502116650001602131650001602147650001402163650001102177650001802188650002302206650001202229650002402241650001202265653000902277653002102286653001702307653002602324653001802350700002102368700006402389700002202453700002002475700002402495773009902519856009002618852000902708655001202717IND60532331020221119060647.0190318e20140820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053233102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorgiou, Stella10aMyosin light chain 2 isoforms in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.): Molecular growth markers at early stages  ap. 434-442.  aThe production of high quality juveniles at hatchery stages is important to ensure high growth potential during the on-growing phase. In the present paper, molecular growth markers of muscle development and growth in gilthead sea bream were validated in developmental stages/sizes that exhibit high accelerated growth rate, and rearing practices that are characterized by considerable size disparity. In gilthead sea bream the skeletal myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) is a structural molecule of the muscle that exists in two isoforms, A and B, which are known to mark hyperplasia and hypertrophy, respectively. The expression levels of the two isoforms and the robustness of its correlation with length growth were validated in a) larvae and juveniles of gilthead sea bream originating from the same broodstock and raised under intensive vs semi-intensive conditions, and b) in juvenile gilthead sea bream reared under commercial aquaculture practices and subjected to size grading with sorters of increasing diameter. A replacement of MLC2A by MLC2B was observed at metamorphosis in agreement with previous results. Larvae reared at the semi-intensive system outperformed in length growth and MLC2 expression those reared intensively and an earlier and faster replacement of MLC2A by MLC2B was observed at metamorphosis. Similarly, the ratio of MLC2A/MLC2B expression exhibited a tight, significantly negative correlation to total length of juveniles, independent of age. Overall, comparison of groups of gilthead sea bream of different origin rose under different conditions and of different developmental stages (larvae vs juveniles) provided significant evidence for the robustness of MLC2 expression as a growth marker.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3aaquaculture 3abreeding stock 3ahatcheries 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3amyosin light chains 3arearing 0aMLC2 0aGrowth potential 0aSize sorting 0aSemi-intensive system 0aSparus aurata1 aMakridis, Pavlos1 aDimopoulos, Dimitris1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2533-74971 aPower, Deborah M.1 aMamuris, Zissis1 aMoutou, Katerina A.0 tAquaculture.g2014 Aug. 20, v. 432 p.434-442dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012200204300001800326500001100344520139600355592002801751650002501779650003301804650000901837650001701846650002001863650001401883650002001897650001801917650002101935650002301956650002301979650002602002650001302028650001102041700002202052700002602074773011502100856008302215852000902298655001202307IND60719187420221120115841.0210723e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071918742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-020-01090-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Nesar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4133-697X10aOrganic aquaculture productivity, environmental sustainability, and food security: insights from organic agriculture  ap. 1253-1267.  aReview  aOrganic aquaculture originated from the organic agriculture movement. Organic fish farming is an ecosystem-based management system, which was developed as a potential substitute to address environmental constraints faced by intensive aquaculture. However, the transformation from conventional aquaculture to organic aquaculture is a multidimensional, complex, and expensive process. The further development of organic aquaculture can be enhanced by establishing uniform organic aquaculture standards. Converting to organic aquaculture brings a wide range of environmental advantages. Nevertheless, organic yields are significantly lower than those of modern aquaculture, which will reduce its contribution to global food security. To meet global demand for fish and seafood from an increasing human population, food production from aquaculture must be enhanced since production from capture fisheries has remained stagnant. Because aquaculture is associated with various environmental constraints, a further increase in fish production will encounter diverse environmental challenges. Greater use of organic aquaculture practices will help to diminish environmental footprints of aquaculture. We propose that fish production could increase through the sustainable intensification of a combination of production systems, including polyculture, integrated aquaculture, and organic aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem management 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afish 3afish culture 3afish production 3afisheries 3afood production 3afood security 3ahuman population 3amanagement systems 3aorganic production 3aproduction technology 3aseafoods 3ayields1 aThompson, Shirley1 aTurchini, Giovanni M.0 tFood security.g2020 Dec., v. 12, no. 6 p.1253-1267dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-020-01090-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245005000205300001800255500001100273520123500284592002801519650001801547650001301565650001301578650000901591650001201600650001901612650001801631650001601649650002401665650001601689650002501705650001001730650001801740650001201758650002601770650001401796650001001810650000901820700001801829700002101847773011501868856008301983852000902066655001202075IND60719187520221120124922.0210723e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071918752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-020-01061-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Caleb1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3952-301514aThe global challenge of clean cooking systems  ap. 1219-1240.  aReview  aCooking is an essential and energy-intensive activity. Populations in industrialized countries enjoy nearly universal access to electricity and gas for clean cooking, while about 2.5 billion people in low- and middle-income countries use solid fuels such as wood, charcoal, coal, crop residue and dung for their daily cooking. These traditional solid fuel cooking systems negatively affect the health and reduce the opportunities of cookstove users, who are disproportionately women and children. Solid fuel cooking also presents a number of detrimental environmental impacts, such as ambient air pollution and forest degradation in some regions. Access to cleaner cooking fuels such as gas and electricity is expanding, but is constrained by the higher costs and logistical challenges of such systems. This review investigates the technologies and systems that are currently used to cook food, with a focus on low-income populations. It identifies key challenges that hinder a global transition to clean and sustainable cooking. Finally, it reflects on the recent success of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) along with other fossil fuel-based cooking systems, and discusses a potential transition to renewable energy-based cooking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acharcoal 3achildren 3acoal 3acooking 3acooking stoves 3acrop residues 3adegradation 3adeveloped countries 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental impact 3afeces 3afood security 3aforests 3alow-income population 3apetroleum 3awomen 3awood1 aSathre, Roger1 aBuluswar, Shashi0 tFood security.g2020 Dec., v. 12, no. 6 p.1219-1240dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-020-01061-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013500157300002000292520174300312592002802055650001502083650001602098650002102114650001302135650001302148650001902161700002002180700002102200700001802221700001902239700002302258700002102281700002102302700001702323773013402340856007502474852000902549655001202558IND60539442220221118161300.0160816e20140730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053944222DNAL7 a10.1021/ja505941b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Jiheong10aC5-Symmetric Chiral Corannulenes: Desymmetrization of Bowl Inversion Equilibrium via “Intramolecular” Hydrogen-Bonding Network  ap. 10640-10644.  aBecause of a rapid conformational inversion, bowl-shaped C₅-symmetric corannulenes, though geometrically chiral, have not been directly resolved into their enantiomers. However, if this inversion equilibrium can be desymmetrized, chiral corannulenes enriched in either enantiomer can be obtained. We demonstrated this possibility using pentasubstituted corannulenes 4 and 5 carrying amide-appended thioalkyl side chains. Compound 4 displays chiroptical activity in a chiral hydrocarbon such as limonene. Because compound 5 carries a chiral center in the side chains, its enantiomers 5R and 5S show chiroptical activity even in achiral solvents such as CHCl₃ and methylcyclohexane. In sharp contrast, when the side chains bear no amide functionality (1 and 2R), no chiroptical activity emerges even in limonene or with a chiral center in the side chains. Detailed investigations revealed that the peripheral amide units in 4 and 5 are hydrogen-bonded only “intramolecularly” along the corannulene periphery, affording cyclic amide networks with clockwise and anticlockwise geometries. Although this networking gives rise to four stereoisomers, only two, which are enantiomeric to one another, are suggested computationally to exist in the equilibrated system. In a chiral environment (chiral solvent or side chain), their thermodynamic stabilities are certainly unequal, so the bowl-inversion equilibrium can be desymmetrized. However, this is not the case when the system contains a protic solvent that can deteriorate the hydrogen-bonding network. When the enantiomeric purity of limonene as the solvent is varied, the chiroptical activity of the corannulene core changes nonlinearly with its enantiomeric excess (majority rule).  aPublisher supplied data 3achloroform 3aenantiomers 3ahydrogen bonding 3alimonene 3asolvents 3athermodynamics1 aMiyajima, Daigo1 aItoh, Yoshimitsu1 aMori, Tadashi1 aTanaka, Hiroki1 aYamauchi, Masahito1 aInoue, Yoshihisa1 aHarada, Soichiro1 aAida, Takuzo0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 July 30, v. 136, no. 30 p.10640-10644dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja505941b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014000161300001600301520157700317592002801894653001301922653001001935653001501945653002101960653001601981653001701997700002502014700001702039700001702056773012702073856007802200852000902278655001202287IND60516956220221117215908.0160327e20121106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051695622DNAL7 a10.1139/cjpp-2012-02322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadawy, Dina10aAldose reductase inhibitors zopolrestat and ferulic acid alleviate hypertension associated with diabetes: effect on vascular reactivity  ap. 101-107.  aThis study investigated the effect of aldose reductase (AR) inhibitors on hypertension in diabetes. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin, while AR inhibitors zopolrestat and ferulic acid were administered at 2 weeks after streptozotocin treatment and for 6 weeks afterwards. Then, blood pressure (BP) and serum level of glucose were determined. Concentration–response curves for phenylephrine (PE), KCl, and acetylcholine (ACh) were obtained in isolated aorta. In addition, ACh-induced NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in aorta and histopathology were examined. Compared with the control animals, diabetes increased diastolic and systolic BP. AR inhibitors reduced diastolic BP elevation without affecting the developed hyperglycaemia. Diabetes increased the contractile response of aorta to KCl, and decreased the relaxation response to Ach, while administering AR inhibitors prevented an impaired response to ACh. Incubation of aorta isolated from diabetic animals with AR inhibitors did not affect the impaired relaxation response to ACh. In addition, AR inhibitors negated the impaired Ach-stimulated NO generation seen in aorta isolated from diabetic animals. Furthermore, diabetes was accompanied with marked infiltration of leukocytes in aortic adventitia, endothelial cell pyknosis, and increased ROS formation. AR inhibitors reduced leukocyte infiltration and inhibited endothelial pyknosis and ROS formation. In conclusion, AR inhibitors negate diabetes-evoked hypertension via ameliorating impaired endothelial relaxation and NO production.  aPublisher supplied data 0adiabetes 0aaorta 0arelaxation 0aaldose reductase 0azopolrestat 0aferulic acid1 aEl-Bassossy, Hany M.1 aFahmy, Ahmed1 aAzhar, Ahmad0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2012 Nov. 6, v. 91, no. 2 p.101-107dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2012-02323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012700206300001800333520150600351592002801857596004101885650001701926650001201943650001101955650001001966650001201976650001701988650001702005650001202022650001702034700002002051700003402071700001702105700001702122700002002139773013302159856008302292852000902375655001202384IND60686267620221116175307.0220331e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068626762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-019-02192-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerr, Megan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7599-660510aScenario analysis on the use of rodenticides and sex-biasing gene drives for the removal of invasive house mice on islands  ap. 1235-1248.  aSince the 1960s conservation efforts have focused on recovering island biodiversity by eradicating invasive rodents. These eradication campaigns have led to considerable conservation gains, particularly for nesting seabirds. However, eradications are complex and lengthy endeavors and are even more challenging when humans are co-inhabitants of the targeted island. Furthermore, the method of eradication matters and recent proposals to consider genetic technologies for rodent eradication require specific scrutiny. One such technology is the potential use of a gene drive for biasing offspring sex ratios in invasive house mice, Mus musculus, that would spread and prevent the production of one sex, allowing die-off from lack of reproduction and natural attrition. Practitioners can gain insight into the potential for adoption of this technology from examining stakeholder engagement. This paper uses scenario analysis to address the eradication of rodents on inhabited and uninhabited islands, by specifically comparing the traditional approach of using rodenticides with sex-biasing gene drives. Concurrently the International Union for Conservation of Nature is assessing the risks and value of gene drives in general for conservation. Hence, we make the case that the ethical challenges with the use of gene drive sex-biasing techniques and the effectiveness of this tool will rely as much on its public acceptance and its democratic use as the actual science used to construct the technology.  aPublisher supplied data  a1068676cNational Science Foundation 3abiodiversity 3adie-off 3aethics 3agenes 3aprogeny 3areproduction 3arodenticides 3arodents 3astakeholders1 aValdez, Rene X.1 aBarnhill-Dilling, Kathleen S.1 aGodwin, John1 aKuiken, Todd1 aBooker, Matthew0 tBiological invasions.g2020 Apr., v. 22, no. 4 p.1235-1248dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-02192-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245016500181300001600346520109300362592002801455650001101483650001201494650002101506650001501527650001401542650001401556650001401570650001501584651001001599700002201609700002301631700002801654773018701682856008401869990002301953852000901976655001201985IND60093680920221116191338.0141103e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009368092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemer.2012.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamkumar, Muthuvairavasamy10aAnomalous phosphorus episodes during Callovian-Oxfordian times in the Kachchh Basin, western India: Implications for palaeoclimate, productivity, and weathering  ap. 141-148.  aThe Upper Callovian-Oxfordian strata of the Kachchh Basin, western India, record three positive excursions of phosphorus. They have been documented in three sections of the Chari Formation from different parts of the basin. Corroboration of field and petrographic data with trends of major and trace elemental data and elemental ratios of the strata revealed that these excursions were coeval with reduced chemical weathering in the source area and significant reduction of siliciclastic influx to the depositional sites. The study also revealed the intrabasinal source of P, and minor sea-level fluctuations and resultant episodic sediment recycling as the causative factors. Considering the geographic locations of the three sections, the phosphorus anomalies seem to be controlled by a regional and/or basin-scale process, if not linked with global signals. Temporal resolution of these anomalies suggests that the processes were episodic and related to short term climate/relative sea-level cycles, the durations of which could be unraveled with high-resolution biostratigraphic data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3apaleoclimatology 3aphosphorus 3arecycling 3asea level 3asediments 3aweathering 3aIndia1 aAlberti, Matthias1 aFürsich, Franz T.1 aPandey, Dhirendra Kumar0 tChemie der Erde - Geochemistry - Interdisciplinary Journal for Chemical Problems of the Geosciences and Geoecology.g2012 June, v. 72, no. 2 p.141-148dElsevier GmbHx0009-28197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemer.2012.01.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166300001600272520145700288592002801745650002001773650001501793650002001808650001501828650001201843650002201855650001501877650001801892650002701910700001801937700001601955700001701971700001601988700001602004773011102020856004802131852000902179655001202188IND50059364720221118044439.0121017e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005936472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-012-1823-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Baifeng10aUPLC-ESI-MS/MS for determining trans- and cis-vitamin K1 in infant formulas: method and applications   ap. 873-879.  aA simple and sensitive method of determining vitamin K1 isomers (cis-and trans-forms) was developed for routine monitoring of supplemented infant formulas. The proposed method involves the applications of the lipase hydrolysis and the liquid-to-liquid extraction. After the hydrolysis and extraction procedures, the vitamin K1-enriched extract was directly injected into the ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry system (UPLC-MS/MS). The components were detected using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive-ion and quantified by multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. trans-vitamin K1 was separated from the biologically inactive cis-isomer through a C30 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3 µm), and vitamin K1-d7 was used as an internal standard. Calibration curves were linear over the range of 9.3–464.75 ng ml−1 for trans-vitamin K1 (r 2 > 0.999) and 1.71–85.25 ng ml−1 for cis-vitamin K1 (r 2 > 0.999). The limit of detection for trans- and cis-vitamin K1 was 0.011 µg 100 g−1 and 0.01 µg 100 g−1. The limit of quantification was 0.037 µg 100 g−1 and 0.031 µg 100 g−1, respectively. The intra- and inter-batch variations (RSD%) were less than 5 %. The proposed method was applied to determine vitamin K1 isomers in milk-based, soy-based and rice-based infant formulas, and the cis-vitamin K1 isomer contributes to 7.05–17.21 % of the total vitamin K1 in certain infant formulas.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3ahydrolysis 3ainfant formulas 3aionization 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3aphylloquinone 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aZheng, Feifei1 aFu, Shishan1 aYao, Jianhua1 aTao, Baohua1 aRen, Yiping0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2012 Nov., v. 235, no. 5 p.873-879dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-012-1823-7  aDNAL 7aarticle01618naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011500162300001600277520055500293592002800848650001500876650001800891650001700909650001100926651001400937651002000951700002200971700002300993700002001016700001901036700002501055773010601080856007301186852000901259655001201268IND60727415420221121235918.0210211e20200221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072741542DNAL7 a10.15560/16.1.2112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerniotti, Enzo N.10aNew record and range extension of Bradybaena similaris (Férussac, 1822) (Gastropoda, Camaenidae) in Argentina  ap. 211-217.  aThe Asian tramp snail Bradybaena similaris (Férussac, 1822) is an exotic mollusk native to Southeast Asia.

The combination of highly gregarious larvae with the production of a variety of toxins in P. flavipes has led to severe cases of intoxication in a variety of livestock species. Over the years, considerable information was discovered on the larval natural history of P. flavipes; however, virtually nothing is known about the adult behavior, particularly because of its short life-span. In this study, we report on the first extensive study on the adult behavior of P. flavipes, including movement, mating (with oviposition and maternal care), and thanatosis. Our results show some unusual behavioral adaptations presented by P. flavipes, such as irregular activity behavior (i.e., deficient gait pattern), thanatosis behavior-like display, and primitive maternal care. Individual behavioral acts are described and compared among sexes, and their potential functions are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPergidae 3aoviposition 3anatural history 3asawflies 3alivestock 3atoxins 3alarvae 3agait 3aimagos 3apoisoning 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aUruguay 0aadults1 aPie, MR0 tNeotropical entomology.g2018 Feb., v. 47, no. 1 p.46-52dSpringer USwJournal:jnl69840x1519-566X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-017-0509-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245012500208300001800333520158000351592002801931650001001959650001601969650002101985650001302006650001402019650001202033650001302045650001102058650001002069650002602079650000902105650001602114650001002130650000902140650001402149651001202163651001102175700001702186700001902203773013302222856008302355852000902438655001202447IND60686267720221116175141.0220331e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068626772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-019-02190-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŻarnowiec, Jan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9662-753114aThe alien moss Orthodontium lineare Schwägr. in Poland (East-Central Europe): a summary of nearly 40 years of invasion  ap. 1249-1263.  aOrthodontium lineare, a neophyte of southern origin, was accidentally introduced by human activity to England in 1910. Subsequently it spread to mainland Europe and it continues to move eastward. In Poland, it was discovered in 1980–1981. The present paper shows dot distribution maps at 10-year intervals and discusses the dynamics of its invasion and ecological preferences using statistical methods. In Poland in 2018 it was known in 235 stands. 86.4% of them were located below 300 m a.s.l. and only 10.2% of the sites reached the lower mountain forest belt (maximum altitude 915 m). On every substrate and in all types of habitat, it commonly produced sporophytes (88.6% of the specimens investigated). Most commonly it occurred on rotting wood (38.5% of all records) and the base of tree trunks (33.9%). Rarely it grew on soil (podzolic and acid podzolic brown soils and humus on rocks; in total 19.0%). Most frequently it was found on the dead wood of Pinus sylvestris (31.3% of all records on rotting wood) and Picea abies (23.2%) and on the bases of P. sylvestris trunks (77.0%). Up to 2018 it was listed in 13 habitat types, including eight EU habitats (two priority), the most often invaded being semi-natural forest (25.8% of all records), boggy woodland (23.4%), mature managed forest developed from old plantations (17.7%), wooded dunes of the Atlantic region (9.7%) and Luzulo-Fagetum beech forest (6.9%). 33 accompanying taxa were found comprising 6 liverworts, 23 mosses and 4 lichens. Of these only 7 species were present in more than 5% of the samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aaltitude 3adead wood 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ahumus 3amosses and liverworts 3asoil 3asporophytes 3atrees 3awood 3awoodlands 3aEngland 3aPoland1 aStebel, Adam1 aChmura, Damian0 tBiological invasions.g2020 Apr., v. 22, no. 4 p.1249-1263dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-02190-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05033naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245020500173300001600378520294600394592002803340650002303368650001603391650001703407650001903424650000903443650001203452650002303464650002703487650001003514650001303524650001603537650001403553650001103567650004303578650001803621650002103639650001303660650001503673650001203688650000903700650000903709650000903718650001403727650001303741650001803754650001203772651001103784653001103795653002503806653002103831653003103852653001803883700002503901700003003926700005903956700002204015700005504037700002904092700002804121773009904149856009004248852000904338655001204347IND60532331320221119060652.0190318e20140820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053233132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorais, Sofia10aNew formulated diets for Solea senegalensis broodstock: Effects of parental nutrition on biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and performance of early larval stages and juvenile fish  ap. 374-382.  aSenegalese sole is considered a species with high interest for aquaculture diversification in the South of Europe whose production has shown an important increase in recent years. However, broodstock nutrition of this species is still based on a diet of fresh feeds, which poses important sanitary risks, has variable supply and nutritional composition and contributes to the deterioration of water quality. This study was performed to test two new specifically formulated semi-moist diets for Solea senegalensis broodstock: a control diet (CTR) formulated with high quality ingredients and a further supplemented diet (PLUS), fortified with lipids, vitamins and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), mainly DHA. Larvae originating from simultaneous spawns of both broodstock groups were reared in the same standard conditions up to 67days post-hatching (dph) and effects were assessed on early ontogeny (up to first-feeding), larval (up to 17dph) and juvenile performance. Both diets led to the production of eggs with good viability, hatching rate and fatty acid composition. The fatty acid profile reflected differences in the experimental diets, with eggs from the PLUS group presenting higher levels of both EPA and DHA, although more markedly for EPA. Furthermore, significant differences in the percentage of EPA were maintained until 7dph, while DHA was only significantly higher in eggs and 0dph larvae from the PLUS treatment. The expression of enzymes of the LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway was assessed in parallel and results show that transcript levels of elovl5 and Δ4fad in eggs and newly hatched larvae were affected by broodstock diet and that DHA biosynthesis capacity of Senegalese sole larvae may have been up-regulated at hatching in the CTR treatment. Further nutrient supplementation in the PLUS diet did not enhance larval survival and performance and larvae originating from this treatment were significantly smaller than their CTR counterparts at hatching and 3dph and had lower growth up to 17dph, probably reflecting variations in egg size between batches. However, after metamorphosis, post-larvae from the PLUS treatment quickly caught-up and after complete weaning were significantly larger than juveniles originating from the CTR broodstock. Furthermore, juveniles from the PLUS treatment had a much lower incidence of tail fin deformity. These results were surprising and should be further investigated as, although we cannot exclude a genetic effect, the results could also indicate a nutritional programming effect of broodstock diet in sole juvenile growth and quality. In addition, the results suggest that Senegalese sole larvae are capable of regulating DHA biosynthesis as early as at hatching to counterbalance lower levels of DHA in eggs. Finally, we demonstrate that the current feeding protocol of sole broodstock can be replaced by a safer formulated semi moist diet with good results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolea senegalensis 3aaquaculture 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding stock 3aeggs 3aenzymes 3aexperimental diets 3afatty acid composition 3afeeds 3ahatching 3aingredients 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3ametamorphosis 3anutrient content 3aontogeny 3apostlarvae 3arearing 3arisk 3asole 3atail 3aviability 3avitamins 3awater quality 3aweaning 3aEurope 0aLipids 0aBroodstock nutrition 0aSemi-moist diets 0aEgg fatty acid composition 0aDHA synthesis1 aMendes, Ana Candeias1 aCastanheira, Maria Filipa1 aCoutinho, Joana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3991-33281 aBandarra, Narcisa1 aDias, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2796-26241 aConceição, Luís E.C.,1 aPousão-Ferreira, Pedro0 tAquaculture.g2014 Aug. 20, v. 432 p.374-382dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011100171300001600282520134900298592002801647650002001675650001101695650001201706650001001718650002701728650001401755650001201769650002401781650001101805700002401816700001801840700002501858700001901883773009001902856004801992852000902040655001202049IND50068382820221119234843.0130807e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006838282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-012-1419-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacháček, Jiří,10aSexual reproduction of Daphnia in a deep temperate reservoir: the phenology and genetics of male formation  ap. 113-123.  aLong-term persistence of a Daphnia population is allowed by the production of dormant stages, produced mostly through sexual reproduction. We investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of male production in a spring population of Daphnia galeata in the reservoir, and compared the genetic structure of three groups within this population: male-, female-producing females, and adult males. With a fine resolution sampling design and the use of highly variable microsatellite markers we revealed that: (1) the spring period of male offspring production was delimited in time with minimum interannual variation to about 3 weeks, and in space to the upper 5-m water layer; (2) there were no remarkable changes in the clonal composition of male-producing females within the period of male production; (3) overall certain clones exhibited a higher tendency to produce male offspring and therefore the clonal structure of male-producing lineages was significantly different from that of female-producing lineages; and (4) the clonal structure of male-producing females was not significantly different from that of adult males occurring later in the reservoir. This suggests that males were not subjected to any significant selective forces till maturity and the male-producing females confer a long-term fitness advantage over female-producing females.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia galeata 3aclones 3afemales 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenology 3aprogeny 3asexual reproduction 3aspring1 aVaníčková, Ivana1 aSeda, Jaromir1 aCordellier, Mathilde1 aSchwenk, Klaus0 tHydrobiologia.g2013 Sept., v. 715, no. 1 p.113-123dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1419-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245018400170300001600354520143400370592002801804650001101832650001701843650001101860650001501871650001401886650001401900650001401914650001901928650001501947651001101962700001801973773018701991856008402178990002302262852000902285655001202294IND60093681120221116191133.0141103e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009368112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemer.2011.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantopoulos, G.10aPetrographic and geochemical characteristics of Paleogene turbidite deposits in the southern Aegean (Karpathos Island, SE Greece): Implications for provenance and tectonic setting  ap. 153-166.  aThe provenance and depositional setting of Paleogene turbidite sediments from the southern Aegean are investigated using petrography and whole-rock geochemistry. Petrography indicates that Karpathos Island turbidites are consisting of compositionally immature sandstones (graywackes–litharenites) derived from igneous (plutonic–volcanic), sedimentary, low-grade metamorphic and ophiolitic sources. The studied sediments probably reflect a mixing from an eroded magmatic arc and from quartzose, recycled sources. Major and trace element data are compatible with an acidic to mixed felsic/basic source along with input of ultramafic detritus and recycling of older sedimentary components. Geochemical data also reveal that the sediments have undergone a minor degree of weathering and no significant sediment recycling. Chondrite-normalized REE plots show a light REE enrichment (LaN/YbN ca. 7) and absence of significant negative Eu anomalies, indicating provenance from young undifferentiated arc material with contribution from an old upper continental crust source. Turbidite sedimentation probably took place in a continental island arc depositional setting as a result of subduction of a branch of Neotethys beneath a continental fragment of the Anatolide domain in Early Tertiary times. The relation of Karpathos turbidites with the Pindos foreland basin (Gavrovo and Ionian Zones of western Greece) remains problematic.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ageochemistry 3amixing 3aprovenance 3arecycling 3asediments 3atectonics 3atrace elements 3aweathering 3aGreece1 aZelilidis, A.0 tChemie der Erde - Geochemistry - Interdisciplinary Journal for Chemical Problems of the Geosciences and Geoecology.g2012 June, v. 72, no. 2 p.153-166dElsevier GmbHx0009-28197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemer.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006900169520097600238592002801214650001201242650002101254650001401275650001101289650000901300650001201309650001301321650001601334650002101350653001801371653001601389653001501405700001801420700001501438700001601453700001601469700002101485700002001506700002001526773011301546856008601659852000901745655001201754IND60714035120221118093727.0210708e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071403512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1241682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Li Ping10aP-type doping in internally photoemitted hot carrier solar cells  aHot carriers in hybrid perovskite have been proven to have eminent properties with long carrier cooling time and long carrier migration distance. The invention of the internally photoemitted hot carrier (IPHC) solar cell recently makes it possible to utilize the hot electrons in CH₃NH₃PbI₃ perovskite and capture their excess energies under steady state illumination. How to further improve the efficiency of IPHC cells is challenging and crucial to demonstrate their effectiveness. In this work, sodium iodide (NaI) is added into the CH₃NH₃PbI₃ precursor solution for inducing a P-type doping and downshifting its Fermi level. The lowered energy barrier at the interface of Au/doped CH₃NH₃PbI₃ promotes the hot electron extraction, thereby enhancing the power conversion efficiency of IPHC devices. The FTO/TiO₂/Au/Na⁺-doped MAPbI₃ construction with considerable photocurrent would be an alternative approach for light-to-electricity conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aelectric current 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3agold 3aiodides 3alighting 3asolar cells 3atitanium dioxide 0aP-Type doping 0aHot carrier 0aPerovskite1 aYao, Yan Qing1 aWang, Gang1 aXu, Cun Yun1 aLiu, De Bei1 aZhou, Guang Dong1 aZhong, Yuan Xin1 aSong, Qun Liang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 278 p.124168-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1241683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03765naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009900173520224500272592002802517650002502545650001202570650001002582650001802592650001502610650002402625650002702649650001202676650001402688650001502702650001602717650001302733650001502746650001002761650001202771650002102783650002002804650001602824650000902840650001902849650001802868651001102886651001202897653001502909653001602924653001902940653002502959653001802984653001703002773009603019856008703115852000903202655001203211IND60679554620221122202730.0200210e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067955462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1141282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteckley, Joshua10aCash cropping worms: How the Lumbricus terrestris bait worm market operates in Ontario, Canada  aAnecic earthworms such as Lumbricus terrestris are ecosystem engineers whose impacts on soil fertility and remediation have been extensively researched. The majority of L. terrestris used for such research and practical remediation applications are procured through the largely unknown bait worm market that serves freshwater recreational fishermen across North America and Europe. Some earthworm researchers have questioned the use of these bait worms for research and soil inoculations because of their untraceable origins, unknown environmental exposures and growing conditions, as well as the sustainability of harvesting practices. However, there has been no recent study of this unique industry and how it hand-picks hundreds of millions of L. terrestris worms annually from a single region in southwestern Ontario. This paper provides a detailed description of how land and labour are currently organized to supply the world market for the valuable L. terrestris, commonly known as the “Canadian Nightcrawler” bait worm. Based on 59 semi-structured depth interviews, the findings show there are an estimated 500 to 700 million worms picked annually from farmer fields that stretch between Toronto and Windsor, Ontario. Dairy farms in particular have emerged as de facto L. terrestris production sites because of their perennial alfalfa crops, heavy manure application, and reduced tillage practices. This has made L. terrestris the most lucrative crop in the region with many farmers leasing land to worm-picking operations for over $1000 CND per year ($750 USD/ €685) — approximately four times the regional rental rates. Worm-pickers have historically been recent immigrants to Ontario with the majority of current pickers coming from Vietnam. Worm pickers make $20CND ($15 USD, €13.50) per thousand worms, and can pick over 20,000 worms per night in optimal field conditions (moisture, temperature, wind, moonlight). The piece-rate wages tend to reward speed and efficacy with some pickers capable of making over $600 in a single night. This peculiar arrangement between dairy farmers, soils, and worm pickers opens avenues for socio-economical, agronomical and ecological studies of commercial L. terrestris harvesting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLumbricus terrestris 3aalfalfa 3acrops 3adairy farming 3aearthworms 3aecosystem engineers 3aenvironmental exposure 3afarmers 3afishermen 3aharvesting 3aimmigration 3aindustry 3ainterviews 3alabor 3aleasing 3amanure spreading 3areduced tillage 3aremediation 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3aworld markets 3aEurope 3aOntario 0aBait worms 0aDairy farms 0aMigrant labour 0aRecreational fishing 0aBostimulation 0aVermiculture0 tGeoderma.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 363 p.114128-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1141283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245016600168300001600334520150100350592002801851650002401879650001901903650001201922650001601934650001601950650001601966650002401982650001902006650001202025650002602037650002502063650001902088650002202107650001202129653001802141653002402159653003002183653002102213653001302234700001402247700001702261700005602278700001602334700001702350700001202367773007702379856008902456852000902545655001202554IND60561040620221120174915.0170713e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056104062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Bing10aSingle-stage versus two-stage anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactors in treating municipal wastewater: Performance, foulant characteristics, and microbial community  ap. 158-167.  aThis study examined the receptive performance, membrane foulant characteristics, and microbial community in the single-stage and two-stage anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (AFMBR) treating settled raw municipal wastewater with the aims to explore fouling mechanisms and microbial community structure in both systems. Both AFMBRs exhibited comparable organic removal efficiency and membrane performances. In the single-stage AFMBR, less soluble organic substances were removed through biosorption by GAC and biodegradation than those in the two-stage AFMBR. Compared to the two-stage AFMBR, the formation of cake layer was the main cause of the observed membrane fouling in the single-stage AFMBR at the same employed flux. The accumulation rate of the biopolymers was linearly correlated with the membrane fouling rate. In the chemical-cleaned foulants, humic acid-like substances and silicon were identified as the predominant organic and inorganic fouants respectively. As such, the fluidized GAC particles might not be effective in removing these substances from the membrane surfaces. High-throughout pyrosequencing analysis further revealed that beta-Proteobacteria were predominant members in both AFMBRs, which contributed to the development of biofilms on the fluidized GAC and membrane surfaces. However, it was also noted that the abundance of the identified dominant in the membrane surface-associated biofilm seemed to be related to the permeate flux and reactor configuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3abiopolymers 3abioreactors 3abiosorption 3acommunity structure 3afluidized beds 3afouling 3amicrobial communities 3amunicipal wastewater 3aorganic matter 3asequence analysis 3asilicon 0aAnaerobic MBR 0aBacterial diversity 0aGranular activated carbon 0aMembrane fouling 0aScouring1 aLi, Yifei1 aLim, Weikang1 aLee, Shi Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1026-837X1 aGuo, Qiming1 aFane, A.

Yet, long-term trade data are lacking for many species, precluding analysis of trends and trade dynamics. The Sunda Leopard Cat is endemic to insular Southeast Asia, where despite legal protection, it is openly traded. Data from Java and Bali (1996–2018, 393 surveys, 219 cats recorded in 21 markets) reveal that numbers of cats decreased (1.95/survey in the 1990s, 0.44/survey in the 2010s) and their prevalence decreased (from 46% to 30% of surveys recording cats). Invariably in the animal markets other protected wildlife was for sale, even if Sunda Leopard Cats were not present. Corrected for inflation, prices were higher in recent years (US$59 vs US$26) and higher in markets with low availability, possibly indicating an Anthropogenic Allee Effect whereby a premium is paid for rare species. Direct comparisons between markets reveal a complicated pattern with evidence of a significant decrease from only one market, but clear shifts of the trade between markets. Despite legal protection, we conclude that leopard cats are still commonly traded in Java, alongside other protected wildlife, albeit in smaller numbers than before.  aWe thank the Mohamed bin al Zayed Species Conservation Fund (152511813), National Geographic (GEFNE101-13), People’s Trust for Endangered Species, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo and Zoo Society, International Primate Protection League, Amersfoort Zoo, and Columbus Zoo for providing funding.  aPublisher supplied data  a152511813cMohamed bin al Zayed Species Conservation Fund  aGEFNE101-13cNational Geographic 3aAllee effect 3aPrionailurus bengalensis 3acats 3acrime 3amarkets 3aprices 3arare species 3asurveys 3atrade 3awildlife 3aIndonesia 0aAnthropogenic Allee Effect 0aBali 0aCITES 0aconservation 0aillegal wildlife trade 0aIndonesia 0aJava 0aprotected species 0awild cats1 aArdiansyah, Ahmad1 aBergin, Daniel1 aBirot, Hélène1 aBrown, Ella1 aLanggeng, Abdullah1 aMorcatty, Thais1 aSpaan, Denise1 aSiriwat, Penthai1 aImron, Muhammad Ali1 aNekaris, K.

However, studies to assess their health risks and environmental impacts are scarce. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the toxicological effects of CuO-NPs on the duckweed species Landoltia punctata, which was used as a test organism. To accomplish this, duckweed was grown under standard procedures according to ISO DIS 20079 and exposed to three different concentrations of CuO-NPs (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 g L⁻¹), with one control group (without CuO-NPs). The toxicological effects were measured based on growth rate inhibition, changes in the plant’s morphology, effects on ultrastructure, and alterations in photosynthetic pigments. The morphological and ultrastructural effects were evaluated by electronic, scanning and light microscopic analysis, and CuO-NPs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential, and superficial area methods of analysis. This analysis was performed to evaluate nanoparticle size and form in solution and sample stability. The results showed that CuO-NPs affected morphology more significantly than growth rate. L. punctata also showed the ability to remove copper ions. However, for this plant to be representative within the trophic chain, the biomagnification of effects must be assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3acell biology 3acopper 3aenvironmental impact 3ananoparticles 3apigments 3arisk 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3azeta potential1 aMohedano, Rodrigo de Almeida1 aSchmidt, Éder C.1 aBouzon, Zenilda L.1 aOuriques, Luciane C.1 ados Santos, Rodrigo W.1 ada Costa, Cristina H.1 aVicentini, Denice S.1 aMatias, William Gerson0 tProtoplasma.g2015 Jan., v. 252, no. 1 p.221-229dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-014-0671-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009800161300001600259520157300275592002801848650000801876650004201884650001201926650001301938650001001951650001301961650001001974650002001984650002102004650001402025650001802039650002202057650001302079700002002092700001502112700001602127700001702143700001902160773011602179856008102295852000902376655001202385IND60585292620221119221159.0171108e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058529262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1240-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeale, H.10aHydrogen sulfide causes excision of a genomic island in Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola  ap. 911-921.  aHydrogen sulfide (H₂S) is known to be an important signalling molecule in both animals and plants, despite its toxic nature. In plants it has been seen to control stomatal apertures, so altering the ability of bacteria to invade plant tissues. Bacteria are known to generate H₂S as well as being exposed to plant-generated H₂S. During their interaction with plants pathogenic bacteria are known to undergo alterations to their genomic complement. For example Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (Pph) strain 1302A undergoes loss of a section of DNA known as a genomic island (PPHGI-1) when exposed to the plants resistance response. Loss of PPHGI-1 from Pph 1302A enables the pathogen to overcome the plants resistance response and cause disease. Here, with the use of H₂S donor molecules, changes induced in Pph 1302A genome, as demonstrated by excision of PPHGI-1, were investigated. Pph 1302A cells were found to be resistant to low concentrations of H₂S. However, at sub-lethal H₂S concentrations an increase in the expression of the PPHGI-1 encoded integrase gene (xerC), which is responsible for island excision, and a subsequent increase in the presence of the circular form of PPHGI-1 were detected. This suggests that H₂S is able to initiate excision of PPHGI-1 from the Pph genome. Therefore, H₂S that may emanate from the plant has an effect on the genome structure of invading bacteria and their ability to cause disease in plants.

In this regard, the present investigation employed immunocytochemistry to determine wall composition and possible changes during development of immature and mature embryos of the recalcitrant-seeded cycad Encephalartos natalensis. Fluorescent and gold markers, together with cryo-scanning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were also used to analyse potential changes in the cell walls of mature embryos upon desiccation. Immature cell walls were characterised by low- and high methyl-esterified epitopes of pectin, rhamnogalacturonan-associated arabinan, and the hemicellulose xyloglucan. Arabinogalactan protein recognised by the LM2 antibody, along with rhamnogalacturonan-associated galactan and the hemicellulose xylan, were not positively localised using immunological probes, suggesting that the cell walls of the embryo of E. natalensis do not possess these epitopes. Interestingly, mature embryos appeared to be identical to immature ones with respect to the cell wall components investigated, implying that these may not change during the protracted post-shedding embryogenesis of this species. Drying appeared to induce some degree of cell wall folding in mature embryos, although this was limited by the abundant amyloplasts, which filled the cytomatrical space. Folding, however, was correlated with relatively high levels of wall plasticisers typified by arabinose polymers. From the results of this study, it is proposed that the embryo cell walls of E. natalensis are constitutively prepared for the flexibility required during cell growth and expansion, which may also facilitate the moderate cell wall folding observed in mature embryos upon drying. This, together with the abundant occurrence of amyloplasts in the cytomatrix, may provide sufficient mechanical stabilisation if water is lost, even though the seeds of this species are highly desiccation-sensitive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloplasts 3acell growth 3aEncephalartos 3aepitopes 3acell walls 3aantibodies 3afluorescence 3aarabinose 3atransmission electron microscopy 3acell wall components 3aembryogenesis 3agold 3aseeds 3axylan 3apectins 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aplasticizers 3axyloglucans 3aarabinogalactan proteins 3apolymers 3adrying 0ahemicellulose1 aPammenter, N.

This study mainly focuses on studying the optimal sizing of small and medium-sized hydro-PV systems, which are abundant in the northwest and southwest of China but are rarely considered by the existing researches. In this study, a scenario analysis technique, which includes typical scenario classification, the analysis of the inflow and PV power output under each scenario and scenario combination, is proposed to deal with the uncertainties of the inflow of the hydropower plant and the PV power output. On that basis, an optimization model is developed to determine the optimal size of a PV plant complementarily operating with a hydropower plant, where the hydro-PV hybrid system provides the baseload of local power grid and renewable energy curtailment is not allowed. A two-layer nested algorithm is then proposed to solve the model in a hierarchical structure. In the inner layer, an iterative trial calculation method for coupled dynamic programming is used to optimize the PV capacity for the given scenario. In the outer layer, the traversal search algorithm is employed to search for the optimal PV capacity in each scenario, and a confidence level accumulation method is proposed to determine the PV capacity for different confidence levels. The developed model and method are applied to the Naijili hydro-PV hybrid system which is located in Qinghai Province, China. Case studies demonstrate that the optimization of the PV capacity can significantly promote the consumption of renewable energy and effectively mitigate the adverse impact of PV output fluctuations on the power grids. The optimal PV capacities for different confidence levels are obtained, which can make it easy for planners to determine the installed capacity of the PV plant based on their own appetite for risk. Moreover, it is observed that, for small and medium-sized hydro-PV hybrid systems, the impact of capacity expansion of the hydropower plant on the solar energy consumption and the total power generation of the system is not significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aappetite 3acase studies 3aclassification 3adynamic programming 3aenergy 3ahybrids 3amodels 3apower generation 3arisk 3asolar energy 3asolar farms 3auncertainty 3awater power 3aChina 0aHydro-PV systems 0aOptimization of PV capacity 0aMultiple uncertainties 0aConfidence level1 aLiu, Zhe1 aSu, Chengguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8578-34941 aWang, Xinqi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 276 p.124170-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1241703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245012500202300001800327520116600345592002801511596009801539596009801637596009801735596007101833650002301904650002501927650001601952650001901968650001701987700001502004700001502019700005702034773012902091856008502220852000902305655001202314IND60773937520221119164720.0220420e20220404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077393752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.2c006332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7899-860610aFinding a Sensitive Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopic Thermometer at the Nanoscale by Examining the Functional Groups  ap. 6011-6016.  aTemperature variation at the nanoscale is pivotal for the thermodynamics and kinetics of small entities. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a promising technique for monitoring temperature variations at the nanoscale. A key but ambiguous topic is methods to design a sensitive SERS thermometer. Here, we elucidate that the type of chemical bond of molecular probes and the surface chemical bonding effect are crucial for maximizing the sensitivity of the SERS thermometer, as illustrated by the variable-temperature SERS measurements and quantum chemistry calculations for the frequency–temperature functions of a series of molecules. The sensitivity of the frequency–temperature function follows the sequence of triple bond > double bond > single bond, which is available for both aliphatic and aromatic molecules. The surface chemical bonding effect between the SERS substrate and molecular probe substantially increases the sensitivity of the frequency–temperature function. These results provide universally available guidelines for the rational design of a sensitive SERS thermometer by examining the functional groups of molecular probes.  aPublisher supplied data  a21872094cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21991150cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21991152cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcShanghaiTech Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100012600 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aanalytical chemistry 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3athermometers1 aWu, Liwen,1 aCao, Wumei1 aHuang, Yi-Fan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0615-08140 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Apr. 04, v. 94, no. 15 p.6011-6016dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c006333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03963naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013700161300001400298520206600312592002802378650002702406650002702433650002702460650002102487650001102508650001702519650001602536650002902552650002202581650002402603650001002627650001502637650001502652650001302667650001802680650002202698650002102720650001202741650002402753650003902777650001702816650002502833650002302858650001302881650001602894650002302910650002902933653002702962653002002989653002703009653002003036653001203056700002003068700001903088700001503107773011203122856008203234852000903316655001203325IND60553903520221121225636.0161023e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055390352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2014.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yi10aExpression of c-type lysozyme gene in sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) is highly regulated and time dependent after salt stress  ap. 68-78.  aLysozymes have been confirmed to possess varieties of functions in a range of organisms. In the present study, we cloned and sequenced c-type lysozyme cDNAs, constructed the recombinant protein over-expression of c-type lysozyme and analyzed the expression of transcription level in various tissues. The c-type lysozyme cDNA contained an open reading frame of 759 bp encoding a polypeptide of 252 amino acids. The molecular weight of the deduced amino acid of AjcLYZ is 26.7 kDa with an estimated pI of 4.66. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that AjcLYZ had two highly conserved active sites (Glu147 and Asp159) and eight typical Cys residues. The tertiary structure and modeled AjcLYZ showed structural similarity to Meretrix lusoria LYZ. The results of mRNA transcripts showed that the highest expression was found in the tube foot, followed by the muscle, body wall, and coelomic fluid. In contrast, the intestine, tentacle and respiratory tree exhibited very low expression levels. Under salinity stress, significant down-regulation of AjcLYZ was observed in response to salinity stress in the intestine and coelomic fluid. Significant up-regulation and down-regulation of AjcLYZ were observed in response to salinity stress in body wall and respiratory tree. The purified recombinant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and a single band with a molecular mass of 45.09 kDa, which was in agreement with the theoretical size (26.7 kDa for AjcLYZ and 18.39 kDa Trx-His-S tags) of the recombinant protein. Radial diffusion assay was employed to determine the antimicrobial spectrum of recombinant AjcLYZ against three Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and three sea cucumber pathogenic Vibrio species. From the radius of the antimicrobial zone, it was found that recombinant AjcLYZ harbored remarkable in vitro inhibitive effect on tested Gram-positive bacteria, while lytic activity against Gram-negative bacteria was relatively weak. The results will provide new clues about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the salinity adaption system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aMeretrix lusoria 3aVibrio 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3aantibacterial properties 3acomplementary DNA 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aintegument 3aintestines 3alysozyme 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3amuscles 3aopen reading frames 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolypeptides 3arecombinant proteins 3arespiratory system 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asequence alignment 3atranscription (genetics) 0aApostichopus japonicus 0ac-type lysozyme 0aRecombinant expression 0aSalinity stress 0aqRT-PCR1 aLiang, Xue-wang1 aChang, Ya-qing1 aSong, Jian0 tComparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part B.g2015 Feb., v. 180 p.68-78dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2014.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03719naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245007600161300001400237520242500251592002802676650001502704650001902719650001602738650002902754650001602783650001302799650001202812650002302824650001902847650001902866650001402885650002302899650001102922650001002933650002402943650002102967650002102988650001103009650001803020650001103038651001203049773010803061856007103169852000903240655001203249IND60518341320221121231059.0160412e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051834132DNAL7 a10.2307/29371222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulliam, William M.10aCarbon Dioxide and Methane Exports from a Southeastern Floodplain Swamp  ap. 29-53.  aPatterns and rates of generation of CO₂ and CH₄ by aerobic and anaerobic soil respiration are a significant gap in knowledge of floodplain carbon dynamics. Gaseous and hydrologic exports of CO₂ and CH₄ from the forested floodplain of the Ogeechee River in Georgia, USA, were studied from July 1987 to September 1989. Net emissions to the atmosphere were measured with short (10—20 min) static chamber incubations. CO₂ emissions were highly seasonal, with largest rates during summer, and were strongly correlated with soil temperatures. Annual total CO₂ emissions were similar in both years of the study, and averaged 919 g/m². The contribution of live root respiration to this total was estimated with in situ incubations of attached roots excavated from the soil. Over 55% of the total CO₂ flux appeared to arise from live roots rather than mineralization of soil organic matter. Significant atmospheric CH₄ fluxes were found only at flooded sites. CH₄ emissions were highly variable, with high rates of release of methane carbon (up to 271 mg · m— ² · d— ¹) occurring irregularly during the warmer months. The temperature effect on CH₄ emissions appeared to be a step function. No significant CH₄ emissions occurred when soil temperatures were below 15°C; during warmer periods emission rates were generally positive, but showed no additional correlation with temperature. This effect is hypothesized to represent an interaction of the rates of oxygen consumption and replenishment in the soil. Spatial variability in CH₄ emissions was also large. Over 90% of the total floodplain CH₄ emissions came from the 30% of the floodplain that was most frequently inundated. Annual total fluxes of CH₄ carbon from low habitats averaged 17 g · m— ² · yr— ¹. Methane oxidation rates were estimated in floodplain surface waters by in situ bottle incubations. Roughly half of the CH₄ that entered the water column was consumed without reaching the atmosphere. Hydrologic exports of CO₂ and CH₄ via surface and groundwater were small, representing ≈1—2% of total export for both species, and were much less important than fluvial exports of organic carbon. Overall, floodplain detrital carbon processing was dominated by aerobic respiration and gaseous CO₂ export, although methanogenesis did constitute up to 20% of total soil respiration at some sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobiosis 3acarbon dioxide 3afloodplains 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3amethane 3amethane production 3amineralization 3aorganic carbon 3aoxidation 3aoxygen consumption 3arivers 3aroots 3asoil organic matter 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asummer 3asurface water 3aswamps 3aGeorgia0 tEcological monographs.g1993 Feb., v. 63, no. 1 p.29-53dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/29371223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245008400158300001600242520242400258592002802682650001102710650001002721650000902731650002502740650001302765650001602778650001302794650001102807650001602818650001502834650001402849650001602863650000902879650001302888650001902901650001902920650001002939650001102949650002002960650001902980650001202999651001303011700002703024773011003051856007103161852000903232655001203241IND60518341420221123044647.0160412e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051834142DNAL7 a10.2307/29371782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillson, Mary F.10aVariation of Dispersal Phenology in a Bird‐Dispersed Shrub, Cornus Drummondii  ap. 151-172.  aVariation in the timing of seed dispersal among individuals of Cornus drummondii was marked at two sites in east—central Illinois. Individuals whose fruit crops were removed most quickly shared few characteristics. Fruit removal rates, dispersal efficiency (percent of total crop removed), and dispersal success (estimated percent of dispersed seeds attributable to each individual) were not closely related to characteristics of the fruits or the immediate environment of the parent plant. Although small fruit crops were often depleted proportionately faster than large crops, dispersal success relative to others in the population was positively related to crop size; i.e., plants with larger crops contributed more seeds to the total pool of dispersed seeds than plants with smaller crops. Over the 4—yr study, individual plants often exhibited between—year differences in ripening time, crop size, and pulp characteristics, but between—year correlations of traits were only sporadically significant. Crop size showed the most consistent between—year correlation (i.e., plants with large crops tended to make large crops in all years), but even this trait was not always correlated between years. Dispersal success was usually correlated between years, but dispersal efficiency was not. Annual (and sometimes site) differences in most dispersal—related plant traits and in dispersal efficiency and dispersal success were common. No plant traits except crop size had consistent effects on dispersal success, although we found some evidence of selective foraging. We suggest that fruit removal may be more a function of avian biology (flocking and social behavior, frequency of foraging interruptions, sun—seeking in cold weather, etc.) than of most characteristics of the fruiting plant. The ecological consequences of differences in dispersal phenology were variable between years. Postdispersal seed predation and germination success showed no consistent seasonal trends. The most important consequence of failure of early fruit dispersal may be a high probability of nondispersal (falling, rotting, being eaten by a predispersal seed predator or poor dispersal agent). Great variation in space and time in the outcome of bird/fruit interactions means that studies directed at the evolution of the interactions need to have both larger samples sizes and longer duration than has been feasible so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCornus 3abirds 3acold 3aenvironmental impact 3aforaging 3afruit crops 3afruiting 3afruits 3agermination 3agranivores 3aphenology 3aprobability 3apulp 3aripening 3aseed dispersal 3aseed predation 3aseeds 3ashrubs 3asocial behavior 3aspace and time 3aweather 3aIllinois1 aWhelan, Christopher J.0 tEcological monographs.g1993 Feb., v. 63, no. 2 p.151-172dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/29371783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011800167520099300285592002801278650002101306650002501327650001401352650001901366650001701385650002101402650002101423653002101444653002001465653003001485653002501515700001501540700001601555700001501571700001201586700002001598700001801618700001301636700001701649700001701666773010801683856008601791852000901877655001201886IND60698536820221120215035.0200808e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069853682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1166202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bulei10aExtraction, purification, and determination of the gastroprotective activity of glucomannan from Bletilla striata  aIn this study, a water-soluble polysaccharide (BSP) was extracted and purified from pseudobulb of Bletilla striata. The preliminary structure and gastroprotective activity of BSP were analyzed. Results indicate that BSP is a glucomannan with a molar ratio of 7.45:2.55 (Man:Glc), and its molecular weight is approximately 1.7 × 10⁵ Da. BSP displayed outstanding protective action against ethanol-induced GES-1 cell injury in vitro, as well as, excellent gastroprotective activity in vivo. Especially, a high-dose of BSP (100 mg/kg) could reduce the ulcer index of the gastric mucosa and increase the percentage of ulcer inhibition, which possibly caused by enhancing the antioxidant capacity and inhibiting the apoptotic pathway in gastric tissue. Interestingly, BSP exhibited a comparative gastroprotective activity to that of positive control (omeprazole). In summary, our results indicated that BSP could be considered as a potential supplement for the prevention of gastric injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBletilla striata 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3agastric mucosa 3aglucomannans 3amolecular weight 3awater solubility 0aBletilla striata 0aPolysaccharides 0aGastroprotective activity 0aAntioxidant activity1 aZhang, Hui1 aChen, Lijun1 aMi, Zeyuan1 aXu, Yan1 aZhao, Guangming1 aLichuanjushi,1 aLei, Hui1 aWang, Zhezhi1 aNiu, Junfeng0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 246 p.116620-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1166203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013400164500002000298520188900318592002802207596002702235596004002262650001602302650001202318650003802330650001702368650001902385650001302404650000902417650001302426650001502439650002102454650001302475650001802488650002102506650001602527650002102543650003302564650001502597650001402612700002102626700005802647773011502705856007802820852000902898655001202907IND60662542020191213000000.0190906e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066254202DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2019000602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsiri, Saeed A.10aEnzymatic Modification of Granular Potato Starch ‐ Effect of Debranching on Morphological, Molecular, and Functional Properties  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe debranching enzyme pullulanase (PUL) is used in order to conduct a partial conversion of a regular granular potato starch (PS) improving the techno‐functional properties when used as a gelling agent. The starch is hydrolyzed systematically by grading the amount of a technical enzyme solution added (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mL PUL solution) resulting 400 g of a 20% (w/w) suspension. Morphological characteristics of the granules (scanning electron microscopy, SEM), swelling behavior (differential scanning calorimetry, DSC), polymer solubility, hot paste viscosity, gel strength, and molecular properties of the starch samples (size exclusion chromatography‐multi angle laser light scattering‐differential refractive index detection, SEC‐MALS‐DRI) as well as the respective separated amylose (AM) and amylopectin (AP; size exclusion chromatography‐conventional standard calibration‐differential refractive index detection, SEC‐cal‐DRI) branch chains fractions are comprehensively analyzed. The granule surface is visibly affected, but the granular structure is largely intact. The DSC gelatinization characteristics are impacted manifold, and the solubility, in particular when disintegrated using pressure cooking, increases. The hot paste viscosity decreases, while the ability to form mechanically stable gel structures increases due to modification. The weight‐average molar mass (Mw) decreases from 38.2 × 10⁶ (native) to 2.3 × 10⁶ g mol⁻¹ (40 mL PUL solution), in particular due to cleavage of α‐1,6‐linkages within the AP. Surprisingly, the detailed analysis reveals a concomitant and remarkable degradation of the AM‐fraction. The partial hydrolysis of granular starch by means of a debranching enzyme is shown to be basically a very specific, fast, and serious alternative to e.g., the acid‐tinning process.  aPublisher supplied data  cKing Faisal University  cSaudi Arabian Ministry of Education 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agel strength 3agelatinization 3agelation 3agels 3agranules 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3apotato starch 3apressure cooking 3apullulanase 3arefractive index 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3aviscosity1 aFlöter, Eckhard1 aUlbrich, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1454-70370 tStärke =.g2019 Sept., v. 71, no. 9-10 p.e1900060-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2019000603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008300171520140800254592002801662650001101690650001901701650003301720650002601753650001501779650002901794650001301823650001101836650001501847650001801862650002301880650001501903650001601918650002401934650002101958650002101979650001502000650002302015650001302038653001902051653002702070653002702097653002802124700001602152700002002168700001902188700002702207773009602234856008702330852000902417655001202426IND60679555020221122230939.0200210e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067955502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1141532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstruch, Carme10aSpecies identity improves soil respiration predictions in a semiarid scrubland  aSoil respiration accounts for ca. three quarters of total ecosystem respiration and is sensitive to temperature and moisture. Plants can influence soil CO₂ emissions through specific effects on soil humidity, soil temperature and soil microbial communities. These plant-soil effects mostly come via litter production and root exudates, enhancing soil autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. We explored how plant species affected soil CO₂ emissions in an arid environment. We altered soil temperature in bare soil and under the canopy of four plant species differing in functional type, and measured monthly fluxes to establish seasonal patterns of CO₂ release along a 20-month period. We found that soil temperature explained 69% of the annual soil respiration (SR) variance, while soil water content explained 71% of SR variance. When we included plant species identity in the model, soil temperature and soil water content explained 76% and 81% of SR variance, respectively, exemplifying how plant species modulate SR responses as a function of temperature and water availability. Our results demonstrate that plant species influence soil carbon balance and emphasize that species identity matters in dry ecosystems. SR dynamics in dry ecosystems can be accurately modelled with soil water and temperature as predictors, but models are more efficient if plant species identity is considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahumidity 3amodels 3aprediction 3aroot exudates 3aseasonal variation 3ashrublands 3asoil carbon 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3avariance 0aClimate change 0aArid plant communities 0aSeasonal CO2 emissions 0aSoil respiration models1 aMacek, Petr1 aArmas, Cristina1 aPistón, Nuria1 aPugnaire, Francisco I.0 tGeoderma.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 363 p.114153-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1141533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245012300211300001600334506007600350520146500426592002801891506003701919650002601956650002301982650002202005650002202027650002302049650002602072650003002098650001502128650001702143650001602160650001502176650001802191650000902209650001602218651001102234700002802245700002102273773008702294856008102381852000902462655001202471IND60518171820221207112018.0160407e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051817182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-015-0717-12doi7 aPMC48233222pmcid7 a266873432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStępień, Łukasz10aWildly Growing Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.)

Most of them produce mycotoxins in plant tissues, thus affecting the physiology of the host plant. However, there is lack of information on Fusarium communities in wild asparagus, where they would definitely have considerable environmental significance. Therefore, the main scientific aim of this study was to identify the Fusarium species and quantify their typical mycotoxins present in wild asparagus plants collected at four time points of the season. Forty-four Fusarium strains of eight species—Fusarium acuminatum, Fusarium avenaceum, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium proliferatum, Fusarium sporotrichioides, and Fusarium tricinctum—were isolated from nine wild asparagus plants in 2013 season. It is the first report of F. sporotrichioides isolated from this particular host. Fumonisin B₁ was the most abundant mycotoxin, and the highest concentrations of fumonisins B₁–B₃ and beauvericin were found in the spears collected in May. Moniliformin and enniatins were quantified at lower concentrations. Mycotoxins synthesized by individual strains obtained from infected asparagus tissues were assessed using in vitro cultures on sterile rice grain. Most of the F. sporotrichioides strains synthesized HT-2 toxin and F. equiseti strains were found to be effective zearalenone producers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAsparagus officinalis 3aFusarium avenaceum 3aFusarium culmorum 3aFusarium equiseti 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium proliferatum 3aFusarium sporotrichioides 3aHT-2 toxin 3afumonisin B1 3ahost plants 3aphysiology 3aplant tissues 3arice 3azearalenone 3aEurope1 aWaśkiewicz, Agnieszka,1 aUrbaniak, Monika0 tMicrobial ecology.g2016 May, v. 71, no. 4 p.927-937dSpringer USx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-015-0717-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013000167300001600297520128400313592002801597650002501625650002501650650001501675650001601690650001001706650002201716650002701738650001901765650001301784651001401797700002101811700001401832700001901846700002001865700001801885773011601903856008102019852000902100655001202109IND60585293120221119220924.0171108e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058529312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1247-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalacios, S.

This study evaluated the presence of FGSC in durum wheat from the main growing area in Argentina and analyzed the trichothecene genotype and chemotype of the strains isolated. Also, the genetic variability of the strains was assayed using ISSR markers. Molecular analysis revealed that among the strains isolated and identified morphologically as F. graminearum, there were 14 strains identified as F. cerealis. Also, it revealed that durum wheat grains were mostly contaminated by F. graminearum, being this the only species reported so far, within the FGSC, affecting durum wheat in Argentina. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated a high genetic variability within rather than between F. graminearum populations. All F. graminearum strains presented 15ADON genotype and were able to produce DON while all F. cerealis strains presented the NIV genotype and most of them were able to produce this toxin.

Juvenile soft-shelled turtles, Pelodiscus sinensis, were fed diets that contained 36, 160, 357, 630, 947, 1249, or 1560mg/kg Mg and 11g/kg of phytic acid for 8weeks. Weight gain of turtles generally increased as dietary Mg increased up to approximately 630mg/kg followed by a plateau stage till 1560mg/kg. The plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, carapace strength and concentration of Mg in the tissue generally increased as dietary Mg concentrations increased from 36 to 947mg/kg. However, increases in Mg beyond 947mg/kg caused the Mg concentrations in the tissue and carapace strength to remain constant. When 11g/kg of phytic acid was added to the diet and broken-line analysis used weight gain as the indicator, the dietary Mg requirements for soft-shelled turtles was estimated at 715mg/kg. This is a 10% increase from the requirement reported for turtles fed a phytate-free diet. A dietary intake of 970mgMg/kg is recommended to further enhance carapace strength and plasma ALP activity in soft-shelled turtles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelodiscus sinensis 3aalkaline phosphatase 3afood intake 3ajuveniles 3amagnesium 3aphytic acid 3aturtles 3aweight gain 0aMagnesium sulfate 0aSoft-shelled turtle 0aMg requirement 0aPhytic acid1 aChen, Shu-Mei1 aHuang, Chen-Huei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4390-65020 tAquaculture.g2014 Aug. 20, v. 432 p.80-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245011100157500002000268520117100288592002801459596004501487596005901532596005801591596005601649650001201705650001201717650001501729650001901744650002301763650002501786650001601811650001601827700001601843700001801859700001401877700001501891773011501906856007802021852000902099655001202108IND60662542220191213000000.0190906e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066254222DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2018002922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jie10aEffect of Ultrasound‐Assisted Isolation on Yield and Properties of High‐Amylose Starch from Amylomaize  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEffect of ultrasound‐assisted wet‐milling on yield and properties of high amylose starch from amylomaize was investigated. The defibered mixture of starch and protein (mill starch) was sonicated by an ultrasonic processor. The highest yield of 56.68 % was obtained with steeping time of 36 h, ultrasonic power of 200 W, ultrasonic time of 15 min, and mill starch to water ratio of 1:1, while maintaining SO₂ concentration of 0.05% in steepwater and a constant ultrasound frequency of 20 kHz. The starch isolated by sonication showed significantly lower b values (yellowness). Ultrasound did not cause changes in starch granular size, morphology, surface, and ordered structures at both short‐range and long‐range scale (p>0.05). The effect of ultrasound was also insignificant on thermal properties (p>0.05). The results demonstrated that the ultrasound did not alter the structures and properties of the isolated starches. Approximately 11% of starch yield was increased, 75% of SO₂ content in steepwater was reduced and 25 % of steeping time was reduced by ultrasound‐assisted method compared with those of conventional wet‐milling process.  aPublisher supplied data  a21420004cHenan University of Technology  a2015GGJS‐035cEducation Department of Henan Province  a817142cNatural Science Foundation of Hainan Province  cHenan Scientific and Technological Research Project 3aamylose 3asoaking 3asonication 3asulfur dioxide 3athermal properties 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3awet milling1 aWang, Yadan1 aFang, Guihong1 aMan, Yong1 aLiu, Yawei0 tStärke =.g2019 Sept., v. 71, no. 9-10 p.e1800292-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2018002923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009400170300001800264520143400282592002801716650002101744650002301765650001501788650002201803650001001825650002101835650001701856650002001873650000901893650001501902650001301917653002001930653001501950653001301965653001501978653001801993653001502011653000902026700001802035700006002053700001702113773012102130856008802251852000902339655001202348IND60589535220221120150523.0190206e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058953522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.3192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, M.10aToxic effects of human pharmaceuticals to Folsomia candida – A multigeneration approach  ap. 1225-1233.  aThe study of the effects of human pharmaceuticals has been considered a priority in terms of environmental safety. However, the available information concerning soil organisms is scarce. To decrease this knowledge gap, the effects of carbamazepine and fluoxetine (0.04, 0.4, 4 and 40mg·kg−1 of soil) were assessed on the springtail Folsomia candida, for three consecutive generations. The assessed endpoints included survival, reproduction and biomarkers associated with biotransformation, neurotransmission and peroxidative damage. A light avoidance behavior test was performed, in the third generation. The obtained data demonstrate that both pharmaceuticals may affect Collembola populations after three generational exposures, as showed by the decrease trend for both survival and reproduction. The effects of carbamazepine were however, more pronounced. After the third generational exposure to all carbamazepine tested concentrations and the three highest concentrations of fluoxetine, F. candida displayed altered light avoidance behavior. The biochemical endpoints also revealed that carbamazepine and fluoxetine may exert toxic effects to F. candida through the induction of oxidative stress and impairment in neurotransmission with an apparent higher potential for carbamazepine. Overall, data show that the effects of pharmaceuticals throughout different generations should be considered in risk assessment studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFolsomia candida 3aavoidance behavior 3abiomarkers 3abiotransformation 3adrugs 3aoxidative stress 3areproduction 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3asoil biota 3atoxicity 0aMultigeneration 0aCollembola 0aBehavior 0aBiomarkers 0aCarbamazepine 0aFluoxetine 0aSoil1 aCardoso, D.N.1 aSoares, A.M.V.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0879-94701 aLoureiro, S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 June 01, v. 625 p.1225-1233dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.3193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009000169520140500259592002801664650001501692650001301707650001901720650002201739650001201761650001901773650001601792650000901808650001601817650001901833653002201852653002501874653002401899700001901923700001901942773009601961856008702057852000902144655001202153IND60679555220221122230944.0200210e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067955522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1141502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Min-oh14aThe kinetics of mercury vaporization in soil during low-temperature thermal treatment  aEquilibrium vapor-phase Hg concentrations and vaporization kinetics at temperatures from 100 to 400 °C were evaluated in field soil naturally contaminated with Hg⁰, as well as sand artificially contaminated with HgCl₂, HgO, and HgS. The calculated change in the standard enthalpy of Hg vaporization (ΔH⁰) was 4.73 (±1.52), 2.11 (±0.17), 5.59 (±0.25), and 4.87 (±0.46) kcal mol⁻¹ for naturally Hg⁰-contaminated field soil and sand artificially contaminated with HgCl₂, HgO, and HgS, respectively. The measured ΔH⁰ was 30% of the theoretical ΔH⁰, which suggests that higher temperatures are required to remove Hg from contaminated soil when compared to pure chemical states. Thermal vaporization and desorption kinetics tended to increase upon increasing the temperature; however, the rates at 300 and 400 °C were similar to each other due to kinetic limitations. Our theoretical calculations showed that 90% Hg removal from field contaminated soil at 100, 300, and 400 °C would require 204 days, 3.5 h, and 2.7 h, respectively. At low temperature (i.e., approximately 100 °C), an unrealistically long time was required for Hg removal from soil; however, increasing the temperature up to 400 °C did not necessarily decrease the remediation time. Thus, optimal remediation temperature needs to be evaluated based on Hg thermal desorption and volatilization kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesorption 3aenthalpy 3aheat treatment 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3asand 3atemperature 3avolatilization 0aThermal treatment 0aHg-contaminated soil 0aDesorption kinetics1 aKim, Moon-Hyun1 aHong, Yongseok0 tGeoderma.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 363 p.114150-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1141503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100002100192245014500213300001800358506007600376520169800452592002802150506003702178650001702215650001902232650003502251650001102286650001802297650002602315650002702341650002302368650001102391650001202402650001302414650001902427650002802446650002002474650001602494650001302510650001002523651002302533653001502556653001902571653001102590653002302601653000802624700006302632700002002695700001802715700001802733773009902751856008602850852000902936655001202945IND60655307720221207081307.0200824e20190823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065530772DNAL7 aPMC71821532pmcid7 a313785352pmid7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrivatt, Sara R.10aLongitudinal quantification of adenovirus neutralizing responses in Zambian mother-infant pairs: Impact of HIV-1 infection and its treatment  ap. 5177-5184.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVaccination offers the most cost-effective approach to limiting the adverse impact of infectious and neoplastic diseases that reduce the quality of life in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, it is unclear what vaccine vectors would be most readily implementable in the setting and at what age they should be applied for maximal efficacy. Adenoviruses (Ad) and Ad-based vectors have been demonstrated to induce effective humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in humans. However, because immunity associated with Ad infection is lifelong, there exists a debate as to whether pre-existing immunity might decrease the efficacy of Ad vectored vaccines. In order to begin to rationally develop vaccination strategies for SSA, we have quantified neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against Ad4, Ad5, Ad7, Ad26, Ad28, Ad45 and Ad48 in 67 adult women and their infants. We are the first to define the decay kinetics of transferred maternal nAb in infants as well as the apparent initiation of de novo Ad responses. Our findings demonstrate that in Zambian adults, robust nAb responses exist against each of the Ads tested and are efficiently transferred to newborns. With few exceptions, neither the HIV-1 infection status of the mothers or the antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment of HIV-1 disease had significant impact on maternal Ad nAb responses or their transfer to infants. However, maternal Ad nAb decays in infants to a nadir at 12 months of age such that any of the seven Ad types could function as vaccine vectors. The definition of this ‘window of opportunity’ provides important foundational data for rational design and implementation of Ad vectors in this setting.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAdenoviridae 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aadults 3aanimal models 3aantiretroviral agents 3acell-mediated immunity 3acost effectiveness 3ahumans 3amothers 3aneonates 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aquality of life 3avaccination 3avaccines 3awomen 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aAdenovirus 0aSeroprevalence 0aVector 0aSub-Saharan Africa 0aHIV1 aBullard, Brianna L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6702-00791 aWeaver, Eric A.1 aWood, Charles1 aWest, John T.0 tVaccine.g2019 Aug. 23, v. 37, no. 36 p.5177-5184dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012000164300001800284520111800302592002801420650002501448650001601473650002401489650001301513650001301526650002501539650001901564650001901583650002401602650001301626650002301639700001901662700002001681773010201701856004801803852000901851655001201860IND4480833220221119004402.0120715e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448083322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5201-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, ChunRong10aPreparation and evaluation of biomimetric nano-hydroxyapatite-based composite scaffolds for bone-tissue engineering  ap. 2787-2792.  aIn the present study, novel biomimetic composite scaffolds with a composition similar to that of natural bone were prepared, using nano-hydroxyapatite, collagen, and phosphatidylserine. The scaffolds possess an interconnected porous structure with a porosity of 84%. The pore size ranges from several micrometers up to about 400 Î¼m. In-vitro studies in simulated body fluids showed that the morphologies of the products derived from mineralization can be regulated by the extracellular matrix components of the scaffolds; this in turn leads to creation of a large number of hydroxyapatite crystals on the scaffold surface. The regulatory properties of collagen and phosphatidylserine also influenced the cell response to the composite scaffolds. MC3T3-E1 cells attached and spread on the surfaces of the materials and interacted with the substrates; this may be the result of charged groups on the composite materials. Radiological analysis suggested that calluses and bone bridges formed in defects within 12 weeks.

We analyzed PFO typologies from 28 European countries published from 1985 to 2015 in peer-reviewed journals and grey literature with respect to 1) research approaches and methods used; 2) typology objectives and problems addressed; 3) policy and management recommendations given. Using an on-line questionnaire we asked the first authors of the most relevant publications to retrospectively assess 4) the use of their typologies in education, science and forest policy. Most of the 66 publications reviewed share the common objective of providing a better understanding of forest ownership. Typologies were also developed to address roundwood mobilization, delivery of public goods, forest management approaches, involvement in PFO associations and entrepreneurship. The most common methodological approach was quantitative where owners were grouped by k-means clustering into 2 to 6 types and labelled with various names. Most frequently used labels were Multiobjective owners, Recreationists, Investors, Farmers, Indifferent owners, Conservationists, Multifunctional owners and Self-employed owners. Policy implications remain vague. The typologies had mostly been used in teaching and occasionally by politicians, civil servants or stakeholders. Only a half of the typologies had a follow-up study or was updated over time by the authors. After decades of classifying PFOs, it seems necessary to explore the link between typologies and forest owners' overt behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aeducation 3aentrepreneurship 3afarmers 3aforest management 3aforest ownership 3aforest policy 3anonindustrial private forests 3apublic services and goods 3aquestionnaires 3aroundwood 3astakeholders 3aEurope 0aFamily forests 0aLandowners 0aNon-industrial 0aPolicy instruments 0aLiterature review 0aClassification1 aLidestav, Gun1 aNí Dhubháin, Áine,1 aKarppinen, Heimo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8631-18431 aZivojinovic, Ivana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9900-70661 aWestin, Kerstin0 tForest policy and economics.g2019 Feb., v. 99 p.21-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2017.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010900165520143300274592002801707650001601735650002501751650002801776650002001804650001501824650002801839653001901867653001501886653001801901653001501919653001901934653000801953653001601961700001701977700005201994700001702046773011302063856008602176852000902262655001202271IND60714036120221118093645.0220719e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071403612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1241792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolff, S.10aTransforming automotive companies into sustainability leaders: A concept for managing current challenges  aDieselgate and the public focus on sustainability raise the question to what extent sustainability is implemented in automotive companies. Although, mandatory reporting tracks companies’ sustainability strategies and goals, this does not entail comprehensive operational measures to increase company sustainability. To analyze internal sustainability perspectives and measures, we examine benchmarking initiatives and corporate sustainability reports and compare them to interviews with employees of automobile manufacturers from management to operational level. This comparison shows that the transformation to sustainable companies is hindered by a lack of a common understanding of sustainability, a failure to assign responsibility, and the absence of measurable sustainability targets. To close the gap between the communicated strategy and operational implementation, we propose the concept of the ‘‘Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Owner". Analogous to the Product Owner (from Scrum) and Process Owner (from Lean Management) concepts, an SDG Owner is responsible for implementation and performance of sustainable products or process transformations by setting transparent, quantified, and well-defined defined sustainability goals. Thus, the SDG owner links the sustainability goals at management level with those at implementation level enabling a successful corporate transformation into sustainability leaders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic sustainability 3ahuman resources 3ainterviews 3asustainable development 0aSustainability 0aAutomotive 0aManufacturers 0aManagement 0aTransformation 0aSDG 0aDevelopment1 aBrönner, M.1 aHeld, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3751-39021 aLienkamp, M.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 276 p.124179-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1241793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01303naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245003800153300001800191520027900209592002800488650002300516650002700539650002300566650002200589650000900611700002100620700002100641700001900662700002100681700002100702700001900723773012900742856007300871852000900944655001200953IND60658524420221118031844.0190817e20091117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065852442DNAL7 a10.1039/b916225a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkada, Jun10aEnzyme-mediated protein refolding  ap. 7197-7199.  aWe employed a urease-catalyzed reaction to gradually remove a high concentration of a chaotropic agent (urea) from a denatured protein solution and demonstrated that efficient protein refolding can be achieved by the urease-catalyzed reaction, without large-volume dilution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aprotein refolding 3aurea1 aMaruyama, Tatsuo1 aMotomura, Konomi1 aKuroki, Kimiko1 aMaenaka, Katsumi1 aSakono, Masafumi1 aGoto, Masahiro0 tChemical communications.g2009 Nov. 17, , no. 46 p.7197-7199dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b916225a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245018100168520189300349592002802242650000902270650002702279650002602306650001602332650001602348650003002364650001502394650001302409650001302422650002102435650002502456650002602481650002302507650001202530650002202542650001802564650003302582650001202615650001202627650002202639650001802661653002102679653002202700653001602722653001502738653002402753700001702777700001702794700001202811700001802823700002702841700001402868773009602882856008702978852000903065655001203074IND60679555420221122202628.0200210e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067955542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1141562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Haofeng10aConventional flooding irrigation and over fertilization drives soil pH decrease not only in the top- but also in subsoil layers in solar greenhouse vegetable production systems  aConventional flooding irrigation combined with over-fertilization in intensively used solar greenhouse vegetable production systems are jeopardizing soil productivity and groundwater quality due to soil acidification and nitrogen (N) leaching. While it has been shown that excessive application of N fertilizer in greenhouse production systems significantly reduces topsoil pH values, it remains unknown if also subsoil pH values do change too and if surplus N fertilization and hydrological N losses lead to nutrient imbalances. In this study, soil samples from six soil layers from 0 to 300 cm were taken from 45 greenhouse fields with three representative cultivation years (2, 5, and 10 years). Soil samples from 5 adjacent corn fields served as comparison. Results show that (1) compared to soils from adjacent corn fields, the pH in the 0–30 cm soil layer was slightly elevated two years and five years after greenhouse establishment, but was lowered by 0.52 ± 0.06 units after ten years. Moreover, also the pH in deeper soil layers (30–300 cm) significantly decreased with cultivation years. (2) A significant imbalance of N:P:K ratios in greenhouse top soils was found, as P and K accumulates while N is leached to subsoils. (3) Structural equation modeling indicated that changes in the mineral N concentration in the 0–30 cm soil layer was driving soil pH changes. Our results demonstrate that N accumulation in top soils and N leaching to deep soil caused by excessive irrigation explains observed declines in surface and deep soil pH values of conventional greenhouse vegetable production systems. Consequently, for avoiding groundwater contamination with N and for ensuring sustainable soil productivity, current schemes of irrigation and fertilization management need to be adapted to avoid N leaching, soil acidification, nutrient accumulation and imbalances.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3afertilizer application 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3airrigation 3aleaching 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aproduction technology 3asoil acidification 3asoil pH 3asoil productivity 3asoil sampling 3astructural equation modeling 3asubsoil 3atopsoil 3avegetable growing 3awater quality 0aSolar greenhouse 0aCultivation years 0aSoil depths 0aN leaching 0aNutrient imbalances1 aZhao, Yiming1 aWang, Yafang1 aWan, Li1 aWang, Jingguo1 aButterbach-Bahl, Klaus1 aLin, Shan0 tGeoderma.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 363 p.114156-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1141563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009600166300001800262520102500280592002801305596009801333596009801431596010301529596012801632596009801760596011301858650002501971650002601996650001602022650002302038650001302061700001702074700001402091700001402105700001502119700001502134700001502149700003702164700005602201700001602257700005502273773012902328856008502457852000902542655001202551IND60773938220221119164832.0220420e20220406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077393822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.2c010542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Fudan10aHighly Chiral Selective Resolution in Pillar[6]arenes Functionalized Microchannel Membranes  ap. 6065-6070.  aHigh flux microchannel membranes have the potential for large scale separations. However, it is prevented by poor enantioselectivity. Therefore, the development of a high-enantioselective microchannel membrane is of great importance for large scale chiral separations. In this work, chiral gold nanoparticles are incorporated into the microchannel membrane to astringe the large pores and improve the enantioselectivity. Here, the gold nanoparticles are functionalized by l-phenylalanine-derived pil-lararenes (l-Phe-P6@AuNPs) as the chiral receptor of R-phenylglycinol (R-PGC) over its enantiomer. This chiral Au NPs coated microchannel membrane (l-Phe-P6@AuNPs microchannel) shows a selectivity of 5.40 for R-PGC and a flux of 140.35 nmol·cm–²·h–¹, where the enantioselectivity is improved, ensuring its flux. Compared with the enantioselectivity and flux of nanochannel membranes reported in literatures, the l-Phe-P6@AuNPs microchannel has the advantage for enantioselectivity and flux for chiral separation.  aPublisher supplied data  a21772055cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22071074cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  a2021YFA0716702cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  aB17019cHigher Education Discipline Innovation Projectdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100013314  aSKLF-KF-202103cState Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan Universitydhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3ananogold1 aZhang, Siyun1 aYang, Lei1 aLi, Guang1 aXu, Weiwei1 aQu, Haonan1 aZhang, Jin1 aDhinakaran, Manivannan Kalavathi1 aXu, Chuanlai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5639-71021 aCheng, Jing1 aLi, Haibing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6374-46940 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Apr. 06, v. 94, no. 15 p.6065-6070dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c010543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04156naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245020900210300001600419520181400435592002802249596007202277596009502349596009502444596009502539596009502634596008102729596008102810650002602891650001202917650002502929650001402954650001602968650001702984650001303001650001103014650001103025650002003036700002403056700001803080700006203098700002603160700006503186700005703251700005803308700006403366773011503430856008403545852000903629655001203638IND60773938320221119164750.0220420e20220405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077393832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.1c007742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcBride, Molly J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3832-135510aSubstrate-Triggered μ-Peroxodiiron(III) Intermediate in the 4-Chloro-l-Lysine-Fragmenting Heme-Oxygenase-like Diiron Oxidase (HDO) BesC: Substrate Dissociation from, and C4 Targeting by, the Intermediate  ap. 689-702.  aThe enzyme BesC from the β-ethynyl-l-serine biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces cattleya fragments 4-chloro-l-lysine (produced from l-Lysine by BesD) to ammonia, formaldehyde, and 4-chloro-l-allylglycine and can analogously fragment l-Lys itself. BesC belongs to the emerging family of O₂-activating non-heme-diiron enzymes with the “heme-oxygenase-like” protein fold (HDOs). Here, we show that the binding of l-Lys or an analogue triggers capture of O₂ by the protein’s diiron(II) cofactor to form a blue μ-peroxodiiron(III) intermediate analogous to those previously characterized in two other HDOs, the olefin-installing fatty acid decarboxylase, UndA, and the guanidino-N-oxygenase domain of SznF. The ∼5- and ∼30-fold faster decay of the intermediate in reactions with 4-thia-l-Lys and (4RS)-chloro-dl-lysine than in the reaction with l-Lys itself and the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (D-KIEs) on decay of the intermediate and production of l-allylglycine in the reaction with 4,4,5,5-[²H₄]-l-Lys suggest that the peroxide intermediate or a reversibly connected successor complex abstracts a hydrogen atom from C4 to enable olefin formation. Surprisingly, the sluggish substrate l-Lys can dissociate after triggering intermediate formation, thereby allowing one of the better substrates to bind and react. The structure of apo BesC and the demonstrated linkage between Fe(II) and substrate binding suggest that the triggering event involves an induced ordering of ligand-providing helix 3 (α3) of the conditionally stable HDO core. As previously suggested for SznF, the dynamic α3 also likely initiates the spontaneous degradation of the diiron(III) product cluster after decay of the peroxide intermediate, a trait emerging as characteristic of the nascent HDO family.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  aGM119707cU.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000057  aGM127079cU.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000057  aGM136156cU.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000057  aGM138580cU.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000057  aCHE-1610676cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000165  aCHE-1710588cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000165 3aStreptomyces cattleya 3aammonia 3abiochemical pathways 3adeuterium 3afatty acids 3aformaldehyde 3aisotopes 3alysine 3aolefin 3aoxidoreductases1 aNair, Mrutyunjay A.1 aSil, Debangsu1 aSlater, Jeffrey W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1126-89051 aNeugebauer, Monica E.1 aChang, Michelle C.

Four different diets, with crude protein (CP) contents of 24.3, 30.3, 32.9 and 36.7% were produced. In the laboratory, experimental culture in the biofloc system was performed in twelve experimental units at a density of 250shrimpm−3, the four treatments were performed in triplicate. The semi-intensive culture system was applied at the commercial farm in eleven ponds containing 15.5shrimpm−2. After 49days, the zootechnical performance of the shrimp was rated, and the cost per kilogram of shrimp was produced by both culture systems. In the semi-intensive system, the shrimp fed with a diet containing 32.9% CP showed a higher final weight and weight gain and a lower dietary cost. In the biofloc culture, a higher final weight, weight gain, growth rate and productivity were observed in shrimp fed diets containing 30.3, 32.9 and 36.7% CP compared with those fed a diet containing 24.3% CP. The lowest dietary cost of shrimp farming in the biofloc system was registered in the shrimp fed the 30.3% CP diet, whereas, in the semi-intensive system, the highest final weight, highest weight gain and lowest cost were observed in shrimp fed the 32.9% CP diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3abiofloc technology 3acommercial farms 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aponds 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3aweight gain 0aPacific white shrimp 0aNutrition 0aFarming systems 0aProduction cost 0aProtein1 ada Silva, Bruno Corrêa1 ada Silva, Jairo Souza1 aVieira, Felipe do Nascimento1 aMouriño, José Luiz Pedreira1 aSeiffert, Walter Quadros1 aToledo, Tárik Massucci0 tAquaculture.g2014 Aug. 20, v. 432 p.365-371dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011100161300001600272520147100288592002801759650002001787650002301807650002601830650002001856650002501876650001601901650001301917650001101930650000701941650001401948650001501962650001601977650001801993650001602011650001902027700001402046700002002060700001702080773011602097856008102213852000902294655001202303IND60585293620221119220908.0171108e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058529362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1235-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrans, M.10aEnvironmental effects on growth and sporulation of Fusarium spp. causing internal fruit rot in bell pepper  ap. 875-883.  aInternal fruit rot in bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is mainly caused by members of the Fusarium lactis species complex (FLASC) and to a lesser extent by Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium proliferatum. Despite the importance of the disease, there is hardly no information about growth, sporulation and germination dynamics of FLASC. In order to understand the dominance of FLASC as main pathogen of internal fruit rot, the effects of temperature (5 °C – 35 °C), water activity (aw 0.76–0.96), pH (pH 3 - pH 9) and oxygen concentration (2.5% - 20%) on growth and sporulation of all three Fusarium species were compared. In addition, germination kinetics were also investigated. FLASC showed optimal mycelium growth and sporulation in the narrow range of 25 °C, while both other strains were also tolerant for higher temperatures to 30 °C. FLASC was also characterized by a broad pH optimum from pH 3–7 while F. oxysporum (pH 4–7) and F. proliferatum (pH 5–8) were more demanding concerning pH. In addition, optimal sporulation occurred in the acid region for FLASC (pH 3) whilst neutral and alkaline pH were more favourable for the other species. Germination kinetics revealed that FLASC did not benefit from an earlier and/or faster germination process. A thorough understanding of the growth characteristics and dominance of FLASC as main pathogen for internal fruit rot is inevitable to develop sustainable control measures for the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium proliferatum 3acontrol methods 3aenvironmental impact 3agermination 3amycelium 3aoxygen 3apH 3apathogens 3aplant rots 3asporulation 3asweet peppers 3atemperature 3awater activity1 aAerts, R.1 aVan Laethem, S.1 aCeusters, J.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2017 Dec., v. 149, no. 4 p.875-883dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1235-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011600166520117600282592002801458650001501486650002501501650003001526650001101556650002601567650001301593650001401606650001501620650002801635653004701663653004601710653002801756653002801784653005601812700001401868700001701882773011301899856008602012852000902098655001202107IND60714036520221118093746.0220719e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071403652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1241832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xulong10aSustainable smart waste classification and collection system: A bi-objective modeling and optimization approach  aIn the context of the “smart city”, information and communication technologies (ICT) have become indispensable in the planning and design of modern municipal solid waste management. Due to more waste varieties, there are urgent calls to implement waste classification worldwide, which promotes resource recycling to achieve sustainable development. In this paper, we present an ICT-based smart waste classification and collection system (SWCCS) that is abstracted as a bi-objective mathematical programming model to optimize the waste collection problem. To implement the proposed SWCCS effectively, we design a novel multi-objective hybrid algorithm based on the whale optimization and genetic algorithms (MOGWOA) with an improved convergence factor and a fast, non-dominated sorting method. A comparison of our algorithm with two classical multi-objective algorithms on generated test instances and on a real-world case shows that the proposed MOGWOA is more effective for optimizing the established model. This paper demonstrates how the ICT-based SWCCS works and how it can help sanitation companies improve waste collection both economically and environmentally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abusiness enterprises 3acommunications technology 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3aplanning 3arecycling 3asanitation 3asustainable development 0aInformation and communication technologies 0aSmart waste classification and collection 0aSustainable development 0aVehicle routing problem 0aMulti-objective hybrid whale optimization algorithm1 aPu, Xujin1 aHan, Xiaohua0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 276 p.124183-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1241833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245005700202500002000259520108700279592002801366650002201394650000801416650001201424650002501436650002501461650002001486650002401506650002401530650002001554700006001574700006001634700006201694700005501756773011201811856007901923852000902002655001202011IND60775173620221121230236.0220422e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077517362DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2022000092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBremer, Erhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2225-700514aThe many faces of the unusual biofilm activator RemA  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiofilms can be viewed as tissue‐like structures in which microorganisms are organized in a spatial and functional sophisticated manner. Biofilm formation requires the orchestration of a highly integrated network of regulatory proteins to establish cell differentiation and production of a complex extracellular matrix. Here, we discuss the role of the essential Bacillus subtilis biofilm activator RemA. Despite intense research on biofilms, RemA is a largely underappreciated regulatory protein. RemA forms donut‐shaped octamers with the potential to assemble into dimeric superstructures. The presumed DNA‐binding mode suggests that RemA organizes its target DNA into nucleosome‐like structures, which are the basis for its role as transcriptional activator. We discuss how RemA affects gene expression in the context of biofilm formation, and its regulatory interplay with established components of the biofilm regulatory network, such as SinR, SinI, SlrR, and SlrA. We emphasize the additional role of RemA played in nitrogen metabolism and osmotic‐stress adjustment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDNA 3abiofilm 3acell differentiation 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression 3anitrogen metabolism 3aregulatory proteins 3atransactivators1 aHoffmann, Tamara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5218-85061 aDempwolff, Felix1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7788-84451 aBedrunka, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9984-55181 aBange, Gert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7826-09320 tBioEssays.g2022 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.e2200009-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2022000093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245006300167300001600230520091400246592002801160596008001188596008001268650003601348650001901384650001401403650001401417700001401431700006101445700002101506700006301527700001501590773011501605856008401720852000901804655001201813IND60773938420221119164928.0220420e20220405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077393842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.1c007752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Hui-Qiao10aPI4P-Dependent Targeting of ATG14 to Mature Autophagosomes  ap. 722-729.  aDegradation of autophagosomal cargo requires the tethering and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes that is mediated by the scaffolding protein autophagy related 14 (ATG14). Here, we report that phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 2A (PI4K2A) generates a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) that facilitates the recruitment of ATG14 to mature autophagosomes. We also show that PI4K2A binds to ATG14, suggesting that PI4P may be synthesized in situ in the vicinity of ATG14. Impaired targeting of ATG14 to autophagosomes in PI4K2A-depleted cells is rescued by the introduction of PI4P but not its downstream product phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P₂). Thus, PI4P and PI(4,5)P₂ have independent functions in late-stage autophagy. These results provide a mechanism to explain prior studies indicating that PI4K2A and its product PI4P are necessary for autophagosome–lysosome fusion.  aPublisher supplied data  aGM064589cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  aGM121536cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002 3a1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 3aautophagosomes 3aautophagy 3alysosomes1 aChen, Yan1 aHedde, Per Niklas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2994-369X1 aMueller, Joachim1 aAlbanesi, Joseph P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6864-81401 aYin, Helen0 tBiochemistry.g2022 Apr. 05, v. 61, no. 8 p.722-729dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.1c007753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245011900194300001600313500001500329520109200344592002801436650001401464650001401478650002801492650001701520650001401537650001101551650001401562650002101576650001201597650002301609650001501632650001201647650001001659650003101669650001101700650010401711650004501815650002501860651001001885651001001895653001501905700002101920700002801941700001901969700002601988700002002014773009702034856004802131852000902179655001202188IND50061880420221119004523.0130816e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006188042DNAL7 a230527622pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-012-3129-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbikounlé, Moudachirou10aSnail intermediate host/Schistosoma haematobium relationships from three transmission sites in Benin (West Africa)  ap. 227-233.  a2019-12-05  aThe relationships between three strains of Schistosoma haematobium (Doh, Sô-Tchanhoué and Toho-Todougba; from Benin, West Africa) and their snail hosts were assessed by measurement of several life-history traits, including the infection rate; pre-patent period; cercarial production of each parasite strain; and growth, fecundity and survival of the host snails. Adaptations to its local snail host was found for the Toho-Todougba strain and included a short pre-patent period, a long patent period and production of more cercariae in its local snail host. In contrast, the life-history traits of the Doh and Sô-Tchanhoué strains indicated non-local adaptations, as some sympatric host–parasite combinations were not compatible, the highest infection rates occurred in the allopatric snail Bulinus wrighti, and the duration of cercarial production was short because of the high level of mortality of the snails. Furthermore, snail reproduction ceased following infection by each of the three parasite strains, and the life-history traits were not influenced by the miracidial dose.  aPublisher supplied data 3acercariae 3aparasites 3aSchistosoma haematobium 3alife history 3afecundity 3asnails 3amortality 3aprepatent period 3aBulinus 3aintermediate hosts 2aAdolescent 2aAnimals 2aChild 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aHumans 2aSchistosoma haematobiumxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aSchistosomiasis haematobiaxparasitology 2aSnailsxparasitology 3aBenin 0aBenin 0aadaptation1 aMouahid, Gabriel1 aMintsa Nguema, Rodrigue1 aSakiti, Nestor1 aMassougbodji, Achille1 aMoné, Hélène0 tParasitology research.g2013 Jan., v. 112, no. 1 p.227-233dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-012-3129-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01369naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003500138245009700173300001800270520033300288592002800621650002700649650002300676650002300699650001400722650002000736650001200756650002200768700002100790700002100811773012900832856007300961852000901034655001201043IND60658524720221118031826.0190817e20091124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065852472DNAL7 a10.1039/b916250j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Llansola, Francisco12aA supramolecular hydrogel as a reusable heterogeneous catalyst for the direct aldol reaction  ap. 7303-7305.  aAn l-proline based supramolecular hydrogel is used as an efficient heterogeneous organocatalyst for the direct aldol reaction with high stereoselectivity (up to 90% ee) and recyclability (up to 3 runs).

In this study, rice straw was recycled as a cheap and renewable fibre for enhancing the performance of cement-based composites. To improve the properties of fibre, two modification approaches were designed, namely, room-temperature (20 °C) alkaline (sodium hydroxide) treatment, and high-temperature (90 °C) alkaline treatment. The physicochemical characteristics of raw and modified straw fibres were analysed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and fibre uniaxial stretching. The results showed that alkali-solution treatment increased cellulose proportion, slenderness ratio, tensile strength of fibre, and reduced its water absorption. Between two modification schemes, high-temperature treatment was more effective than the room-temperature treatment. The fibre modification eliminated the inhibitory effect of straw fibre on cement hydration verified by isothermal calorimeter analysis. Mechanical strength results illustrated that the addition of raw straw fibre had a marginal or even adverse effect on the mechanical properties of composites, due to its inherent porous structure and suppression effect on cement hydration. By contrast, the incorporation of modified fibres enhanced flexural strength and compressive strength of composites by 12.5%–22.3% and 4.7%–14.6%, respectively, especially for the addition of high-temperature treated fibre. Therefore, rice straw fibre after high-temperature alkaline treatment can be recycled for reinforcing cementitious composites, particularly suitable for on-site construction use in rural areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aagricultural wastes 3aalkali treatment 3aambient temperature 3acalorimeters 3acellulose 3acement 3acompression strength 3aheat treatment 3amodulus of rupture 3arice straw 3arural areas 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3atensile strength 3awater uptake 0aRice straw fibre 0aFibre-reinforced composites 0aAlkaline-solution treatment 0aAgricultural waste recycling 0aCleaner production technology 0aConstruction materials1 aYang, Jingwei1 aSong, Qun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2744-21701 aWang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0336-72410 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 276 p.124184-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1241843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245006700163300001600230520151600246592002801762653001701790653003701807653002701844653002001871653002301891700001801914700002001932700001701952700001401969700001801983700002802001700002502029700002202054700002602076700002002102700001702122700001902139773012802158856007802286852000902364655001202373IND60516957920221117215922.0160327e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051695792DNAL7 a10.1139/cjpp-2012-02572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarang, Deepak10aTriton X-100 inhibits L-type voltage-operated calcium channels  ap. 316-324.  aTriton X-100 (TX-100) is a nonionic detergent frequently used at millimolar concentrations to disrupt cell membranes and solubilize proteins. At low micromolar concentrations, TX-100 has been reported to inhibit the function of potassium channels. Here, we have used electrophysiological and functional techniques to examine the effects of TX-100 on another class of ion channels, L-type voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs). TX-100 (30 nmol·L–¹ to 3 μmol·L–¹) caused reversible concentration-dependent inhibition of recombinant L-type VOCC (CaV 1.2) currents and of native L-type VOCC currents recorded from rat vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes, and murine and human pancreatic β-cells. In functional studies, TX-100 (165 nmol·L–¹ to 3.4 μmol·L–¹) caused concentration-dependent relaxation of rat isolated mesenteric resistance arteries prestimulated with phenylephrine or KCl. This effect was independent of the endothelium. TX-100 (1.6 μmol·L–¹) inhibited depolarization-induced exocytosis in both murine and human isolated pancreatic β-cells. These data indicate that at concentrations within the nanomolar to low micromolar range, TX-100 significantly inhibits L-type VOCC activity in a number of cell types, an effect paralleled by inhibition of cell functions dependent upon activation of these channels. This inhibition occurs at concentrations below those used to solubilize proteins and may compromise the use of solutions containing TX-100 in bioassays.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTriton X-100 0avoltage-operated calcium channel 0avascular smooth muscle 0acardiac myocyte 0apancreatic β-cell1 aKerr, Paul M.1 aBaserman, Jason1 aTam, Raymond1 aYang, Wei1 aSearle, Gavin1 aManning-Fox, Jocelyn E.1 aPaulsen, Isabelle M.1 aKozuska, Janna L.1 aMacDonald, Patrick E.1 aLight, Peter E.1 aHolt, Andrew1 aPlane, Frances0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 91, no. 4 p.316-324dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2012-02573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011500169300001400284520103500298592002801333650002401361650002101385650001301406650002201419650001201441650001501453650002201468650001001490650001201500650001801512653001601530653001701546653001301563653002101576653002401597653002701621700002301648700001901671700002301690773013801713856008301851852000901934655001201943IND60584245020221120122937.0190412e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058424502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2017.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJumeau, Jonathan10aRoad-related landscape elements as a habitat: A main asset for small mammals in an intensive farming landscape  ap. 15-27.  aRoad construction creates new habitats for a variety of species. In intensive farming landscapes, road verges may be the only suitable habitat for rodents. However, little attention has been paid to other road-related landscape elements (RRLEs), such as excavation slopes or the central islands of roundabouts, and their importance in a rodent territory. This study investigated all types of RRLE in terms of rodent abundances and habitat quality. RRLEs were compared with the semi-natural elements of the studied landscape using a capture-mark-recapture protocol. Four species and 3154 individuals were captured over a period of four months. Relative abundance and habitat quality were higher in RRLEs than in semi-natural elements. Mapping of the landscape showed that 86% of crop fields are accessible to Microtus arvalis (and almost 100% for Apodemus sylvaticus) from road verges. Our results highlight the importance of road verges and all other RRLEs in the conservation of species diversity in intensive farming landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApodemus sylvaticus 3aMicrotus arvalis 3ahabitats 3aintensive farming 3aislands 3alandscapes 3aroad construction 3aroads 3arodents 3asmall mammals 0aRoad verges 0aRoad ecology 0aMotorway 0aMicrotus arvalis 0aApodemus sylvaticus 0aCapture-mark-recapture1 aBoucharel, Pauline1 aHandrich, Yves1 aBurel, Françoise,0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2017 Dec., v. 25 p.15-27dElsevier GmbHaGesellschaft für ÖkologiewJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2017.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100003500142245009700177300001600274520128300290592002801573650001501601650003801616650002201654650001801676650001101694650004401705650001001749650001401759650002401773650003101797650001701828650001601845650001201861700002401873700002101897773013101918856004502049852000902094655001202103IND4468682420221119004313.0120727e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446868242DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2005011702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraipsonâDanthine, Sabine10aPhysicochemical characteristics of ternary fat blends involving lowâerucic rapeseed oil  ap. 627-633.  aSome fat systems made of lowâerucic (LERO) and hydrogenated lowâerucic rapeseed oil (HLERO) blended with a third component are studied for their physical properties, especially for solid fat content by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (pNMR) and melting profile by differential scanning calorimetry; a comparison is made with a commercial bakery shortening. The third component is made of hydrogenated palm oil (HPO), palm oil (PO), palm stearin (Pst), palm olein (Pol) or anhydrous milk fat (AMF). The goal is to increase the chain length diversity of the systems. Polymorphic stability is evaluated by powder Xâray diffraction. HPO is the best betaâprimeâstabilizing agent, followed by PO and its fractions, then by AMF. However, only a small part of the ternary diagram made with HPO, the best betaâprimeâstabilizing agent, displays a melting profile similar to the commercial bakery shortening. In contrast, the diagrams made of PO and of its fractions show greater composition zones suitable for use as bakery shortenings. In this series, Pol seems to be the best candidate.

L.10aDiving Behavior and Energetics During Foraging Cycles in King Penguins  ap. 143-163.  aKing Penguins are the second largest of all diving birds and share with their congener, Emperor Penguins, breeding habits strikingly different from other penguins. Our purpose was to determine the feeding behavior, energetics of foraging and the prey species, and compare these to other sympatric species of subantarctic divers. We determined: (1) general features of foraging behavior using time—depth recorders, velocity meters, and radio transmitters, (2) energetics by doubly labeled water, (3) food habits and energy content from stomach lavage samples, and (4) resting and swimming metabolic rate by oxygen consumption measurements. The average foraging cycle was ≈6 d, during which the mass gain of 30 birds was ≈2 kg. When at sea, the birds exhibit a marked pattern of shallow dives during the night, whereas deep dives of >100 m only occurred during the day. Maximum depth measured from 34 birds and 18 537 dives was 304 m, and maximum dive duration from 23 birds and 11 874 dives was 7.7 min. The frequency distribution of dive depth was bimodal, with few dives between 40 and 100 m. Overall, swim velocities when a bird was at sea averaged 2.1 m/s (N = 5), while descent and ascent rates of change in depth averaged 0.6 m/s for dives <60 m (N = 74) and 1.4 m/s for dives >150 m (N = 90). Night feeding dives occurred at a rate of ≈20 dives/h, and deep dives occurred at a rate of ≈5 dives/h. The energy consumption rate while resting ashore was 3.3 W/kg (N = 3) or 1.6 times the predicted standard metabolic rate (SMR). The average energy consumption rate while away from the colony was 10 W/kg (N = 8) or 4.6 x SMR, compared to 4.3 x SMR estimated from a time—energy budget. The latter value is based on an average metabolic rate of 4.2 W/kg for three birds while resting in 5°C water and 9.6 W/kg while swimming at 2 m/s, which was extrapolated from the average of three birds swimming at 1 m/s. The average energy intake based on 9 stomach content samples was nearly 24.6 kJ/g dry mass. The main prey by number are myctophid fish of the species Krefftichthys anderssoni and Electrona carlsbergi. It was concluded that: (1) feeding begins ≈28 km from the colony, (2) prey is pursued night and day through its vertical movements, (3) vertical distribution of the prey is reflected closely by diving habits of the birds, (4) deep—diving, for unknown reasons, is an important component of foraging success, (5) diving capacities of King Penguins are remarkable compared to other birds and many pinnipeds, and (6) calculated foraging energetics can be closely estimated from time—energy budgets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAptenodytes forsteri 3aAptenodytes patagonicus 3aElectrona 3aPinnipedia 3abreeding 3aeating habits 3aenergy content 3aenergy intake 3afish 3aforaging 3afrequency distribution 3ametabolism 3aoxygen consumption 3apenguins 3aprey species 3aradio transmitters 3aspatial distribution 3astomach 3aswimming 3asympatry1 aCherel, Y.1 aMaho, Y.

Given that the signaling mechanisms triggered by calcium paradox remain elusive, in the present study, we tried to investigate them in the isolated perfused heart from Rana ridibunda. Calcium paradox was found to markedly activate members of the MAPKs (p43-ERK, JNKs, p38-MAPK). In addition to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the perfusate (indicative of necrosis), we also confirmed the occurrence of apoptosis by using the TUNEL assay and identifying poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragmentation and upregulated Bax expression. Furthermore, using MDL28170 (a selective calpain inhibitor), a role for this protease was revealed. In addition, various divalent cations were shown to exert a protective effect against the calcium paradox. Interestingly, SB203580, a p38-MAPK inhibitor, alleviated calcium-paradox-conferred apoptosis. This result indicates that p38-MAPK plays a pro-apoptotic role, contributing to the resulting myocardial dysfunction and cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the calcium paradox has been shown to induce apoptosis in amphibians, with p38-MAPK and calpain playing significant roles.  aPublisher supplied data 0aamphibian heart 0acalcium paradox 0aapoptosis 0asignaling pathways 0ap38-MAPK 0acalpain 0aPARP 0aMDL281701 aZacharias, Triantafyllos1 aPapapavlou, Georgia1 aGaitanaki, Catherine1 aBeis, Isidoros0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2013 Aug. 19, v. 91, no. 12 p.1095-1106dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2013-00813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245011000174500001900284520141600303592002801719650002101747650002801768650002201796650001501818650002501833650001401858650001201872650001701884650001101901650002201912650003201934650001501966650002101981650001802002650001402020650001702034650001502051653002402066653001902090653005902109653002202168653002402190700001902214700001502233700001602248700001202264700001402276700001602290773009302306856009102399852000902490655001202499IND60698534620221120133444.0200819e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069853462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1201902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Fengyun10aOxaliplatin-/NLG919 prodrugs-constructed liposomes for effective chemo-immunotherapy of colorectal cancer  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a major cause of tumor induced immunosuppression, and appears to be associated with poor prognosis in human colorectal cancer and some others. In this study, we construct a bifunctional liposome by self-assembly of oxaliplatin-prodrug (Oxa(IV)) conjugated phospholipid and alkylated NLG919 (aNLG), an IDO1 inhibitor, together with other commercial lipids. The obtained aNLG/Oxa(IV)-Lip can not only release cytotoxic oxaliplatin inside the reductive cytosol to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) of cancer cells, but also efficiently retard the degradation of tryptophan to immunosuppressive kynurenine via the NLG919 mediated inhibition of IDO1. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies indicate that such aNLG/Oxa(IV)-Lip has a long blood circulation time, thereby enables highly-efficient passive tumor homing. Upon tumor accumulation, such aNLG/Oxa(IV)-Lip presents superior synergistic antitumor efficacies to both subcutaneous and orthotopic CT26 tumors, ascribing to significantly primed anti-tumor immunity of enhanced intratumoral infiltration of CD8⁺ T cells, scretion of cytotoxic cytokines and downregulation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. This work highlights that such bifunctional aNLG/Oxa(IV)-Lip is a potent candidate for future clinical translation owing to its excellent biocompatibility and high therapeutic efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3ablood circulation 3acell death 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytokines 3acytosol 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3aimmunosuppression 3aindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 3akynurenine 3apharmacokinetics 3aphospholipids 3aprognosis 3atherapeutics 3atryptophan 0aOxaliplatin prodrug 0aIDO inhibition 0aModulation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment 0aColorectal cancer 0aChemo-immunotherapy1 aFeng, Liangzhu1 aZhu, Yujie1 aTao, Danlei1 aXu, Jun1 aPeng, Rui1 aLiu, Zhuang0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Oct., v. 255 p.120190-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1201903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009500171300001400266520165400280592002801934650002401962650002501986650001602011650001002027650001202037650001402049650001202063650001402075650001902089650002502108650001402133650002202147650003802169650003802207653001402245653001002259653001702269653000902286653002202295700002502317700002002342700002802362773012302390856008202513852000902595655001202604IND60553901520221120161832.0161023e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055390152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2014.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Mello, Fernanda10aIdentification of TGF-β, inhibin βA and follistatin paralogs in the rainbow trout genome  ap. 46-55.  aSince their initial discovery, TGF-β superfamily members have been considered multifunctional growth and differentiation factors in many cell types. Various studies have clearly demonstrated the key roles of specific TGF-β members in muscle growth, including myostatin and inhibin as well as genes, such as follistatin. By binding to TGF-β members, follistatin prevents TGF-β from binding to its receptors and thus neutralizes its activity. Here, we report the identification of the gene sequences of four TGF-β isoforms and three paralogs of TGF-β1, which we called TGF-β1a, TGF-β1b and TGF-β1c, four sequences of inhibin βA paralogs; and two sequences of follistatin paralogs from rainbow trout. A phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated the existence of four monophyletic clades, corresponding to TGF-β1, -β2, -β3 and -β6. Based on their sequence identity TGF-β1a and -β1c are grouped together, whereas TGF-β1b appears more divergent even though it is grouped within the TGF-β1 clade. Alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that the protein sequences of TGF-β, inhibin βA and follistatin are extremely well conserved (>90%) relative to each other; however, their regulation and expression patterns are different. TGF-β2 and -β3 showed the most abundant expression in muscle and were the main TGF-β members expressed in this tissue. Follistatin and inhibin βA paralogs were expressed in all tissues examined but with different patterns. Our identification of multiple copies of TGF-β, inhibin βA and follistatin with different expression patterns suggests non-redundant functions for these paralogs in rainbow trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aamino acid sequences 3afollistatin 3agenes 3ainhibin 3amonophyly 3amuscles 3amyostatin 3aneutralization 3anucleotide sequences 3areceptors 3asequence analysis 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atransforming growth factor beta 2 0aMyostatin 0aGDF11 0aPhylogenetic 0aFish 0aTissue expression1 aStreit, Danilo Pedro1 aSabin, Nathalie1 aGabillard, Jean-Charles0 tComparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part B.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 177-178 p.46-55dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2014.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245011500178300001600293520189800309592002802207650002202235650002702257650001302284650002002297650002702317650001602344650001602360650002502376650000902401650002702410650001602437650001302453650001302466650001502479650001802494650001402512650002002526650001802546650001802564650001502582650002302597650002702620653001502647653001702662653001702679653001602696653001602712700001602728700002002744700001202764773009902776856009002875852000902965655001202974IND60532329720221119032633.0190318e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053232972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelladsen, Heather10aShelf-life assessment of microalgae concentrates: Effect of cold preservation on microalgal nutrition profiles  ap. 241-247.  aLive microalgal cultures have long been regarded as a bottleneck in the aquaculture industry due to their high cost and labour requirements to maintain, however, feasible alternatives to in-house cultures are limited. Microalgal concentrates, which can be shipped from a central production facility to aquaculture operations, are rising in demand due to this market niche, but they are few in number. To qualify as a viable alternative to fresh cultures, microalgal concentrates kept in basic storage conditions such as refrigeration and freezing should have a shelf life of at least 2months, demonstrated by a stable biochemical profile over that time period. Consequently, this study tested the effect of storage condition (refrigerator and freezer) on the fatty acid and amino acid profiles of four concentrated species of microalgae: Nannochloropsis sp., Dunaliella tertiolecta, Entomoneis punctulata and Melosira dubia. The most stable products were Nannochloropsis sp. and D. tertiolecta, with no significant change in the fatty acid profile or protein content after 2month storage in the refrigerator. The two diatoms however, were not as robust; M. dubia showed a steady decline in fatty acid content over the course of 30days, before a marked decrease at 60days. Although the fatty acid content of E. punctulata was stable for the first 30days of storage, a significant decline, particularly in omega-3 content, was seen from 30–60day storage in both the refrigerator and freezer. The total protein content, however, was stable in both species of diatoms throughout the course of the experiment. These findings suggest that Nannochloropsis sp. and D. tertiolecta concentrates could be used in aquaculture industries as a replacement or supplement to fresh cultures, whilst E. punctulata may be more suited to short-term storage, and M. dubia would perform better as a fresh culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aDunaliella tertiolecta 3aMelosira 3aNannochloropsis 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture industry 3acold 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3afreezers 3afreezing 3amicroalgae 3aniche markets 3anutrition 3aprotein content 3arefrigeration 3arefrigerators 3ashelf life 3astorage conditions 3awages and remuneration 0aMicroalgae 0aConcentrates 0aCold storage 0aFatty acids 0aAmino acids1 aKent, Megan1 aMangott, Arnold1 aLi, Yan0 tAquaculture.g2014 June 20, v. 430 p.241-247dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245006700192300001800259520134100277592002801618650002401646650002101670650001201691650002701703650001001730650001801740650000701758650001701765650001501782650001701797650003401814650003801848650003001886650002201916650001201938650003501950700003301985700003602018700002402054773011602078856004802194852000902242655001202251IND50064183120221119004558.0130505e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006418312DNAL7 a234562792pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0153-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulo, Paula Loureiro10aAnaerobic Digestion of Cassava Wastewater Pre-treated by Fungi  ap. 2457-2466.  aCassava wastewater (cww) contains high concentrations of easily acidifying compounds, requiring a buffered system to allow a stable operation during anaerobic digestion (AD). The possibility to include a preliminary one-step fungi treatment aimed at raising the pH and buffering the cww prior to AD was studied. Preliminary tests were performed with a naturally grown fungal mixed culture, under aerated (AE), non-aerated (NAE) and initially oxygen-deprived (IOD) conditions. The cww was pre-treated by the NAE condition, until reaching a soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 10 g L⁻¹ and pH 6.4 (batch A) and pH 5.7 (batch B). The fungal mixed culture showed ability to biodegrade the cww with initial pH of 4.4 and 14,500 mg COD L⁻¹, raising the pH over 8.5, with only 13 % of COD remaining within 27 days for both AE and NAE condition. The fungal pre-treated-cww (FPTcww) was subjected to anaerobic digestion under different buffered (CaCO₃ and NaHCO₃) and non-buffered conditions. The FPTcww with initial pH at 6.4 provided stability during the anaerobic biodegradability tests, showing the possibility of system operation without buffer addition, with final pH around 7. The application of a fungal pre-treatment can be a promising strategy to permit the anaerobic digestion of carbohydrate-rich wastewaters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3acassava 3achemical oxygen demand 3afungi 3amixed culture 3apH 3apretreatment 3awastewater 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiological Oxygen Demand Analysis 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aFungixmetabolism 2aManihot 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods1 aColman-Novaes, Thais Adriana1 aObregão, Laynara Dayene Soares1 aBoncz, Marc Árpád0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2013 Apr., v. 169, no. 8 p.2457-2466dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0153-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002600169245014900195300001400344520123500358592002801593650002201621650002801643650001401671650001901685650000901704650002701713650001201740650001101752650001201763650004001775650003101815650002601846650004001872651001301912700001601925700001901941700001801960700002001978700001701998773010502015856008402120852000902204655001202213IND60099450720221122233755.0141105e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009945072DNAL7 a210752192pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2010.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjuikwo-Teukeng, F.F.10aStrong genetic structure in Cameroonian populations of Bulinus truncatus (Gastropoda: Planorbidae), intermediate host of Schistosoma haematobium  ap. 17-22.  aIn order to evaluate the snail host contribution on the variability of mollusk/schistosome compatibility, the genetic structure of seven Cameroonian populations of the schistosome vector, Bulinus truncatus, was studied using four variable microsatellite loci. A substantial polymorphism mainly distributed among populations was observed. No heterozygous genotype was scored, confirming the high level of selfing rate occurring in B. truncatus populations. Contemporaneous samples were highly and significantly differentiated with a marginally significant correlation with geographical distances (P-value=0.069). The different sites sampled seemed to rarely exchange migrants with very small Nm (∼0.22 or below). The data also suggest that B. truncatus subpopulations might be composed of very small and isolated units at much smaller surfaces than what was investigated. Even if more data (in particular more loci) will be needed to confirm these issues, they suggest that restricted gene flow plays an important role in maintaining differentiation among snail populations in the transmission foci, potentially leading to specific adaptation between each B. truncatus population and its local Schistosoma haematobium population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBulinus truncatus 3aSchistosoma haematobium 3agene flow 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aselfing 3asnails 2aAnimals 2aGastropodaxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSchistosoma haematobiumxphysiology 0aCameroon1 aNjiokou, F.1 aNkengazong, L.1 aDe Meeûs, T.1 aSame-Ekobo, A.,1 aDreyfuss, G.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2011 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.17-22dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2010.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01258naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016300169300001800332500001900350520031700369592002800686650001400714650001900728650001600747651000900763773011800772856008100890852000900971655001200980IND60686353920221119215309.0200317e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068635392DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738190900572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnisyutkin, L.

It’s significant to explore the metabolic fate of multiple components in vivo which are responsible for the pharmacological effects but not fully investigated. A rapid and high-throughput method using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS) was established for systematic investigation on GFC, including GFC chemical compositions, and their absorption and metabolism in rat plasma, urine, uterus and brain after oral administration of GFC. A total of 102 nonvolatile GFC phytochemistry components were identified based on the accurately measured mass value, fragmentation pattern and retention behavior. Compared to the previous GFC study, additional 47 different GFC components were detected. Furthermore 21, 9, 4 and 3 prototype compounds were separately observed in plasma, urine, uterus and brain samples with the support of in vitro GFC study. While 29, 33, 10 and 8 metabolites were also identified with the assistance of the MetaboLynx tool in these biological samples. The result indicated that the developed method was suitable for the components identification even in the complex matrix. The chemical and metabolic profiling of GFC provided an abundant substance foundation for the extensive GFC research, especially for the pharmacodynamic mechanisms research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3abrain 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aoral administration 3apharmacodynamics 3aplant biochemistry 3arats 3ascreening 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 3auterus 0aGFC 0aTCMs 0aUPLC/Q 0aPrD 0aEICs 0aECs 0aBPI 0aGuizhi Fuling capsule 0aQ-TOF systems 0aMetaboLynx 0aPhytochemistry components 0aMetabolic profiling 0aMaterial base1 aCheng, Yezhe1 aLiu, Zhongbo1 aDing, Liqin1 aQiu, Tianyi1 aChai, Liwei1 aQiu, Feng1 aWang, Zhenzhong1 aXiao, Wei1 aZhao, Longshan1 aChen, Xiaohui0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 1061-1062 p.474-486dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007300169300001800242520124500260592002801505650001401533650001201547650001701559650001701576650001601593650002101609650001201630650001001642650001501652650000901667650002201676650001201698650001101710650001301721650001101734650001401745650001901759651001101778700002201789700001801811700002701829773008801856856008301944852000902027655001202036IND60096800720221120110717.0141104e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009680072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrømborg, Erik10aProjecting demand and supply of forest biomass for heating in Norway  ap. 7049-7058.  aThis paper assesses the increase in demand and supply for forest biomass for heating in Norway in 2020. By then there is a political aim to double the national production of bioenergy from the level in 2008. The competitiveness of woody biomass in central and district heating is analyzed in a model selecting the least-cost heating technology and scale in municipalities given a set of constraints and under different fuels price scenarios. The supply of forest biomass from roundwood is estimated based on data of forest inventories combined with elasticities regarding price and standing volumes. The supply of biomass from harvesting residues is estimated in an engineering approach based on data from the national forest inventories and roundwood harvest. The results show how the production of bioenergy is affected by changes in energy prices and support schemes for bioenergy. One conclusion from the analyses is that the government target of 14TWh more bioenergy by 2020 is not likely to be met by current technologies and policy incentives. The contribution of the analysis is the detailed presentation of the heat market potentials and technology choices combined with supply functions for both roundwood and harvesting residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3aelasticities 3aenergy costs 3aengineering 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3afuels 3aharvesting 3aheat 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3apolitics 3aprices 3aroundwood 3asupply balance 3aNorway1 aHavskjold, Monica1 aLislebø, Ole1 aRørstad, Per Kristian0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.7049-7058dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245016300165300001600328520131000344592002801654650001301682650001701695650002301712650002201735650001201757650001201769650001301781650000901794651001801803651002301821653002001844653002201864653002001886773009401906856008302000852000902083655001202092IND60610635420221119224445.0180829e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061063542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yingqi10aDemand response and energy efficiency in the capacity resource procurement: Case studies of forward capacity markets in ISO New England, PJM and Great Britain  ap. 271-282.  aDemand-side resources like demand response (DR) and energy efficiency (EE) can contribute to the capacity adequacy underpinning power system reliability. Forward capacity markets are established in many liberalised markets to procure capacity, with a strong interest in procuring DR and EE. With case studies of ISO New England, PJM and Great Britain, this paper examines the process and trends of procuring DR and EE in forward capacity markets, and the design for integration mechanisms. It finds that the contribution of DR and EE varies wildly across these three capacity markets, due to a set of factors regarding mechanism design, market conditions and regulatory provisions, and the offering of EE is more heavily influenced by regulatory utility EE obligation. DR and EE are complementary in targeting end-uses and customers for capacity resources, thus highlighting the value of procuring them both. System needs and resources’ market potential need to be considered in defining capacity products. Over the long-term, it is important to ensure the removal of barriers for these demand-side resources and the capability of providers in addressing risks of unstable funding and forward planning. For the EDR Pilot in the UK, better coordination with forward capacity auction needs to be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauctions 3acase studies 3aconsumers (people) 3aenergy efficiency 3afunding 3amarkets 3aplanning 3arisk 3aGreat Britain 3aNew England region 0aDemand response 0aEnergy efficiency 0aCapacity market0 tEnergy policy.g2017 Jan., v. 100 p.271-282dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012700160300001800287520178600305592002802091650001002119650001502129650001502144650001202159650001502171650002002186653002602206653002702232653001802259653002402277653001402301700001802315700001402333700001802347700001502365700001302380773015402393856007902547852000902626655001202635IND60637873920221119043841.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063787392DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-158422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovács, L.10aShort communication: Heart rate variability, step, and rumination behavior of dairy cows milked in a rotary milking system  ap. 5525-5529.  aStep behavior, heart rate (HR), the high-frequency (HF) component of heart rate variability (HRV), the ratio of the low-frequency (LF) and HF components (LF/HF ratio) as well as rumination behavior during milking were investigated in dairy cows milked in a high-capacity rotary milking system (n = 49) to study animals' stress responses to the milking process. Cardiac parameters were analyzed for undisturbed standing (baseline) and for the stages of the morning, afternoon, and evening milking processes (i.e., driving animals from the barn to the pre-milking holding pen, pre-milking holding pen, preparation, milking, and waiting after milking in the milking stall). During driving, HR was greater than during all other stages. After driving, a gradual decrease in HR was observed. The HF decreased during driving, indicating a decrease in vagal tone compared with baseline. When animals were in the holding pen, vagal tone decreased, whereas sympathetic tone increased with lower values than recorded for baseline and driving. During preparation, HF values were still lower than those recorded for baseline. The recovery of the autonomic activity was observed following preparation as indicated by increased HF and decreased LF/HF ratio during milking and waiting stages. During milking, 53.1% of the animals ruminated. The frequency of steps was greater during preparation (3.7 ± 1.8 steps/min) than during milking (0.7 ± 0.4 steps/min) and waiting after milking (1.6 ± 1.0 steps/min). Our results suggest that being in the holding pen is stressful for cows; however, vagal predominance from the onset of milking, the low frequency of steps, and the high prevalence of rumination during milking suggest a possible welfare benefit of the investigated rotary milking system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarns 3adairy cows 3aheart rate 3amilking 3arumination 3astress response 0arotary milking parlor 0aheart rate variability 0astep behavior 0arumination behavior 0adairy cow1 aKézér, F.L.1 aPóti, P.1 aJurkovich, V.1 aSzenci, O.1 aNagy, K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 June, v. 102, no. 6 p.5525-5529dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-158423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245010100213300001300314506007600327520134000403592002801743506003701771650002301808650001901831650002001850650001401870650001601884650001801900650001101918650001201929653001001941653000801951653000801959653000801967653000801975653000801983653000901991653000802000653000802008653000802016653000802024653000902032653000802041653000802049653000902057653002302066653001102089653000902100653000902109653000902118653002402127700002002151700001802171700001602189700002202205700002002227700002002247700002302267773009802290856008302388852000902471655001202480IND60556989420221207072205.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055698942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2016.08.0132doi7 aPMC68160192pmcid7 a275467182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilvestri, Erin E.10aOptimization of a sample processing protocol for recovery of Bacillus anthracis spores from soil  ap. 6-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFollowing a release of Bacillus anthracis spores into the environment, there is a potential for lasting environmental contamination in soils. There is a need for detection protocols for B. anthracis in environmental matrices. However, identification of B. anthracis within a soil is a difficult task. Processing soil samples helps to remove debris, chemical components, and biological impurities that can interfere with microbiological detection. This study aimed to optimize a previously used indirect processing protocol, which included a series of washing and centrifugation steps. Optimization of the protocol included: identifying an ideal extraction diluent, variation in the number of wash steps, variation in the initial centrifugation speed, sonication and shaking mechanisms. The optimized protocol was demonstrated at two laboratories in order to evaluate the recovery of spores from loamy and sandy soils. The new protocol demonstrated an improved limit of detection for loamy and sandy soils over the non-optimized protocol with an approximate matrix limit of detection at 14spores/g of soil. There were no significant differences overall between the two laboratories for either soil type, suggesting that the processing protocol will be robust enough to use at multiple laboratories while achieving comparable recoveries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus anthracis 3acentrifugation 3adetection limit 3apollution 3asandy soils 3asoil sampling 3aspores 3awashing 0aANOVA 0aBaS 0aCDC 0aCFU 0aEPA 0aPBS 0aqPCR 0aR2A 0aR2B 0aSDS 0aSES 0aSHMP 0aTSA 0aTSB 0aUSGS 0aBacillus anthracis 0aSpores 0aSand 0aLoam 0aSoil 0aIndirect processing1 aFeldhake, David1 aGriffin, Dale1 aLisle, John1 aNichols, Tonya L.1 aShah, Sanjiv R.1 aPemberton, Adin1 aSchaefer, Frank W.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2016 Nov., v. 130 p.6-13dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2016.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245010100185300001600286520099100302592002801293650003201321650001301353650001101366650001001377650002701387650001501414650001301429650001801442650001401460650002201474650002401496650001201520650001801532650004301550650001601593650003801609650007101647650002501718650002701743650001301770650001401783650002701797650005201824651001001876651002501886700001701911700001701928700001901945700001301964700001701977700001901994700001502013700001602028700001702044700001902061700001902080773010702099856008402206852000902290655001202299IND60099451020221122223542.0141105e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009945102DNAL7 a208332702pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2010.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Zongxi12aA 15-year analysis of molecular epidemiology of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus in China  ap. 190-200.  aA comprehensive study of the epidemiology and pathogenicity of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in China was carried out by molecular characterization of the S1 gene from 46 isolates obtained for this study and 174 reference strains isolated over a 15-year period. Nine types were found according to sequence analysis and phylogenetic study of the S1 gene. The co-circulation of multiple IBV types and the ongoing emergence of IBV variants are the epidemiological challenges in China. Factors contributing to the continual emergence include mutations, insertions and deletions in the S1 protein genes; recombination between local IBV strains circulating in chicken flocks in China; and recombination between local strains and vaccine strains. Vaccination-challenge analysis between circulating field strains and Mass-type H120 vaccine indicated the need to develop new vaccines from local IBV strains. These results also emphasize the importance of continued IBV surveillance in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3achickens 3aflocks 3agenes 3amolecular epidemiology 3amonitoring 3amutation 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3avaccine development 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBird Diseasesxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aDNA Primers 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aInfectious bronchitis virusxgeneticsximmunologyxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aMutation 2aPhylogeny 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aSun, Chuyang1 aYan, Baolong1 aZhang, Xiaonan1 aWang, Yu1 aLi, Chengren1 aZhang, Qingxia1 aMa, Yazhen1 aShao, Yuhao1 aLiu, Qiaoran1 aKong, Xiangang1 aLiu, Shengwang0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2011 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.190-200dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2010.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245014800178300001800326520137700344592002801721650001901749650002001768650002401788650001601812650001101828650002201839650001201861650001501873651001201888651001001900700001901910773008801929856008302017852000902100655001202109IND60096800920221120110643.0141104e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009680092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Hauteclocque, Adrien,10aReconsidering the European regulation of merchant transmission investment in light of the third energy package: The role of dominant generators  ap. 7068-7077.  aThe regulation of merchant transmission investment (MTI) has become an important issue in the EU electricity sector, subsequent to the granting of authorizations by European authorities to five merchant projects: BritNed, Estlink, the East West Cables, NorGer and recently a merchant line connecting Italy and Austria. The creation of a new Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) at the EU level, which has decision-making powers on MTI, therefore presents a unique opportunity to question and re-design the current European policy. This paper shows that the recent decisions concerning MTI may suffer a strong bias against dominant electricity generators while incumbent Transmission System Operators (TSOs) or new entrant TSOs are generally favored by national regulators and the European Commission (EC). This strategy is misguided as it fails to recognize both the new incentives of generators to develop MTI and the conflict of interest between the regulated and non-regulated activities of incumbent TSOs. Letting dominant generators undertake MTI is indeed generally beneficial as long as potential abuses of dominance are mitigated. To deter possible anti-competitive effects, we propose a new and feasible allocation of regulatory powers based on a clear demarcation between the market monitoring powers of ACER and the antitrust powers of the EC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3adecision making 3aelectric generators 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3aAustria 3aItaly1 aRious, Vincent0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.7068-7077dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013500167300001400302520117300316592002801489650001701517650001601534650001901550650001101569650001901580650001701599650002601616650001201642650001401654653001701668653002201685653001701707653003501724653002101759653002201780700001401802700001801816700001701834700001801851700001801869700001701887700001901904773008201923856008602005852000902091655001202100IND60559718720221122133629.0170607e20170202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055971872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2016.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ying10aSubstitution of the precursor peptide prevents anti-prM antibody-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection  ap. 57-64.  aAntibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is currently considered as the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease. Many studies have shown that precursor (pr) peptide-specific antibodies do not efficiently neutralize infection but potently promote ADE of dengue virus (DENV) infection. To explore the effect of pr peptide substitution on neutralization and ADE of DENV infection, the rabbit anti-prM polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) and anti-JEVpr/DENV-M pAbs were prepared, and the neutralization and ADE of these two pAbs were further compared. Here, we report that both anti-JEVpr/DENV-M and anti-prM pAbs exhibited broad cross-reactivity and only partial neutralization with four DENV serotypes and immature DENV. Rabbit anti-prM pAbs showed a significant enhancement in a broad range of serum dilutions. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the enhancing activity of rabbit anti-JEVpr/DENV-M pAbs at various levels of dilution. These results demonstrate that anti-prM antibody-mediated ADE can be prevented by JEV pr peptide replacement. The present study contribute further to research on the pathogenesis of DENV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3ablood serum 3across reaction 3adengue 3aneutralization 3apathogenesis 3apolyclonal antibodies 3arabbits 3aserotypes 0aDengue virus 0aPrecursor peptide 0aPre-membrane 0aAntibody-dependent enhancement 0aChimeric protein 0aAnti-prM antibody1 aSi, Lu-Lu1 aGuo, Xiao-Lan1 aCui, Guo-hui1 aFang, Dan-Yun1 aZhou, Jun-Mei1 aYan, Hui-Jun1 aJiang, Li-Fang0 tVirus research.g2017 Feb. 02, v. 229 p.57-64dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245013700135300001600272506002800288520152700316592002801843506003701871650002401908650002401932650001701956650001501973650001301988650001002001650001702011650001602028651001402044653001502058653001502073653002402088653001702112653003302129700002002162700002202182773013502204852000902339655001202348IND60774307720221207073109.0161206e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077430772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinol, Ridzki M.F.10aDinamika profil hematologi dan rasio netrofil:limfosit monyet ekor panjang (macaca fascicularis) pada pengaturan mikroklimat ruangan  ap. 110-116.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of this study was to obtain the profile of physiological hematology (erythrocyte, PCV, Hb, MCV, MCH, MCHC, and leukocyte) and the profile of ratio between neutrophil and lymphocyte of long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) in different microclimate conditions due to the room’s temperature and humidity setting. The symptom of stress was also observed in this study. The research used 10 male macaques aged of 4 until 5 years old which placed in room temperature and humidity of 29,00±1,95°C and 79,52±1,57% respectively 7 days for adaptation period. Further more, the room temperature and humidity were set into 25,79±1,16°C and 80,19±9,05% during 14 days for treatment period. For the last treatment, macaques were reconditioned in room temperature and humidity of 29,00±1,95°C and 79,52±1,57% during 14 days for post-treatment period. Blood samplings were collected through femoralis vein on last day of adaptation period, continued with treatment and post-treatment periods as the day 1, 4, 7, 14, and 28. The results showed that there were not significant difference by room temperature and humidity setting to hematology and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. It could be proven by all parameters score obtained were still in normal ranges compared to literatures. There was also no stress symptom based on neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio measurement.

However, good information is mandatory to investigate the limnic carbon cycle, assess the endangerment through limnic eruptions and evaluate a potential source of exploitable energy. We addressed these three points in a heavily polluted mine pit lake in Germany. We quantified the ebullition of methane from deep waters and the sediment below. Exposed to continuous percolation of gas bubbles, the deep (monimolimnetic) water had accumulated high concentrations of gas: directly measured gas pressures indicated the proximity to spontaneous ebullition. Consequently, the possibility of a limnic eruption was assessed by initiating a self-sustained flow through a vertical pipe. Despite the high gas pressures, the flow was slow and the endangerment was considered low. A sampling strategy with bags was developed to achieve a reliable measurement of gas content and gas composition in the monimolimnion. As a result, directly measured gas pressures could be confirmed and were nearly exclusively attributed to methane and nitrogen. Contrary to lakes that had shown limnic eruptions, carbon dioxide played a much subordinate role, and hence the driving force for a violent outburst of gases was missing. Nevertheless the amount of dissolved methane was remarkably high. This investigation closes with some estimates of the commercial value of the deposit and limiting conditions for a possible exploitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abags 3abubbles 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3agases 3alakes 3amethane 3anitrogen 3asediments 3aGermany 0aGas pressure 0aMethane 0aEbullition 0aMeromixis 0aLimnic eruption 0aMine pit lake1 aMetzler, Philipp1 aUllrich, Karen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9811-684X1 aKoschorreck, Matthias1 aBoehrer, Bertram0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 584-585 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245012000213300001400333506007600347520128600423592002801709506003701737650002001774650000901794650001301803650001601816650002301832650001101855650001101866650001201877650002301889650001601912653002301928653002201951653001301973653001201986653002301998653001602021700001602037700002402053700002002077773009202097856008402189852000902273655001202282IND60535547220221207124328.0190318e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053554722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2013.09.0182doi7 aPMC42621482pmcid7 a240905372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRollins, Brandi Y.10aMeasurement of food reinforcement in preschool children.

Study objectives were to demonstrate the validity of the RRV of food task adapted for use among for preschool children (3–5y), and examine individual differences in performance. Thirty-three children completed the RRV of food task in which they worked to access graham crackers. They also completed a snack task where they had free access these foods, liking and hunger assessments, and their heights and weights were measured. Parents reported on their child’s reward sensitivity. Overall, children were willing work for palatable snack foods. Boys and older children made more responses in the task, while children with higher BMI z-scores and reward sensitivity responded at a faster rate. Children who worked harder in terms of total responses and response rates consumed more calories in the snack session. This study demonstrates that with slight modifications, the RRV of food task is a valid and developmentally appropriate measure for assessing individual differences in food reinforcement among very young children.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3aboys 3acrackers 3afood intake 3afood reinforcement 3ahumans 3ahunger 3aparents 3apreschool children 3asnack foods 0aFood reinforcement 0aProgressive ratio 0aChildren 0aObesity 0aReward sensitivity 0aMeasurement1 aLoken, Eric1 aSavage, Jennifer S.1 aBirch, Leann L.0 tAppetite.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 72 p.21-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2013.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008600170300001600256520114200272592002801414650002001442650001201462650002001474650002101494650002101515650001401536650001301550650001601563650001101579650001401590650000901604650001301613650001401626650001601640653000801656653001101664653000801675653000901683653000801692653000701700653000901707653000801716653000801724653000801732653000801740653001401748653002401762653001301786653001201799653001501811653001401826700001801840700001901858773009101877856008501968852000902053655001202062IND60086126320221116161724.0161018e20130702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008612632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaridas, Seenu10aMelatonin ameliorates chronic mild stress induced behavioral dysfunctions in mice  ap. 201-207.  aMelatonin, a neurohormone, is known to regulate several physiological functions, especially the circadian homeostasis, mood and behavior. Chronic exposure to stress is involved in the etiology of human affective disorders, and depressed patients have been reported to show changes in the circadian rhythms and nocturnal melatonin concentration. The present study was conducted to evaluate a possible beneficial action of chronic night-time melatonin treatment against chronic mild stress (CMS) induced behavioral impairments. As expected in the present study, the stress exposed mice showed reduced weight gain, hedonic deficit, cognitive deficits and decreased mobility in behavioral despair test. Interestingly, CMS exposed mice showed less anxiety. Chronic night-time melatonin administration significantly ameliorated the stress-induced behavioral disturbances, especially the cognitive dysfunction and depressive phenotypes. In conclusion, the present findings suggest the mitigating role of melatonin against CMS-induced behavioral changes, including the cognitive dysfunctions and reaffirm its potential role as an antidepressant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantidepressants 3aanxiety 3abehavior change 3achronic exposure 3acircadian rhythm 3acognition 3aetiology 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3amelatonin 3amice 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aweight gain 0aCMS 0aCPSCEA 0aFST 0aIAEC 0aIST 0aMT 0aNORT 0aOFT 0aPSU 0aSAD 0aSMA 0aMelatonin 0aChronic mild stress 0aBehavior 0aAnxiety 0aDepression 0aCognition1 aKumar, Mayank1 aManda, Kailash0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2013 July 02, v. 119 p.201-207dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016700168300001600335520149200351592002801843650001701871650001301888650001901901650002501920650001001945650002801955650001501983650001901998650001102017650000902028650002602037650001502063650001502078650001802093650002902111653000802140653000702148653000702155653000802162653000702170653000702177653000802184653000702192653000802199653000702207653001502214653000902229653000802238653000802246653000702254653000802261653000702269653000902276653001602285653001502301653002702316700001902343700001702362773011702379856008602496852000902582655001202591IND60576017220221119125736.0180905e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057601722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Yi Yun10aInvestigation of the effect of plasma albumin levels on regorafenib-induced hepatotoxicity using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method  ap. 220-224.  aRegorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor indicated for metastatic colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Due to its extensive plasma protein binding and low calculated hepatic extraction ratio, the hepatotoxicity observed with usage of the drug may be related to its plasma exposure. To investigate the highly dynamic free:bound drug concentration for regorafenib in the plasma, a bioanalytical liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric assay was developed and validated in human plasma. The concentration range of the assay was 2–1000ng/mL. Sample preparation was via protein precipitation using acetonitrile with sorafenib as the internal standard. The supernatant was injected into an ultra-performance liquid chromatographic system coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The analytes were separated on an AQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (120Å, 1.7μm, 2.1mm×50mm) and eluted with a gradient elution system. The ions were detected in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The linearity, lower limit of quantification, intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy conformed to FDA guidelines. The validated method was successfully applied to determine the effect of albumin levels in plasma on the extent of protein binding of regorafenib. The results indicated that physiologically-relevant levels of albumin were found to have no significant effect on the extent of protein binding of regorafenib, hence imposing minimal effect on drug disposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aalbumins 3ablood proteins 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adrugs 3agastrointestinal system 3aguidelines 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahumans 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3ametastasis 3amonitoring 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aACN 0aCE 0aCS 0aCXP 0aED 0aEP 0aESI 0aDP 0aFDA 0aIS 0aLC–MS/MS 0aLLOQ 0aMRM 0aPBS 0aQC 0aRED 0aSD 0aULOQ 0aRegorafenib 0aLC–MS/MS 0aPlasma protein binding1 aTan, Yeong Lan1 aHo, Han Kiat0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 1061-1062 p.220-224dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03608naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245008900159300001800248520233000266592002802596650002302624650001202647650001502659650001002674650001402684650001102698650000902709650002902718650001402747650001002761650001802771650001102789650001402800650002202814650001502836650002302851650001502874650001102889650001602900700002402916700002002940773009802960856007103058852000903129655001203138IND60518714320221119135701.0160418e198310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051871432DNAL7 a10.2307/19378312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArruda, Joseph A.14aThe Role of Suspended Sediments in the Nutrition of Zooplankton in Turbid Reservoirs  ap. 1225-1235.  aReservoirs built on rivers draining watersheds are often turbid with suspended sediments. Filter—feeding zooplankton, e.g., members of the genus Daphnia, seem to be as abundant in such reservoirs as in natural lakes. Using controlled laboratory conditions, we have investigated the potential role of suspended sediments in the nutrition of Daphnia from a turbid reservoir. In three sets of experimental procedures we measured: (1) the physical effect of sediments on the ingestion and incorporation rates of algae by daphnids, (2) the ingestion rates of two sizes of clay mineral sediments particles by daphnids, and (3) the growth and survival of daphnids fed yeast and sediments with and without organic matter adsorbed onto the particle surfaces. Increases in suspended sediment concentration from 0.0 to 245 l mg/L decreased ingestion rates of ¹ ⁴C—labeled Chlorella vulgaris by Daphnia parvula and D. pulex by 895% and decreased incorporation rates by 99%. Sediment concentrations of 50—100 mg/L reduced the algal carbon ingested by daphnids to potential starvation levels. ⁶ ⁵Zn—labeled fine and coarse (1.88 and 4.65 μ mean diameter) clay mineral sediment particles were fed to D. parvula, D. pulex, and D. similis. Ingestion rates of sediments by daphnids were limited at particle concentrations of 85.0 ° 10⁶ particles/mL and were dependent on particle size, daphnid size, daphnid species, and body size. Fine particles were ingested at greater rates by D. pulex and D. parvula than were coarse particles, while large D. similis ingested coarse and fine particles at similar rates. In addition, D. pulex had higher ingestion rates in each particle size suspension than did D. parvula or D. similis. The differential ability to ingest these particles suggest a mechanism of regulating daphnid species composition if the organic matter adsorbed to these sediment particles is useful as food. To evaluate this mechanism, we adsorbed dissolved organic protein to sediment particles. When D. pulex were fed the amended sediment suspension, they grew larger than when fed control sediments, but not as large as when fed yeast. D. parvula grew equally well when fed either yeast or amended sediments. Thus, dissolved organic matter can be made available for daphnid growth by the mechanism of adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aDaphnia 3aadsorption 3aalgae 3abody size 3acarbon 3aclay 3adissolved organic matter 3aingestion 3alakes 3aparticle size 3arivers 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3astarvation 3asuspended sediment 3awatersheds 3ayeasts 3azooplankton1 aMarzolf, G.

We derived dietary data from two multiple-pass 24-hour dietary recalls with a parent and his or her child. The analysis employed a classic twin study design and used data from 379 twin pairs.Univariate analyses indicate that heritability for mean daily energy (kcal) and macronutrient (g) intakes was moderate, ranging from 0.34 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.46) to 0.42 (0.31, 0.53). Genetic effects also accounted for 0.28 (0.16, 0.40) of the variance in percent of energy from lipids, while only environmental (shared and unique) effects accounted for the variance in percent of energy from proteins and carbohydrates. The shared environment did not contribute to variations in daily intakes for most of the nutritional variables under study. Multivariate analyses suggest the presence of macronutrient-specific genetic influences for lipids and carbohydrates, estimated at 0.12 (0.04, 0.19) and 0.20 (0.11, 0.29) respectively.The unique environment (i.e., not shared by family members) has the largest influence on variances in daily energy and macronutrient intakes in 9-year-old children. This finding underscores the need to take obesogenic environments into account when planning dietary interventions for younger populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3achildren 3adiet recall 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aexperimental design 3aheritability 3alipids 3amultivariate analysis 3aneonates 3anutritional intervention 3aphenotype 3aplanning 3aproteins 3atwins 3avariance 3aQuebec 0aEnergy intake 0aMacronutrients 0aChildren 0aTwins 0aHeritability 0aEnvironment1 aDiasparra, Maikol1 aBédard, Brigitte1 aKaprio, Jaakko1 aFontaine-Bisson, Bénédicte1 aPérusse, Daniel1 aTremblay, Richard1 aBoivin, Michel0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2013 July 02, v. 119 p.30-37dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.05.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014000169300001800309520132400327592002801651650001901679650001501698650002401713650002201737650001301759650002201772650002501794650001501819650001501834650001901849700002001868773008801888856008301976852000902059655001202068IND60096801620221118050448.0141104e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009680162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezessy, Silvia10aVoluntary agreements in the field of energy efficiency and emission reduction: Review and analysis of experiences in the European Union  ap. 7121-7129.  aA number of Member States of the EU have introduced voluntary agreements (VAs) that aim to deliver energy savings and emission reductions via increased energy efficiency in different end-use sectors, mainly targeting industry. Where there is a successful track record of cooperation between public authorities and the private sector, VAs can offer advantages to public authorities in comparison to legislation, most importantly better flexibility when introduced or updated, greater acceptance by industry, possibility for tailor-made solutions e.g. at the level of industrial sectors and opportunity to overcome the information asymmetry between public authorities and private actors. Nevertheless, VAs have been criticized for lack of specific obligations and lenient targets, as well as for deficiencies in compliance monitoring and self-reporting and difficulty in establishing the policy additionality of VA activity. This paper analyses the design of existing VAs in terms of general framework, targets and sectors, obligations and commitments, motivation to join, reporting and monitoring provisions, and results of existing VAs as reported by national authorities. The paper summarizes the key characteristics of voluntary agreements and gives recommendations for the successful application of this policy tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acompliance 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3amonitoring 3amotivation 3aprivate sector1 aBertoldi, Paolo0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.7121-7129dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245006300174300001600237520152700253592002801780650002901808650001201837650002301849650001601872650001401888650001101902650001401913650001801927650001001945653002301955653002101978653002301999653002202022653001902044653002602063700001902089700002002108700001702128700001902145773012302164856008802287852000902375655001202384IND60564441620221118061633.0181011e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056444162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBednařík, Adam10aEffect of weir impoundments on methane dynamics in a river  ap. 164-174.  aWe measured CH4 concentration, CH4 oxidation in the water column and total CH4 emissions to the atmosphere (diffusion and ebullition) in three weir impoundments and river reaches between them, in order to understand their role in river methane (CH4) dynamics. Sediment samples were also collected to determine CH4 consumption and production potentials together with the contribution of individual methanogenic pathways. The CH4 surface water concentration increased 7.5 times in the 16km long river stretch. Microbial CH4 oxidation in the water column reached values ranging from 51 to 403nmoll⁻¹d⁻¹ and substantially contributed to the CH4 removal from surface water, together with CH4 emissions. The total CH4 emissions to the atmosphere varied between 0.8 and 207.1mmolCH4m⁻²d⁻¹ with the highest values observed upstream of the weirs (mean 68.5±29.9mmolCH4m⁻²d⁻¹). Most of the CH4 was transported through the air-water interface by ebullition upstream of the weirs, while the ebullition accounted for 95.8±2.0% of the total CH4 emissions. Both CH4 production and oxidation potential of sediments were higher upstream of the weirs compared to downstream of the weirs. The contribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to total CH4 sediment production was 36.7–89.4% and prevailed upstream of the weirs. Our findings indicate that weirs might influence river CH4 dynamics, especially by increased CH4 production and consumption by sediments, followed by increasing CH4 emissions to the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aoxidation 3arivers 3asediments 3asurface water 3aweirs 0aMethane production 0aMethane emission 0aMethane ebullition 0aRiver impoundment 0aRiver sediment 0aMethanogenic pathways1 aBlaser, Martin1 aMatoušů, Anna1 aHekera, Petr1 aRulík, Martin0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 584-585 p.164-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245015700170300001600327520120400343592002801547650003701575650001901612650002101631650001901652650001101671650001101682650001401693650001401707650002601721650001501747650001601762650001001778651001101788653001401799653002601813653001301839653002201852653004001874700002101914700002101935700002301956700001801979700002101997700002002018700002102038700002602059700001902085700002502104773012702129856008802256852000902344655001202353IND60559719220221122115453.0190318e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055971922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Koen10aChilling and forcing requirements for foliage bud burst of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) differ between provenances and are phenotypically plastic  ap. 172-181.  aThe timing of foliar budburst is an important component of the fitness of trees. Adaptation of budburst to local temperatures and phenotypic plasticity in the date of budburst to changes in temperature can therefore be expected. In this study, we analysed provenance trials of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) established over a wide geographic and climatic range in Europe. The analysis was based on a phenological model that represents the key processes at budburst phenology of temperate- and boreal zone deciduous trees. We conclude that adaptive differences exist between provenances in the critical chilling- and forcing requirements triggering budburst. Moreover, it is likely that these provenances show a plastic response to local environmental conditions for these two factors. Chilling- and forcing temperature requirements are key traits determining a tree’s response of the date of foliar budburst to temperature. We infer from our results that trees would be able to adjust this response when climatic conditions change. Implications for climate change assessment studies and suggestions to incorporate this second order phenotypic plasticity in phenological models are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acold treatment 3aleaves 3amodels 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprovenance 3atemperature 3atrees 3aEurope 0aPhenology 0aPhenotypic plasticity 0aBudburst 0aProvenance trials 0aEuropean beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)1 aDucousso, Alexis1 aGömöry, Dušan1 aHansen, Jon Kehlet1 aIonita, Lucia1 aLiesebach, Mirko1 aLorenţ, Adrian1 aSchüler, Silvio1 aSulkowska, Malgorzata1 ade Vries, Sven1 avon Wühlisch, Georg0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 234-235 p.172-181dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245011300172300001600285520116700301592002801468650003001496650001501526650001301541650001501554650002001569650001901589650002001608650001401628650001101642650001301653653004001666653001201706653001201718653003101730653002701761653001901788653002601807653001201833653001801845653002101863653001501884700003501899700003801934700003601972700003402008700002202042700003602064700002202100773010102122856008302223852000902306655001202315IND60556990120221118181145.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055699012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2016.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandi, Igor Viana10aTotal combining power: Technique for the evaluation of the quality control process of clostridiosis vaccines  ap. 164-168.  aAn efficient technique for evaluation of the quality control of vaccines against clostridiosis is described in this study. This technique is capable of quantifying the toxoid of the bacterium Clostridium perfringens Type D, which is commonly found within these vaccines. The described method is performed in vivo to quantify the toxoid, replacing the current predominant approaches that use the titration of toxins before the inactivation process. This method is based on the partial neutralization of a determined dose of antitoxin by testing different doses of the toxoid. In order to guarantee its reliability, it is essential for the technique to be validated. Thus, the technique was tested using the following validation parameters: specificity and selectivity, detection limit, linear correlation, precision and robustness, in agreement with the requirements of regulatory agencies and international committees from around the world. The method was found to be specific, selective, robust, precise, and linear inside a specific concentration range. Therefore, it could be applied to the quality control of clostridiosis vaccines with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens D 3aantitoxins 3abacteria 3acommittees 3adetection limit 3aneutralization 3aquality control 3atitration 3atoxins 3avaccines 0aInternational antitoxin unit (I.U.) 0aLo dose 0aL+ dose 0aStandard epsilon antitoxin 0aStandard epsilon toxin 0aEpsilon toxoid 0aTotal combining power 0aVaccine 0aClostridiosis 0aToxin and toxoid 0aValidation1 aSantos, Eliane Macedo Sobrinho1 aCarvalho, Bruna Mara Aparecida de1 aDurães, Carla Adriana Ferreira1 aFarias, Paula Karoline Soares1 aSari, Roger Shoji1 aCangussu, Alex Sander Rodrigues1 aPessoa, Adalberto0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2016 Nov., v. 130 p.164-168dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2016.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001200176245008100188300001500269520134300284592002801627650001201655650001301667650002001680650001901700650001201719650001401731700001601745700001601761700001601777700002101793773015101814856006901965856010302034990002302137852000902160655001202169IND60643512020221121220532.0190510e20140305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064351202DNAL7 a10.3791/512492doi7 aPMC41237962pmcid7 a246374042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qin10aFast imaging technique to study drop impact dynamics of non-newtonian fluids  ap. e51249.  aIn the field of fluid mechanics, many dynamical processes not only occur over a very short time interval but also require high spatial resolution for detailed observation, scenarios that make it challenging to observe with conventional imaging systems. One of these is the drop impact of liquids, which usually happens within one tenth of millisecond. To tackle this challenge, a fast imaging technique is introduced that combines a high-speed camera (capable of up to one million frames per second) with a macro lens with long working distance to bring the spatial resolution of the image down to 10 µm/pixel. The imaging technique enables precise measurement of relevant fluid dynamic quantities, such as the flow field, the spreading distance and the splashing speed, from analysis of the recorded video. To demonstrate the capabilities of this visualization system, the impact dynamics when droplets of non-Newtonian fluids impinge on a flat hard surface are characterized. Two situations are considered: for oxidized liquid metal droplets we focus on the spreading behavior, and for densely packed suspensions we determine the onset of splashing. More generally, the combination of high temporal and spatial imaging resolution introduced here offers advantages for studying fast dynamics across a wide range of microscale phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3adroplets 3afluid mechanics 3aimage analysis 3aliquids 3aoxidation1 aPeters, Ivo1 aWilken, Sam1 aBrown, Eric1 aJaeger, Heinrich0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Mar. 05, , no. 85 p.e51249-e51249dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/512493Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51249/fast-imaging-technique-to-study-drop-impact-dynamics-non-newtonian  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04463naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001900182245008700201300001800288500001500306506007600321520183100397592002802228506003702256650002502293650001302318650000902331650001702340650001702357650001402374650002002388650001102408650001002419650003402429650001202463650001802475650001902493650001002512650001102522650002402533650004102557650005202598650005202650650002702702650003302729650003702762650001302799650002802812650002302840650003502863650001402898650005302912650004102965650004203006650003603048650004303084650004003127650003103167650002303198650004903221650005303270653001203323700002203335700001903357700001903376700001903395700001903414700002203433700002203455773011503477856004403592852000903636655001203645IND4469024320221207092254.0120502e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446902432DNAL7 a223835412pmid7 aPMC33201772pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.111.1927652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Yu-Chang10aCharacterization of Genes Involved in Cytokinin Signaling and Metabolism from Rice  ap. 1666-1684.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo-component signaling elements play important roles in plants, including a central role in cytokinin signaling. We characterized two-component elements from the monocot rice (Oryza sativa) using several complementary approaches. Phylogenetic analysis reveals relatively simple orthologous relationships among the histidine kinases in rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In contrast, the histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins (OsHPs) and response regulators (OsRRs) display a higher degree of lineage-specific expansion. The intracellular localizations of several OsHPs and OsRRs were examined in rice and generally found to correspond to the localizations of their dicot counterparts. The functionality of rice type-B OsRRs was tested in Arabidopsis; one from a clade composed of both monocot and dicot type-B OsRRs complemented an Arabidopsis type-B response regulator mutant, but a type-B OsRR from a monocot-specific subfamily generally did not. The expression of genes encoding two-component elements and proteins involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation was analyzed in rice roots and shoots and in response to phytohormones. Nearly all type-A OsRRs and OsHK4 were up-regulated in response to cytokinin, but other cytokinin signaling elements were not appreciably affected. Furthermore, multiple cytokinin oxidase (OsCKX) genes were up-regulated by cytokinin. Abscisic acid treatment decreased the expression of several genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation. Auxin affected the expression of a few genes; brassinosteroid and gibberellin had only modest effects. Our results support a shared role for two-component elements in mediating cytokinin signaling in monocots and dicots and reveal how phytohormones can impact cytokinin function through modulating gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aproteins 3arice 3abiosynthesis 3aOryza sativa 3aphylogeny 3agene expression 3aauxins 3agenes 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3amutants 3aabscisic acid 3aacid treatment 3aroots 3ashoots 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aCytokininsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOryzaxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aPlant Shootsxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aProtein Transportxdrug effects 2aProtoplastsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSequence Alignment 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aSubcellular Fractionsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0akinases1 aWeir, Nicholas R.1 aHill, Kristine1 aZhang, Wenjing1 aKim, Hyo-jung,1 aShiu, Shin-Han1 aSchaller, G.

Albumin is a THDP in the blood of all studied species of vertebrates, so may be the original vertebrate THDP. However, albumin has weak affinity for THs. Transthyretin (TTR) has been identified in the blood across different lineages in adults vs juveniles. TTR has intermediate affinity for THs. Thyroxine-binding globulin has only been identified in mammals and has high affinity for THs. Of these THDPs, TTR is the only one known to be synthesised in the brain and is involved in moving THs from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid.

A 200‐V electrical field was applied to extract the analytes from 2.5 mL sample solution with pH 3.0, through an organic phase which consisted of 80% 2‐nitrophenyl octyl ether, 10% di‐(2‐ethylhexyl) phosphate and 10% tris‐(2‐ethylhexyl)phosphate as supported liquid membrane into an acidic acceptor solution with pH 1.0, located inside the lumen of a hollow fiber. To achieve the best extraction conditions, the organic membrane composition was optimized separately and other parameters, such as extraction time, applied voltage and pH in sample solution and acceptor phase were studied using experimental design. Under optimal conditions, extraction recoveries of 53 and 43% were obtained for SB and terbutaline, respectively, which corresponded to preconcentration factors of 89 for SB and 72 for terbutaline. The method offers acceptable linearity with correlation coefficient higher than 0.9947 and relative standard deviation less than 4.7%. Finally, it was applied for analysis of drugs in wastewater samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acorrelation 3adrugs 3aelectric field 3aelectrical treatment 3aexperimental design 3aliquid chromatography 3amicroextraction 3apH1 aYamini, Yadollah1 aSeidi, Shahram0 tJournal of separation science.g2012 Feb., v. 35, no. 4 p.571-579dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.201100869  aDNAL 7aarticle01971naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245004700132300001200179520113200191592002801323650002001351650001401371650001601385650001401401650001101415650002101426650001201447650000901459650001001468651002001478651001301498773012501511852000901636655001201645IND60312894220221119205513.0150714e20140829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031289422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBawaya, Michael12aA chocolate habit in ancient North America  ap. 991.  aFor centuries, elite people in ancient Mesoamerica drank a foaming beverage made from the ground beans of the tropical Theobroma cacao tree. Served in cylindrical jars and spouted pitchers in grand cities and temples, this was a chocolate drink steeped in ritual. North America had its great prehistoric cities, too—for example, ancient Cahokia near St. Louis, Missouri, or Chaco Canyon in New Mexico—but for years most archaeologists assumed little contact between the cultures. Chocolate may change that picture, with the recent discovery of subtle residues of it in pots from Cahokia. Added to similar evidence from the Southeast and Southwest, the findings suggest regular trade in cacao—and movements of the people who imbued it with significance—between ancient Mesoamericans and their northern neighbors, says Dorothy Washburn, an archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and co-author of a new paper. But the new work also reveals the complexities of such residue analysis, she says: Low levels of a certain alkaloid of T. cacao may be due to modern contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3aalkaloids 3aarchaeology 3achocolate 3acities 3acocoa (beverage) 3afoaming 3ajars 3atrade 3aCentral America 3aMissouri0 tScience.g2014 Aug. 29, v. 345, no. 6200 p.991-991dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012700164300001600291520082200307592002801129650002401157650001801181650001801199650001501217650001301232650002301245650002401268650002101292650002701313650002101340650001401361650001001375650001601385650001601401700001501417700001801432700003201450700001501482773010601497856008101603852000901684655001201693IND60579742720221116141524.0170830e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057974272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-017-9681-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yueya10aAdventitious Shoot Induction from Internode and Root Explants in a Semiparasitic Herb Monochasma savatieri Franch ex Maxim  ap. 799-804.  aA highly efficient protocol for the induction of adventitious shoots from young internode and root explants of a semiparasitic medicinal herb Monochasma savatieri Franch ex Maxim was developed. MS basal medium supplemented with 5 µM thidiazuron (TDZ) induced 32 adventitious shoots/explant, which was double the number obtained using the same concentration of 6-benzyladenine (BA). Hyperhydric shoots were observed when 10 µM of any cytokinin was added to MS media. Use of any cytokinin at 2.5 µM produced an average of 14–21 adventitious shoots/root explant. Shoots formed roots in vitro more effectively than α-naphthaleneacetic acid when indole-3-butyric acid and indole-3-acetic acid were used at 1.0 µM. Two-month-old rooted plantlets were transplanted to vermiculite and 70% survived after 4 months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadventitious shoots 3abenzyladenine 3aculture media 3acytokinins 3aexplants 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3amedicinal plants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aparasitic plants 3aplantlets 3aroots 3athidiazuron 3avermiculite1 aChen, Yulu1 aZhang, Xinhua1 aTeixeira da Silva, Jaime A.1 aMa, Guohua0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2017 Sept., v. 36, no. 3 p.799-804dSpringer USx0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-017-9681-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245010900173300001600282520190200298592002802200650002202228650001002250650001502260650001702275650001202292650001002304650001602314650001502330650002902345650001302374650001002387650001002397700001702407773011302424856005502537852000902592655001202601IND4473465720221117234535.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447346572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2011.01642.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilchrist, A. S.10aFactors affecting the dispersal of large‐scale releases of the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni  ap. 252-262.  aThis study investigated two factors potentially affecting the spatial distribution of Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) after release from a single point. First, the effect of age at release was investigated using a single cohort of 205 000 males from a mass‐rearing strain used for sterile insect releases. Approximately half were released as immature males and the remainder as sexually mature males (1 week later). Males were collected over 3 weeks from a grid of 135 traps, each containing a pheromone/insecticide bait, positioned between 4 and 500 m from the release point. Variation in the distribution of fly density around the release point was assessed by regressing trapped fly counts against distance. Unexpectedly, no significant differences were found in the spatial distribution of the flies. Second, the effect of inbreeding on spatial distribution was investigated using replicated simultaneous releases of two strains of B. tryoni. One strain was the existing (inbred) mass‐rearing strain that has been selected for high productivity in a mass‐rearing facility. The second strain was deliberately outbred but also selected for high productivity. Almost 100 000 males of each strain were released over the two experiments. Regression of trappings against distance differed significantly between strains in only one of five releases, but in all cases the outbred strain had a greater dispersal distance. As our trapping grid was not regular but contained gaps of up to 100 m, a small preliminary experiment investigated whether flies move faster along tree rows or across open fields. At distances up to 100 m, we found no detectable difference in fly distributions. These results are primarily relevant to the large‐scale point releases carried out as part of an existing B. tryoni sterile insect programme and are discussed in that context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera tryoni 3abaits 3ainbreeding 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3amales 3aoutbreeding 3apheromones 3asterile insect technique 3atrapping 3atraps 3atrees1 aMeats, A.

In addition, a possible role of neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, in HPA axis hyperactivation has recently been proposed. Neuropeptide W (NPW) is an endogenous peptide ligand for the GPR7 and GPR8 and a stress mediator in the hypothalamus. It activates the HPA axis by working on hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). No information is available about the interrelationships between neurotrophines like NGF/BDNF and NPW. We studied the effect and underlying mechanisms of NGF/BDNF on the production of NPW in PC12 cells and hypothalamus. NGF time- and concentration-dependently stimulated the expression of NPW in PC12 cells. The effect of NGF was blocked by the inhibition of PI3K/Akt signal pathway with specific inhibitors for PI3K or Akt siRNA for Akt while inhibition of ERK pathway had no effect. Moreover, BDNF concentration-dependently induced the expression of NPW mRNA and decreased the expression of NPY mRNA in primary cultured hypothalamic neurons which was also blocked by a PI3K kinase inhibitor. Finally, in vivo study showed that exogenous BDNF injected icv increased NPW production in the hypothalamus and this effect was reversed by a PI3 kinase inhibitor. These results and the fact that BDNF was able to stimulate the expression of CRH demonstrated that neurotrophines can modulate the expression of NPW in neuronal cells via the PI3K/Akt pathway and suggest that BDNF might be involved in functions of the HPA axis, at least in part by modulating the expression of NPW/NPY and CRH.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahypothalamus 3ain vivo studies 3aligands 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anerve growth factor 3aneurons 3aneuropeptides 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3asignal transduction 0aNeuropeptide W 0aNeurotrophins 0aPI3K/Akt 0aHPA axis1 aYan, Fengxia1 aLiao, Rifang1 aWan, Pei1 aLittle, Peter J.1 aZheng, Wenhua0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01972naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245011600174300001600290520095300306592002801259650001301287650000901300650001801309650002301327650001101350650001001361650002301371700002601394700001801420773014401438856005501582852000901637655001201646IND50059917120221118074023.0180615e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005991712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7976.2012.01254.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkaichi, Faical10aAssessing Consumers’ Willingness to Pay for Different Units of Organic Milk: Evidence from Multiunit Auctions  ap. 469-494.  aExperimental auctions are normally conducted using single‐unit auctions. In this paper, we use the multiunit Vickrey auction to assess the determinants of consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for organic milk in a multiunit shopping scenario. We also analyze the effect of positive and negative information about organic farming on WTP. Our results suggest that consumers are willing to pay a premium for organic milk but that this WTP decreases with the number of units purchased. Results also suggest that health issues, high price of organic foods, taste, and lack of information on organic foods are factors that influence WTP for organic milk. The type of information provided also plays a relevant role. Specifically, we found that subjects’ WTP responds positively to positive information about organic farming and responds negatively to negative information. The provision of both positive and negative information does not affect WTP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauctions 3amilk 3aorganic foods 3aorganic production 3aprices 3ataste 3awillingness to pay1 aNayga, Jr, Rodolfo M.1 aGil, José M.0 tCanadian journal of agricultural economics.g2012 Dec., v. 60, no. 4 p.469-494dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl44931x0008-39767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7976.2012.01254.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009600169520164700265592002801912650002301940650002601963650001601989650001202005650001402017650001402031650002002045650001702065650001202082650002202094650001902116650002202135650000702157650001302164650001902177650001602196700002802212700003002240700002502270700002002295700002702315700002102342700002302363773012502386856008402511852000902595655001202604IND60760620520221120121022.0211223e20211112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076062052DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70402622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaijan, Manat 10aCharacterization of Antioxidant Peptides from Thai Traditional Semi-Dried Fermented Catfish  aHerein, the antioxidant peptides from a Thai traditional semi-dried fermented farmed hybrid catfish (Clarias macrocephalus × Clarias gariepinus) catfish, Pla Duk Ra, were characterized. After extraction and deproteinization, Pla Duk Ra crude peptide extract (CPE) was fractioned using 2 connected Hitrap Sephadex-G25 columns, yielding two significant fractions, F1 with higher browning intensity (A₄₂₀) and F2. CPE, F1, and F2 had different amino acid profiles, contents, and sequences evaluated by LC-MS/MS, which could be responsible for their antioxidant properties. F2 contained the highest numbers of hydrophobic amino acid (HBA) (47.45%) and aromatic amino acid (27.31%), followed by F1, and CPE. The peptides with 8–24 amino acid residues were detected in CPE and its fractions. In CPE, F1, and F2, there were 69, 68, and 85 peptides with varied HBA content, respectively. ARHSYGMLYCSCPPND (50% HBA), ALRKMGRK (37.5% HBA), and ANWMIPLM (87.5% HBA) were the most prevalent peptides found in CPE, F1, and F2. Overall, F2 was the most effective at inhibiting free radicals (DPPH● and ABTS●⁺) and reactive oxygen species (hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide), followed by F1 and CPE. The metal chelation of F1 was, however, superior to that of F2 and CPE. For the stability test, the effects of pH, heating temperature, and in vitro digestion on the DPPH● scavenging activity of F2 were investigated. The activity was boosted by lowering the pH and raising the heating temperature. In the gastrointestinal tract model system, however, roughly 50% of DPPH● scavenging activity reduced after digesting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClarias gariepinus 3aClarias macrocephalus 3aamino acids 3acatfish 3achelation 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3afermentation 3ahybrids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydroxyl radicals 3apH 3apeptides 3asinglet oxygen 3atemperature1 aRodsamai, Tanutchaporn 1 aCharoenlappanit, Sawanya 1 aRoytrakul, Sittiruk 1 aPanya, Atikorn 1 aPhonsatta, Natthaporn 1 aCheong, Lingzhi,1 aPanpipat, Worawan 0 tFermentation.g2021 Nov. 12, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70402623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01569naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245004900132300001200181520088500193592002801078650001301106650001601119650001501135650002001150650001101170773012501181852000901306655001201315IND60312894320221119205518.0150714e20140829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031289432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMervis, Jeffrey10aWhy null results rarely see the light of day  ap. 992.  aA team at Stanford University reports online this week in Science that scientists are unlikely to even write up an experiment that produces so-called null results. A study of 221 survey-based experiments funded by the TESS (Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences) program at the National Science Foundation has found that almost two-thirds of the experiments yielding null findings are stuck in a file drawer rather than being submitted to a journal, and only 21% are published. In contrast, 96% of the experiments that yield strong results are written up, and 62% of them are published. Such practices by researchers can skew the literature and lead to wasteful duplication, the authors argue. To combat the problem, the authors call for a social science registry that would contain all such data, as well as descriptions of the methodology used to analyze the results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aresearchers 3ascientists 3asocial sciences 3ayields0 tScience.g2014 Aug. 29, v. 345, no. 6200 p.992-992dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245012300211300001400334520220600348592002802554650001502582650001402597650002002611650001902631650001202650650001102662650001002673650002002683650001702703650001902720650001302739653001902752653002702771653002102798653001402819653003002833653001502863700006302878700001802941700001802959773014902977856008603126852000903212655001203221IND60752215420221119121459.0211106e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075221542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOviedo-Diego, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4469-624410aInteraction between sexual communication functions leads to reproductive interference in two syntopic scorpion species  ap. 83-93.  aSexual communication in mate choice scenarios involves nonmutually exclusive functions: species recognition, mate location and mate assessment. Most studies on sexual communication in mate choice have focused on female assessment of conspicuous male traits, such as visual and acoustic signals. Only a few studies have addressed male assessment of female traits, especially those that are inconspicuous to the human sensory system, such as chemical signals. Although chemical signals are important in sexual communication of many arachnids, there is a gap in our knowledge about how male scorpions use these signals to evaluate potential partners. Here we studied sexual communication functions in two scorpion species (Urophonius brachycentrus and Urophonius achalensis) with sympatric populations and synchronic reproduction, where males are under a scramble competition mating system. We addressed the volatile pheromones role in each of the sexual communication functions. We used Y-mazes to test volatile pheromones, exposing males to different female stimulus arrays in single-signal (conspecific only) and mixed-signal (conspecific and heterospecific) contexts. Males located conspecific females through volatile pheromones, and the time spent in proximity to the female was proportional to males' perception of the female's quality, reinforcing the pheromones' function in mate location and assessment in single-signal environments. However, these sexually selected functions were overridden in mixed-signal contexts, in which males could not differentiate conspecific from heterospecific females, suggesting that pheromones do not allow species recognition. This interaction between sexual communication functions can lead to reproductive interference in this sympatric zone. Male indiscriminateness mediated by scramble competition could attenuate pheromones' species recognition function during mate choice. We provide a comprehensive study of the pheromones' role for mate and species recognition in different social contexts in scorpions. We found support for nonindependent and interacting functions of sexual communication, indicating that mate choice is a complex process in scorpions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScorpiones 3aacoustics 3aanimal behavior 3aconspecificity 3afemales 3ahumans 3amales 3amating behavior 3areproduction 3asensory system 3asympatry 0abody condition 0achemical communication 0amale mate choice 0apheromone 0areproductive interference 0aUrophonius1 aCosta-Schmidt, L.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0223-85871 aMattoni, C.I.1 aPeretti, A.V.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2021 Nov., v. 181 p.83-93dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.08.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245017600177520102300353592002801376650002201404650001601426650002601442650001701468650001101485650001601496650001101512650002301523650001601546650002501562700002301587700002501610700002201635700002801657700001801685773012501703856008401828852000901912655001201921IND60760620620221120121155.0211223e20211112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076062062DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70402632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondylaksita, Kinanthi 10aEnhanced Volatile Fatty Acid Production from Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch through Acidogenic Fermentation—A Novel Resource Recovery Strategy for Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch  aThe glucan-rich fraction, hemicellulosic compounds-rich fraction, and a mixture of both fractions obtained from organosolv pretreatment of oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) were used as substrates to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in acidogenic fermentation.

R.12aA quantitative framework for analysis of regime shifts in a Galápagos coastal lagoon  ap. 3046-3055.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRegime shifts are often used to describe sharp changes between two or more ecological states, each characterized by their own dynamics, stochastic fluctuations, or cycles. Ecological theory indicates they can occur either as a result of an abrupt environmental forcing (extrinsic regime shift), or be indicative of complex responses to local‐scale dynamics and thresholds (intrinsic regime shift). One important area of ecological research is to develop quantitative tools to analyze regime shifts, but there are few studies that have applied these methods to the long‐term ecological record. In this study, we introduce a framework to investigate regime shifts in diatom assemblages and mangrove ecosystem dynamics in a coastal lagoon from the Galápagos Islands over the past 2600 years. The framework integrates a set of established statistical methodologies for investigating regime shift dynamics in long‐term ecological records. We use these methods to (1) identify the presence of regime shifts; (2) test for a series of hypothetical relationships (i.e., linear through to threshold) between ecological response and environment using nonlinear regression; and (3) investigate the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics in response to environmental perturbations. The transitions in the diatoms closely track the sequence of disturbance, recovery, and habitat shifts that have occurred in the lagoon over the past 2600 years, demonstrating extrinsic responses to environmental forcing. In contrast, the shift from a mangrove‐ to a microbial mat‐dominated system ∼945 cal yr BP provides potential evidence of an intrinsic regime shift. Our framework enables robust interpretations into the underlying dynamics of regime shifts in the paleoecological record and is widely applicable for investigating abrupt ecological changes in a range of systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3acoastal water 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3aislands 3apaleoecology 3aGalapagos Islands1 aFroyd, Cynthia A.1 aWitkowski, Andrzej1 aWillis, K.

The amount and distribution of leaf litter within a forest can influence patterns of plant establishment. In this study, we determined the spatial variability in leaf litter in the forest understory, and investigated how different litter depths (bare, 1, 6, and 12 cm) affected the establishment of several tropical tree species in both growth house (sun and shade) and field (gap and understory) experiments in the semideciduous tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The tree species used in this study (Aspidospermum cruenta, Ceiba pentandra, Cordia alliodora, Gustavia Superba, Luehea semmannii, Ochroma pyrimidale) were chosen to represent a range of seed masses and a gradient in the light requirement for establishment of the species. The spatial distribution of leaf litter was not correlated between adjacent sampling points within the forest understory, suggesting that the establishment environment for seedlings, with respect to litter, is highly variable at scales of 1—20 m. The presence of litter affected five of the six species, but the nature and the magnitude of the effect were species specific. The smaller seeded shade—intolerant species had fewer seedlings establishing under leaf litter than on bare ground. The species ranged from strongly nagatively affected (Luehae) to moderately negatively affected (Cordia, Ochroma) to affected only by extreme amounts of litter (Ceiba). The presence of litter influenced Gustavia, one of the larger seeded shade—tolerant species, but did not affect Aspidospermum, the other large seeded species. The effect of litter on Gustavia depended on the light environment. Gustavia had more seedlings establishing under litter in the sun, but the presence of litter had no effect in the shade. Differences among the smaller seeded shade—intolerant species in the amount they were negatively influenced by litter were not correlated with seed mass. Data from our field study were consistent with our growth house results for the shade—intolerant species. Additional data from the field study indicated that these species with similar habitat requirements differed in the developmental stage at which they were affected by the presence of litter. Luehea had fewer seeds germinating under litter while the other two species, Ochroma and Cordia, were affected only after germination. Interspecific comparisons done for each light level and litter depth indicated that the presence of litter caused reversals in the relative ranking of species success. For example, Gustavia preferentially established under relatively deep litter depths in the sun where Luehea could not establish. In conclusion, the presence of litter can potentially increase seedling diversity within the forest by creating heterogeneity in the establishment environment and by causing reversals in species' rankings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeiba pentandra 3aCordia alliodora 3aGustavia 3aLuehea 3aOchroma 3afield experimentation 3aforest litter 3agermination 3ahabitats 3aislands 3alight requirement 3aplant establishment 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashade tolerance 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aunderstory 3aPanama1 aAugspurger, Carol K.0 tEcology.g1992 Feb., v. 73, no. 1 p.68-77dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19387213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015000171300001800321500001900339520179300358592002802151650000802179650001602187650002602203650003102229650001102260650001802271650001302289650002102302650002002323650001102343650001702354650001602371653001702387653001602404653001702420653001402437653002002451700002202471700001702493773009902510856008602609852000902695655001202704IND60700972220221119091052.0210118e20200731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070097222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.06.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiskanen, Mirja10aDNA vaccination with the Mycobacterium marinum MMAR_4110 antigen inhibits reactivation of a latent mycobacterial infection in the adult Zebrafish  ap. 5685-5694.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTuberculosis is a major challenge for health care, as options for its treatment and prevention are limited. Therefore, novel approaches, such as DNA vaccination, to both prevent primary infections and the reactivation of latent infections need to be developed. A Mycobacterium marinum infection in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) recapitulates features of the human Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, providing a convenient preclinical animal model for studying tuberculosis.Hypoxic M. marinum cultures were produced with the Wayne model, and further reaerated to replicate the in vivo reactivation in vitro. Expression levels of M. marinum genes were studied with mRNA sequencing from exponentially growing bacteria, anaerobic cultures and at 2 and 12 h after reaeration. Seven reactivation-associated genes were selected for further studies, where their antigen potentiality as DNA-vaccines to prevent reactivation of a latent mycobacterial infection was investigated in the adult zebrafish model. The Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate differences in bacterial counts between the groups.The mRNA sequencing data showed that, seven M. marinum genes, MMAR_0444, MMAR_0514, MMAR_0552, MMAR_0641, MMAR_1093, MMAR_4110 and MMAR_4524, were upregulated during reactivation when compared to both dormant and logarithmic growing bacteria. Four different MMAR_4110 antigens prevented the reactivation of a latent mycobacterial infection in the adult zebrafish.This study provides novel information about reactivation-related M. marinum genes. One of the antigens, MMAR_4110, inhibited the reactivation of a latent M. marinum infection in zebrafish, implicating that the characterized genes could be potential targets for further vaccine and drug development against mycobacterial diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDanio rerio 3aMycobacterium marinum 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aadults 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3adrug development 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3atuberculosis 3avaccination 0aReactivation 0aDNA vaccine 0aImmunization 0aZebrafish 0amRNA sequencing1 aMyllymäki, Henna1 aRämet, Mika0 tVaccine.g2020 July 31, v. 38, no. 35 p.5685-5694dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.06.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151100002800169245007100197300001600268520151600284592002801800653003001828653001301858653001601871653003001887773013001917856008502047852000902132655001202141IND60545974320221119192052.0160903e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054597432DNAL7 a10.1016/S0187-6236(13)71093-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrett, B.S.1 aEsquivel Longoria, M.I.10aVariability of precipitation and temperature in Guanajuato, Mexico  ap. 521-536.  aVariability of precipitation and temperature was examined on multiple time scales using data from five surface observing stations in the center of Guanajuato state, Mexico, as well as gridded data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Frequency of days with total precipitation exceeding the 90th percentile was not found to have increased from 1979-2011. However, frequency of days with maximum temperature above the 90th percentile more than doubled from 1979-2011, and frequency of days with maximum temperature below the 10th percentile decreased by almost half over the same period, an important result given the scarcity of water resources for the agriculture-based economy. Precipitation within the growing season was found to vary by phase of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), with MJO phases 1-3 associated with above-normal rainfall and MJO phases 4-7 with normal or below normal rainfall. Composite anomalies of precipitation, surface pressure, surface wind, surface temperature, and 700 mbar height showed that days with rainfall in Guanajuato were associated with on-shore, upslope flow, reduced surface temperatures, and reduced potential evaporation. Composites for MJO phases 1-3 and 8 agreed well with these anomalies. Similarly, composite anomalies for days without rainfall in Guanajuato showed warm surface temperatures, broad anticyclonic flow over much of northern Mexico, and enhanced potential evaporation. Composites for MJO phases 4-7 agreed well with these anomalies.  aPublisher supplied data 0aClimatology of Guanajuato 0arainfall 0atemperature 0aintraseasonal variability0 tAtmósfera.g2013 Oct., v. 26 p.521-536dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de Méxicox0187-62367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0187-6236(13)71093-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011700163300001600280520121100296592002801507650002101535650001801556650001601574650001001590650001201600650002601612650002001638650001001658650001101668650001301679650001601692650001401708650002401722650002001746650002101766650001601787650001301803650002601816650002201842700001801864700001801882700001501900700001601915700001101931700001501942773010601957856008102063852000902144655001202153IND60579743020221116141539.0170830e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057974302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-017-9664-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jingtao10aSilencing of SlHB2 Improves Drought, Salt Stress Tolerance, and Induces Stress-Related Gene Expression in Tomato  ap. 578-589.  aAdverse environmental conditions, such as drought, high salinity, and extreme temperature, severely affect the growth and productivity of crop plants. HD-Zip I transcription factors have been described to be involved in stress responses. In the present study, a novel transcription factor gene, SlHB2, from the HD-Zip I subfamily has been cloned from tomato. The expression of SlHB2 was induced by ABA, ACC, MeJA, dehydration, high-salinity, low-temperature, and wounding. To investigate the function of SlHB2 in response to abiotic stress, tomato seedlings of SlHB2-RNAi lines were exposed to drought and salt stresses. Higher levels of chlorophyll and water contents, lower water loss rate and MDA contents were detected in the leaves of transgenic plants compared to those in wild type under stress conditions, which was consistent with the enhanced tolerance of SlHB2-RNAi lines to drought and salt stresses. Significant up-regulation of multiple stress-related genes was also observed in the RNAi lines under normal and/or abiotic stresses. Taken together, the results suggest that the transcription factor SlHB2 acts as a negative regulator in the drought and high-salinity stress signaling pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aabscisic acid 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants1 aChen, Guoping1 aYin, Wencheng1 aCui, Baolu1 aYu, Xiaohui1 aLu, Yu1 aHu, Zongli0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2017 Sept., v. 36, no. 3 p.578-589dSpringer USx0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-017-9664-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264500001500280520155100295592002801846650002201874650001901896650001101915650001401926650001201940650001001952650001101962650002001973650001801993650001202011650002002023653001102043700001902054700002002073700002002093700002202113700003502135700002502170773010602195856008102301852000902382655001202391IND60579743220221116141617.0170830e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057974322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-017-9665-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSales, Luciana10aSalt Tolerance in Apple Seedlings is Affected by an Inhibitor of ABA 8′-Hydroxylase CYP707A  ap. 643-650.  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of an ABA 8′-hydroxylase inhibitor, (±)abscinazole-E2B (Abz-E2B), were examined in “Fuji” apple seedlings exposed to sodium chloride (NaCl). Water potential, stomata aperture, and endogenous ABA, proline, and sodium (Na⁺) levels were analyzed, along with expression of the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxigenase (MdNCED) and ABA 8′-hydroxylase (MdCYP707A) genes. Water potential and stomatal aperture in the leaves treated with Abz-E2B and NaCl (Abz-E2B⁺NaCl⁺ group) were lower than those in the untreated controls, but remained higher than those in the leaves treated with NaCl alone (Abz-E2B⁻NaCl⁺ group). Endogenous ABA levels were higher in the Abz-E2B⁺NaCl⁺ leaves at 4 days after treatment, whereas those in the Abz-E2B⁻NaCl⁺ leaves increased with time and peaked at 12 days after treatment. Expressions of the MdNCED1 and MdNCED2 genes remained lower in Abz-E2B⁺NaCl⁺ compared with Abz-E2B⁻NaCl⁺ leaves, especially at 12 days after treatment. Proline levels increased sharply at 100-mM NaCl, and Na⁺ levels increased with time. The Na⁺ concentrations in the Abz-E2B⁻NaCl⁺ leaves increased fourfold compared to those in the Abz-E2B⁺NaCl⁺ leaves. The expressions of MdCYP707A1 and MdCYP707A2 were higher in Abz-E2B⁺NaCl⁺ at 4 days, but declined at 12 days. The present data suggest that the increased endogenous ABA during the early stages of Fuji apple cultivation under salinity-stress conditions might be a good approach to prevent long-lasting damage and allow plants to recover.  aPublisher supplied data 3astomatal movement 3asalt tolerance 3aapples 3aseedlings 3aproline 3agenes 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3aabscisic acid 3astomata 3awater potential 0aleaves1 aOhara, Hitoshi1 aOhkawa, Katsuya1 aSaito, Takanori1 aTodoroki, Yasushi1 aV.

Therefore, quantitative analyses are required to identify subtle perturbations in the pattern and to test dynamic modeling hypotheses using biological measurements. We developed an online framework, designated Leaf Image Analysis Interface (LIMANI), in which venation patterns are automatically segmented and measured on dark‐field images. Image segmentation may be manually corrected through use of an interactive interface, allowing supervision and rectification steps in the automated image analysis pipeline and ensuring high‐fidelity analysis. This online approach is advantageous for the user in terms of installation, software updates, computer load and data storage. The framework was used to study vascular differentiation during leaf development and to analyze the venation pattern in transgenic lines with contrasting cellular and leaf size traits. The results show the evolution of vascular traits during leaf development, suggest a self‐organizing mechanism for leaf venation patterning, and reveal a tight balance between the number of end‐points and branching points within the leaf vascular network that does not depend on the leaf developmental stage and cellular content, but on the leaf position on the rosette. These findings indicate that development of LIMANI improves understanding of the interaction between vascular patterning and leaf growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adevelopmental stages 3adynamic models 3adynamic testing 3aevolution 3aimage analysis 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3aquantitative analysis 2aArabidopsisxgrowth & development 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assistedxmethods 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgrowth & development 2aSoftware 2aUser-Computer Interface1 aVan Haerenborgh, Dirk1 aVan Cauwenbergh, Caroline1 aMerks, Roeland M.

In Illinois alone this industry has created an economic impact around $320 million (MKF, 2009). The presence of a distinguishing terroir is one of the prerequisites for the establishment of a federally recognized American Viticultural Area (AVA). Wineries in the U.S. are using these geographic designations and labels to differentiate their wines and increase the consumers' confidence (Love, 1997). The TTB granted the Shawnee Hills, located in southern Illinois, this designation at their request in 2006. The goal of this research is to determine the economic impact of a regional designation on a wine-producing region. The next step in the discovery of this goal is to examine less recognized wine-producing regions with an established AVA designation and a wine culture in place. We have chosen two California AVAs, Lodi and the Central Coast AVAs. Using a regression model we have attempted to discover the source of these regions' growth in grower return. Our results show the significance of achieving an AVA status, and the formation of regional quality wine standards program for that AVA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aeconomic impact 3aissues and policy 3aregression analysis 3aviticulture 3awine grapes 3awine industry 3awines 3aCalifornia 3aIllinois 0aEconomic return 0aGrape production 0aAmerican Viticultural Areas1 aRendleman, C.

Nevertheless, insect sensory systems, such as the auditory system, need to function effectively over a wide range of temperatures, as sudden changes of up to 10 °C or more are common. We investigated the performance of auditory receptor neurons and properties of the tympanal membrane of Locusta migratoria in response to temperature changes. Intracellular recordings of receptors at two temperatures (21 and 28 °C) revealed a moderate increase in spike rate with a mean Q10 of 1.4. With rising temperature, the spike rate–intensity–functions exhibited small decreases in thresholds and expansions of the dynamic range, while spike durations decreased. Tympanal membrane displacement, investigated using microscanning laser vibrometry, exhibited a small temperature effect, with a Q10 of 1.2. These findings suggest that locusts are affected by shifts in temperature at the periphery of the auditory pathway, but the effects on spike rate, sensitivity, and tympanal membrane displacement are small. Robust encoding of acoustic signals by only slightly temperature-dependent receptor neurons and almost temperature-independent tympanal membrane properties might enable locusts and grasshoppers to reliably identify sounds in spite of changes of their body temperature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLocusta migratoria 3aacoustics 3aambient temperature 3aanimals 3abody temperature changes 3agrasshoppers 3alocusts 3amuscles 3aneurons 3areceptors1 aGordon, Shira D.1 aWindmill, James F.

In total, 432 South-African consumers (aged 35.2 ± 12.3 years) consumed a full portion of a chicken stew meal once at a central location. Four stock cube powders varying in salt content were used to prepare chicken stews: 1) no reduction – 2013 Na level; regular salt level as currently available on the South African market (24473 mg Na/100 g), 2) salt reduction smaller than 2016 level, i.e. 10%-reduced (22025 mg Na/100 g), 3) 2016 salt level, as per regulatory prescriptions (18000 mg Na/100 g), 4) 2019 salt level, as per regulatory prescriptions (13000 mg Na/100 g). Consumers were randomly allocated to consume one of the four meals. Liking, salt taste perception, and use of table salt and pepper were measured. Chicken stews prepared with reduced-salt stock powders were equally well-liked as chicken stews with the current salt level. Moreover, a gradual reduction of the salt in the chicken stews resulted in a reduced salt intake, up to an average of 19% for the total group compared to the benchmark 2013 Na level stew. However, 19% of consumers compensated by adding salt back to full compensation in some cases. More salt was added with increased reductions of salt in the meals, even to the point of full compensation. Further investigation into the impacts of nutrition communication and education about salt reduction on salt taste perception and use is needed. This research provides new consumer insights on salt use and emphasises the need for consumer-focused behaviour change approaches, in addition to reformulation of products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3achickens 3aeducation 3amarkets 3anutrition 3apepper 3apowders 3asalt content 3asodium 3astews 3atable salt 3ataste 3aSouth Africa 0aSalt reduction 0aChicken stew 0aConsumer liking 0aMeals1 aZandstra, E.H.1 aSayed, N.1 aWentzel-Viljoen, E.0 tAppetite.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 96 p.383-390dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2015.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015400174300001800328500001500346520170600361592002802067650002002095650002102115650001602136650001802152650002102170650002302191650002602214650003102240650004402271650001102315650000702326650000902333650002102342650001602363650002302379650003302402650001702435650001702452653001302469700002402482700002502506700002202531773010502553856004802658852000902706655001202715IND50064539720221118074217.0130403e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006453972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-011-0584-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTongnuanchan, Phakawat10aProperties and Stability of Protein-based Films from Red Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) Protein Isolate Incorporated with Antioxidant during Storage  ap. 1113-1126.  a2019-12-06  aFilm from fish protein isolate (FPI) from red tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) muscle prepared at pH 3 and incorporated with 100 ppm Trolox (FPIT film) was prepared and characterized in comparison with film prepared from unwashed mince film (UWM film) during storage of 40 days at room temperature (28–32°C). FPIT film had higher tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) but lower water vapor permeability (WVP) than UWM film (p < 0.05). During the storage, FPIT film had much lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value than UWM film. Furthermore, FPIT was more transparent and had no yellow discoloration, as evidenced by no change in b* and ΔE* values during the storage of 40 days. Both UWM and FPIT films were stabilized mainly by hydrogen bond, followed by hydrophobic interaction, disulfide bond, and nondisulfide covalent bond. Fourier transforms infrared spectra indicated that FPIT film contained the lower amount of lipids with the lower amplitude of amide B band, compared with UWM film. Higher degradation temperature (Td) was observed in FPIT film, indicating a greater protein–protein interaction in film matrix. FPIT film had smoother surface and cross-section than UWM film. After 40 days of storage, both films had the increase in TS and Td but lower EAB, WVP, and protein solubility. This was more pronounced in UWM film and was associated with the formation of nondisulfide covalent bond in the film network, most likely mediated by the interaction between protein and lipid oxidation products via Maillard reaction. Thus, film from FPI incorporated with antioxidant had the improved mechanical and physical properties without yellow discoloration.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisulfide bonds 3aprotein isolates 3awater vapor 3adiscoloration 3atensile strength 3alipid peroxidation 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aMaillard reaction products 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3alipids 3apH 3afish 3ahydrogen bonding 3atemperature 3aprotein solubility 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aantioxidants 3apermeability 0aproteins1 aBenjakul, Soottawat1 aProdpran, Thummanoon1 aSongtipya, Ponusa0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 May, v. 6, no. 5 p.1113-1126dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-011-0584-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245004500170300001600215520121400231592002801445650001001473650000901483650001601492650001001508650004401518650001401562650001601576773012501592856007901717852000901796655001201805IND60312894620221119205214.0150714e20140829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031289462DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12587852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoungman, Randall E.10aGlimpsing glass structure under pressure  ap. 998-999.  aArchaeologists suggest that the earliest known use of glass, natural obsidian, dates to the Stone Age, with extensive “modern” utilization as early as ∼12,500 BCE (1). The first historical appearance of synthetic glass is around ∼5000 BCE, where it was used as a glaze on clay and stone beads (2). Today, glass has broad uses in technology, architecture, packaging, and art. Throughout the technological (and artistic) advances in inorganic glasses, temperature has remained the single most important variable, controlling glass formation and playing a critical role in the short-range atomic structure of these disordered solids. On page 1027 of this issue, Edwards et al. (3) present findings on glass structure where pressure is the extrinsic variable. Using a novel nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methodology, they measured the boron-11 NMR spectrum of a borosilicate glass as a function of pressure in situ, in contrast to the more common postcompression analyses of glass. Their findings, augmented with ab initio calculations, demonstrate deformation of planar BO ₃ triangles, a key feature in boron-containing glasses, that leads to their eventual conversion to fourfold coordinated boron.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3aclay 3adeformation 3aglass 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apackaging 3atemperature0 tScience.g2014 Aug. 29, v. 345, no. 6200 p.998-999dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12587853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245014300186300001600329500001500345520152500360592002801885650002601913650000901939650001101948650001601959650001101975650002201986650002002008650001902028650002602047650001802073650001202091653001302103700002002116700001702136700002402153773008302177856008102260852000902341655001202350IND60081145620221120025836.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008114562DNAL7 a249236762pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-014-2098-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGesell, Andreas10aCharacterization of an apple TT2-type R2R3 MYB transcription factor functionally similar to the poplar proanthocyanidin regulator PtMYB134  ap. 497-511.  a2019-12-06  aMAIN CONCLUSION : The apple MdMYB9 gene encodes a positive regulator of proanthocyanidin synthesis that activates anthocyanidin reductase promoters from apple and poplar via interaction with basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The regulation of proanthocyanidins (PAs, condensed tannins) is of great importance in food plants due to the many benefits of PAs in the human diet. Two candidate flavonoid MYB regulators, MdMYB9 and MdMYB11, were cloned from apple (Malus × domestica) based on their similarity to known MYB PA regulators. Transcript accumulation of both MdMYB9 and MdMYB11 was induced by high light and wounding, similar to the poplar (Populus spp) PA regulator PtMYB134. In transient activation assays with various basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) co-regulators, MdMYB9 activated apple and poplar anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) promoters, while MdMYB11 showed no activity. Potential transcription factor binding elements were found within several ANR promoters, and the importance of the bHLH binding site (E-box) on ANR promoter activation was demonstrated via mutational analysis. The ability of MdMYB9 and PtMYB134 to reciprocally activate ANR promoters from both apple and poplar and to partner with heterologous bHLH co-factors from these plants confirms the high degree of conservation of PA regulatory complexes across species. The similarity in apple and poplar PA regulation suggests that regulatory genes from poplar could be effectively employed for metabolic engineering of the PA pathway in apple.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3adiet 3aapples 3afood plants 3ahumans 3aproanthocyanidins 3aregulator genes 3aanthocyanidins 3ametabolic engineering 3abinding sites 3aPopulus 0aproteins1 aYoshida, Kazuko1 aTran, Lan T.1 aConstabel, C.

In 466 elderly subjects residing in communities in Seoul, Korea, we examined 16 constituents, seven sources, and total mass concentrations of PM2.5. We measured the BP, heart rate (HR), and indices of heart rate variability (HRV), such as the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (rMSSD), and two frequency-domain variables (low frequency [LF] and high frequency [HF]). We used linear mixed effects models to assess the association of PM2.5 constituents and sources with cardiovascular markers.BP, HR, and rMSSD were associated with concentration of total mass of PM2.5. For each increase of the interquartile range in PM2.5 constituents, systolic and diastolic BP, and HR increased by 2.1–3.3mmHg, 1.2–2.3mmHg, and 1.2–1.9bpm, respectively, while the rMSSD, LF, and HF decreased by 8.1–9.3%, 16.6%, and 20.4%, respectively. Particularly, elemental carbon, sulfate, ammonium, lead, and strontium in the PM2.5 constituents and emissions from oil combustion and incineration were associated with increased BP, HR, and decreased HRV.Our results suggest an association between specific PM2.5 constituents and vascular and cardiac autonomic functions. These findings may provide supportive evidence for developing a pollution reduction plan to prevent cardiovascular diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aautonomic nervous system 3ablood pressure 3acarbon 3acardiovascular diseases 3acombustion 3aelderly 3aemissions 3aepidemiological studies 3aheart rate 3alead 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3aoils 3aparticulates 3apollution 3astatistical analysis 3astrontium 3asulfates 3aKorean Peninsula 0aAT 0abpm 0aBMI 0aCr 0aCI 0aCu 0aDBP 0aFe 0aHF 0aHR 0aHRV 0aIQR 0aLF 0aMn 0aNH4+ 0aNi 0aNO3− 0aPb 0aPM2.5 0arMSSD 0aSBP 0aSi 0aSDNN 0aSO42− 0aSr 0aTi 0aUS EPA 0aV 0aZn 0aAir pollution 0aAutonomic nervous system 0aBlood pressure 0aHeart rate 0aParticulate matter1 aBae, Hyun-Joo1 aYi, Seung-Muk1 aPark, EunHa1 aLee, Bo-Eun1 aHong, Yun-Chul0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Dec. 31, v. 607-608 p.847-854dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016100171300001600332520182000348592002802168650002602196650001102222650000902233650001902242650000902261650002402270650002402294653002602318653001002344653000902354653001502363653003902378700001902417700002502436700002002461700002402481700002102505773012002526856008502646852000902731655001202740IND60535282820221119213133.0190401e20140402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053528282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, James S.10aEvaluation of the curative and preventive efficacy of a single oral administration of afoxolaner against cat flea Ctenocephalides felis infestations on dogs  ap. 207-211.  aThe efficacy of orally administered afoxolaner for treatment and prevention of repeated infestations with adult Ctenocephalides felis on dogs was evaluated in two studies after administration of a beef-flavored soft chew. In each study, 32 dogs were divided randomly into four equal groups. Dogs in Groups 1 and 3 were not treated and served as controls. Dogs in Groups 2 and 4 were treated on Day 0 with a combination of chewable tablets to be as close as possible to the minimum therapeutic dose of 2.5mg/kg. All animals were infested experimentally with unfed C. felis (100±5) on Days −1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Flea killing efficacy was evaluated in both studies while, efficacy against flea egg production was assessed in Study 1. Live fleas were counted at 12 (Groups 1 and 2) and 24h (Groups 3 and 4), after treatment or after weekly infestations. In Study 1, flea eggs were collected and counted at either 12 or 24h after each flea infestation on Days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. The results of both studies demonstrate the long lasting and rapid efficacy of afoxolaner against C. felis, when administered as a single oral dose to dogs. For flea counts conducted 24h after treatment or infestation, efficacy was 100% for all time points up to Day 36 in both studies, except for one time point (99.9% on Day 22) for Study 2. For flea counts performed 12h after treatment or infestation, efficacy was ≥95.2% until Day 21 in both studies. Efficacy at 12h was ≥93.0% on Day 35 in Study 1 and ≥89.7% on Day 35 in Study 2. The treated groups had significantly fewer fleas than untreated control dogs in both studies for all flea counts (p=0.003 Study 1, p=0.0006 Study 2). In Study 1, for all egg counts performed at or beyond Day 7, efficacy in egg reduction was >99% for all time points between Days 7 and 35.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenocephalides felis 3aadults 3adogs 3aegg production 3aeggs 3ainsect infestations 3aoral administration 0aCtenocephalides felis 0aFleas 0aDogs 0aAfoxolaner 0aCurative and prophylactic efficacy1 aDumont, Pascal1 aChester, Theodore S.1 aYoung, David R.1 aFourie, Josephus J.1 aLarsen, Diane L.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Apr. 02, v. 201, no. 3-4 p.207-211dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011900170300001600289520149100305592002801796650001201824650002501836650001401861650002701875650001301902650002601915650001101941650001901952651001001971700002301981700002102004700003502025773012002060856004802180852000902228655001202237IND50061844820221117234431.0130320e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006184482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-012-2141-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaiano, Antonietta10aEffects of Cultivars and Location on Quality, Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Activity of Extra-Virgin Olive Oils  ap. 103-111.  aQuality characteristics of extra-virgin olive oils depend on several factors. In order to study the effects of genotype and growing location on olive oil quality, olives from cv. Coratina, Nocellara, Ogliarola, and Peranzana, picked in four locations of the Apulia region (Italy), were crushed by a three-phase system to produce mono-cultivar extra virgin olive oils that were analyzed for acidity, peroxide value, spectrophotometric indices, total phenolic content, phenolic profile and antioxidant activity. The experimental data concerning peroxide value, spectrophotometric indices, phenolic content and profile and antioxidant activity showed great variability among the cultivars grown in the same location and also among the oils produced with olives of the same cultivar but grown in different locations. For each cultivar, no significant differences were found among locations in terms of acidity and ΔK whereas peroxide value, K₂₃₂, and K₂₇₀ differ significantly among locations for both Ogliarola and Peranzana cv. Concerning the phenolic content of Ogliarola cv., no differences were highlighted between the locations whereas the phenolic contents of Peranzana significantly changed as a function of the place of growing. On the basis of these results, the statistical multivariate analysis did not allow the classification into homogeneous groups neither of the oils belonging to the same cultivar nor of those obtained from olives picked in the same location.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3acultivars 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3agenotype 3amultivariate analysis 3aolives 3aperoxide value 3aItaly1 aTerracone, Carmela1 aViggiani, Ilaria1 aDel Nobile, Matteo Alessandro,0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2013 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.103-111dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-012-2141-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008500167300001600252520159300268592002801861650001501889650002101904650003101925650002201956650001301978650001201991650001402003650001802017650001202035650001402047650002002061650002202081650000902103650002002112700002102132700002202153773012802175856008202303852000902385655001202394IND60089334520221118155334.0141102e20110225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008933452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Taro10aRapid induction of REDD1 expression by endurance exercise in rat skeletal muscle  ap. 615-619.  aAn acute bout of exercise induces repression of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle due in part to reduced signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Previous studies have shown that upregulated expression of regulated in DNA damage and development (REDD) 1 and 2 is an important mechanism in the regulation of mTORC1 activity in response to a variety of stresses. This study investigated whether induction of REDD1/2 expression occurs in rat skeletal muscle in response to a burst of endurance exercise. In addition, we determined if ingestion of glucose or branched chain amino acids (BCAA) before exercise changes the expression of REDD1/2 in muscle. Rats ran on a motor-driven treadmill at a speed of 28mmin⁻¹ for 90min, and then the gastrocnemius muscle was removed and analyzed for phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and expression of REDD1/2. Exercise repressed the mTORC1-signaling pathway regardless of the ingestion of nutrients before the exercise, as shown by dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1. In addition, exercise induced the expression of REDD1 mRNA (∼8-fold) and protein (∼3-fold). Exercise-induced expression of REDD1 was not affected by the ingestion of glucose or BCAA. Expression of REDD2 mRNA was not altered by either exercise or nutrients. These findings indicated that enhanced expression of REDD1 may be an important mechanism that could partially explain the downregulation of mTORC1 signaling, and subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle during exercise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3abinding proteins 3abranched chain amino acids 3adephosphorylation 3aexercise 3aglucose 3aingestion 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3anutrients 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3askeletal muscle1 aHasegawa, Kazuya1 aYoshinaga, Mariko0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Feb. 25, v. 405, no. 4 p.615-619dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013500169520173100304592002802035650002202063650000802085650002702093650001902120650002902139650002302168650002102191650001702212650001502229650001902244650001102263650001602274650000702290650001602297650001402313700003202327700002402359700003502383700002202418700003202440773012502472856008402597852000902681655001202690IND60760621520221120095422.0211223e20211121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076062152DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70402712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Gee Hyeun10aSelection of Bacteriocinogenic Bacillus spp. from Traditional Fermented Korean Food Products with Additional Beneficial Properties  aTwo Bacillus spp. isolated from kimchi, Bacillus tequilensis ST816CD and Bacillus subtilis ST830CD, were characterized for their antimicrobial properties and safety. The proteinaceous nature of their inhibitory metabolites was confirmed after exposure to proteolytic enzymes, resulting in partial loss of the antimicrobial effect. This indicated that different non-proteinaceous antimicrobial substances may also be produced by these strains. This hypothesis was later confirmed when genes associated with the production of surfactants were detected in their DNA. The expressed antimicrobial metabolites were not affected by treatment at different temperatures and pH levels, including exposure to selected chemicals. Their strong adherence to susceptible pathogens was not significantly affected by different temperatures, chemicals, or pH values. Both Bacillus strains showed inhibitory activity against clinical and food-associated pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 15313, and some Staphylococcus species. Several genes associated with the production of antimicrobial metabolites were detected, but key virulence and beneficial genes were not present in these strains. Even though only B. tequilensis ST816CD displayed γ-hemolysin production, both selected strains were found to produce gelatinase and biogenic amines, which are considered as either potential virulence- or health-related factors. Moreover, the strains were susceptible to a variety of antibiotics except for the penicillin G [1 IU/disc] resistance of B. tequilensis ST816CD. Both strains showed proteolytic activity. Additionally, both strains showed low hydrophobicity based on bacterial adherence measured by hydrocarbons (n-hexadecane).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDNA 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aStaphylococcus 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacterial adhesion 3abenzylpenicillin 3afermentation 3ahexadecane 3ahydrophobicity 3akimchi 3ametabolites 3apH 3aproteolysis 3avirulence1 aFugaban, Joanna Ivy Irorita1 aDioso, Clarizza May1 aVazquez Bucheli, Jorge Enrique1 aHolzapfel, W.

Improvements made to the setup include a new, more powerful laser, a precision designed turbulence delivery system, an imbedded pressure sensor, and a platform for height adjustability between the laser beam and the turbulence model. The setup was not only able to reproduce previous results exactly but also allowed new data for the turbulence strength Cn2, the Rytov variance (scintillation) and the coherence diameter (Fried’s parameter) to be successfully measured. Analysis of the produced interferograms has been discussed using fast Fourier transforms. The results confirm, within the Kolmogorov regime, that phase and intensity fluctuations increase relative to temperature. The turbulent region exhibited very strong disturbances, in the range of 1.1 × 10-12 m-2/3 to 2.7×10-12 m-2/3. In spite of the strong turbulence strength, scintillation proved otherwise, since the condition for a weak turbulence environment was determined in the laboratory and a low scintillation index was to be expected. This is as a result of the relatively short propagation distances achieved in the laboratory. In the open atmosphere, path lengths extend over vast distances and in order for turbulent effects to be realized, the turbulence model must generate stronger turbulence. The model was, therefore, able to demonstrate its ability to fully quantify and determine the thermal turbulence effects on a propagating laser beam.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRytov variance 0athermal turbulence 0aFried’s parameter 0ascintillation index 0alaser beam propagation 0aturbulence strength1 aChetty, Naven0 tAtmósfera.g2014 Oct., v. 27 p.385-401dElsevier España, S.L.UaUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de Méxicox0187-62367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0187-6236(14)70037-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012400171300001600295520125800311592002801569650001501597650001901612650001401631650001401645650001101659650001601670650001001686650002001696700001701716700001601733700001801749700001901767700002101786773012801807856008201935852000902017655001202026IND60089334620221118155303.0141102e20110225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008933462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarukawa, Masataka10aEvaluation of the bitterness of green tea catechins by a cell-based assay with the human bitter taste receptor hTAS2R39  ap. 620-625.  aCatechins have a broad range of physiological functions and act as the main taste ingredient of green tea. Although catechins show a strong bitterness, the bitter taste receptor for catechins has not been fully understood. The objective of this study was to identify the receptor for the major green tea catechins such as (−)-epicatechin (EC), (−)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg). By the cell-based assay using cultured cells expressing human bitter taste receptor, a clear response of hTAS2R39-expressing cells was observed to 300μM of either ECg or EGCg, which elicit a strong bitterness in humans. The response of hTAS2R39-expressing cells to ECg was the strongest among the tested catechins, followed by EGCg. Because the cellular response to EC and EGC is much weaker than those of ECg and EGCg, galloyl groups was strongly supposed to be involved in the bitter intensity. This finding is similar to the observations of taste intensity obtained from a human sensory study. Our results suggest the participation of hTAS2R39 in the detection of catechins in humans, indicating the possibility that bitterness of tea catechins can be evaluated by using cells expressing hTAS2R39.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitterness 3acultured cells 3aflavanols 3agreen tea 3ahumans 3aingredients 3ataste 3ataste receptors1 aNoga, Chiaki1 aUeno, Yohei1 aSato, Tsutomu1 aMisaka, Takumi1 aWatanabe, Tatsuo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Feb. 25, v. 405, no. 4 p.620-625dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008400177300001600261520259800277592002802875653002002903653002202923653001402945653002202959700002302981773012903004856008503133852000903218655001203227IND60545975220221119192132.0160903e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054597522DNAL7 a10.1016/S0187-6236(14)70039-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalekinezhad, Hossein10aRegional frequency analysis of daily rainfall extremes using L-moments approach  ap. 411-427.  aDaily extreme precipitation values are among environmental events with the most disastrous consequences for human society. Information on the magnitudes and frequencies of extreme precipitations is essential for sustainable water resources management, planning for weather-related emergencies, and design of hydraulic structures. In the present study, regional frequency analysis of maximum daily rainfalls was investigated for Golestan province located in the northeastern Iran. This study aimed to find appropriate regional frequency distributions for maximum daily rainfalls and predict the return values of extreme rainfall events (design rainfall depths) for the future. L-moment regionalization procedures coupled with an index rainfall method were applied to maximum rainfall records of 47 stations across the study area. Due to complex geographic and hydro-climatological characteristics of the region, an important research issue focused on breaking down the large area into homogeneous and coherent sub-regions. The study area was divided into five homogeneous regions, based on the cluster analysis of site characteristics and tests for the regional homogeneity. The goodness-of-fit results indicated that the best fitting distribution is different for individual homogeneous regions. The difference may be a result of the distinctive climatic and geographic conditions. The estimated regional quantiles and their accuracy measures produced by Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty as measured by the RMSE values and 90% error bounds is relatively low when return periods are less than 100 years. But, for higher return periods, rainfall estimates should be treated with caution. More station years, either from longer records or more stations in the regions, would be required for rainfall estimates above T=100 years. It was found from the analyses that, the index rainfall (at-site average maximum rainfall) can be estimated reasonably well as a function of mean annual precipitation in Golestan province. Index rainfalls combined with the regional growth curves, can be used to estimate design rainfalls at ungauged sites. Overall, it was found that cluster analysis together with the L-moments based regional frequency analysis technique could be applied successfully in deriving design rainfall estimates for northeastern Iran. The approach utilized in this study and the findings are of great scientific and practical merit, particularly for the purpose of planning for weather-related emergencies and design of hydraulic engineering structures.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRegionalization 0arainfall analysis 0aL-moments 0anortheastern Iran1 aZare-Garizi, Arash0 tAtmósfera.g2014 Oct., v. 27 p.411-427dElsevier España, S.L.UaUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de Méxicox0187-62367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0187-6236(14)70039-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012600171300001400297520090300311592002801214650000801242650003201250650001901282650001201301650001001313650001901323650001101342650002001353650001401373650000901387650001601396650000901412650001801421650001201439651001101451653003201462653000901494653001601503653000801519653000901527700001301536700001601549700002001565700001401585773011801599856008501717852000901802655001201811IND60535283120221119213253.0190401e20140616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053528312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzostakowska, B.10aFirst finding of Echinococcus multilocularis DNA in soil: Preliminary survey in Varmia-Masuria Province, northeast Poland  ap. 73-79.  aThe aim of this study was to estimate the presence of Echinococcus multilocularis DNA in the soil in rural areas of Varmia-Masuria Province, Poland, which is the region with the highest recorded number of human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) cases in this country. In total, 62 soil samples were analyzed. Samples were collected in forests near the lairs of foxes, as well as from arable fields, kitchen gardens and farmyards. The parasite DNA was detected in 11.3% of the samples. This study is the first environmental survey of the presence of E. multilocularis DNA in soil. The results demonstrate that the soil can be a direct source of human infections. These results should motivate the appropriate institutions to introduce informative and educational campaigns about the risk of infection, as well as developing methods for protecting the population, especially those living in at-risk areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aechinococcosis 3aforests 3afoxes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3akitchen gardens 3aparasites 3arisk 3arural areas 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3asurveys 3aPoland 0aEchinococcus multilocularis 0aEggs 0aEnvironment 0aPCR 0aSoil1 aLass, A.1 aKostyra, K.1 aPietkiewicz, H.1 aMyjak, P.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 June 16, v. 203, no. 1-2 p.73-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013100171300001600302500001500318520214000333592002802473650001502501650002802516650001802544650001002562650002102572650001202593650001002605650000802615650002102623650001102644650002102655650000902676650001502685650002002700650002902720650001602749650001402765650001502779650000702794650001002801650002602811650002402837651001002861653002502871700002402896700002302920700002502943773011202968856008303080852000903163655001203172IND50060335020221122225702.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006033502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2012.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSperanza, Barbara10aShelf life definition for Italian anchovies inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis  ap. 171-180.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper reports on the optimization of marinated anchovies, inoculated with two probiotic strains (Lactobacillus plantarum and Bidifobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). The research was divided into three phases: a) choice of the hurdles for the marinating brine; b) brine optimization; and c) production of functional anchovies. After studying the effects of pH and NaCl as typical hurdles of brine, the effect of citrus extract towards the probiotics was assessed; this antimicrobial agent was chosen as an additional hurdle for product storage. Process optimization, conducted through the use of a centroid design, revealed that the optimal composition for marinating brine was the following: 2% of acetic acid, 10% of NaCl and 200ppm of citrus extract. Then, anchovies were inoculated with probiotics, marinated, packed under different conditions (air, vacuum, in oil and in a diluted brine) and stored at 4°C. During 21days, analyses were performed to evaluate quality attributes (odor, color, texture and overall quality) as well as the survival of the tested strains. The limiting factors for shelf life definition resulted to be sensory scores (odor in particular); the best sample was that packed in diluted brine, as it retained the sensory quality at the maximum level for at least 6–10days and showed a shelf life longer than 21days. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: This paper proposes a new kind of functional food, based on marinated anchovies. The new non-dairy functional food may both contribute to a regular assumption of probiotics in individuals with lactose intolerance or with a diet lacking milk-derived products and to expand the range of health-promoting foods. By increasing the amount of functional foods in the diet, will be easier for consumers to achieve the optimal supply of probiotics able to guarantee a healthy bacterial gut flora. Moreover, anchovy is a low cost product in Southern Italy; therefore the preparation of a functional dish with this kind of raw material could be a promising way for small-scale producers and very attractive for consumers, due to mild treatments used for its stabilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3ashelf life 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3araw materials 3aodors 3adigestive system 3atexture 3aflora 3aair 3amilk substitutes 3aCitrus 3afunctional foods 3aoils 3amarinating 3asodium chloride 3aBifidobacterium animalis 3aacetic acid 3aanchovies 3aprobiotics 3apH 3acolor 3aanti-infective agents 3alactose intolerance 3aItaly 0aantimicrobial agents1 aBevilacqua, Antonio1 aSinigaglia, Milena1 aCorbo, Maria Rosaria0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2012 Oct., v. 16 p.171-180dElsevier Ltdx1466-85647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2012.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013600165300001800301520125900319592002801578650002101606650001701627650001301644650001501657650002001672650001501692650001001707650001201717650004301729650001101772650003601783650003601819650001201855700001901867700001801886700001701904700001501921700001601936700001501952773011201967856008102079852000902160655001202169IND60519616320221117233851.0160506e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051961632DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1959-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yunping10aEfficient Production of Hydroxylated Human-Like Collagen Via the Co-Expression of Three Key Genes in Escherichia coli Origami (DE3)  ap. 1458-1470.  aMature collagen is abundant in human bodies and very valuable for a range of industrial and medical applications. The biosynthesis of mature collagen requires post-translational modifications to increase the stability of collagen triple helix structure. By co-expressing the human-like collagen (HLC) gene with human prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) and D-arabinono-1, 4-lactone oxidase (ALO) in Escherichia coli, we have constructed a prokaryotic expression system to produce the hydroxylated HLC. Then, five different media, as well as the induction conditions were investigated with regard to the soluble expression of such protein. The results indicated that the highest soluble expression level of target HLC obtained in shaking flasks was 49.55 ± 0.36 mg/L, when recombinant cells were grew in MBL medium and induced by 0.1 mM IPTG at the middle stage of exponential growth phase. By adopting the glucose feeding strategy, the expression level of target HLC can be improved up to 260 mg/L in a 10 L bench-top fermentor. Further, HPLC analyses revealed that more than 10 % of proline residues in purified HLC were successfully hydroxylated. The present work has provided a solid base for the large-scale production of hydroxylated HLC in E. coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abiosynthesis 3acollagen 3acontainers 3afeeding methods 3afermenters 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3apost-translational modification 3aprocollagen-proline dioxygenase 3aproline1 aYang, Xiuliang1 aHang, Baojian1 aLi, Jiangtao1 aHuang, Lei1 aHuang, Feng1 aXu, Zhinan0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2016 Apr., v. 178, no. 7 p.1458-1470dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1959-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011800165500001900283520118400302592002801486650001501514650001601529650001601545650001801561650000901579650000701588650001901595653001901614653001101633653002701644653002301671653000701694653000701701653000601708653000701714700001601721700001601737700001601753700001201769700001401781773010201795856008601897852000901983655001201992IND60700973220221119091403.0200824e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070097322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1061452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yan10aInterfacial and emulsifying properties of β-conglycinin/pectin mixtures at the oil/water interface: Effect of pH  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe influence of pH (2–7) on the interfacial and emulsifying properties of β-conglycinin/pectin (7S/PC) mixtures was investigated. At pH 2–3 (pH < pI of 7S), 7S/PC mixtures had large size and low Zeta potential, leading to slower adsorption kinetics. When treated by deformation amplitude in the non-linear region, Lissajous plots of 7S/PC mixtures at pH 3 suggested that PC might adsorb onto the interfaces through competitive adsorption as proved by viscous behavior response. These combinations effects resulted in poor emulsification properties and emulsions instability. At pH = 5–7 (pH > pI of 7S), 7S/PC mixtures had smaller size and higher Zeta-potential values, leading to the rapid adsorption. Lissajous plots of 7S/PC mixtures at pH 6 suggested that 7S almost irreversibly adsorbed onto the interface as proved by a purely elastic response. Particle sizes of emulsions stabilized by 7S/PC mixtures at pH 6–7 remained unchanged due to that PC provided electrostatic and steric stabilization. In summary, pH had significant effects on the interactions between 7S and PC, and thereby influenced the interfacial and emulsifying properties of their mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adeformation 3aemulsifying 3ahydrocolloids 3aoils 3apH 3azeta potential 0aβ-Conglycinin 0aPectin 0aInterfacial properties 0aEmulsion stability 0a7S 0aPC 0aE 0aπ1 aZhang, Zhen1 aAhmed Taha,1 aChen, Yijie1 aHu, Hao1 aPan, Siyi0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Dec., v. 109 p.106145-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1061453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03874naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010700170300001600277520189200293592002802185650002202213650001902235650001302254650002602267650001202293650001202305650001902317650001402336650001802350650001602368650001502384650001402399650002102413650002002434650001502454650001502469650001402484650001802498650001802516650001102534650001902545650002402564650001202588650001802600650001502618650001202633650001302645650001102658651001002669653002102679653001502700653002102715653001802736653002602754700005302780700002502833700001902858700001802877700001902895700001602914700001402930773012302944856008803067852000903155655001203164IND60573364120221116154958.0181015e20171231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057336412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Liming10aVertical patterns and controls of soil nutrients in alpine grassland: Implications for nutrient uptake  ap. 855-864.  aVertical patterns and determinants of soil nutrients are critical to understand nutrient cycling in high-altitude ecosystems; however, they remain poorly understood in the alpine grassland due to lack of systematic field observations. In this study, we examined vertical distributions of soil nutrients and their influencing factors within the upper 1m of soil, using data of 68 soil profiles surveyed in the alpine grassland of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks decreased with depth in both alpine meadow (AM) and alpine steppe (AS), but remain constant along the soil profile in alpine swamp meadow (ASM). Total phosphorus, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺ stocks slightly increased with depth in ASM. K⁺ stock decreased with depth, while Na⁺ stock increased slightly with depth among different vegetation types; however, SO4²⁻ and Cl⁻ stocks remained relatively uniform throughout different depth intervals in the alpine grassland. Except for SOC and TN, soil nutrient stocks in the top 20cm soils were significantly lower in ASM compared to those in AM and AS. Correlation analyses showed that SOC and TN stocks in the alpine grassland positively correlated with vegetation coverage, soil moisture, clay content, and silt content, while they negatively related to sand content and soil pH. However, base cation stocks revealed contrary relationships with those environmental variables compared to SOC and TN stocks. These correlations varied between vegetation types. In addition, no significant relationship was detected between topographic factors and soil nutrients. Our findings suggest that plant cycling and soil moisture primarily control vertical distributions of soil nutrients (e.g. K) in the alpine grassland and highlight that vegetation types in high-altitude permafrost regions significantly affect soil nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine grasslands 3aalpine meadows 3aaltitude 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acalcium 3acations 3achemical bases 3achlorides 3aclay fraction 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3amagnesium 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3apermafrost 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asand fraction 3asilt fraction 3asodium 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asteppes 3asulfates 3aswamps 3aChina 0aNutrient cycling 0aPermafrost 0aAlpine grassland 0aSoil nutrient 0aQinghai-Tibet plateau1 aZhao, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4306-63011 aWu, Xiaodong,d1979-1 aFang, Hongbing1 aZhao, Yonghua1 aYue, Guangyang1 aLiu, Guimin1 aChen, Hao0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Dec. 31, v. 607-608 p.855-864dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009700175520170200272592002801974650003302002650003002035650002002065650001702085650001302102650001502115650002602130650001302156650001402169650001502183650002502198650001102223650001402234650001802248650001602266650001702282650001502299651003302314651002202347653001502369653001302384653002502397653002802422700002402450700002102474700002302495700001702518700001902535700001902554700001602573700002202589700001602611700002402627773010702651856008502758852000902843655001202852IND60674872320221121225931.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067487232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1134862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinnathamby, Sumathy12aA sensitivity analysis of pesticide concentrations in California Central Valley vernal pools  aVernal pools are ephemeral wetlands that provide critical habitat to many listed species. Pesticide fate in vernal pools is poorly understood because of uncertainties in the amount of pesticide entering these ecosystems and their bioavailability throughout cycles of wet and dry periods. The Pesticide Water Calculator (PWC), a model used for the regulation of pesticides in the US, was used to predict surface water and sediment pore water pesticide concentrations in vernal pool habitats. The PWC model (version 1.59) was implemented with deterministic and probabilistic approaches and parameterized for three agricultural vernal pool watersheds located in the San Joaquin River basin in the Central Valley of California. Exposure concentrations for chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion were simulated. The deterministic approach used default values and professional judgment to calculate point values of estimated concentrations. In the probabilistic approach, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were conducted across the full input parameter space with a sensitivity analysis that quantified the parameter contribution to model prediction uncertainty. Partial correlation coefficients were used as the primary sensitivity metric for analyzing model outputs. Conditioned daily sensitivity analysis indicates curve number (CN) and the universal soil loss equation (USLE) parameters as the most important environmental parameters. Therefore, exposure estimation can be improved efficiently by focusing parameterization efforts on these driving processes, and agricultural pesticide inputs in these critical habitats can be reduced by best management practices focused on runoff and sediment reductions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3abest management practices 3abioavailability 3achlorpyrifos 3adiazinon 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3amalathion 3aprediction 3aprobability analysis 3arunoff 3asediments 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3avernal pools 3awatersheds 3aCentral Valley of California 3aSan Joaquin River 0aPesticides 0aExposure 0aSensitivity analysis 0aAgricultural watersheds1 aMinucci, Jeffrey M.1 aDenton, Debra L.1 aRaimondo, Sandy M.1 aOliver, Leah1 aYuan, Yongping1 aYoung, Dirk F.1 aHook, James1 aPitchford, Ann M.1 aWaits, Eric1 aPurucker, S.

The content of neutral detergent fiber in treatment 1 and 2 were adjusted to 20% and 40%, respectively. The total tract digestibility of nutrients and the degradation efficiency of fecal microorganisms to different types of fiber were determined. Results showed that the composition and nutritional level of Diqing Tibetan pig original diet differed greatly in different seasons. The content of crude fiber in the original diet was as high as 12.3% and the neutral detergent fiber was 32.5% in April, while the content of crude fiber was 4.9% and the neutral detergent fiber was 13.3% in October. With the increase of dietary fiber level, the total tract apparent digestibility of dry matter, crude fiber, crude protein, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, ether extract, and organic matter decreased significantly (p < 0.05), and the contents of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, and isovaleric acid in the feces were also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced. The ability of Diqing Tibetan pig fecal microorganisms to degrade neutral detergent fiber was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than “Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire” pig. In addition, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the degradation efficiency of the same type of fiber between NDF-20 and NDF-40 groups. Our results strongly suggested that Diqing Tibetan pigs have the potential to efficiently utilize fiber, and their unique intestinal microbial composition is the main reason for their efficient utilization of dietary fiber.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aTibetan (swine breed) 3aacetic acid 3aacid detergent fiber 3aadults 3abutyric acid 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3adietary fiber 3adigestibility 3afeces 3afermentation 3ahabitats 3aintestines 3aisobutyric acid 3alandraces 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aorganic matter 3apropionic acid 3aswine 3avaleric acid1 aWang, Gang 1 aZhou, Junyan 1 aYang, Yuting 1 aPan, Hongbin 1 aZeng, Xiangfang 1 aQiao, Shiyan 0 tFermentation.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70402753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245005000160300001400210520251900224592002802743650002602771650001902797650001802816650001402834650001202848650001202860650002402872650001402896650001202910650001502922650003002937650001702967650001102984650001602995650000903011650001903020650001003039700002103049773009403070856007103164852000903235655001203244IND60518881120221122035821.0160419e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051888112DNAL7 a10.2307/19387172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Bruce D.13aAn Experimental Test of Plant Strategy Theory  ap. 15-29.  aTwo of the central hypotheses of the triangular model of primary plant strategies were tested by a movel technique involving seven grasses of contrasted ecology grown in pure stands and an additive mixture on an experimental matrix of crossed gradients of mineral nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. The experimental design allowed reductions in vegetative and reproductive vigor resulting from interspecific competition to be distinguished from those arising from direct effects of nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. It was also possible to determine the extent to which competitive suppression of each species was affected by stress and disturbance. In isolation, all species showed maximum vegetative and reproductive vigor at high soil fertility and low disturbance. In the mixture, absolute reductions in biomass and flowering due to competition were greatest at high soil fertility and low disturbance, and the species of most extreme strategy became restricted to areas of the matrix broadly consistent with those predicted by strategy classification. When standardized for differences in biomass in pure stands, the effect of competition remained relatively constant across the stress—disturbance matrix for all species except Poa annua, which was less restricted by competition at high intensities of stress. There were marked and consistent differences between species in their susceptibility to competition. At both high and low soil fertility, two species of natural occurrence on infertile soils (Festuca ovina, Bromus erectus) were poor competitors relative to Arrhenatherum elatius, a widespread dominant of productive grasslands. The effect of competition was least severe on flowering of annuals in low—stress portions of the matrix. If competition is assessed simply as the percentage of reduction in biomass between pure and mixed stands it appears that competition intensity is constant across different intensities of stress and disturbances. However, observations that maximum reductions in biomass coincided with low stress and low disturbance, that competition decreased in importance as a factor reducing yield and flowering (relative to stress and disturbance) as stress and disturbance intensities increased, and that there was a consistently inferior competitive ability of plants from infertile soils at all positions on the matrix all support the hypothesis that competition declines in importance as a vegetation determinant in the vegetation of infertile soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArrhenatherum elatius 3aBromus erectus 3aFestuca ovina 3aPoa annua 3aannuals 3abiomass 3aexperimental design 3aflowering 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ainterspecific competition 3amixed stands 3amodels 3apure stands 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3avigor1 aGrime, J.

Results showed a decrease in soybean yield under P deficiency, but the yield reduction of genotype L13 was much less than that of T3. The grain yield of L13 was 40.5, 64.2 and 141.6% higher than that of T3, under 0.5, 0.25 and 0.0 mM P treatments, respectively. Genotype L13 activated sugar metabolism in roots and released H⁺ into the root hair zone to acidify the rhizosphere to resist P deficiency. P deficiency induced an increase in aspartic acid concentrations in root, the increase being substantially greater in the P efficient genotype. These findings suggested that the P-efficient genotype L13 has established more responsive mechanisms and better countermeasures against P deficiency. The findings of this study will be useful in further research aimed at optimizing soybean responses to P deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aaspartic acid 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ametabolism 3aphosphorus 3aphysiological response 3aprotons 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aroot hairs 3asand 3asoil 3asoybeans 3asugars1 aWang, H.1 aShan, Y.

The release of hazardous wastes and other pollutants from these industries increases the potential for contamination in foods in the surrounding area, especially farmed shellfish. This study determined the arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and manganese (Mn) concentrations in the edible flesh of farmed shellfish, including Perna viridis, Meretrix meretrix, and Scapharca inaequivalvis, around the Map Ta Phut area using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results showed that shellfish samples contained high levels of total As [1.84–6.42 mg kg⁻¹wet weight (ww)]. High Mn concentrations were found in P. viridis and M. meretrix, whereas S. inaequivalis contained the highest Cd. Arsenobetaine (AsB) was found to be the major As species in shellfish (>45 % of total As). The in vitro cytotoxicity of these elements was evaluated using human cancer cells (T47D, A549, and Jurkat cells). An observed decrease in cell viability in T47D and Jurkat cells was mainly caused by exposure to inorganic As (iAs) or Mn but not to AsB or Cd. The combined elements (AsB+Mn+Cd) at concentrations predicted to result from the estimated daily intake of shellfish flesh by the local people showed significant cytotoxicity in T47D and Jurkat cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeretrix meretrix 3aPerna viridis 3aScapharca inaequivalvis 3aarsenic 3aaverage daily intake 3acadmium 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afoods 3ahumans 3aindustry 3amanganese 3amass spectrometry 3aneoplasm cells 3apeople 3apollutants 3ashellfish 3awastes 3aThailand1 aSiripriwon, Pantaree1 aNookabkaew, Sumontha1 aSuriyo, Tawit1 aSatayavivad, Jutamaad0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2015 Jan., v. 68, no. 1 p.169-180dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-014-0054-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002300176245009400199300001500293520107000308592002801378650001501406650001201421650001301433650002201446650002001468650001101488650001901499650001201518650001101530650000901541700002001550773015101570856006901721856010501790990002301895852000901918655001201927IND60643510120221123021003.0190510e20140213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064351012DNAL7 a10.3791/512232doi7 aPMC40893962pmcid7 a245618102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabcock, Daniel T.13aAn improved method for accurate and rapid measurement of flight performance in Drosophila  ap. e51223.  aDrosophila has proven to be a useful model system for analysis of behavior, including flight. The initial flight tester involved dropping flies into an oil-coated graduated cylinder; landing height provided a measure of flight performance by assessing how far flies will fall before producing enough thrust to make contact with the wall of the cylinder. Here we describe an updated version of the flight tester with four major improvements. First, we added a "drop tube" to ensure that all flies enter the flight cylinder at a similar velocity between trials, eliminating variability between users. Second, we replaced the oil coating with removable plastic sheets coated in Tangle-Trap, an adhesive designed to capture live insects. Third, we use a longer cylinder to enable more accurate discrimination of flight ability. Fourth we use a digital camera and imaging software to automate the scoring of flight performance. These improvements allow for the rapid, quantitative assessment of flight behavior, useful for large datasets and large-scale genetic screens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3acameras 3acoatings 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aflight 3aimage analysis 3ainsects 3amodels 3aoils1 aGanetzky, Barry0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Feb. 13, , no. 84 p.e51223-e51223dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/512233Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51223/an-improved-method-for-accurate-rapid-measurement-flight-performance  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165300001600278520126500294592002801559650001701587650001201604650001901616650002401635650002601659650002201685650001201707650002101719650002501740650000901765650003501774651001001809653002001819653002201839653001601861653001701877653004301894700001801937700001801955700001601973700001501989700001702004700001402021700001502035700003102050773012902081856008202210852000902292655001202301IND60517377220221122052334.0190803e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051737722DNAL7 a10.1017/S147926211200024X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Fangming10aGenetic diversity and structure of indica rice varieties from two heterotic pools of southern China and IRRI  ap. 186-193.  aInvestigation of genetic diversity and the relationships among varieties and breeding lines is of great importance to facilitate parental selection in the development of inbred and hybrid rice varieties and in the construction of heterotic groups. The technology of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is being advanced for the assessment of population diversity and genetic structures. We characterized 215 widely cultivated indica rice varieties developed in southern China and at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) using IRRI-developed SNP oligonucleotide pooled assay (OPA) to provide grouping information of rice mega-varieties for further heterotic pool study. The results revealed that the Chinese varieties were more divergent than the IRRI varieties. Two major subpopulations were clustered for the varieties using a model-based grouping method. The IRRI varieties were closely grouped and separated clearly from the majority of the Chinese varieties. The Chinese varieties were subclustered into three subgroups, but there was no clear evidence to separate the Chinese varieties into subgroups geographically, indicating a great degree of genetic integration of alleles and shared ancestries among those high-yielding modern varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3abreeding lines 3adivergent evolution 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3aoligonucleotides 3apopulation structure 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aChina 0aChinese variety 0agenetic diversity 0ahybrid rice 0aIRRI variety 0asingle nucleotide polymorphism markers1 aGuo, Longbiao1 aRen, Guangjun1 aHu, Peisong1 aWang, Feng1 aXu, Jianlong1 aLi, Xinqi1 aQiu, Fulin1 adela Paz, Madonna Angelita0 tPlant genetic resources.g2012 Dec., v. 10, no. 3 p.186-193dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S147926211200024X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013300165300001300298520111700311592002801428650003001456650002301486650002101509650002201530650001501552650001401567650001101581650001301592650001701605651001201622653000801634653001901642653001101661653002101672653000901693653000801702653000801710653003401718653001401752653002301766653002901789653003001818653003801848700001501886700002201901773011401923856008202037852000902119655001202128IND60576014620221119125800.0190415e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057601462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo Thi, Huong14aThe success of scientific support for biodiversity conservation policy: The case of Ngoc Son Ngo Luong nature reserve in Vietnam  ap. 3-10.  aThe successful transfer of scientific knowledge is an increasingly important activity for addressing complex problems of biodiversity conservation. This study used the Research-Integration-Utilization model of scientific knowledge transfer to analyze the research, integration, and utilization activities in the establishment process of Ngoc Son Ngo Luong Nature Reserve in northern Vietnam. The results found successes and failures of scientific support for Vietnam’s biodiversity conservation policy. High-quality scientific solutions of the Limestone Landscape: Improving Negotiation for Conservation Project were not utilized by stakeholders due to those solutions’ weak integration. Weak research conducted by the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute of Vietnam was transferred through professional integration, which thereby achieved some successes in utilization. The results suggest three options to strengthen scientific support of policy: (1) need for professional integration, (2) improvement of the local scientific basis, and (3) need for improved communication between research and practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3aconservation areas 3aforest inventory 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3alimestone 3amodels 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3aVietnam 0aFFI 0aNature Reserve 0aLLINCP 0aPu Luong Project 0aFIPI 0aRIU 0aSLT 0aScientific knowledge transfer 0aRIU model 0aScientific support 0aProfessional integration 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aNgoc Son Ngo Luong nature reserve1 aKrott, Max1 aBöcher, Michael,0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2017 July, v. 38 p.3-10dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011900170300001600289520147800305592002801783650002001811650001401831650001201845650002001857650001401877650001401891650002401905650002201929650001301951650001701964650001401981650003101995650000902026650001502035650001002050653001302060653002002073653002802093653002902121653001402150653002702164700002002191700002402211700002002235700001502255700002002270700002002290773012902310856008202439852000902521655001202530IND60517377320221122052207.0190803e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051737732DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621120002512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathi, Shailesh10aGenetic variability and interrelationships of phenological, physicochemical and cooking quality traits in chickpea  ap. 194-201.  aEighty-six chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) genotypes, including 44 Kabuli type and 42 Desi type, were evaluated for their phenological, physicochemical and cooking quality traits. There were significant differences among the genotypes for days to 50% flowering (34–81 d), days to maturity (85–122 d), number of pods per plant (13–66), number of seeds per plant (15–85), 100-seed weight (10.5–58.6 g), seed yield (561–1852 kg/ha), hydration capacity (0.11–0.68 g water/seed), hydration index (0.80–1.21), swelling capacity (0.11–0.7 ml/seed), seed volume (0.1–0.52 ml/seed) and cooking time (38–125 min). The Desi and Kabuli types of chickpea differed significantly from each other for all the traits except for hydration index, swelling index and cooking time. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance was recorded for 100-seed weight, hydration capacity, swelling capacity and seed volume in both Desi and Kabuli genotypes. Seed size (100-seed weight and seed volume) showed significant positive correlations with hydration capacity and swelling capacity. Cooking time did not show any significant positive or negative correlation with any of the traits studied, including seed size, indicating that other additional factors may be involved in controlling cooking time. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to develop cultivars with faster cooking time in both Kabuli and Desi types and in all seed size categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3achickpeas 3acooking 3acooking quality 3acultivars 3aflowering 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aheritability 3aphenology 3aphysicochemical properties 3apods 3aseed yield 3aseeds 0achickpea 0aCicer arietinum 0acooking characteristics 0acorrelation coefficients 0aphenology 0aphysicochemical traits1 aSridhar, Vindla1 aJukanti, Aravind K.1 aSuresh, Kamatam1 aRao, B.

Although the region, taken as a whole, possesses financial, technical, labor, and natural resources sufficient to address much of the region's needs now and into the future, no one country has all of those attributes. As a result, over the past two decades, there has been significant interest in regional proposals that would allow sharing of resources, including infrastructure to develop and transport energy resources from the Russian Far East to South Korea, China, and Japan, and cooperation on energy-efficiency, renewable energy, and the nuclear fuel cycle as well. In this article we review some of these proposals, identify some of the factors that could contribute to the success or failure of infrastructure proposals, and explore some of the implications and ramifications of energy cooperation activities for energy security in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aeconomic development 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3ainfrastructure 3alabor 3anuclear fuels 3arenewable energy sources 3aChina 3aJapan 3aRussia 3aSouth Korea1 aGulidov, Ruslan1 aKalashnikov, Victor1 aHayes, Peter0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.6855-6866dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2009.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245004300172300001400215520120500229592002801434650001601462650001001478650001301488650001101501650001101512650000901523650001001532653001401542653001601556653001301572653001101585653001201596700001501608773008901623856008501712852000901797655001201806IND60086123920221116161446.0161018e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008612392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe la Casa, L.G.10aContextual control of flavor neophobia  ap. 45-51.  aThe role of context in the retrieval of learned information has been widely analyzed in the associative learning domain. However, evidence about the effect of context on flavor memory retrieval is more limited. We have carried out four experiments with rats testing for possible interactions between neophobia habituation and the context in which flavors are presented, by manipulating prior experience with contexts. Our results point to the relevance of context familiarity for the establishment and recovery of a safe taste memory trace. More specifically, the use of the animals' home cages as experimental context favored neophobia habituation (Experiments 1A and 2), reduced dopamine levels induced by administration of the dopamine D1-like receptor antagonist SCH-23390 disrupted neophobia habituation when tested in presence of a new context (Experiment 1B), and testing in the animal's home cage increases the amount of flavor consumed, even when such flavor had a previous history of aversive conditioning (Experiment 3). We propose that exploring context without aversive consequences generates a safe memory trace of such context that becomes in the basis of increased flavor consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3acages 3adopamine 3aflavor 3amemory 3arats 3ataste 0aNeophobia 0aHabituation 0aDopamine 0aFlavor 0aContext1 aDíaz, E.,0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2013 June 13, v. 118 p.45-51dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010000171300001800271520098400289592002801273650002501301650001601326650001101342650001801353650001801371650001201389651001401401700001701415700001801432700002201450773008801472856008301560852000901643655001201652IND60096798620221120042151.0141104e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009679862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.04.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Hippel, David10aFuture regional nuclear fuel cycle cooperation in East Asia: Energy security costs and benefits  ap. 6867-6881.  aEconomic growth in East Asia has rapidly increased regional energy, and especially, electricity needs. Many of the countries of East Asia have sought or are seeking to diversify their energy sources and bolster their energy supply and/or environmental security by developing nuclear power. Rapid development of nuclear power in East Asia brings with it concerns regarding nuclear weapons proliferation associated with uranium enrichment and spent nuclear fuel management. This article summarizes the development and analysis of four different scenarios of nuclear fuel cycle management in East Asia, including a scenario where each major nuclear power user develops uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent fuel individually, scenarios featuring cooperation in the full fuel cycle, and a scenario where reprocessing is avoided in favor of dry cask storage of spent fuel. The material inputs and outputs and costs of key fuel cycle elements under each scenario are summarized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3anuclear fuels 3anuclear power 3auranium 3aEast Asia1 aHayes, Peter1 aKang, Jungmin1 aKatsuta, Tadahiro0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.6867-6881dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.04.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014400167300001300311520172100324592002802045650002002073650002202093650000902115650001102124650002102135650001602156650001502172650002202187650002402209650002102233650001202254650003502266650002302301650000902324651001002333700001802343700002102361700001602382700001902398700001802417700001402435773012602449856008102575852000902656655001202665IND60119789520221121111232.0150106e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011978952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-014-0065-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bing-Ling10aLevels of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers in Settled House Dust From Urban Dwellings With Resident Preschool-Aged Children in Nanjing, China  ap. 9-19.  aWe investigated the levels and possible determinants of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the settled house-dust (SHD) of urban dwellings with resident preschool-aged children in Nanjing, China. The possible neurodevelopmental effects of house-dust PBDEs were also explored. SHD was collected from 216 urban houses. Levels of 8 PBDEs were measured by gas chromatography–negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The Child Behavior Checklist and the Gesell Development Inventory were used to evaluate the child’s development. BDE47, BDE99, BDE153, BDE18, and BDE209 were detected in the SHD of >90 % of houses, of which BDE209 predominated. Most PBDEs were found at significantly greater levels in indoor than in outdoor dust (P < 0.05). Levels of BDE28 and BDE154 in houses with solid-wood floors were significantly greater than those in houses with plywood floors (P < 0.05). BDE154 levels in houses with wallpaper were significantly greater than those without wallpaper (P < 0.05). Greater BDE47 concentrations were found in houses with less natural ventilation time (linear trend P < 0.05). After dichotomization at the geometric mean concentration, BDE209 and total BDEs showed significant risks for depressed behavior problems and lower personal social developmental quotients (DQs); BDE99 and BDE153 indicated a risk for lower personal social DQs. In conclusion, PBDEs (especially BDE209) are ubiquitous in urban SHD in Nanjing residences. Natural ventilation and floor materials potentially influence PBDE levels in SHD. The potential adverse effect of postnatal exposure to PBDEs on the behavior and neurodevelopment of preschool-age children requires follow-up in larger studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abehavior problems 3adust 3afloors 3ahome furnishings 3ainventories 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3anatural ventilation 3aneurodevelopment 3aplywood 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apreschool children 3arisk 3aChina1 aPang, Shu-tao1 aZhang, Xiao-ling1 aLi, Xi-ling1 aSun, Yong-gang1 aLu, Xiao Mei,1 aZhang, Qi0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2015 Jan., v. 68, no. 1 p.9-19dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-014-0065-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008500174300001400259520164000273592002801913650001301941650001601954650002001970650002801990650003002018650002602048650001602074650000902090650001102099650001302110650001702123650002602140650001502166650001302181653001302194653001302207653001202220653001702232653000902249700001902258700002102277700001802298700002602316700002202342700001902364700002402383700002402407773008902431856008502520852000902605655001202614IND60086124020221116161534.0161018e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008612402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayandemehr, Borna10aRole of nitric oxide in additive anticonvulsant effects of agmatine and morphine  ap. 52-57.  aThe anticonvulsant effects of agmatine, an endogenous polyamine and a metabolite of l-arginine, have been shown in various experimental seizure models. Agmatine also potentiates the anti-seizure activity of morphine. The present study aimed to investigate a possible involvement of nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the protection by agmatine and morphine co-administration against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) –induced seizure in male mice. To this end, the thresholds for the clonic seizures induced by the intravenous administration of PTZ, a GABA antagonist, were assessed. Intraperitoneal administration of morphine at lower dose (1mg/kg) increased the seizure threshold. Also intraperitoneal administration of agmatine (5 and 10mg/kg) increased the seizure threshold significantly. Combination of subeffective doses of morphine and agmatine led to potent anticonvulsant effects. Non-effective doses of morphine (0.1 and 0.5mg/kg) were able to induce anticonvulsant effects in mice pretreated with agmatine (3mg/kg). Concomitant administration of either the non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME (1, 5mg/kg, i.p.) or the selective NOS inhibitor 7-NI (15, 30mg/kg, i.p.), with an ineffective combination of morphine (0.1mg/kg) plus agmatine (1mg/kg) produced significant anticonvulsant impacts. Moreover, the NO precursor, l-arginine (30, 60mg/kg, i.p.), inhibited the anticonvulsant action of agmatine (3mg/kg) plus morphine (0.5mg/kg) co-administration. Our results indicate that pretreatment of animals with agmatine enhances the anticonvulsant effects of morphine via a mechanism which may involve the NO pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagmatine 3aantagonists 3aanticonvulsants 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aintravenous injection 3ametabolites 3amice 3amodels 3amorphine 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3apolyamines 3aseizures 0aMorphine 0aAgmatine 0aSeizure 0aNitric oxide 0aMice1 aRahimian, Reza1 aBahremand, Arash1 aEbrahimi, Ali1 aSaadat, Seyedehpariya1 aMoghaddas, Peiman1 aFadakar, Kaveh1 aDerakhshanian, Hoda1 aDehpour, Ahmad Reza0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2013 June 13, v. 118 p.52-57dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245005500170300001800225520096900243592002801212650001101240650001701251650002201268650001201290650000901302650001101311650001401322651001701336700001801353773008801371856008301459852000901542655001201551IND60096798820221120054508.0141104e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009679882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlyousef, Yousef14aThe cost of domestic energy prices to Saudi Arabia  ap. 6900-6905.  aThe issue of subsidies on domestic energy prices has moved up the policy agenda, most recently as a result of the G20 commitment in September 2009 to phase out such subsidies. However, what constitutes a “subsidy” is complex and controversial. The IEA in its last World Energy Outlook claimed that Saudi Arabia was second in the world in terms of its levels of subsidy on domestic energy prices. However, because Saudi Arabia is a price maker in the international oil market, the methodology used by the IEA is seriously flawed. This paper explains the problems with the methodology for computing subsidies and explains the correct method in the case of Saudi Arabia. It then attempts to measure the levels of subsidy in Saudi Arabia using this methodology. However, while it converts the IEA's “subsidy” of $23 billion into a net “profit” of $5.7 billion, it goes on to point out that the current low price regime is causing problems for Saudi Arabia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aoils 3aprices 3asubsidies 3aSaudi Arabia1 aStevens, Paul0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.6900-6905dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245012300132300001400255520150600269592002801775650002001803650002401823650001701847650002201864650002301886650002201909650002301931650002101954650001701975650001101992650002602003650001402029650001702043650002402060650001202084650001002096650001502106651001802121653002902139653001402168700002102182700002202203700002402225700001702249773015002266852000902416655001202425IND60596009320221123024455.0180608e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059600932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLink, Arthur F.10aLow Recruitment of Native Trees in a Deciduous Forest Associated with Japanese Barberry (Berberis thunbergii) Invasion  ap. 20-26.  aInvasive plants may dramatically impact forest ecosystems by establishing dense populations and suppressing the recruitment of native tree species. One invasive shrub currently spreading throughout eastern deciduous forests of North America, Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii DC), may be limiting tree recruitment in stands where it invades. Once established, B. thunbergii becomes densely populated within forest understories and suppresses native plants by competing for limited resources, altering soil conditions, and changing the understory microclimate. To quantify native seedling inhibition caused by B. thunbergii invasion, we conducted an observational study on seedling abundance within forest plots that were either invaded or not invaded by B. thunbergii and used survey data to generate Bayesian models of native seedling densities along gradients of increasing B. thunbergii stem counts and aboveground plant dry mass. Model outputs predicted that B. thunbergii—invaded plots had 82% lower seedling densities compared with uninvaded plots. Native tree seedling densities were very low even in areas with moderate B. thunbergii density, suggesting that reduced tree seedling densities are observed even at low densities of invasion. Our findings indicate that forests invaded with B. thunbergii harbor substantially lower densities of native tree seedlings, with potentially significant long-term consequences for forest ecological integrity, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aBerberis thunbergii 3abiodiversity 3adeciduous forests 3aecosystem services 3aforest ecosystems 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3aobservational studies 3aseedlings 3asoil quality 3aspecies recruitment 3asurveys 3atrees 3aunderstory 3aNorth America 0aEastern deciduous forest 0aseedlings1 aTurnblacer, Trey1 aSnyder, Cierra K.1 aDaugherty, Sarah E.1 aUtz, Ryan M.0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2018 Mar., v. 11, no. 1 p.20-26dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-747X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03778naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014000166300001400306520235900320592002802679650002702707650001702734650001902751650002402770650002202794650003402816650001302850651001002863653002502873653001702898653001702915653001902932653001802951653001602969700001902985700002703004700001903031700002203050773018003072856008303252852000903335655001203344IND60576015120221119125606.0190415e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057601512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.njas.2017.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTotin, Edmond10aHow does institutional embeddedness shape innovation platforms? A diagnostic study of three districts in the Upper West Region of Ghana  ap. 27-40.  aInnovation platforms have emerged as a way of enhancing the resilience of agricultural and food systems in the face of environmental change. Consequently, a great deal of theoretical reflection and empirical research have been devoted to the goal of understanding the factors that enhance and constrain their functionality. In this article, we further examine this enquiry by applying the concept of institutional embeddedness, understood as encompassing elements of platform design, structure, and functions as well as aspects of the broader historical, political, and social context to which platforms are connected. We present a case study of sub-national platforms established in three districts of the climatically-stressed Upper West Region of Ghana and charged with facilitating climate change responses at the local level and channelling community priorities into national climate change policy. A different kind of organization − the traditional chief council, the agricultural extension service, and a local NGO − was chosen by members to convene and coordinate the platform in each district. We examine platform members’ accounts of the platform formation and selection of facilitating agent, their vision for platform roles, and their understandings of platform agenda and impacts. We analyse these narratives through the lens of institutional embeddedness, as expressed mostly, but not solely, by the choice of facilitating agents. We illustrate how the organizational position − and related vested interests − of facilitating agents contribute to shaping platform agendas, functions, and outcomes. This process hinges on the deployment of legitimacy claims, which may appeal to cultural tradition, technical expertise, community engagement, and dominant scientific narratives on climate change. Iinstitutional embeddedness is thereby shown to be a critical aspect of agency in multi-actor processes, contributing to framing local understandings of the climate change and to channelling collective efforts towards select response strategies. In conclusion, we stress that the institutional identity of facilitating agents and their relationship to members of the platform and to powerholders in the broader context provides a useful diagnostic lens to analyse the processes that shape the platform’s ability to achieve its goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural education 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aextension education 3aissues and policy 3anongovernmental organizations 3apolitics 3aGhana 0aInnovation platforms 0aInstitutions 0aStakeholders 0aClimate change 0aFood security 0aWest Africa1 aRoncoli, Carla1 aTraoré, Pierre Sibiry1 aSomda, Jacques1 aZougmoré, Robert0 tNetherlands journal of agricultural science.g2018 Mar., v. 84 p.27-40dElsevier B.V.aRoyal Netherlands Society for Agricultural ScienceswJournal:J000000128x1573-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.njas.2017.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011900171300001600290520136400306592002801670650002001698650002101718650001501739650002001754650002201774650001301796650001401809650002701823650002601850650002501876650002501901650001001926651001201936651002401948653001001972653001701982653001901999653001702018653002502035653001802060700001802078700002702096700002002123700001702143700002302160700002502183773012902208856008202337961001302419852000902432655001202441IND60517377820221122052421.0190803e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051737782DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621120003052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotilal, Lambert A.10aElucidation of genetic identity and population structure of cacao germplasm within an international cacao genebank  ap. 232-241.  aTheobroma cacao L., or cacao, is the source of cocoa products used in the making of chocolate. These tropical trees are conserved in living genebanks. The International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad is one of the largest ex situ collections in the public domain. Mislabelling is a critical problem and the correction of this problem is vital to improve the accuracy and efficiency of genebank management. Using microsatellite DNA markers, we assessed the level of mislabelling in a group of Refractario cacao that originated from Ecuador and determined their population memberships through Bayesian clustering analysis. The microsatellite data revealed a synonymous rate of 7.5% and an error rate of 39.4% in this germplasm subset. The analysis of the population structure grouped the Refractario accessions into four subclusters, indicating intra-population heterogeneity in this germplasm group. Based on the results, we recommend that when the assignment test is used for cacao genotype identification, it should (a) use duplicated samples as internal checks, (b) choose suitable reference accessions, including a known homogeneous group and (c) employ subclustering checks to obtain reliable results. The information framework generated is discussed in relation to the management of the collection, population enhancement and future research of the collection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3acluster analysis 3agene banks 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular systematics 3aplant identification 3apopulation structure 3atrees 3aEcuador 3aTrinidad and Tobago 0acocoa 0aconservation 0afield genebank 0amislabelling 0apopulation structure 0atree identity1 aZhang, Dapeng1 aUmaharan, Pathmanathan1 aBoccara, Michel1 aMischke, Sue1 aSankar, Antoinette1 aMeinhardt, Lyndel W.0 tPlant genetic resources.g2012 Dec., v. 10, no. 3 p.232-241dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621120003053Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100003100150245014300181300001400324520144500338592002801783650002601811650002801837650002701865650001301892650001701905650001401922650001501936650001301951650001201964650001901976650001101995650001402006650002302020650002002043650001602063650001202079650002302091653002402114653001402138653002702152653002902179653002302208653001902231700001602250700002102266700001902287700001702306773010002323856008702423852000902510655001202519IND4468960220221117161126.0190408e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446896022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.05.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-López, Vicente M.,10aOperating conditions for the electrolytic disinfection of process wash water from the fresh-cut industry contaminated with E. coli o157:H7  ap. 42-48.  aThe effect of operating conditions (current density, recirculation flow rate and electrode doping level) on the efficacy of boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes to inactivate microorganisms and decrease chemical oxygen demand (COD) was studied in lettuce process wash water with a COD of 725mg/L and inoculated with a 5-strain cocktail of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Changes in pathogen population, COD, pH, temperature, redox potential, and free and total chlorine were monitored in process wash water during treatments. Considering the specific characteristics of the washing step included in the fresh-cut processing, the disinfection of process wash water should be of fast action. A biphasic with a shoulder model was used to estimate shoulder length (Sl), log-linear inactivation rates (kmax1,kmax2), lowest population (Nf) and highest log reduction (HLR). Current density clearly influenced Sl, and kmax2; recirculation flow rate influenced Sl, kmax1,kmax2 and COD depletion; and doping level influenced Nf. No relationship was observed between inactivation parameters and chlorine concentration. Conditions including high current density (180mA/cm2), high flow rate (750l/h) and high doping level (8 000μmol/mol) seems to provide a disinfection efficiency suitable to decrease the chance of bacterial cross contamination in the fresh-cut industries while saving on water consumption and decreasing the amount of wastewater effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3abacterial contamination 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3aeffluents 3aelectrodes 3aindustry 3alettuce 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3apathogens 3aprocess monitoring 3aredox potential 3atemperature 3awashing 3awater conservation 0aBoron-doped diamond 0aFlow rate 0aElectrode doping level 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aElectrolyzed water 0aOrganic matter1 aGobet, Jean1 aSelma, María V.1 aGil, María I.1 aAllende, Ana0 tFood control.g2013 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.42-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.05.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013500166300001600301520142800317592002801745650001601773650001101789650002101800650001501821650001101836650001901847650001401866650001101880650000901891653001701900653002201917653003301939653001901972700001801991700001502009700001302024700001602037700001502053700001802068773012502086856008302211852000902294655001202303IND60637872320221119042029.0190523e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063787232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.04.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Weiguo10aNovel fabrication of hollow and spinous NiCo2S4 nanotubes templated by natural silk for all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors  ap. 140-149.  aRecently, ternary cobalt nickel sulfide, performing as the promising electrode material for supercapacitors has obtained great interests. Herein, the hollow and spinous NiCo2S4 nanotubes are designed and prepared through a simple hydrothermal reaction using the natural silk as the template. The spinous Ni-Co precursors are grown on the natural silk through a facile hydrothermal strategy and the hollow structure is obtained by decomposing the silk via hydrothermal sulfurization. After the calcination treatment, the hollow and spinous NiCo2S4 nanotubes are applied as the electrode material and exhibit better electrochemical performance than the solely vulcanized samples. In addition, owing to the unique hollow and spinous structure of NiCo2S4 nanotubes, the supercapacitor electrode material shows good specific capacitance (630 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), low internal resistance Rs (0.68 Ω) and high capacitance retention (91% after 3000 cycles) at 10 A g−1. Furthermore, an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor is self-assembled with the SC400 composite and exhibits an energy density of 52.34 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 2206.37 W kg−1. Additionally, a blue LED indicator can be powered by connecting two ASCs in series. The prepared hollow and spinous NiCo2S4 nanotubes with excellent electrochemical properties can envision promising applications in energy storage devices and nanotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ananotubes 3anickel 3asilk 0aNatural silk 0aNiCo2S4 nanotubes 0aHollow and spinous structure 0aSupercapacitor1 aZhang, Aitang1 aLiang, Hui1 aLiu, Rui1 aCai, Jintao1 aCui, Liang1 aLiu, Jingquan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 549 p.140-149dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.04.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245013300173300001400306520226300320592002802583650001502611650001102626650001202637650002602649650001102675650001002686650001902696650001202715650001002727650001802737650001602755650001602771651001202787700002702799700001902826700001902845700002002864773008302884856008802967852000903055655001203064IND60086194720221119195943.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008619472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2011.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuguet, Arnaud10aBranched tetraether membrane lipids associated with rhizoliths in loess: Rhizomicrobial overprinting of initial biomarker record  ap. 12-19.  aLoess–palaeosol sequences are considered important terrestrial archives for studying Quaternary climate. Recent studies have shown that calcified roots (rhizoliths) can be significantly younger than surrounding terrestrial sediment (loess) and that loess organic matter may be contaminated with root-derived carbon from post-sedimentary deep rooting plants. Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are membrane lipids produced by unknown bacteria in soil and are increasingly being used as palaeoclimate proxies. The aim of this work was to examine the impact of the temporal decoupling between rhizoliths and loess on the abundance and composition of branched GDGTs, and consequently on the application of branched GDGTs as proxies in loess deposits. Branched GDGTs in rhizoliths and the surrounding sediment from a loess–palaeosol sequence in Nussloch (SW Germany) were examined. Their composition varied between the rhizolith and loess, which may reflect the fact that branched GDGTs were biosynthesized at different times (late Pleistocene for loess and Holocene for rhizoliths) and therefore under different environmental conditions. A large difference (ca. 7°C) in branched GDGT-reconstructed palaeotemperature was observed between rhizoliths and loess. In addition, the reconstructed temperatures were the opposite from those expected from the assumed depositional ages of branched GDGTs. This might be explained by the post-sedimentary input of root-associated, microorganism-derived branched GDGTs to loess, which might have led to an overprint of the initial branched GDGT signal in the sediment. Our results suggest that post-sedimentary penetration of deep-rooting plants in loess might entail uncertainty regarding the application of branched GDGT palaeoproxies and that caution should be exercised in interpreting temperature estimates derived from branched GDGTs in loess–palaeosol sequences. This is of special importance for loess, where rhizoliths are abundant, and where non-calcified root remains of different age from that of the sediment are possible. In addition, the GDGT concentration in rhizoliths and surrounding loess supports the hypothesis of a heterotrophic lifestyle for branched GDGT-producing bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aenvironmental factors 3alipids 3aloess 3aorganic matter 3arooting 3aroots 3asoil bacteria 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aGermany1 aWiesenberg, Guido L.B.1 aGocke, Martina1 aFosse, Céline1 aDerenne, Sylvie0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2012 Feb., v. 43 p.12-19dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2011.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009400171300001800265500001400283520108500297592002801382650002501410650002201435650001201457650001701469650001201486650001401498651001001512700002001522700001701542773008801559856008301647852000901730655001201739IND60096799020221120064104.0141104e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009679902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2008.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVon Hippel, David10aIntroduction to the Asian Energy Security project: Project organization and methodologies  ap. 6712-6718.  aEDITORIAL  aThe spectacular recent economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region in general, and in many of the economies of Northeast Asia in particular, has spurred a vast expansion in the need for energy services, and an expansion in the demand for the fuels that help to supply these services. Future projections suggest that the growth of fossil fuel use in Northeast Asia, especially in China, will have major consequences for financial and fuel markets and pollution both regionally and globally. Before the project described in this paper was initiated, there was no ongoing forum for energy experts from all of the countries of the region to meet, informally and in an unofficial capacity, to discuss openly and in a targeted fashion the energy situations in their countries, and to work together to evaluate the energy efficiency costs and benefits of different ways of meeting regional demand. The Asian Energy Security (AES) project provides such a forum, and as such constitutes a unique resource in the engagement of the countries of Northeast Asia on the topic of energy security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aenergy efficiency 3aexperts 3afossil fuels 3amarkets 3apollution 3aChina1 aSavage, Timothy1 aHayes, Peter0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.6712-6718dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2008.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007800163300001400241520167400255592002801929650001901957650001901976650001701995650002102012650001602033650001702049650001702066650001702083650001802100650002202118650002102140650001302161650001402174650001102188650002102199650001002220650004302230650002402273650001402297650001302311650002102324650001002345700001602355700001702371700001402388700001502402700001402417773013202431856008102563852000902644655001202653IND60686352420221119221347.0200317e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068635242DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437200102522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, H. Y.10aInvestigation of Tocopherol Biosynthesis in Blackberry Seeds (Rubus spp.)  ap. 76-84.  aTocopherol (vitamin E) is widely recognized as a cellular antioxidant and can prevent oxidative damage during seed quiescence and dormancy in all angiosperms. Tocopherols biosynthesis was highly accumulated in blackberry seeds, but limited study was done on expression of critical genes involved in this biosynthesis pathway. In the present study, each RuHPT and RuTMT cDNA sequence was isolated from boysenberry (Rubus idaeus × fruticosus × loganobaccus Darrow) and their expression patterns and regulation of tocopherols contents were investigated during different seed development stages from 14 to 42 days. RuHPT contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1224 bp that encoded 407 amino acid residues, and for RuTMT, an ORF of 1056 bp encoding 351 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that RuHPT and RuTMT were closely related to other Rosaceae species, Rosa chinensis and Fragaria vesca, respectively. The transcript level of both RuHPT and RuTMT gradually increased and reached a maximum level in the seeds of late ripening stages, 35 days after flowering (DAF) and 42 DAF. Assay of total tocopherol, α-tocopherol, γ‑tocopherol and δ-tocopherol contents by HPLC all revealed a similar changing trend concomitantly with the rising expression of RuHPT, and reached the peak on Day 35. The α-tocopherol level showed itself a trend of descending after ascending and reached its peak on Day 28. Therefore, RuHPT and RuTMT may both play a role in tocopherols biosynthesis in the seeds of ripening fruits. These results provide a novel foundation for investigating the functions of key enzyme genes on tocopherols biosynthesis in blackberry plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria vesca 3aRosa chinensis 3aRubus idaeus 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aamino acids 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3ablackberries 3aboysenberries 3acomplementary DNA 3adelta-tocopherol 3adormancy 3aflowering 3afruits 3agamma-tocopherol 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aripening 3aseed development 3aseeds1 aDong, S.

Manual control by cutting or shredding is one of the most common strategies many land managers employ. However, rapid sprouting from the root collar and lateral roots commonly results in poor control. Cutting followed by either glyphosate or triclopyr application to the stumps is generally effective, but the efficacy of these herbicides in relation to treatment timing and L. sinense root collar diameter has not been evaluated. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effectiveness of glyphosate and triclopyr cut stump treatments compared with cutting alone at spring and fall timings across a range of L. sinense size classes. Studies were conducted at two locations in Auburn, AL. Treatments included cut stump + no herbicide, cut stump+ glyphosate (120 g L⁻¹), or cut stump + triclopyr (90 g L⁻¹). Treatments were applied to at least 50 experimental units each at April and November timings. Root collar diameter was recorded for each stem, stems were cut 2.5 cm above the ground, and herbicide treatments were applied within 30 s. Ligustrum sinense mortality and sprouting were quantified 6, 12, and 18 mo after treatment. Both glyphosate and triclopyr amine were very effective in controlling L. sinense at both spring and fall timings. However, glyphosate provided slightly better results than triclopyr when lateral sprouting was included. Application timing also was significant, with a lower percentage of sprouting following November treatments than April treatments. Stem size influenced treatment success, as larger stumps tended to sprout more than smaller stumps. These results indicate L. sinense can be controlled with cut stump herbicide treatment using either glyphosate or triclopyr with spring or fall timings at concentrations much lower than typically used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLigustrum sinense 3aapplication timing 3aautumn 3acutting 3aglyphosate 3ainvasive species 3amanagers 3amortality 3aroot crown 3aroots 3ashredding 3ashrubs 3aspring 3asprouting 3astems 3astumps 3atriclopyr 3aAlabama 0aIndividual plant treatment 0ainvasive plant control1 aO'Sullivan, Sarah E.1 aLoewenstein, Nancy J.1 aBrantley, Eve1 aLauer, Dwight K.0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2018 Mar., v. 11, no. 1 p.49-55dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-747X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245014900165300001600314520149800330592002801828650001701856650001201873650002301885650001501908650000901923650001101932650001401943650001001957650002001967650002501987650002402012650002102036650002302057650001502080651001002095651001802105653002202123653002002145653001902165653001302184653001202197653001802209700001602227700002002243700001502263700001402278700001702292700002402309700001902333773012302352856008802475852000902563655001202572IND60564439520221117045937.0181011e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056443952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Min10aUsing palaeolimnological data and historical records to assess long-term dynamics of ecosystem services in typical Yangtze shallow lakes (China)  ap. 791-802.  aUnderstanding the dynamics of ecosystem services (ESs) is crucial for sustainable resource management. Palaeolimnological records have a great potential to reveal long-term variations and dynamic interactions in ESs, especially supporting/regulating services, which are not easily quantified by documentary records. To elucidate the variations between eight important ESs in shallow lake ecosystems, we combined documentary records with palaeolimnological proxies (covering the past 100years) from two typical lakes (Lakes Taibai and Zhangdu) of the Yangtze River basin. Although all supporting services and some provisioning services have increased, the regulating services of the two lakes have markedly declined, in particular since the 1950s. Human activities, including hydrological intervention, nutrient input and land-use change, were identified as the main factors behind the observed variations. Both in Lake Taibai and Zhangdu, primary production and biodiversity (supporting services) have increased (synergies), whereas climate and water purification (regulating services) have significantly decreased (tradeoffs) since the 1950s when attempts were made by the local population to reach a higher land/fish ESs level. By considering long-term records, dynamic tradeoff and synergy relationship between various ESs relative to different types of human “modification” in a temporal perspective, we suggest valuable information can be gained in future lake management initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afish 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3alakes 3aland use change 3aprimary productivity 3aresource management 3awater management 3awater purification 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aEcosystem service 0aPalaeolimnology 0aHuman activity 0aTradeoff 0aSynergy 0aYangtze River1 aDong, Xuhui1 aYang, Xiangdong1 aWang, Rong1 aZhang, Ke1 aZhao, Yanjie1 aDavidson, Thomas A.1 aJeppesen, Erik0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 584-585 p.791-802dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014500162300001400307520165700321592002801978650002702006650001902033650001802052650002502070650001802095650001302113650001102126650002002137650002002157650001602177650002202193650001102215650002002226650001502246650002102261650001102282650001502293650001202308650001402320650002502334700001102359700001502370700001502385700001102400700001702411700001702428773013202445856008102577852000902658655001202667IND60686352520221119215301.0200317e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068635252DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437200102642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, X.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of exogenous different concentrations of ABA (0, 0.5, 1, 10, 100 and 200 μM) to mitigate oxidative stress in Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco exposed to 100 mM hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), and its effects on reactive oxygen metabolism. Results indicated that exposure to 100 mM H₂O₂ significantly increased the contents of H₂O₂, malondialdehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid, total glutathione, and proline, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in P. orientalis leaves, while peroxidase (POD) activity decreased. The transcript levels of Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT, GR, APX, MDAR, and GST were upregulated in P. orientalis after 48 h of H₂O₂-induced stress. Compared with 100 and 200 μM ABA, lower ABA concentrations (0.5, 1, and 10 μM) significantly enhanced the activities of SOD, POD and CAT, and increased the contents of ascorbic acid, total glutathione, and proline in H₂O₂-treated seedlings at 48 h, accompanied by reduced H₂O₂ and MDA contents. Among the three lower concentrations of ABA, the 1 μM ABA concentration had the strongest effect on enzyme activities and the contents of antioxidant compounds. Among all the ABA concentrations, 1 μM ABA had the strongest effect to increase the transcript levels of Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT, GR, APX and MDAR in P. orientalis under H₂O₂-induced stress. This study revealed that an appropriate concentration of ABA effectively mitigated the damage caused by reactive oxygen species to P. orientalis via regulating the antioxidant defense system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatycladus orientalis 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aperoxidase 3aproline 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aJi, J.1 aYue, J.

Cultivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in molasses medium with different concentrations of selenium showed that the contents of organic selenium in the cells, increased with the increase in selenium concentration up to 2μg/ml followed by a gradual decrease after 24h of incubation. No clear inhibition effect on growth or gassing power of cells was observed at all concentrations of selenium.

The results did not show any influence on kidney function (CK), liver function (AST, ALT, ALK, protein and albumin) and glucose in serum as well as histopathology studies. Content of Se and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Pxe) activity in erythrocytes increased gradually with increase in supplemented Se. It could be recommended to use the selenium yeast (high quality baker’s yeast containing selenium) in baking process to control the selenium level in the final product as a source of antioxidant substance for protection from different diseases instead of using selenium drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3abaking 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3adrugs 3aerythrocytes 3agas production (biological) 3aglucose 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aliver function 3amolasses 3arats 3arenal function 3aselenium 3ayeasts 0aBaker’s yeast 0aSelenium-enriched yeast 0aGlutathione peroxidase 0aSerum glucose 0aAlbumin1 aAllababidy, T.1 aRamadan, E.M.0 tAnnals of agricultural science.g2015 Dec., v. 60, no. 2 p.307-315dElsevier B.V.wJournal:17770x0570-17837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aoas.2015.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010900165300001800274520066100292592002800953650001300981650001200994650002001006650001501026650001401041650002901055653002901084653001301113653002301126653001801149653003001167653001401197653001301211653002701224653001301251653001401264700002601278700001601304700002801320700002201348773012201370856008501492852000901577655001201586IND60576015520221119125620.0180905e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057601552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2017.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Shuang14aThe role of intrinsic disorder and dynamics in the assembly and function of the type II secretion system  ap. 1255-1266.  aMany Gram-negative commensal and pathogenic bacteria use a type II secretion system (T2SS) to transport proteins out of the cell. These exported proteins or substrates play a major role in toxin delivery, maintaining biofilms, replication in the host and subversion of host immune responses to infection. We review the current structural and functional work on this system and argue that intrinsically disordered regions and protein dynamics are central for assembly, exo-protein recognition, and secretion competence of the T2SS. The central role of intrinsic disorder-order transitions in these processes may be a particular feature of type II secretion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aimmune response 3aproteomics 3asecretion 3atype II secretion system 0aType II secretion system 0aDynamics 0aIntrinsic disorder 0aType IV pilus 0aType III secretion system 0aVirulence 0aSecretin 0aGram negative bacteria 0aPathogen 0aSecretion1 aShevchik, Vladimir E.1 aShaw, Rosie1 aPickersgill, Richard W.1 aGarnett, James A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Oct., v. 1865, no. 10 p.1255-1266dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2017.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006100174300001800235520152000253592002801773650004401801650003201845650001301877650001501890650001701905653000801922653001901930653001201949653001401961653001501975700002201990773012202012856008502134852000902219655001202228IND60576015620221119125633.0180905e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057601562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerjanskii, Mark V.10aUnraveling the meaning of chemical shifts in protein NMR  ap. 1564-1576.  aChemical shifts are among the most informative parameters in protein NMR. They provide wealth of information about protein secondary and tertiary structure, protein flexibility, and protein-ligand binding. In this report, we review the progress in interpreting and utilizing protein chemical shifts that has occurred over the past 25years, with a particular focus on the large body of work arising from our group and other Canadian NMR laboratories. More specifically, this review focuses on describing, assessing, and providing some historical context for various chemical shift-based methods to: (1) determine protein secondary and super-secondary structure; (2) derive protein torsion angles; (3) assess protein flexibility; (4) predict residue accessible surface area; (5) refine 3D protein structures; (6) determine 3D protein structures and (7) characterize intrinsically disordered proteins. This review also briefly covers some of the methods that we previously developed to predict chemical shifts from 3D protein structures and/or protein sequence data. It is hoped that this review will help to increase awareness of the considerable utility of NMR chemical shifts in structural biology and facilitate more widespread adoption of chemical-shift based methods by the NMR spectroscopists, structural biologists, protein biophysicists, and biochemists worldwide.

Four polyethersulfone membranes of molecular weight cut offs of 10, 30, 50 and 100kDa were used. The system was quite efficient in fractionating HSs with different molecular sizes. HS fractions were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry to obtain E₂/E₃ ratios, which describe the aromaticity of the fractions. The E₂/E₃ ratios were in agreement with those obtained using current commercial systems, and FTIR spectra of all fractions presented characteristic bands of the HSs. Therefore, it can be concluded that this system is a simple, versatile and low cost alternative to the current systems on the market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3afractionation 3ahumic substances 3amarkets 3amolecular weight 3aultrafiltration1 aTadini, Amanda M.1 aBisinoti, Márcia Cristina1 aMoreira, Altair B.1 aSantos, Ademir dos1 aOliveira, Luciana Camargo de1 aMartin, Cibely S.0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2012 Feb., v. 43 p.156-161dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2011.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015900172300001400331520152400345592002801869650003101897650001901928650002301947650001201970650001901982650001102001650002102012650001902033650001802052650001802070650000902088650001702097650003702114650001502151700002102166700002002187700001802207700002002225700002102245700002302266700002202289700002302311700002102334773008802355856008302443990002302526852000902549655001202558IND60099449520221120132612.0141105e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009944952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.imlet.2013.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahara, Masahiro13aIL-7 promotes long-term in vitro survival of unique long-lived memory subset generated from mucosal effector memory CD4⁺ T cells in chronic colitis mice  ap. 82-93.  aColitogenic memory CD4⁺ T cells are important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although memory stem cells with high survival and self-renewal capacity were recently identified in both mice and humans, it is unclear whether a similar subset is present in chronic colitis mice. We sought to identify and purify a long-lived subset of colitogenic memory CD4⁺ T cells, which may be targets for treatment of IBD. A long-lived subset of colitogenic memory CD4⁺ T cells was purified using a long-term culture system. The characteristics of these cells were assessed. Interleukin (IL)-7 promoted the in vitro survival for >8 weeks of lamina propria (LP) CD4⁺ T cells from colitic SCID mice previously injected with CD4⁺CD45RBʰⁱᵍʰ T cells. These cells were in a quiescent state and divided a maximum of 5 times in 4 weeks. LP CD4⁺ T cells expressed higher levels of Bcl-2, integrin-α4β7, CXCR3 and CD25 after than before culture, as well as secreting high concentrations of IL-2 and low concentrations of IFN-γ and IL-17 in response to intestinal bacterial antigens. LP CD4⁺ T cells from colitic mice cultured with IL-7 for 8 weeks induced more severe colitis than LP CD4⁺ T cells cultured for 4 weeks. We developed a novel culture system to purify a long-lived, highly pathogenic memory subset from activated LP CD4⁺ T cells. IL-7 promoted long-term in vitro survival of this subset in a quiescent state. This subset will be a novel, effective target for the treatment of IBD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCXCR3 receptor 3abacterial antigens 3acolitis 3acultured cells 3ahumans 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-7 3amice 3apathogenesis 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3astem cells1 aNemoto, Yasuhiro1 aOshima, Shigeru1 aMatsuzawa, Yu1 aKanai, Takanori1 aOkamoto, Ryuichi1 aTsuchiya, Kiichiro1 aNakamura, Tetsuya1 aYamamoto, Kazuhide1 aWatanabe, Mamoru0 tImmunology Letters.g2013 , v. 156, no. 1-2 p.82-93dElsevier B.V.x0165-24787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245010200175300001600277520106400293592002801357650001601385650000901401650001201410650001201422650001901434650001001453650001001463650001201473650001401485653002001499653001801519653001301537653001901550773011801569856008301687852000901770655001201779IND60535545720221117222344.0190405e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053554572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aoas.2015.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelmegeed, Sawsan M.10aEffect of mating duration and the number of females/male moth of Bombyx mori L. on eggs fertility  ap. 341-343.  aThe present work was carried out to investigate eggs fertility of Bombyx mori L. as affected by mating duration and male fertility and their ability of mating more than once of silkworm.

This flexibility is associated with environmental tolerance in several traits, such as allocation of resources to shoots versus roots, clonal versus sexual reproduction, and survival of seedlings. These traits were explored in the chandelier plant (Kalanchoe delagoensis Eckl. & Zeyh.), which has invasive populations in several countries. Light and water tolerance and herbicide treatments were tested on plantlet survival. Plantlet survival in the most extreme cases (full sunlight and no watering) was close to 30%, whereas in less severe conditions (water and shaded), it was close to 100%. Stress conditions triggered the onset of plantlet production from the margin of leaves, which increased clonality. Biomass was allocated primarily to aboveground structures. Although all herbicides resulted in high plantlet mortality (>85%), only 2,4-D and glyphosate + 2,4-D amine achieved the maximum recorded mortality a few days after the chemical application. The high tolerance of K. delagoensis plantlets to varying conditions shows that under stress, plantlet production is enhanced as survival of established individuals decreases. Biomass is primarily aboveground, which can potentially alter nitrogen and carbon in poor arid environments, and the proportion of the biomass assigned to belowground roots increased with an increase in sunlight received. Even though the chemical treatments 2,4-D and glyphosate + 2,4-D amine have been shown to be the only effective treatments, the 2,4-D treatment may be the most viable (cost + quantity) to reduce the propagation of K. delagoensis. Plantlets have become the main reason for population persistence, partially due to the plant's environmental tolerance and ability to reproduce asexually in short time periods. Susceptibility of plantlets to the two herbicides presents a means to adequately manage invasions of K. delagoensis in Mexico.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aKalanchoe tubiflora 3aasexual reproduction 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achemical control 3achemical treatment 3adry environmental conditions 3adry matter partitioning 3aglyphosate 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3amortality 3anitrogen 3aplantlets 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asexual reproduction 3ashoots 3asolar radiation 3aMexico 0aAsexual reproduction 0achemical control 0ainvasive species 0aplantlet 0arecruitment1 aBarrales-Alcalá, Diego,1 aArgueta-Guzmán, Magda1 aCruz, Abraham1 aMandujano, Maria C.1 aArévalo-Ramírez, Jose A.1 aMilligan, Brook G.1 aGolubov, Jordan0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2018 Mar., v. 11, no. 1 p.33-39dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-747X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245009600208300001600304520192700320592002802247650001302275650000802288650002002296650001102316650001502327650001702342653002402359653001702383653001602400653002302416653000802439700002202447700001502469700001902484700002102503700001702524700002302541700002002564700002002584700002902604700002602633700001802659700002702677700002602704773012302730856008802853852000902941655001202950IND60564439820221117050545.0181011e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056443982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivas, Ioar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4743-619X10aIdentification of technical problems affecting performance of DustTrak DRX aerosol monitors  ap. 849-855.  aThe TSI DustTrak Aerosol Monitor is a portable real-time instrument widely used for particulate matter (PM) mass concentrations monitoring.

These artefact jumps can sometimes be easily recognised (“obvious jump”), while others can be difficult to identify because the difference in the concentrations before and after the jump might be just few μg·m⁻³ (“possible jump”) or because the jump is sustained over the whole monitoring period and only detectable if PM concentrations are simultaneously measured by other instruments (“hidden jump”). Moreover, in areas of relatively low PM levels, the unit reported concentration of 0μg·m⁻³ for ambient PM concentration or even negative concentration values which may seriously compromise the dataset. These data suggest issues with the detection of low PM concentrations, which could be due to an incorrect instrument offset or the factory calibration setting being inadequate for these PM concentrations. The upward and downward artefact jumps were not related to especially dusty or clean conditions, since they have been observed in many kinds of environments: indoor and outdoor school environments, subway stations and in ambient urban background air. Therefore, PM concentration data obtained with the TSI DustTrak DRX models should be handled with care and meticulously revised before being considered valid. To prevent these issues the use of auto zero module is recommended, so the DustTrak monitor is automatic re-zeroed without requiring the presence of any user.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3adata collection 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 0aPortable instrument 0aTSI DustTrak 0aPerformance 0aMass concentration 0aPMx1 aMazaheri, Mandana1 aViana, Mar1 aMoreno, Teresa1 aClifford, Samuel1 aHe, Congrong1 aBischof, Oliver F.1 aMartins, Vânia1 aReche, Cristina1 aAlastuey, A.q(Andrés),1 aAlvarez-Pedrerol, Mar1 aSunyer, Jordi1 aMorawska, L.q(Lidia),1 aQuerol, X.q(Xavier),0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 584-585 p.849-855dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012600172300001400298500001500312520112100327592002801448650001301476650001601489650001401505650001501519650001701534650002201551650001301573650003101586650001701617650002401634650001401658650002301672653001201695653002101707653001501728653002201743653001701765653001701782700001901799700001601818700002201834700002401856700001901880700002301899700001701922700002101939773011001960856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60554221120221120215125.0180904e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055422112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2015.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeidmann, Verena10aStudies towards the synthetic applicability of biocatalytic allylic oxidations with the lyophilisate of Pleurotus sapidus  ap. 15-21.  a2019-12-06  aThe edible fungus Pleurotus sapidus (PSA) is a particularly interesting biocatalytic system for allylic oxidation and has a remarkably broad substrate range from terpenoids to fatty acids. The oxidations are most likely catalyzed by a lipoxygenase and involve the formation of peroxides via radical intermediates in the first rate-limiting step. We provide herein a rationalization of the observed regioselectivity of these conversions by means of computational determination of bond dissociation enthalpies of a set of tailor-made spirocyclic terpenoids. It was found that only strongly activated allylic positions (BDH298 of <80kcal/mol) with neighboring heteroatoms or with activating alkyl groups are oxidized to the corresponding unsaturated lactones or enones, respectively. With the synthesis and purification of allylic hydroperoxide intermediates, we have been able to characterize the putative direct precursors of enones in PSA oxidations. Our results suggest a two-step oxidation mechanism involving hydroperoxide intermediates which are rapidly converted to the observed enones by an enzymatic reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenthalpy 3afatty acids 3aperoxides 3aterpenoids 3aedible fungi 3aPleurotus sapidus 3alactones 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3adissociation 3aenzymatic reactions 3aoxidation 3acatalytic activity 0aFlavors 0aNatural products 0aTerpenoids 0aAllylic oxidation 0alipoxygenase 0aBiocatalysis1 aKliewer, Serge1 aSick, Marko1 aBycinskij, Sergej1 aKleczka, Margarethe1 aRehbein, Julia1 aGriesbeck, Axel G.1 aZorn, Holger1 aMaison, Wolfgang0 tJournal of molecular catalysis.g2015 Nov., v. 121 p.15-21dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12410x1381-11777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2015.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245012000211300001400331520118900345592002801534650001501562650002501577650001501602650004301617650001901660650001501679651002001694653002301714653001601737653001901753653002201772653002201794700002301816700001701839700001901856700001901875700002801894700002001922773013601942856008802078852000902166655001202175IND60564439920221117050228.0181011e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056443992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNouri, Hamideh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7424-503010aNDVI, scale invariance and the modifiable areal unit problem: An assessment of vegetation in the Adelaide Parklands  ap. 11-18.  aThis research addresses the question as to whether or not the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is scale invariant (i.e. constant over spatial aggregation) for pure pixels of urban vegetation. It has been long recognized that there are issues related to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) pertaining to indices such as NDVI and images at varying spatial resolutions. These issues are relevant to using NDVI values in spatial analyses. We compare two different methods of calculation of a mean NDVI: 1) using pixel values of NDVI within feature/object boundaries and 2) first calculating the mean red and mean near-infrared across all feature pixels and then calculating NDVI. We explore the nature and magnitude of these differences for images taken from two sensors, a 1.24m resolution WorldView-3 and a 0.1m resolution digital aerial image. We apply these methods over an urban park located in the Adelaide Parklands of South Australia. We demonstrate that the MAUP is not an issue for calculation of NDVI within a sensor for pure urban vegetation pixels. This may prove useful for future rule-based monitoring of the ecosystem functioning of green infrastructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3agreen infrastructure 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 3aSouth Australia 0aVegetation indices 0aWorldView-3 0aAirborne image 0aVegetation pixels 0aLandscape ecology1 aAnderson, Sharolyn1 aSutton, Paul1 aBeecham, Simon1 aNagler, Pamela1 aJarchow, Christopher J.1 aRoberts, Dar A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 584-585 p.11-18dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01887naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011500172300001500287520080900302592002801111650001101139650000901150650001601159653002701175653002001202653002301222653000901245653000901254653001201263700002401275700002101299700002101320773009001341856008501431852000901516655001201525IND60086124820221116161541.0161018e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008612482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeeker, Harry C.10aAssessment of social interaction and anxiety-like behavior in senescence-accelerated-prone and -resistant mice  ap. 97-102.  aTwo members of the senescence-accelerated mouse group, SAMP8 and SAMP10, are characterized by learning and memory deficits, while the SAMR1 strain is not. In this study, we used two behavioral tests, social approach and object recognition and compared the results observed for the SAMP strains with those seen in the control strain, SAMR1. In social approach experiments, the 2 SAMP strains showed decreased sociability compared to SAMR1 as shown by their reluctance to spend time near a stranger mouse and increased immobility. In object recognition experiments, SAMP strains spent more time in the thigmotaxis zone and less time in the more exposed central zone than SAMR1 mice. From a behavioral standpoint, SAMP mice were less interactive and showed increased anxiety-like behavior compared to SAMR1.  aPublisher supplied data 3amemory 3amice 3athigmotaxis 0aSenescence-accelerated 0aSocial approach 0aObject recognition 0aSAMP 0aSAMR 0aAnxiety1 aChadman, Kathryn K.1 aHeaney, Agnes T.1 aCarp, Richard I.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2013 June 13, v. 118 p.97-102dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001400190245012400204300001600328500001500344520165500359592002802014650002102042650001502063650001102078650000902089650001502098650005202113650002002165650001202185650001902197650001302216650001202229650001202241650001202253650001502265650001802280650001602298650003502314653001002349700001902359700001402378700002002392773009002412856008302502990002302585852000902608655001202617IND60099449820221120133152.0141105e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009944982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.imlet.2013.09.0262doi7 aPMC71262132pmcid7 a241205102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Ji-Su10aIdentification of the polymorphisms in IFITM1 gene and their association in a Korean population with ulcerative colitis  ap. 118-122.  a2019-12-06  aInterferon inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM) family genes have been implicated in several cellular processes such as the homotypic cell adhesion functions of IFNs and cellular anti-proliferative activities. We previously showed that the IFITM3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC). The present study aimed to investigate whether the polymorphisms in the IFITM1 gene are associated with susceptibility to UC. We also evaluated the expression levels in the putative functional promoter polymorphisms to determine the change of their activity. Gene expression profiles in the tissues obtained from human digestive tracts by RT-PCR, and the possible variation sites and SNPs of IFITM1 were identified by direct sequencing method. Genotype analysis in the IFITM1 SNPs was performed by high resolution melting and TaqMan probe analysis, and the haplotype frequencies of IFITM1 SNPs for multiple loci were estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The expression levels in the putative functional promoter polymorphisms were evaluated by performing a luciferase reporter assay. We identified two SNPs and two variation sites, g.-1920G>A (rs77537847), g.-1547delA (novel) and g.-416C>G (rs11246062) in the promoter region, and g.364delA (rs200576757) in intron 1. The genotype and allele frequencies of the g.-1920G>A polymorphism of IFITM1 gene in the UC patients were significantly different from those of the healthy controls (P=0.002 and 0.042, respectively). These results suggest that the g.-1920G>A polymorphism in IFITM1 may be associated with susceptibility to UC.  aPublisher supplied data 3apromoter regions 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3aloci 3aluciferase 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3agene expression 3atissues 3agene frequency 3apatients 3amelting 3acolitis 3aintrons 3aalgorithms 3acell adhesion 3ainterferons 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0agenes1 aNa, Kyung-Sook1 aYu, Ji-In1 aChae, Soo-Cheon0 tImmunology Letters.g2013 , v. 156, no. 1-2 p.118-122dElsevier B.V.x0165-24787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2013.09.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245009000192300001600282520145400298592002801752650002401780650002101804650001701825650001301842650001701855650001301872650002401885650001001909650001601919650001801935650001201953650002201965650001701987650001202004650001102016650002002027650003002047650003802077650006602115650005102181650006102232650004502293650004002338650002802378650003302406650006102439650003902500650003702539700001902576700002902595700001902624700002202643700002402665700002202689700001902711773010002730856005502830852000902885655001202894IND4477420120221120070136.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447742012DNAL7 a217262322pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03810.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Msehli, Sarra10aCrucial role of (homo)glutathione in nitrogen fixation in Medicago truncatula nodules  ap. 496-506.  a• Legumes form a symbiotic interaction with bacteria of the Rhizobiaceae family to produce nitrogen‐fixing root nodules under nitrogen‐limiting conditions. We examined the importance of glutathione (GSH) and homoglutathione (hGSH) during the nitrogen fixation process. • Spatial patterns of the expression of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of both thiols were studied using promoter‐GUS fusion analysis. Genetic approaches using the nodule nitrogen‐fixing zone‐specific nodule cysteine rich (NCR001) promoter were employed to determine the importance of (h)GSH in biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). • The (h)GSH synthesis genes showed a tissue‐specific expression pattern in the nodule. Down‐regulation of the γ‐glutamylcysteine synthetase (γECS) gene by RNA interference resulted in significantly lower BNF associated with a significant reduction in the expression of the leghemoglobin and thioredoxin S1 genes. Moreover, this lower (h)GSH content was correlated with a reduction in the nodule size. Conversely, γECS overexpression resulted in an elevated GSH content which was correlated with increased BNF and significantly higher expression of the sucrose synthase‐1 and leghemoglobin genes. • Taken together, these data show that the plant (h)GSH content of the nodule nitrogen‐fixing zone modulates the efficiency of the BNF process, demonstrating their important role in the regulation of this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago truncatula 3aRNA interference 3aRhizobiaceae 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acysteine 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aleghemoglobin 3alegumes 3anitrogen fixation 3aroot nodules 3asucrose 3athiols 2aDown-Regulation 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlutathionexanalogs & derivativesxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aGlutathione Synthasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aMedicago truncatulaxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aNitrogen Fixationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRoot Nodules, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSinorhizobium melilotixmetabolism 2aSymbiosisxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aLambert, Annie1 aBaldacci‐Cresp, Fabien1 aHopkins, Julie1 aBoncompagni, Eric1 aSmiti, Samira Aschi1 aHérouart, Didier1 aFrendo, Pierre0 tnew phytologist.g2011 Oct., v. 192, no. 2 p.496-506dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03810.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013700173300001200310520155100322592002801873650002501901650002201926650001201948650002001960650001501980650001401995650001502009650001502024650001802039650001102057650001702068650001202085650002602097650001102123650001602134651000902150651001302159700002102172700002102193700001902214773010002233856008102333852000902414655001202423IND60572562920221119100431.0170718e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057256292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-017-3145-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatista, Frederico M.10aAsynchrony in settlement time between the closely related oysters Crassostrea angulata and C. gigas in Ria Formosa lagoon (Portugal)  ap. 110.  aThe Portuguese oyster Crassostrea angulata and the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas are very closely related species originating from Asia that were introduced in Europe. The objectives of the present study were to determine if there is asynchrony in settlement time of C. angulata and C. gigas larvae in an area where both taxa coexist and if hybridization between the two species occurs throughout the breeding season. Oyster collectors were deployed every two weeks during one year in two different sites in Ria Formosa lagoon (Portugal) and the oysters that settled were genotyped with nuclear and mitochondrial markers. Settlement of Crassostrea sp. was observed from April to November 2004 (n = 694), with two distinct periods. In the first period (April), when 19% of the oysters settled, the haplotypes and alleles characteristic of C. gigas were mainly observed. In the following settlement period (July to November), the frequency of haplotypes and alleles of C. gigas decreased over time while those characteristics of C. angulata reached high frequencies by the end of the settlement period. Our results suggest that C. gigas was able to reproduce at lower temperatures than C. angulata in spring. However, the non-significant allelic disequilibrium observed during almost all settlement periods suggests that hybridization is widespread in time. The results obtained in the present study show that there are differences in the reproductive behavior between C. angulata and C. gigas that may limit gene flow between the two species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea angulata 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aalleles 3abreeding season 3acollectors 3agene flow 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3ahybridization 3alarvae 3amitochondria 3aoysters 3areproductive behavior 3aspring 3atemperature 3aAsia 3aPortugal1 aFonseca, Vera G.1 aRuano, Francisco1 aBoudry, Pierre0 tMarine biology.g2017 May, v. 164, no. 5 p.110-110dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-017-3145-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245017100170300001800341520146200359592002801821650002301849650002101872650002301893650001601916650001501932650001301947650001101960650001901971650001401990650001502004650002502019653004302044653004302087653005702130653005602187653005602243653004202299653006002341653005102401653005702452653004702509653001802556653002402574653001502598653001602613653002102629700002702650700002002677700003402697773011002731856008602841852000902927655001202936IND60530312720221121135111.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053031272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabaei, Azadeh10aComparison of different trophic cultivations in microalgal membrane bioreactor containing N-riched wastewater for simultaneous nutrient removal and biomass production  ap. 1568-1575.  aIn this study, a submerged membrane was installed in a bioreactor to treat N-riched wastewater and obtain high biomass productivity. Chlorella vulgaris was cultivated under mixotrophic, heterotrophic, and photoautotrophic conditions in different kinds of nitrogen sources (nitrate and ammonium) to compare the microalgae growth and nutrient removal in a membrane bioreactor. Further, the respirometric and photosynthetic activities of microalgae were investigated to evaluate the viability of microalgae in different conditions. The highest biomass productivity was obtained under mixotrophic cultivation in ammonium source (0.230±0.009 gr/Ld). Moreover, with this type of cultivation and nitrogen source, specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) was higher than oxygen product rate (SOPR). However, SOPR improved in mixotrophic cultivation using nitrate source. In both nitrogen source types, the photosynthetic activity of mixotrophic microalgae was reduced at high cell density. Compared favorably with other cultivation types, mixotrophic microalgae could achieve high N and P removal rates (about 23.64–28.84 and 4.38–5.08mg/Ld, respectively). In all cultivation types (except photoautotrophic condition with nitrate source), N and P removal amounts were assimilated to biomass. Based on the obtained results, membrane bioreactor containing mixotrophic microalgae would be the most useful system for application in N-riched wastewater treatment systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aammonium nitrate 3abiomass production 3abioreactors 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3aviability 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aPotassium nitrate (PubChem CID: 24434) 0aAmmonium chloride (PubChem CID: 25517) 0aPotassium dihydrogen phosphate (Pubchem CID: 516951) 0aMagnesium sulfate heptahydrate (PubChem CID: 24843) 0aCalcium dichloride hexahydrate (PubChem CID: 24486) 0aIron(III)- edta (PubChem CID: 197149) 0aManganese dichloride tetrahydrate (PubChem CID: 643989) 0aZinc sulfate heptahydrate (PubChem CID: 24424) 0aCopper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (PubChem CID: 24463) 0aDialuminum trisulfate (PubChem CID: 24850) 0aHeterotrophic 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aMicroalgae 0aMixotrophic 0aPhotoautotrophic1 aMehrnia, Mohammad Reza1 aShayegan, Jalal1 aSarrafzadeh, Mohammad-Hossein0 tProcess biochemistry.g2016 Oct., v. 51, no. 10 p.1568-1575dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002900113040001800142100001700160245009000177300001600267520184200283592002802125650001502153650001702168650002302185650002002208650001002228650001202238650002002250650001402270650001802284650002202302650001602324650002502340650002502365650001502390650001902405651001102424651001402435651002502449651001402474653001502488653002302503653001702526653001302543653001602556653002102572653002402593653002102617700002302638700002502661700002102686700001702707700002702724700002302751773011402774856007502888852000902963655001202972IND60114909720221119062227.0141124e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011490972DNAL7 a236249272pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.12000582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarres, Laia10aReconstructing the evolution and biogeographic history of tribe Cardueae (Compositae)  ap. 867-882.  a• Premise of the study: Tribe Cardueae (thistles) forms one of the largest tribes in the family Compositae (2400 species), with representatives in almost every continent. The greatest species richness of Cardueae occurs in the Mediterranean region where it forms an important element of its flora. New fossil evidence and a nearly resolved phylogeny of Cardueae are used here to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of this group.• Methods: We performed maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA markers. Divergence times and ancestral area reconstructions for main lineages were estimated using penalized likelihood and dispersal–vicariance analyses, respectively, and integrated over the posterior distribution of the phylogeny from the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis to accommodate uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships.• Key results: The phylogeny shows that subtribe Cardopatiinae is sister to the remaining subtribes, and subtribes Carlininae and Echinopsinae appear as consecutive sister-clades to the Carduinae/Centaureinae. Tribe Cardueae is inferred to have originated around the Mid Eocene in West Asia, which is also the ancestral area of most subtribes within Cardueae. Diversification within each subtribe began during the Oligocene-Miocene period.• Conclusions: Most diversification events within Cardueae are related to the continuous cycles of area connection and division between the Anatolian microplate and the western Mediterranean Basin during the Oligocene-Miocene and with the uplift of the Himalayan range from the Miocene onward. From these two regions, thistles dispersed and colonized the rest of the continents (e.g., the New World, Africa, and Australia), most likely during the colder Pliocene-Pleistocene period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aMarkov chain 3aMonte Carlo method 3achloroplast DNA 3aflora 3afossils 3agenetic markers 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aspecies diversity 3auncertainty 2aAsteraceaexgenetics 2aBiological Evolution 2aDemography 2aPhylogeography 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 3aMediterranean region 3aWest Asia 0aBayes-DIVA 0aBering Land Bridge 0abiogeography 0aCardueae 0aCarduoideae 0aHimalayan uplift 0aMediterranean Basin 0amolecular dating1 aSanmartín, Isabel1 aAnderson, Cajsa Lisa1 aSusanna, Alfonso1 aBuerki, Sven1 aGalbany-Casals, Mercè1 aVilatersana, Roser0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2013 May, v. 100, no. 5 p.867-882dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.12000583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245012200169300002000291500001900311520131700330592002801647650001301675650002401688650002401712650001501736650000701751650001501758650001101773650001901784700002401803700003301827700002401860700002601884773012501910856007402035852000902109655001202118IND60715519820221122204927.0201028e20201023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071551982DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra06159j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranowska-Korczyc, Anna10aFacile synthesis of SnO₂ shell followed by microwave treatment for high environmental stability of Ag nanoparticles  ap. 38424-38436.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study describes a new method for passivating Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with SnO₂ layer and their further treatment by microwave irradiation. The one-step process of SnO₂ layer formation was carried out by adding sodium stannate to the boiling aqueous AgNPs solution, which resulted in the formation of core@shell Ag@SnO₂ nanoparticles. The coating formation was a tunable process, making it possible to obtain an SnO₂ layer thickness in the range from 2 to 13 nm. The morphology, size, zeta-potential, and optical properties of the Ag@SnO₂NPs were studied. The microwave irradiation significantly improved the environmental resistance of Ag@SnO₂NPs, which remained stable in different biological solutions such as NaCl at 150 mM and 0.1 M, Tris-buffered saline buffer at 0.1 M, and phosphate buffer at pH 5.6, 7.0, and 8.0. Ag@SnO₂NPs after microwave irradiation were also stable at biologically relevant pH values, both highly acidic (1.4) and alkaline (13.2). Moreover, AgNPs covered with a 13 nm-thick SnO₂ layer were resistant to cyanide up to 0.1 wt%. The microwave-treated SnO₂ shell can facilitate the introduction of AgNPs in various solutions and extend their potential application in biological environments by protecting the metal nanostructures from dissolution and aggregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyanides 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3ananosilver 3apH 3aphosphates 3asodium 3azeta potential1 aMackiewicz, Ewelina1 aRanoszek-Soliwoda, Katarzyna1 aGrobelny, Jarosław1 aCelichowski, Grzegorz0 tRSC advances.g2020 Oct. 23, v. 10, no. 63 p.38424-38436dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra06159j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011800169520193900287592002802226650001302254650001302267650001202280650002202292650002602314650001502340653002602355653001202381653001502393653002302408653002202431653001102453700001502464700002002479700002102499700002402520700001802544700002502562773009502587856008402682852000902766655001202775IND60738538820221122231705.0210713e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073853882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2021.1053162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Vliet, M.S.10aBaby's first bites: Association between observed maternal feeding behavior and infant vegetable intake and liking  aPositive experiences with the introduction of solid food in infancy may lead to positive associations with feeding in both parent and infant. During this transitional period, parental feeding behavior and infant eating behavior might mutually reinforce each other. A feeding style that is found to be associated with positive child eating behavior, is sensitive feeding. In the present study we tested bidirectional prospective relations between mother and infant behavior in a cross-lagged model using observations of two feeds on two consecutive days on which the first bites of solid food were offered. The sample consisted of 246 first-time mothers and their infants, whose feeding interactions were videotaped during two home visits. Maternal sensitive feeding behavior (consisting of responsiveness to child feeding cues, general sensitivity and non-intrusiveness) and maternal positive and negative affect were coded. In addition, infant vegetable intake was weighed and vegetable liking was reported by mother. Results showed at least some stability of maternal feeding behavior and infant vegetable intake and liking from the first to the second feed. In addition, during the second feed maternal sensitive feeding and positive affect were associated with infant vegetable intake (r=.34 and r=.14) and liking (r=.33 and r=.39). These associations were mostly absent during the first feed. Finally, infant vegetable liking during the first feed positively predicted maternal sensitive feeding behavior during the second feed (β=.25), suggesting that the infant's first response might influence maternal behavior. Taken together, mother and infant seem more attuned during the second feed than during the first feed. Future studies might include multiple observations over a longer time period, or micro-coding. Such insights can inform prevention programs focusing on optimizing feeding experiences during the weaning period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3achildren 3ainfancy 3amaternal behavior 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 0aComplementary feeding 0aWeaning 0aVegetables 0aResponsive feeding 0aSensitive feeding 0aInfant1 aMesman, J.1 aSchultink, J.M.1 ade Vries, J.H.M.1 aVereijken, C.M.J.L.1 aRippe, R.C.A.1 avan der Veek, S.M.C.0 tAppetite.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 165 p.105316-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1053163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245006900160300001600229520144500245592002801690650001501718650002301733650003401756650002601790700001601816700002201832700001601854773009201870856004801962852000902010655001202019IND4477267620221120155207.0120416e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447726762DNAL7 a10.1007/s12080-011-0111-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBest, Alex10aLocal transmission processes and disease-driven host extinctions  ap. 211-217.  aClassic infectious disease theory assumes that transmission depends on either the global density of the parasite (for directly transmitted diseases) or its global frequency (for sexually transmitted diseases). One important implication of this dichotomy is that parasite-driven host extinction is only predicted under frequency-dependent transmission. However, transmission is fundamentally a local process between individuals that is determined by their and/or their vectorâs behaviour. We examine the implications of local transmission processes to the likelihood of disease-driven host extinction. Local density-dependent transmission can lead to parasite-driven extinction, but extinction is more likely under local frequency-dependent transmission and much more likely when there is active local searching behaviour. Density-dependent directly transmitted diseases spread locally can therefore lead to deterministic host extinction, but locally frequency-dependent passive vector-borne diseases are more likely to cause extinctions. However, it is active searching behaviour either by a vector or between sexual partners that is most likely to cause the host to go extinct. Our work emphasises that local processes are essential in determining parasite-driven extinctions, and the role of parasites in the extinction of rare species may have been underplayed due to the classic assumption of global density-dependent transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextinction 3asearching behavior 3asexually transmitted diseases 3avector-borne diseases1 aWebb, Steve1 aAntonovics, Janis1 aBoots, Mike0 tTheoretical ecology.g2012 May, v. 5, no. 2 p.211-217dSpringer-Verlagx1874-17387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-011-0111-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009100161300001800252520161700270592002801887650002301915650001301938650001101951650001101962650003101973650002202004650001402026650001802040650001102058650001502069650001902084650004302103650000902146700002302155700002202178700001802200700001902218700001902237773012602256856008102382852000902463655001202472IND60572563220221119100400.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057256322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8130-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudek, L.10aPeroxide reduction by a metal-dependent catalase in Nostoc punctiforme (cyanobacteria)  ap. 3781-3800.  aThis study investigated the role of a novel metal-dependent catalase (Npun_R4582) that reduces hydrogen peroxide in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that npun_R4582 relative mRNA levels were upregulated by over 16-fold in cells treated with either 2 μM added Co, 0.5 μM added Cu, 500 μM Mn, 1 μM Ni, or 18 μM Zn. For cells treated with 60 μM H₂O₂, no significant alteration in Npun_R4582 relative mRNA levels was detected, while in cells treated with Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, or Zn and 60 μM peroxide, relative mRNA levels were generally above control or peroxide only treated cells. Disruption or overexpression of npun_R4582 altered sensitivity to cells exposed to 60 μM H₂O₂ and metals for treatments beyond the highest viable concentrations, or in a mixed metal solution for Npun_R4582⁻ cells. Moreover, overexpression of npun_R4582 increased cellular peroxidase activity in comparison with wild-type and Npun_R4582⁻ cells, and reduced peroxide levels by over 50%. The addition of cobalt, manganese, nickel, and zinc increased the capacity of Npun_R4582 to reduce the rate or total levels of peroxide produced by cells growing under photooxidative conditions. The work presented confirms the function of NpunR4582 as a catalase and provides insights as to how cells reduce potentially lethal peroxide levels produced by photosynthesis. The findings also show how trace elements play crucial roles as enzymatic cofactors and how the role of Npun_R4582 in hydrogen peroxide breakdown is dependent on the type of metal and the level available to cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc punctiforme 3acatalase 3acobalt 3acopper 3agene expression regulation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amanganese 3amessenger RNA 3anickel 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3azinc1 aTorriero, A.

Two generalized feedforward networks were separately developed by using the operation conditions as inputs. Results based on the highest numerical quantities of the correlation coefficients between the experimental versus predicted values, showed proper fitting. Sensitivity analysis results of selected ANNs showed that among the input variables, frying temperature was the most sensitive to moisture content (MC) and fat content (FC) compared to other variables. Sensitivity analysis results of selected ANNs showed that MC and FC were the most sensitive to frying temperature compared to other input variables. Similarly, for the second ANN architecture, microwave power density was the most impressive variable having the maximum influence on both shrinkage percentage and color changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acorrelation 3afrying 3aimage analysis 3alipid content 3amass transfer 3ameat 3amodels 3aostriches 3ashrinkage 3atemperature 3awater content 2aAnimals 2aColor 2aCooking 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMicrowaves 2aModels, Theoretical 2aMolecular Weight 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistry 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aStruthioniformes 2aTemperature 0aDeep-fat frying 0aOstrich meat 0aMass transfer 0aColor changes 0aShrinkage 0aArtificial neural network1 aMohebbi, Mohebbat1 aKhodaiyan, Faramarz0 tMeat science.g2014 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.172-178dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2013.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012600169300001800295520148600313592002801799650001701827650001301844650001801857650001901875650001101894650001301905650004401918650001401962650001501976650002501991650002102016650001402037650001902051650002002070650001802090650001402108650001302122650001502135700002502150700002102175700002602196700003402222700002802256773012602284856008102410852000902491655001202500IND60572563320221119100440.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057256332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8128-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerruchon, Chiara10aIsolation of a bacterial consortium able to degrade the fungicide thiabendazole: the key role of a Sphingomonas phylotype  ap. 3881-3893.  aThiabendazole (TBZ) is a fungicide used in fruit-packaging plants. Its application leads to the production of wastewaters requiring detoxification. In the absence of efficient treatment methods, biological depuration of these effluents could be a viable alternative. However, nothing is known regarding the microbial degradation of the recalcitrant and toxic to aquatics TBZ. We report the isolation, via enrichment cultures from a polluted soil, of the first bacterial consortium able to rapidly degrade TBZ and use it as a carbon source. Repeated efforts using various culture-dependent approaches failed to isolate TBZ-degrading bacteria in axenic cultures. Denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning showed that the consortium was composed of α-, β- and γ-Proteobacteria. Culture-independent methods including antibiotics-driven selection with DNA/RNA-DGGE, q-PCR and stable isotope probing (SIP)-DGGE identified a Sphingomonas phylotype (B13) as the key degrading member. Cross-feeding studies with structurally related chemicals showed that ring substituents of the benzimidazole moiety (thiazole or furan rings) favoured the cleavage of the imidazole moiety. LC-MS/MS analysis verified that TBZ degradation proceeds via cleavage of the imidazole moiety releasing thiazole-4-carboxamidine, which was not further transformed, and the benzoyl moiety, possibly as catechol, which was eventually consumed by the bacterial consortium as suggested by SIP-DGGE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphingomonas 3abacteria 3abenzimidazole 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acatechol 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aeffluents 3afungicides 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3aisotope labeling 3aphylotype 3apolluted soils 3astable isotopes 3athiabendazole 3athiazoles 3atoxicity 3awastewater1 aChatzinotas, Antonis1 aOmirou, Michalis1 aVasileiadis, Sotirios1 aMenkissoglou-Spiroudi, Urania1 aKarpouzas, Dimitrios G.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2017 May, v. 101, no. 9 p.3881-3893dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8128-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002300170245015300193300001600346520159600362592002801958650001301986650002201999650001002021650001802031650002002049650002102069650002302090650001202113650004302125650004002168650003602208650001102244650003202255650004102287650001102328650003202339650003202371650001602403650004102419653003202460653001902492653002302511653002002534773010102554856008602655852000902741655001202750IND50070070720221118172618.0190402e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007007072DNAL7 a238961532pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2013.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenzo, José M.,10aInfluence of the type of fiber coating and extraction time on foal dry-cured loin volatile compounds extracted by solid-phase microextraction (SPME)  ap. 179-186.  aExtraction of dry-cured loin volatile compounds by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was optimized. Two different fiber coatings: carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) and divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS), and three extraction times (15, 30 and 45min) were assayed. Between the fibers tested, CAR/PDMS coated fibers extracted between two and three times more total amount of volatile compounds than the DVD/CAR/PDMS coating (1314×106 vs. 526×106 area units). Fifty five compounds were extracted by the CAR/PDMS fiber, while only 48 of these were found with the DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber. On the other hand, 6 additional volatile compounds were extracted by the CAR/PDMS coating, all of them being of low molecular weight. Three of the major compounds extracted, hexanoic acid, methyl ester; butanoic acid, 3-methyl-, methyl ester and hexanal, were found in high proportion in both fiber coatings. The effect of exposure time was more marked for the DVD/CAR/PDMS fiber than for the CAR/PDMS coating. Fifteen minutes of extraction provided a volatile compounds profile with lower area counts for most compounds and significantly different to that obtained with 30 and 45min of extraction. The extraction yields of dry-cured loin volatile compounds varied according to the fiber coating used and the time of exposure. Therefore, extraction conditions should be selected depending on the objective of the study. Finally, it can be concluded that both porous fibers tested, CAR/PDMS and DVB/CAR/PDMS, provide a similar volatile compounds profile for dry-cured foal loin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3aexposure duration 3afoals 3ahexanoic acid 3amicroextraction 3amolecular weight 3avolatile compounds 2aAnimals 2aButyric Acidxisolation & purification 2aCaproatesxisolation & purification 2aDimethylpolysiloxanesxanalysis 2aEsters 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHorses 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistry 2aSolid Phase Microextraction 2aTemperature 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 0aSolid-phase microextraction 0aDry-cured loin 0aVolatile compounds 0aExtraction time0 tMeat science.g2014 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.179-186dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2013.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012900168300001400297520143100311592002801742650002401770650002401794650003101818650000901849650001301858650001401871650002301885651001901908700001801927700001901945700001601964700002601980700001802006700002102024700002002045700002002065773010502085856004802190852000902238655001202247IND4465359620221120155143.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446535962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-011-9818-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurukawa, Seishiro10aVertical movement of dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus as recorded by acceleration data-loggers in the northern East China Sea  ap. 89-99.  aEnvironmental changes influence foraging behavior for most animals. Dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus, are epipelagic predators and have a cosmopolitan tropical to warm-temperate (>20Â°C) distribution. We simultaneously obtained the ambient temperature and the foraging behavior (i.e., swimming speed, depth and tailbeat acceleration) of dolphinfish, using an acceleration data-logger in May, September, October, November 2007, June 2008, May and July 2010 for 8 individuals. Although the dolphinfish spent a mean Â± standard deviation of 43.4âÂ±â27.7% of their time at the surface (0â5Â m), dive excursions from the surface (DES) were observed in all individuals and maximum DES depths ranged from 50.1 to 95.4Â m. DES events resulted dives below the thermocline for these dolphinfish, and there was a significantly positive relationship between the isothermal layer depth (ILD) and DES depth. Our results demonstrate that dolphinfish avoided the rapid thermal change beyond the thermocline, and their prey is most likely found in the upper layers of the thermocline. Gliding behavior during the DES phase was also observed and dolphinfish gradually descended to deeper waters with gliding. The gliding time was longer when the ILD was deeper, and fish tended to dive deeper. We suggest that dolphinfish adopt gliding behavior to search a broader range of depths for prey, while minimizing energy use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoryphaena hippurus 3aambient temperature 3aenergy use and consumption 3afish 3aforaging 3apredators 3asearching behavior 3aEast China Sea1 aKawabe, Ryō,1 aOhshimo, Seiji1 aFujioka, Ko1 aNishihara, Gregory N.1 aTsuda, Yuichi1 aAoshima, Takashi1 aKanehara, Hisao1 aNakata, Hideaki0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2011 Sept., v. 92, no. 1 p.89-99dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9818-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015700170300001800327520137300345592002801718650004001746650002801786650001801814650003201832650001701864650001901881650001501900650002201915650001701937650000901954650001401963650001501977650001701992650001802009650001302027650001602040650000902056700002702065700002002092700002302112773012602135856008102261852000902342655001202351IND60572563420221119100435.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057256342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8131-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeteikytė, Aušra10aSequential application of waste whey as a medium component for Kluyveromyces lactis cultivation and a co-feeder for lipase immobilization by CLEA method  ap. 3617-3626.  aCurrently, much attention is paid to technologies which can be drivers of the circular economy across different sectors, in particular, to develop technologies for utilization or reusability of biocompatible materials from industrial waste. One of such is the milk whey, which is a cheap biobased raw material, the disposal of which is a major problem for the dairy industry. Our proposed and investigated technology is based on a continuous exploitation of the whey combining microbiology and biotechnology. Primarily, whey was used as a nutrition source for the cultivation of Kluyveromyces lactis with the aim to produce the targeted biocatalyst—lipase. During cultivation, the whey was transformed into the hydrolyzed form, which was further successfully applied as a protein feeder (external linker) for immobilization of lipase by cross-linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) method. The first time use of whey as a co-feeder for immobilization of enzymes by CLEA method has shown promising results and increased the stability of lipases for temperature and organic solvents. Hydrolysis of rapeseed oil catalyzed with immobilized derivatives was obtained with 45–96% efficiency at non-optimized conditions. Additionally, the determined kinetic parameters indicated that the rate of p-nitrophenyl palmitate hydrolysis was not changed drastically after immobilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3abiocompatible materials 3abiotechnology 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acrosslinking 3adairy industry 3ahydrolysis 3aindustrial wastes 3amicrobiology 3amilk 3anutrition 3apalmitates 3arapeseed oil 3araw materials 3asolvents 3atemperature 3awhey1 aŠiekštelė, Rimantas1 aTvaska, Bronius1 aMatijošytė, Inga0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2017 May, v. 101, no. 9 p.3617-3626dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8131-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245016500215300001600380520160900396592002802005596008002033596007202113650002602185650003002211650001202241650001502253650003002268650002202298650002202320650001502342650002702357650002302384650002702407650001002434650001302444651001102457700002602468700003602494773012102530856008202651852000902733655001202742IND60677590120221120185011.0191130e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067759012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10709-019-00076-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Ariany Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6887-536210aGenetic variability and effective population size in Hymenaea stigonocarpa (Fabaceae) germplasm collection: tools for breeding programs and genetic conservation  ap. 359-368.  aThe conservation of plant genetic resources is essential for breeding programs. Regarding the native species of the Brazilian Cerrado biome, many studies have demonstrated their high potential for use in both medicines and foods. Hymenaea stigonocarpa, a tree with wide occurrence in the Cerrado, has economic importance, and due its extractive use, the establishment of a breeding program is relevant for sustainable use and conservation. Thus, the first germplasm collection of the species was installed at the Federal University of Goiás (UFG). To know the magnitude of genetic variability and how it was distributed in the collection, 353 individuals, distributed in 119 families from 24 subpopulations collected in the Cerrado biome, were genotyped using capillary electrophoresis. Nine pairs of microsatellite markers were genotyped. The UFG germplasm collection showed a high level of genetic diversity (mean [Formula: see text] = 0.554) at the evaluated loci. By Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), a significant genetic structure was detected (θP = 0.152, p < 0.01), which was expected since the subpopulations that originated the germplasm collection were collected in geographically distant locations. In addition, the germplasm collection had a population effective size of 54.9 and presented an allelic representation of 79.89% compared to 32 natural subpopulations. These results demonstrate that the germplasm collection preserves a high genetic diversity of H. stigonocarpa with a population effective size considered sufficient for the conduction of a breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data  aDS-1599817cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a465610/2014-5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Goiás 3aHymenaea stigonocarpa 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acerrado 3aecosystems 3aeffective population size 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3agermplasm conservation 3aindigenous species 3amicrosatellite repeats 3atrees 3avariance 3aBrazil1 aChaves, Lázaro José1 ade Campos Telles, Mariana Pires0 tGenetica.g2019 Dec., v. 147, no. 5-6 p.359-368dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl1577x0016-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-019-00076-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245014300160300001600303520081600319592002801135650001701163650000901180650001001189650001901199650003101218650002201249650001201271653000801283653001501291653000901306653001101315653001401326700003101340700001601371700001501387773013501402856007801537852000901615655001201624IND60520604720221123031713.0160522e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052060472DNAL7 a10.1515/pjvs-2016-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRychlik, A.10aClinical, endoscopic and histopathological evaluation of the efficacy of budesonide in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in dogs  ap. 159-164.  aThis study evaluates the efficacy of budesonide in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in dogs based on the results of clinical, endoscopic and histopathological examinations. The severity of clinical symptoms was assessed based on CIBDAI scores, and macroscopic and histopathological changes were described in accordance with the recommendations of the WSAVA Gastrointestinal Standardization Group for 2008. The results of the experiment revealed that budesonide does not offer effective treatment for canine IBD. The tested drug failed to alleviate the clinical symptoms of disease, lower CIBDAI scores, or improve the macroscopic appearance of intestinal mucosa. The effectiveness of budesonide was most highly evaluated in the histopathological picture of duodenal, jejunal and colonic mucosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3adog diseases 3adogs 3adrugs 3ahistopathology 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aintestinal mucosa 3ajejunum 0aIBD 0abudesonide 0adogs 0aCIBDAI 0aendoscopy1 aKołodziejska-Sawerska, A.1 aNowicki, M.1 aSzweda, M.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 19, no. 1 p.159-164dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:J000000145x2300-25577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjvs-2016-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245006900175300001800244520119000262592002801452650002301480650002001503650001101523650001601534650001501550650001401565650002201579650002801601650001001629650001901639650002301658650001901681650001401700650001301714650001801727653001401745653001801759653001201777653001801789653001501807653002301822700001801845700002201863700007101885773011001956856008602066852000902152655001202161IND60530313220221122051715.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053031322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatyamurthy, Prasad10aNanocellulose induces cellulase production in Trichoderma reesei  ap. 1452-1457.  aNanocellulose prepared by controlled microbial hydrolysis (NCm) induced secretion of complete array of cellulase by the fungus, Trichoderma reesei. The nanocellulose prepared by conventional sulphuric acid hydrolysis (NCa) and high pressure homogenization process (NFC) were also evaluated in this study in addition to two commercial inducers namely, sophorose and cellobiose. Batch culture was grown on Mandel’s basal salt medium added with cellulose as the sole carbon source. Cell growth, substrate concentration and cellulase production were analysed over a period of 5days. NCa, due to attachment of sulphate groups on surface, inhibited the growth of the fungus. NFC could not effectively induce secretion of cellulase as it tends to aggregate due to high aspect ratio (>1000). While sophorose induced an incomplete array of cellulase that too only up to 2h, cellobiose induced complete array with 65% substrate utilization over a period of 5days. NCm induced complete array of cellulase with 80% substrate utilized over a period of 5days. This is attributed to higher crystallinity that helped in slower degradation and steady release of molecules needed for enzyme induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aacid hydrolysis 3acarbon 3acell growth 3acellobiose 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afungi 3agene induction 3agrowth retardation 3ahomogenization 3asecretion 3asulfates 3asulfuric acid 0aCellulose 0aCrystallinity 0aInducer 0aNanocellulose 0aSuspension 0aTrichoderma reesei1 aJain, Prateek1 aKarande, Vilas S.1 aNadanathangam, Vigneshwaran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2330-82730 tProcess biochemistry.g2016 Oct., v. 51, no. 10 p.1452-1457dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013300160300001400293520160300307592002801910650002401938650002101962650002601983650002202009650001102031650001302042650001302055650001102068650002602079650001702105650001802122650001802140650001602158650001202174700001802186700002302204700003102227700003302258773010102291856007302392852000902465655001202474IND60137782020221120175654.0150524e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013778202DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.122132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomma, André T.14aThe eye of the red‐eared slider turtle: morphologic observations and reference values for selected ophthalmic diagnostic tests  ap. 61-70.  aPURPOSE: To perform a descriptive investigation of the red‐eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) eye, performing selected ophthalmic diagnostic tests with the aim of establishing normal reference values for this species. METHOD: Thirty adult healthy red‐eared slider turtles were used to establish normal ophthalmic test values in this investigation. Selected ophthalmic tests included: collection of material for bacterial culture analysis, esthesiometry, intraocular pressure (IOP), A‐ and B‐mode ultrasonic biometry, fundus photography, and central corneal thickness (CCT). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Normal parameters found for the ocular diagnostic tests were: esthesiometry: 5.84 ± 0.48 cm; IOP: 5.42 ± 1.70 mmHg; CCT: 154.5 ± 0.14 μm; palpebral fissure length: 9.71 ± 0.55 mm; modified Schirmer tear test: 2.55 ± 3.4 mm; globe axial length: 7.60 ± 0.23 mm; anterior chamber depth: 0.76 ± 0.23 mm; lens axial length: 2.45 ± 0.28 mm; vitreous chamber depth: 4.31 ± 0.42 mm. An avascular retinal pattern with nerve fibers radiating from the small white circular optic disk was observed. None of the animals had a conus papillaris. The most frequent bacteria found were Bacillus spp. (33.33%) followed by Proteus vulgaris (20.69%) and Staphylococcus aureus (18.39%). No significant differences between left and right eyes or genders were found for any of the results. Reference data and morphologic observations obtained in this investigation might help veterinary ophthalmologists to diagnose ocular diseases in the red‐eared slider turtle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aProteus vulgaris 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aTrachemys scripta 3aadults 3abacteria 3abiometry 3acornea 3adiagnostic techniques 3anerve fibers 3anormal values 3aophthalmology 3aphotography 3aturtles1 aLima, Leandro1 aLange, Rogério R.1 aTurner‐Giannico, Amália1 aMontiani‐Ferreira, Fabiano0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2015 Jan., v. 18 Suppl s1 p.61-70dBlackwell Sciencex1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.122133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010200158300002000260500001900280520103500299592002801334650002901362650001701391650004101408650001801449650001801467650002201485650001601507650001501523650002401538650001601562650002201578700002201600700001701622700002201639700002201661700002301683773012501706856007401831852000901905655001201914IND60715520320221120201101.0201028e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071552032DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra06365g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoji, Mitsuo10aUnique protonation states of aspartate and topaquinone in the active site of copper amine oxidase  ap. 38631-38639.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe oxidative deamination of biogenic amines, crucial in the metabolism of a wealth of living organisms, is catalyzed by copper amine oxidases (CAOs). In this work, on the ground of accurate molecular modeling, we provide a clear insight into the unique protonation states of the key catalytic aspartate residue Asp298 and the prosthetic group of topaquinone (TPQ) in the CAO of Arthrobacter globiformis (AGAO). This provides both extensions and complementary information to the crystal structure determined by our recent neutron diffraction (ND) experiment. The hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations suggest that the ND structure closely resembles a state in which Asp298 is protonated and the TPQ takes an enolate form. The TPQ keto form can coexist in the fully protonated state. The energetic and structural analyses indicate that the active site structure of the AGAO crystal is not a single state but rather a mixture of the different protonation and conformational states identified in this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobacter globiformis 3aactive sites 3aamine and amino acid oxidoreductases 3aaspartic acid 3acalcium oxide 3acrystal structure 3adeamination 3ametabolism 3aneutron diffraction 3aprotonation 3aquantum mechanics1 aMurakawa, Takeshi1 aBoero, Mauro1 aShigeta, Yasuteru1 aHayashi, Hideyuki1 aOkajima, Toshihide0 tRSC advances.g2020 Oct. 21, v. 10, no. 63 p.38631-38639dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra06365g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03570naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245020400175520185200379592002802231650002002259650001202279650003102291650001802322650001102340650001302351650001202364650001302376650001502389650001202404650001402416650001502430650001602445650001202461650001802473650002102491650001102512650001102523650001302534651001002547653001002557653002002567653001302587653001502600653001302615700002002628700002002648700002202668700002102690700002502711700006002736773009702796856009002893852000902983655001202992IND60787276520221123035131.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078727652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInfante, José,10aCryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. in wild rodents: using occupancy models to estimate drivers of occurrence and prevalence in native forest and exotic Pinus radiata plantations from Central Chile  aThe conversion of native forest to forestry plantations is a worldwide practice, affecting biodiversity and host-parasite interactions. One of the most common timber plantations in the world are monocultures of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata). Using occupancy models, we analyzed the occurrence and prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts in fecal samples of wild rodents from a landscape dominated by extensive Monterey pine plantations in central Chile. We aimed to assess drivers of parasite infection such as habitat type, abundance of rodent hosts, species richness, and season. Small mammals were sampled seasonally for two years in three habitat types: native forests, adult pine plantations and young pine plantations. A total of 1091 fecal samples from seven small mammal species were analyzed by coprological analysis. Occurrence probability of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. was similar for the most abundant rodent species (Abrothrix longipilis, A. olivacea, and Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) and for all habitat types. For Cryptosporidium spp., variation in prevalence was mostly explained by season with higher prevalence during winter season and lower during spring. For Giardia spp., the prevalence was significantly higher in young pine plantations, followed by adult pine plantations and native forests. In addition, higher prevalence of Giardia spp. was associated with lower host richness, suggesting a possible dilution effect. Our findings reveal that Monterey pine plantations increase Giardia spp. transmission among rodents, but has no clear effect on Cryptosporidium spp., providing evidence that the impact of land use on parasitism can be idiosyncratic. Since both parasites have zoonotic potential, our findings may be useful for land use planning and management considering health issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aGiardia 3aOligoryzomys longicaudatus 3aPinus radiata 3aadults 3aforestry 3aforests 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aprobability 3arodents 3asmall mammals 3aspecies richness 3aspring 3awinter 3azoonoses 3aChile 0aChile 0aLand-use change 0aRodentia 0aParasitism 0aZoonosis1 aRiquelme, Maira1 aHuerta, Natalia1 aOettinger, Sofía1 aFredes, Fernando1 aSimonetti, Javier A.1 aRubio, André V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7297-95350 tActa tropica.g2022 Nov., v. 235 p.106635-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245008600174506011700260506007600377520112100453592002801574506003701602650002601639650002401665650001901689650002301708650001401731650001701745650002001762653001601782653001001798653002101808653001201829653000701841653000801848653000901856653000801865653000901873653000701882653000701889653000701896653000701903700002101910700001901931700002301950700002101973700002401994773009702018856009002115852000902205655001202214IND60787276620221207123106.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078727662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuji, Yukiteru10aSchistosoma mansoni larvae in vitro cultures using Biomphalaria glabrata extracts  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSchistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent waterborne parasitic diseases affecting humans. In natural conditions, snails are necessary for maintenance of its lifecycle and also required as intermediate hosts to maintain the lifecycle in laboratory settings. In the present study, the location of S. mansoni larvae in Biomphalaria glabrata snails after infection (inoculation of miracidia) was investigated. Larvae were found located in the head-foot (HF) area of B. glabrata snails at 10 days post-infection (DPI), then their location was predominantly changed to the hepatopancreas and ovotestis (HPOT) area by 56 DPI. Next, the effects of extracts from various organs of B. glabrata snails including HF and HPOT for in vitro culturing of S. mansoni larvae were investigated. The HF extract enabled prolonged culturing of S. mansoni larvae. Furthermore, sequential use of that followed by the HPOT extract supported larval development or reproduction of daughter sporocysts. These results may provide important information for identifying essential factors and molecules for culturing Schistosoma larvae in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBiomphalaria glabrata 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3ahepatopancreas 3alarval development 3amiracidia 3areproduction 3aschistosomiasis 0aSchistosoma 0aSnail 0aIn vitro culture 0aExtract 0aHF 0aDPI 0aHPOT 0aH&E 0aTPBS 0aCt 0aHr 0aSW 0aSm1 aHamasaki, Megumi1 aMisu, Masayasu1 aKitamura, Tomotaka1 aHamano, Shinjiro1 aYoshikawa, Masahide0 tActa tropica.g2022 Nov., v. 235 p.106636-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011800167300001600285520160200301592002801903650002801931650001801959650000901977650001801986650002002004650001602024650001502040650002002055650001902075650002302094650001002117650001402127650001002141650001202151700001402163700001802177700001802195700002102213773011302234856008802347852000902435655001202444IND4477978320221120165918.0150812e20120810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447797832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillet, S.10aEffect of feed processing on growth performance and gastric mucosa integrity in pigs from weaning until slaughter  ap. 175-181.  aThe effect of technological treatments on the performances from 1 week after weaning until slaughter and on the gastric mucosa integrity of growing-finishing pigs at slaughter was investigated. We compared a diet expanded at high pressure and temperature (expandate) with a diet expanded under milder conditions that was subsequently pelleted and crumbled (crumble) and an untreated control diet (meal). At weaning, a total of 180 pigs (8.4Â±0.8kg) were divided over 30 pens of 6 animals, with 10 pens per treatment. Feed structure had a clear impact on performance results. However, while the expanded and the crumbled feed was used more efficiently (P=0.003), feed intake was considerably higher on the meal feed (P=0.003). Between start and slaughter, this led to a similar growth in the three groups (P=0.898). Apparent faecal digestibility of dry matter (P=0.843) or crude protein (P=0.726) did not differ between the diets. The ulcer score was affected by the feed structure (P<0.001). Pigs on the meal diet had the lowest ulcer score, those on the expandate an intermediate score and those on the crumbled diet the highest score, with all diets being significantly different from each other (P<0.05). The number of Helicobacter suis bacteria per gram of mucus was lower on the meal than on the expandate or the crumbled feed. In conclusion, it can be stated that expanding and pelleting improved feed efficiency of growing-finishing pigs. However, these technological treatments had a negative impact on gastric mucosa integrity and were associated with an increased H. suis colonisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter heilmannii 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed meals 3afeed processing 3agastric mucosa 3agrowth performance 3amucus 3aslaughter 3aswine 3aweaning1 aKumar, S.1 aDe Boever, J.1 aDucatelle, R.1 aDe Brabander, D.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2012 Aug. 10, v. 175, no. 3-4 p.175-181dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013500164300001200299520139000311592002801701650002101729650001301750650000801763650001301771650001201784650002701796650001101823650001601834650001401850650002001864650001101884650002501895700002201920700002001942700001701962773012401979856008102103852000902184655001202193IND60574462520221119231011.0170816e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057446252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3462-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiavola, A.10aOptimization of Energy Consumption in the Biological Reactor of a Wastewater Treatment Plant by Means of Oxy Fuzzy and ORP Control  ap. 277.  aAeration of the biological reactor in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) represents one of the major cost items, which may account for more than 50% of the total energy consumption. Therefore, airflow rate must be supplied based on the real needs of the biological reactions and the goals to be achieved in terms of removal efficiency and effluent quality. Among the different strategies available to optimize energy consumption of air supply, the Oxy Fuzzy logic and oxidation reduction potential (ORP)-based control systems have proven to be efficient and reliable. The present study compares the effects of these two control systems in terms of energy consumption and efficiency of COD and ammonia oxidation in the activated sludge reactors of two WWTPs for domestic sewage. Both systems allowed to largely comply with the limits set on the effluent for COD and ammonia in spite of the dynamic pattern of the influent load. The Oxy Fuzzy system led to reducing energy consumption by 13% while the ORP control system only by 2%, as average per year. The Oxy Fuzzy system showed higher flexibility, being more capable of adapting the set-points in relation to the influent load. The ORP system seemed to be more suitable for plants where the influent load does not change significantly: the set-points are fixed and the input load can be properly managed only for limited variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aaeration 3aair 3aair flow 3aammonia 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenergy 3afuzzy logic 3aoxidation 3aredox potential 3asewage 3awastewater treatment1 aRomano, Ruggiero,1 aBongirolami, S.1 aGiulioli, S.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Aug., v. 228, no. 8 p.277-277dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3462-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009800166520118900264592002801453650001301481650001201494650000901506650001201515653001201527653001401539653001601553653002401569653001101593653001001604700002201614700001801636773009501654856008401749852000901833655001201842IND60738539320221123002554.0210713e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073853932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2021.1053262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Cin Cin10aAssociations between supportive and undermining coparenting and controlling feeding practices  aParents play an important role in shaping child eating and weight outcomes through feeding practices. Controlling feeding practices are positively related to child obesogenic eating and obesity risk. Although many parents’ characteristics have been examined in relation to controlling feeding practices, less is known about the role of coparenting. The current study seeks to examine whether coparenting (supportive versus undermining) predict controlling feeding practices (use of food for emotion regulation, food as a reward, pressure to eat, restriction for health, restriction for weight). A total of 160 parents (56% females) of preschool-aged children between 3- and 5-years old completed an online survey. After accounting for parent characteristics (i.e., sex, BMI, age), regression analyses showed that supportive coparenting was not predictive of controlling feeding practices. However, regression analyses showed that undermining coparenting predicted greater use of food for emotion regulation, food as a reward, and restriction for weight, but was not predictive of pressure to eat and restriction for health. Implications associated with these findings are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3aobesity 3arisk 3asurveys 0aSupport 0aUndermine 0aCoparenting 0aControlling feeding 0aParent 0aChild1 aHerzog, Noelle K.1 aMhanna, Asmaa0 tAppetite.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 165 p.105326-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1053263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011500155300002000270500001900290520136100309592002801670650002201698650003701720650001301757650001801770650001601788650001101804650002101815650002201836650001201858650001101870650001501881650001401896650003701910650001601947700001601963700001301979700001701992700001802009700001902027700001802046773012502064856007402189852000902263655001202272IND60715520520221122041526.0201028e20201019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071552052DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra06453j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Danhua10aSelf-template formation of porous Co₃O₄ hollow nanoprisms for non-enzymatic glucose sensing in human serum  ap. 38369-38377.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel type of porous Co₃O₄ hollow nanoprism (HNP) was successfully prepared using tetragonal cobalt acetate hydroxide [Co₅(OH)₂(OAc)₈·2H₂O] as precursor by a facile solvothermal process and a subsequent calcination treatment. The morphology and structure of the Co₃O₄ HNPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and N₂ adsorption–desorption measurements. An enzyme-free glucose sensor was constructed based on the Co₃O₄ HNPs, and the electrochemical performance was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry. The as-prepared sensor exhibited a good electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation at the applied potential of 0.6 V in alkaline solution, with a high sensitivity of 19.83 μA mM⁻¹ cm⁻² and a high upper limit of 30 mM, which provide the potential for direct determination of blood glucose without any dilution pretreatment. The Co₃O₄ HNPs had a porous and tubular structure with a large amount of accessible active sites, which enhanced the mass diffusion and accelerated the electron transfer. Moreover, the sensor also demonstrated a desirable stability, selectivity and reproducibility, and could verify the non-enzymatic analysis of glucose in real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetates 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ananoprisms 3aoxidation 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avoltammetry1 aYang, Yunqi1 aNi, Xiao1 aDong, Jinnan1 aQiu, Qianying1 aChu, Xue-Qiang1 aChen, Xiaojun0 tRSC advances.g2020 Oct. 19, v. 10, no. 63 p.38369-38377dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra06453j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245010700214300001200321506007600333520133200409592002801741506003701769650001701806650001601823650002001839650001801859650001701877650001101894650001201905650002001917650001401937650003101951650001101982650001801993700001902011700002402030773014102054856008202195852000902277655001202286IND60574462620221207082814.0180619e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057446262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3449-72doi7 aPMC55018982pmcid7 a287478062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaborowska, Magdalena10aBrown Algae and Basalt Meal in Maintaining the Activity of Arylsulfatase of Soil Polluted with Cadmium  ap. 267.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study analysed the effectiveness of innovative (basalt meal, brown algae extract) and conventional (barley straw) substances which hypothetically alleviate the inhibiting effect of Cd²⁺ on biochemical properties of soil, with particular regard to the activity of arylsulfatase. An analysis of their potential was carried out based on the activity of arylsulfatase and the number of Pseudomonas sp. determined on the 25th and 50th days of the study. Cd²⁺ was applied in the following doses: 0, 4, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200 mg Cd²⁺ kg⁻¹ of DM soil, in the form of CdCl₂·2.5H₂O. A complex formulation of the issue was obtained from the presentation of biochemical properties using the RS (resistance of soil) index. Cadmium caused permanent adverse effects in the soil environment, inhibiting the activity of arylsulfatase and the yield of spring barley. The consequences of stress connected with increasing Cd²⁺ pollution were intensified by an elongation of the accumulation time of the tested metal in the soil. Chances for regeneration of the soil may be sought, most of all, with the application of straw and, to a lesser degree, with basalt meal. Brown algae did not meet the expectations for its potential. An increase in the studied parameters also resulted from sowing the soil with spring barley.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhaeophyceae 3aPseudomonas 3aadverse effects 3aarylsulfatase 3abarley straw 3abasalt 3acadmium 3aedaphic factors 3apollution 3asoil biological properties 3asowing 3aspring barley1 aKucharski, Jan1 aWyszkowska, Jadwiga0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Aug., v. 228, no. 8 p.267-267dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3449-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009800173300001600271520141300287592002801700596007801728596004501806650001501851650002301866650001701889650001001906650001301916650001901929650001401948650002301962651001001985700001801995700001902013700002002032700001902052700001802071773012102089856008202210852000902292655001202301IND60677590420221120184851.0191130e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067759042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10709-019-00079-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMwanzia, Virginia M.14aThe complete chloroplast genomes of two species in threatened monocot genus Caldesia in China  ap. 381-390.  aCaldesia is a genus in the family Alismataceae mainly found in the tropical and temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere. In China, two species, Caldesia parnassifolia, and Caldesia grandis are recorded as critically endangered in sporadic regions. Available protection of the genetic resource of these threatened species has been impeded due to limited genomic information. Here, we sequence the whole chloroplast (cp) genome of the two Caldesia species using high throughput sequencing technology. The whole cp genomes of C. parnassifolia and C. grandis were 167,647 bp and 168,500 bp, respectively with a typical quadripartite structure. There were 115 unique genes with 81 protein-coding genes, 31 tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes. Both species showed a GC content of 37.1%. A duplication of two tRNA genes and a ~ 6 kb inversion region in the LSC was noted in both species. Mononucleotide simple sequence repeats (SSRs) A/T were most abundant for both Caldesia species. High nucleotide variability was recorded in ycf1 gene and trnK-UUU/rps16 intergenic spacer region. All RNA editing conversions were C–U in 23 and 24 protein-coding genes for C. parnassifolia and C. grandis, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis placed both Caldesia species as sister to Sagittaria lichuanensis. This study will be useful for further evolutionary, systematic researches and conservation of the genus Caldesia.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013FY112300cSpecial Foundation for State Basic Working Program of China  aY655261W03cWuhan Botanical Garden (CAS) 3aSagittaria 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3agenes 3agenomics 3aintergenic DNA 3aphylogeny 3athreatened species 3aChina1 aNzei, John M.1 aYan, Dong-Ying1 aKamau, Peris W.1 aChen, Jin-Ming1 aLi, Zhi-Zhong0 tGenetica.g2019 Dec., v. 147, no. 5-6 p.381-390dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl1577x0016-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-019-00079-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002900113040001800142100002000160245006100180300001600241520171000257592002801967650001801995650002602013650001202039650001002051650003302061650000902094650001502103650001402118650001002132650001202142650003002154650002502184650003802209650004302247650001402290650002402304653001702328653001802345653001502363653001402378653001602392700002502408700002202433700002302455773011402478856007502592852000902667655001202676IND60114910320221119103629.0141124e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011491032DNAL7 a236086472pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.12004482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNeal, Joel R.10aPhylogeny and origins of holoparasitism in Orobanchaceae  ap. 971-983.  a• Premise: Orobanchaceae are a family of angiosperms that range from fully autotrophic and free-living to completely heterotrophic and dependent on their hosts (holoparasites). Most of the ca. 2060 species are hemiparasites that photosynthesize throughout all or part of their life cycles. Certain family members are ecologically important due to direct impacts on community biomass and diversity, plant–herbivore interactions, and nutrient cycling. Other members are among the most economically damaging weeds in the world. Multiple trophic transitions within this family make it ideal for studying molecular evolutionary and physiological changes that accompany the evolution of parasitism.• Methods: To establish a phylogenetic framework for such work, we substantially increased taxonomic sampling at loci for which a significant amount of data already existed (nuclear ITS and PHYA, plastid matK and rps2) and added data from the low-copy nuclear locus, PHYB.• Key results: The data provide strong support for relationships among six major clades and for the position of Brandisia hancei Hook. f. The positions of Boschniakia himalaica Hook. f. & Thomson, Centranthera cochinchinensis (Lour.) Merr., Mannagettaea hummelii Harry Sm., and Pterygiella nigrescens Oliv. are confirmed or suggested for the first time.• Conclusions: There is a single origin of parasitism, and from within the hemiparasites, holoparasitism has originated three times. Moving from the base to the tips of the Orobanchaceae tree, the successive major splits within the parasitic clade are: Cymbarieae + the rest; Orobancheae + the rest; Brandisia + the rest; Rhinantheae + the rest; and Pedicularideae + Buchnereae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrobanchaceae 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aloci 3aparasitism 3aphylogeny 3aweeds 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Intergenicxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aOrobanchaceaexgeneticsxparasitology. 2aPhylogeny 2aSpecies Specificity 0ahemiparasite 0aOrobanchaceae 0aparasitism 0aphylogeny 0aphytochrome1 aBennett, Jonathan R.1 aWolfe, Andrea D.,1 aMathews, Sarah Y.,0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2013 May, v. 100, no. 5 p.971-983dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.12004483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010000163300002000263500001900283520091500302592002801217650002401245650002001269650002401289650001501313650001001328650001901338650001701357650001601374650001601390700002301406700002301429700002301452700001901475700002501494700001901519700002001538700002001558700002001578773012501598856007401723852000901797655001201806IND60715520620221122052305.0201028e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071552062DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra06455f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshchenko, Olga M.10aMesoporous TiO₂ anatase films for enhanced photocatalytic activity under UV and visible light  ap. 38233-38243.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMesoporous TiO₂ films with enhanced photocatalytic activity in both UV and visible wavelength ranges were developed through a non-conventional atomic layer deposition (ALD) process at room temperature. Deposition at such a low temperature promotes the accumulation of by-products in the amorphous TiO₂ films, caused by the incomplete hydrolysis of the TiCl₄ precursor. The additional thermal annealing induces the fast recrystallisation of amorphous films, as well as an in situ acidic treatment of TiO₂. The interplay between the deposition parameters, such as purge time, the amount of structural defects introduced and the enhancement of the photocatalytic properties from different mesoporous films clearly shows that our easily upscalable non-conventional ALD process is of great industrial interest for environmental remediation and other photocatalytic applications, such as hydrogen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acrystallization 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aporous media 3aremediation 3awavelengths1 aLamblin, Guillaume1 aGuillot, Jérôme,1 aInfante, Ingrid C.1 aGuennou, Maël1 aAdjeroud, Noureddine1 aFechete, Ioana1 aGarin, Francois1 aTurek, Philippe1 aLenoble, Damien0 tRSC advances.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 10, no. 63 p.38233-38243dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra06455f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01574naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245019100166300001600357520055600373592002800929650001200957650001600969650002200985650001901007700002501026700002201051773012001073856008201193852000901275655001201284IND60618978420221119131633.0181030e196610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061897842DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517566036010062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorley, Smith10aEffects of Variety and Location on Stress-Strain Components of Cotton Fiber BundlesbPart I: True Gage Length, Tenacity, and Elongation at One-Eighth-Inch (O.3175-cm) Nominal Gage Length  ap. 893-899.  aA definition and a method of measuring true gage length is presented.

ANIMALS STUDIED: Seven Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus) and one ball python (P. regius) with clinically normal right eyes and an abnormal or missing left eye. PROCEDURE: At the time of euthanasia, four of the eight snakes underwent necropsy. Hereafter, the heads of two Burmese pythons and one ball python were examined using μCT, and another Burmese python was subjected to MRI. Following these procedures, the heads of these four pythons along with the heads of an additional three Burmese pythons were prepared for histology. RESULTS: All eight snakes had left ocular openings seen as dermal invaginations between 0.2 and 2.0 mm in diameter. They also had varying degrees of malformations of the orbital bones and a limited presence of nervous, glandular, and muscle tissue in the posterior orbit. Two individuals had small but identifiable eyes. Furthermore, remnants of the pigmented embryonic framework of the hyaloid vessels were found in the anophthalmic snakes. Necropsies revealed no other macroscopic anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: Eight pythons with unilateral left‐sided microphthalmia or anophthalmia had one normal eye and a left orbit with malformed or incompletely developed ocular structures along with remnants of fetal structures. These cases lend further information to a condition that is often seen in snakes, but infrequently described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPython 3aabnormal development 3abones 3aeuthanasia 3aeyes 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amuscle tissues 3anecropsy 3aophthalmology 3asnakes 3atomography1 aBertelsen, Mads F.1 aWang, Tobias1 aPedersen, Michael1 aLauridsen, Henrik1 aHeegaard, Steffen0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2015 Jan., v. 18 Suppl s1 p.23-29dBlackwell Sciencex1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.121983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010900163520163800272592002801910650002101938650002701959650001601986650002002002650002602022650001602048650001702064650002402081650001402105650001602119653002302135653001502158653002402173653002402197653001602221700001402237700001302251700001502264700001702279700001702296773010802313856008102421852000902502655001202511IND60787276920221123035301.0220914e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078727692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2022.1148242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Beibei10aColorimetric nano-beacon and magnetic separation-based rapid and visual assay for gram-negative bacteria  aFood-borne diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria are one of the serious factors affecting human health. However, the most commonly used detection methods for pathogenic bacteria not only require expensive instruments, but also take a long time due to the complicated and cumbersome detection process. Therefore, the development of a fast, simple, and low-cost detection method for pathogenic bacteria is crucial for food safety and human health. In this work, based on the high binding ability of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and polymyxin B (PMB) to bacteria, combined with magnetic separation technology, a new enzyme-free colorimetric strategy was constructed to achieve visual detection of Gram-negative bacteria in complex samples. The sensor system was divided into the following two parts: a colorimetric signal amplification nanoprobe, which was modified with AMP to enable effective binding of the colorimetric probe to the surface of bacteria, and a PMB-modified magnetic nanobead (MNB), which was used as the capture and enrichment unit of Gram-negative bacteria, as a result of which PMB could effectively distinguish Gram-negative bacteria from Gram-positive bacteria. Under optimized conditions, the detection limit of the method for Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. E. coli (G⁻)) was as low as 10 CFU/mL, and it was successfully applied to complex real samples. In addition, the developed colorimetric sensor offered advantages, such as fast response, less time consumption, high sensitivity, and low cost. It can be expected to become a new diagnostic tool for on-site detection of pathogenic bacteria in remote areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3afood safety 3ahuman health 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3apolymyxin B 0aColorimetric assay 0aNano-probe 0aMagnetic separation 0aPathogenic bacteria 0aFood safety1 aChen, Fei1 aWang, Yi1 aDeng, Ting1 aFeng, Xinxin1 aLi, Ziqsail,0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 655 p.114824-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2022.1148243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245006800204300001800272520173500290592002802025650001602053650002402069650001402093650000902107650001302116650001102129650002302140650002102163650001602184650002202200650001402222700001702236700001802253700005602271700005802327700002202385700001902407773011902426856008402545852000902629655001202638IND60685938720200410000000.0200311e20200218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068593872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b019882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9018-049210aDisentangling Heat and Moisture Effects on Biopolymer Mechanics  ap. 1527-1535.  aHeat and moisture are known to have important mechanical effects on polymers such as hygric swelling, thermal expansion, and mechanical weakening. A common approach when investigating such effects is to assume the effects of heat and moisture to be similar—the so-called time–temperature–moisture superposition. Through molecular dynamics simulation, this study evaluates the extent of the similarity of the effects of moisture and heat on the hygric swelling, thermal expansion, and mechanical weakening of a biopolymer: an uncondensed type of lignin, one of the most abundant polymers in the plant regime. We introduce as a microscopic metric the local stiffness (T/⟨u²⟩, temperature divided by the amplitude of segmental motion ⟨u²⟩), to analyze the mechanisms of mechanical effects of heat and moisture. The local stiffness of polymer skeleton and the overall stiffness of the composite material are shown to be strongly correlated, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96. Under the assumptions of harmonic vibration and isotropy, an explicit equation relating bulk moduli and the local stiffness can be derived, and the theoretically predicted moduli are in good agreement with measurement. The thermal expansion and weakening are shown to be related to each other and both dependent on the local stiffness. The analysis of the potential energy further points out that heating weakens both primary and secondary bonds of the polymer skeleton, while hydration only affects the secondary bonds. This major difference is thought to be the origin of the different impacts of heat and moisture on biopolymer mechanics, offering a different view of the time–temperature–moisture superposition principle.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acomposite materials 3aequations 3aheat 3aisotropy 3alignin 3amolecular dynamics 3apotential energy 3atemperature 3athermal expansion 3avibration1 aShomali, Ali1 aGuyer, Robert1 aKeten, Sinan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2203-14251 aCoasne, Benoit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3933-97441 aDerome, Dominique1 aCarmeliet, Jan0 tMacromolecules.g2020 Feb. 18, v. 53, no. 5 p.1527-1535dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b019883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006800166300001600234520102200250592002801272650001201300650001301312650003101325650001101356650001001367650001401377650001101391650001601402650001901418650001001437650001801447650001101465700001801476700002401494700001801518773012001536856008201656852000901738655001201747IND60618978620221119131621.0181030e196610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061897862DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517566036010082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaxton, W.E.10aCorrelation of Nylon Tirecord Properties with Tire Flatspotting  ap. 903-914.  aThe theory of flatspotting in tires is reviewed and found to be in essential agreement with that given in earlier publications. The importance of cord moisture content (humidity), temperature, and dynamic response rate in affecting the flatspotting per formance of tirecords is emphasized. Two methods are discussed for favorably altering the viscosity-temperature relationship of nylon tirecords: (a) incorporation of moleculea of bulky groups along the polymer chains (achieved through blending with other poly mers), and (b) plasticization. A new, dynamic flatspot cord testing machine is described which permits close simulation of tirecord stress cycles that duplicate the flatspotting phenomena under various cord moisture contents (humidity test atmospheres) corre sponding to both summer and winter driving conditions. Good correlation is obtained between the laboratory test results and tire results. Applications of the test machine in screening prospective low flatspotting tirecord materials is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3ahumidity 3alaboratory experimentation 3amixing 3anylon 3ascreening 3asummer 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3atires 3awater content 3awinter1 aForster, M.J.1 aRobertson, Jarrius,1 aThurman, G.R.0 tTextile research journal.g1966 Oct., v. 36, no. 10 p.903-914dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517566036010083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245011700202300001600319520140800335592002801743650001201771650003401783650002301817650002401840650003101864650001701895650001601912650001201928650001301940650001501953650001201968650001101980650001401991650000902005650001002014650001602024650001802040650001502058650001402073650000902087650002502096650001702121651001002138653002102148653002502169653003102194653002302225700001702248700002002265700001402285700001702299700001702316773012302333856008302456852000902539655001202548IND60738539720221123002506.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073853972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1017-935310aEvaluation of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activity and identification of active compounds of Humulus scandens  ap. 126-132.  aHumulus scanden, rich in flavonoids, is a traditional Chinese medicine. It is widely used in China to treat tuberculosis, dysentery and chronic colitis. In this study, Humulus scandens (H.S) was extracted in different solvents (water, n-butanol, acetic ether and chloroform) and the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities of extracts were investigated by four assays including DPPH, reducing power, xylene-induced mouse ear edema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma methods. And then, the acute oral toxicity of extracts and biochemical parameters such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in blood serum and edematous tissue of rats were also evaluated. Moreover, the active compounds were identified by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS-MS. Results showed that ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts had the stronger antioxidant activities, while water extract appeared to be weakest among them. The anti-inflammatory test showed that the extract of n-butanol and chloroform had significant anti-inflammatory effects and could improve the activity of SOD and CAT in mice. In general, the site of n-butanol has a stronger antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, and 15 compounds were analyzed by LC/Q-TOF-MS/MS technology. The present study confirms the ethnobotanical use of H.S extracts as natural antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and the composition of the active compound was preliminarily identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHumulus 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aactive ingredients 3aacute oral toxicity 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3abutanol 3acatalase 3achloroform 3acolitis 3acotton 3adysentery 3aears 3aedema 3aethnobotany 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3agranuloma 3amice 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atuberculosis 3aChina 0aHumulus scandens 0aAntioxidant activity 0aAnti-inflammatory activity 0aChemical compounds1 aTan, Li-Hong1 aFeng, Yuan-Jiao1 aYao, Ling1 aYan, Xue-Wei1 aCao, Wei-Guo0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 Sept., v. 141 p.126-132dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007300170300001500243520129600258592002801554650004401582650003701626650001701663650001101680650001001691650001101701650002501712650001201737650001901749650001901768650002601787650000701813650001501820650001501835650002101850650002101871650002101892653002701913653001801940653001801958653002101976653002501997700002102022700005902043700002602102700002602128700002302154773009902177856008602276852000902362655001202371IND60530313820221122051711.0180904e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053031382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanelli, Maria10aSurface modification of polyamide 6.6 fibers by enzymatic hydrolysis  ap. 97-103.  aSynthetic fibers are used extensively in textile industry, however, their high hydrophobicity is a drawback that needs to be considered. The decrease of hydrophobicity can be achieved via a “green” root using enzymes as biocatalysts. In this study, the enzymatic surface modification of polyamide (PA) 6.6 fabric was studied with the use of the commercial protease Alcalase 2.4L at optimal conditions. The modified fabrics were studied via dyeing parameters K/S and ΔΕ values. For treatment at 40–60°C and pH 8 ΔE was found to be approximately 14 and K/S was 1.24-fold increased. Additionally, the enzymatic surface modification of PA textile was justified using different spectroscopy techniques, such as FTIR-ATR and XPS. FTIR-ATR indicated alterations of CO and NH band intensities, while via XPS, there proved to be differences in relative intensities of carbon component peaks. Finally, thermogravimetric and mechanical tests were also conducted to prove the non-degradation of the properties of the bulk material. In conclusion, the investigated enzymatic process increased the hydrophilicity with 2.7-fold increased water absorbency and 1.24-fold enhanced color strength of PA textiles, while maintaining the thermal and mechanical properties of the bulk synthetic material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiocatalysts 3acarbon 3acolor 3adyeing 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afabrics 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amechanical properties 3apH 3apolyamides 3asubtilisin 3asynthetic fibers 3atextile industry 3athermogravimetry 0aEnzymatic modification 0aPolyamide 6.6 0aAlcalase 2.4L 0aSynthetic fibers 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis1 aVasilakos, Sozon1 aLadas, Spyridon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3122-31651 aSymianakis, Emmanouil1 aChristakopoulos, Paul1 aTopakas, Evangelos0 tProcess biochemistry.g2017 Aug., v. 59 p.97-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007800168300001200246520174400258592002802002596005602030650002802086650001702114650002502131650001902156650001602175650001302191650001102204650001902215650004102234650001302275650001602288650002502304650001702329700002502346700002402371700002402395700002302419700002302442700002802465773014402493856008202637852000902719655001202728IND60677590820221120185015.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067759082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-019-2778-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvseeva, Nina V.10aFunctioning of plant-bacterial associations under osmotic stress in vitro  ap. 195.  aThe search for effective plant-growth-promoting strains of rhizospheric bacteria that would ensure the resistance of plant-microbial associations to environmental stressors is essential for the design of environmentally friendly agrobiotechnologies. We investigated the interaction of potato (cv. Nevsky) microplants with the plant-growth-promoting bacteria Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 and Ochrobactrum cytisi IPA7.2 under osmotic stress in vitro. The bacteria improved the physiological and biochemical variables of the microplants, significantly increasing shoot length and root number (1.3-fold, on average). Inoculation also led a more effective recovery of the plants after stress. During repair, inoculation contributed to a decreased leaf content of malonic dialdehyde. With A. brasilense Sp245, the decrease was 1.75-fold; with O. cytisi IPA7.2, it was 1.4-fold. During repair, the shoot length, node number, and root number of the inoculated plants were greater than the control values by an average of 1.3-fold with A. brasilense Sp245 and by an average of 1.6-fold with O. cytisi IPA7.2. O. cytisi IPA7.2, previously isolated from the potato rhizosphere, protected the physiological and biochemical processes in the plants under stress and repair better than did A. brasilense Sp245. Specifically, root weight increased fivefold during repair, as compared to the noninoculated plants, while chlorophyll a content remained at the level found in the nonstressed controls. The results indicate that these bacteria can be used as components of biofertilizers. A. brasilense Sp245 has favorable prospects for use in temperate latitudes, whereas O. cytisi IPA7.2 can be successfully used in saline and drought-stressed environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a19-016-00116cRussian Foundation for basic research 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aOchrobactrum 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofertilizers 3achlorophyll 3alatitude 3aleaves 3aosmotic stress 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3apotatoes 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3awater stress1 aTkachenko, Oksana V.1 aDenisova, Alena Yu.1 aBurygin, Gennady L.1 aVeselov, Dmitry S.1 aMatora, Larisa Yu.1 aShchyogolev, Sergei Yu.0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2019 Dec., v. 35, no. 12 p.195-195dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-019-2778-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245010800171520131700279592002801596650002601624650002201650650001601672650001701688650002001705650002801725650001301753650001901766650002601785650001401811650001401825650002201839650001401861650001301875653001201888653001501900653001001915653000801925653000901933653001201942653002401954653002101978653001401999653002602013653000802039653000702047653000802054653000902062653000802071653000702079653000702086653000802093653001002101653000802111653000802119700002902127700002502156700002802181700002602209700002102235700001902256700002402275700001802299700007102317773010802388856008102496852000902577655001202586IND60787277220221123035217.0220914e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078727722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2022.1148302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJagannath, Deepak K.10aRefolding and characterization of a diabody against Pfs25, a vaccine candidate of Plasmodium falciparum  aPfs25, a vaccine candidate, expressed on the surface of the malarial parasite, plays an important role in the development of Plasmodium falciparum. 1269, a monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor-like domain 1 and epidermal growth factor-like domain 3 of Pfs25, blocks the transmission of parasites in mosquitoes. In this study, we refolded 1269-Db, a dimeric antibody fragment referred as diabody, designed from 1269, with a yield of 3 mg/litre of bacterial culture. Structural integrity of the protein was validated with thermal stability, disulphide bond analysis and glutaraldehyde crosslinking experiments. To evaluate the functionality of 1269-Db, recombinant monomeric MBP-Pfs25 was produced from bacteria. Qualitative binding assays demonstrated that 1269-Db recognized the epitopes on Pfs25 in its native, but not the denatured state. An apparent KD of 2.6 nM was determined for 1269-Db with monomeric MBP-Pfs25, using isothermal titration calorimetry. 1269-Db recognized the periphery of zygotes/ookinetes, demonstrating recognition of Pfs25, expressed on the surface of the parasite. As the established refolding method resulted in a functional diabody, the optimized method pipeline for 1269-Db can potentially facilitate engineering of antibody fragments with desired properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3abacterial culture 3acalorimetry 3acrosslinking 3adisulfide bonds 3aepidermal growth factor 3aepitopes 3aglutaraldehyde 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aookinetes 3aparasites 3athermal stability 3atitration 3avaccines 0aMalaria 0aPlasmodium 0aPfs25 0a4B7 0a1269 0aDiabody 0aMonoclonal antibody 0aInclusion bodies 0aRefolding 0aTransmission blocking 0amAb 0aDb 0aTBV 0ascFv 0aEGF 0aVH 0aVL 0aDSF 0aPfs25 0aGPI 0aMBP1 aValiyaparambil, Ashwathi1 aViswanath, Vysakh K.1 aHurakadli, Manjunath A.1 aKamariah, Neelagandan1 aJafer, Alifia C.1 aPatole, Chhaya1 aPradhan, Sabyasachi1 aKumar, Naveen1 aLakshminarasimhan, Anirudha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3008-03500 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 655 p.114830-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2022.1148303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009700171300001400268520116900282592002801451650001201479650001101491650001401502650001301516650001301529650001401542650002101556650001401577650000901591651001001600653001301610653002201623653001301645653001301658653001501671700002001686700002501706700001801731773013001749856008901879852000901968655001201977IND60693426220221120074614.0200506e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069342622DNAL7 a10.3184/095422913X1370443977277482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, S. M.10aPhenomenal changes in the forms of nitrogen: results from a coastal zone of south west India  ap. 89-96.  aA unique phenomenon along the south west cost of India triggers an active fisheries season with the advent of “mudbanks”. These regions, better described as “zones of biorhythm”, involve different forms of nitrogen which act as nutrients during the propagation of mudbanks. High concentrations of urea and ammonia were observed prior to the formation of mudbanks, signifying the availability of different forms of nitrogen for later assimilation from a reservoir pool. In common with many features of upwelling areas, the variability of nitrite concentration under different phases of the biorhythm is brought about by the processes involved in the nitrification-denitrification process. The marked increase in the concentration of organic nitrogen as compared to a non-mudbank area is indicative of the presence of organically webbed forms of nitrogen. This organic form acted as a “reserved nutrient” (or inducer) for near-future utilisation subsequent to the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen forms. The study emphasises the role of sediments in nitrate uptake and its regeneration which is related to forms of nitrate in the overlying water media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acoasts 3afisheries 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anutrients 3aorganic nitrogen 3asediments 3aurea 3aIndia 0amudbanks 0azone of biorhythm 0anutrient 0anitrogen 0aspeciation1 aBalchand, A.

ANIMALS STUDIED: 17 Saurians, 14 Ophidians, and 11 Chelonians with no concurrent systemic or eye disease were included in the study. PROCEDURE: Age, weight, nose‐cloaca distance (NCD), and pupil shape were collected for each animal. The AS was examined by optical coherence tomography (OCT). After gross description of the appearance of the AS, the central and peripheral corneal thickness (CCT, PCT) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured using the software provided with the OCT device. The ratio CCT/ACD was then calculated for each animal. RESULTS: Pupil shape was a vertical slit in all the crepuscular or nocturnal animals (except for 1 chelonian and 1 ophidian). Each group had its own particular AS architecture. Saurians had a regularly thin cornea with a flat anterior lens capsule and a deep anterior chamber. Ophidians had a thick cornea with a narrow anterior chamber due to a very anteriorly anchored spherical lens. The spectacle was difficult to identify in all ophidians except in Python molurus bivitattus in which it was more obvious. Chelonians displayed an intermediate architecture which more closely resembled the Saurian type than the Ophidian type. CONCLUSION: Despite grossly similar AS architecture, the three groups of reptiles in the study demonstrated differences that are suggestive of a link between anatomical disparities and variations in environment and lifestyle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPython molurus 3acomputer software 3acornea 3aeye diseases 3alifestyle 3amorphometry 3aophthalmology 3areptiles 3atomography1 aLinsart, Adeline1 aIsard, Pierre‐François1 aBesson, Christian1 aDulaurent, Thomas0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2015 Jan., v. 18 Suppl s1 p.53-60dBlackwell Sciencex1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.121863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245011800156300001600274520225500290592002802545650001202573650001102585650001802596650001302614650001702627650001502644650001302659650000902672650001602681650001302697650002702710650001302737650001202750650001802762653001602780653001802796653003402814653001602848700001102864700001202875700001102887700001302898700001202911700001102923700001402934700001202948700001402960773013502974856007803109852000903187655001203196IND60520605620221120051351.0160522e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052060562DNAL7 a10.1515/pjvs-2016-00292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Z.10aImpact of different sources of donor cells upon the nuclear transfer efficiency in Chinese indigenous Meishan pig  ap. 205-212.  aSomatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is currently the most efficient and precise method to generate genetically tailored pig models for both agricultural and biomedical research. However, its efficiency is crucially dependent on the source of nuclear donor cells. In this study, we compared the cloning efficiency by using three lines of donor cells that are derived from fetal, newborn and adult fibroblasts of Chinese indigenous Meishan pig. We showed that cleavage rate and blastocyst formation rate of the reconstructed embryos were not significantly different between the fetal (80.7% and 15.6%) and newborn ear skin (77.5% and 12.3%) fibroblast groups (p>0.05), but in both groups these indices were significantly higher than that found in the adult ear skin (70.5% and 8.8%; p<0.05). Reconstructed embryos derived from fetal, newborn, and adult ear skin fibroblasts were transferred to four surrogates, respectively. For the fetal, newborn, and adult ear skin fibroblasts, the number of pregnancies were two (50.0%), two (50.0%), and one (25.0%), respectively, and the number of deliveries were two (50.0%), one (25.0%), and zero (0.0%), respectively. Seven and two cloned piglets were obtained from the fetal and newborn ear skin fibroblasts respectively, while no piglets were obtained from the adult ear skin fibroblasts. Two cloned piglets from the newborn ear skin fibroblasts died shortly after birth because of neonatal asphyxia caused by dystocia. The birth weights of the piglets derived from the fetal and newborn ear skin fibroblasts were 1230.5 and 1310.0g, respectively, which were statistically insignificant (p>0.05), but both were significantly higher than that of the control groups (p<0.05). Microsatellite analyses demonstrated that the genotypes of all cloned piglets were identical to their donor cells. Therefore, cloned pigs were successfully produced using two sources of donor cells isolated from the fetal and newborn ear skin fibroblasts of Meishan piglet, and indicating a better cloning efficiency than that obtained from adult fibroblasts. We concluded that the nuclear donor cell lines have significant impact on the developmental competence of cloned embryos as well as on the cloning efficiency of Meishan pig.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeishan 3aadults 3aanimal models 3aasphyxia 3abirth weight 3ablastocyst 3adystocia 3aears 3afibroblasts 3agenotype 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aneonates 3apiglets 3asomatic cells 0aMeishan pig 0acloned piglet 0asomatic cell nuclear transfer 0afibroblasts1 aXu, G.1 aLiu, X.1 aBi, Y.1 aXiao, H.1 aHua, W.1 aLi, L.1 aZhang, L.1 aRen, H.1 aZheng, X.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 19, no. 1 p.205-212dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:J000000145x2300-25577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjvs-2016-00293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245005000167300002000217500001900237520123900256592002801495650001501523650001501538650002201553650001601575650001001591650001101601650002001612650001201632650001501644650001601659653002301675653001601698653001801714653001501732653001501747653001501762653001901777700002301796700005801819700001601877700006501893773014101958856007802099852000902177655001202186IND60739062620221122000755.0210526e20210511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073906262DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c050492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKryuchkov, Mikhail10aLight Polarization by Biological Nanocoatings  ap. 23481-23488.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLight plays paramount functions for living beings in nature. In addition to color, the polarization of light is used by many animals for navigation and communication. In this study, we describe the light polarizing role of special nanostructures coating cuticular surfaces of diverse arthropods. These structures are built as parallel nanoscale ridges covering the eyes of the sunlight-navigating spider Drassodes lapidosus and of the water pond-swarming black fly Simulium vittatum, as well as the light-emitting abdominal lantern of the firefly Aquatica lateralis. Exact topography and dimensions of the parallel nanoridges provide different light polarizing efficiencies and wavelength sensitivity. Optical modeling confirms that the nanoscale ridges are responsible for the spectral polarization dependency. Co-opting from our recent work on the self-assembly of Drosophila corneal nanostructures, we engineer arthropod-like parallel nanoridges on artificial surfaces, which recapitulate the light polarization effects. Our work highlights the fundamental importance of nanocoatings in arthropods for the light polarization management and provides a new biomimetic approach to produce ordered nanostructures under mild conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aLampyridae 3aSimulium vittatum 3abiomimetics 3acolor 3acornea 3apolarized light 3aspiders 3atopography 3awavelengths 0alight polarization 0ananocoating 0aself-assembly 0aarthropods 0anavigation 0abiomimetic 0abioengineering1 aSavitsky, Vladimir1 aWilts, Bodo D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2727-71281 aGray, Elmer1 aKatanaev, Vladimir L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7909-56170 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 May 11, v. 13, no. 20 p.23481-23488dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c050493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012300154300002000277500001900297520111600316592002801432650001501460650001301475650001501488650001601503650002101519650002101540650002201561650002801583650001101611650001701622650001801639650001901657650001301676650001401689700001501703700001801718700001901736700001601755700002001771773012501791856007401916852000901990655001201999IND60715521220221122032229.0201028e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071552122DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra06751b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jing10aReagentless and sensitive determination of carcinoembryonic antigen based on a stable Prussian blue modified electrode  ap. 38316-38322.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReagentless and sensitive detection of tumor biomarkers using label-free electrochemical immunosensors is highly desirable for early and effective cancer diagnosis. Herein, we present a label-free electrochemical immunoassay platform based on surface-confined Prussian blue (PB) redox probes for sensitive and reagentless determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). To facilitate the electron transfer of probes and improve sensitivity, Au nanoparticles and PB (Au–PB) are electrochemically co-deposited on a carbon nanotube (CNT) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). A polydopamine (pDA) layer is coated on the Au–PB nanocomposite layer in situ as a bifunctional linker. In addition to improving the stability of PB, pDA also provides reducibility for the preparation of gold nanoparticles, which offers an interface for anti-CEA antibody immobilization. The fabricated immunosensor has good stability and is able to reagentlessly detect CEA over a wide range (0.005–50 ng mL⁻¹) with high reproducibility. Furthermore, the immunosensor was used for determination of CEA in human serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3aneoplasms1 aLi, Kunyin1 aWang, Meifang1 aChen, Xiaohong1 aLiu, Jiyang1 aTang, Hongliang0 tRSC advances.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 10, no. 63 p.38316-38322dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra06751b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007200170300001300242520128800255592002801543650001501571650002501586650001601611650002601627650001301653650001601666650001401682650002601696650001401722650001601736650002101752650001001773650001801783650001701801653004001818653002101858653001801879653001201897773011001909856008102019852000902100655001202109IND60520605720170803000000.0160522e20091006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052060572DNAL7 a10.2478/v10129-009-0001-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiewióra, Barbara10aLong-time storage effect on the seed health of spring barley grains  ap. 3-12.  aSeeds of 5 cultivars of spring barley, originated from field experiments conducted in 2000 at Radzików, were tested immediately after harvest and after three, four and five years of storage in uncontrolled conditions, for incidence of seed-borne fungi with special regard to "field fungi" (Bipolaris sorokiniana and Fusarium spp.) and "storage fungi" (species of Penicillium and Aspergillus). The studies showed that barley seeds were infected before storage by numerous fungi as well as the saprophytes: Alternaria alternata, Acremonium spp,Acremoniella atra and the pathogens: Bipolaris sorokiniana and ten Fusarium species. The analysis after storage showed that the frequency of fungal infection had changed. The occurrence of some fungi was significantly affected by the period of storage. An increase of infection by species of Penicillium and Aspergillus known as "storage fungi" was detected on seeds after storage, especially after four years. At the same time, isolation of species of Fusarium and Bipolaris sorokiniana from these seeds decreased. Differences in number of ‘field’ and ‘storage’ fungi were found in dependence on period of storage, also. The smallest infection by Bipolaris sorokiniana and Fusarium was observed on seed after five years of storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcremonium 3aAlternaria alternata 3aAspergillus 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3aFusarium 3aPenicillium 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3apathogens 3asaprophytes 3aseed-borne fungi 3aseeds 3aspring barley 3astorage time 0a‘field’ and ‘storage’ fungi 0aseed-borne fungi 0aspring barley 0astorage0 tHodowla roślin aklimtyzacja i nasiennictwo.g2009 Oct. 6, v. 59, no. -1 p.3-12dVersitax2083-599X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10129-009-0001-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008300163300001600246520121800262592002801480650002801508650002901536650001301565650001501578650001201593650001401605650002201619650001701641650001901658650001901677650001801696700001801714700001701732700001601749700001701765700002101782773014001803856008201943852000902025655001202034IND60609834720221119123254.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060983472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-018-7515-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Min-Ah10aFluorescence change of Fusobacterium nucleatum due to Porphyromonas gingivalis  ap. 628-633.  aThe aim of this study was to measure changes in the fluorescence of Fusobacterium nucleatum interacting with Porphyromonas gingivalis for excitation with blue light at 405-nm. P. gingivalis was mono- and co-cultivated in close proximity with F. nucleatum. The fluorescence of the bacterial colonies was photographed using a QLF-D (Quantitative Light-induced Fluorescence-Digital) Biluminator camera system with a 405 nm light source and a specific filter. The red, green and blue intensities of fluorescence images were analyzed using the image analysis software. A fluorescence spectrometer was used to detect porphyrin synthesized by each bacterium. F. nucleatum, which emitted green fluorescence in single cultures, showed intense red fluorescence when it was grown in close proximity with P. gingivalis. F. nucleatum co-cultivated with P. gingivalis showed the same pattern of fluorescence peaks as for protoporphyrin IX in the red part of the spectrum. We conclude that the green fluorescence of F. nucleatum can change to red fluorescence in the presence of adjacent co-cultured with P. gingivalis, indicating that the fluorescence character of each bacterium might depend on the presence of other bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusobacterium nucleatum 3aPorphyromonas gingivalis 3abacteria 3ablue light 3acameras 3acoculture 3acomputer software 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aprotoporphyrin 3aspectrometers1 aKang, Si-Mook1 aKim, Se-Yeon1 aKim, Ji-Soo1 aKim, Jin-Bom1 aJeong, Seung-Hwa0 tjournal of microbiology.g2018 Sept., v. 56, no. 9 p.628-633dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-018-7515-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001800170245009000188300001600278520112700294592002801421650001101449650001401460650001201474650001801486650001201504650001701516650001501533650001201548650001701560650001901577650002801596650001201624650003001636650003101666650001101697650002501708650002101733650001001754650001101764650002701775650001701802650002001819650001101839650003101850650001901881650003201900650003101932650002301963650001001986653000701996653000702003653000702010653000702017653000702024653000702031653000802038653000902046653001102055653001002066653001002076653001102086653001402097653001502111653002502126653001602151653002802167653001502195700001902210700001602229700001802245773010102263856008602364852000902450655001202459IND50070071520221118172612.0190402e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007007152DNAL7 a239169592pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2013.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPivotto, L.M.10aEffects of hot boning and moisture enhancement on the eating quality of cull cow beef  ap. 237-246.  aThe effects of chilling method and moisture enhancement were examined for improving eating quality of semimembranosus (SM) and longissimus lumborum (LL) from 62 cull beef cows. Chilling method included hot boning muscles after 45 to 60min postmortem or conventional chilling for 24h.

Chilling method by moisture enhancement treatment interactions (P<0.09) were due to decreased hue, chroma and sarcomere length values in hot boned vs. conventionally chilled product (SM and LL) for CaASC vs. other moisture enhancement treatments. Chilling method by moisture enhancement treatment interactions (P<0.05) were due to decreased shear force and increased tenderness in conventionally chilled vs. hot boned LL using CaASC vs. Na/STP. Moisture enhancement can improve tenderness of cull cow beef depending on combinations of chilling method and moisture enhancement treatments used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3abeef cows 3acalcium 3acitrus juices 3acooling 3afood quality 3ahot boning 3amuscles 3ashear stress 3asodium citrate 3asodium tripolyphosphate 2aAnimals 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCitratesxmetabolism 2aCold Temperature 2aColor 2aFemale 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Quality 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistry 2aPolyphosphatesxmetabolism 2aPostmortem Changes 2aTaste 0aCM 0aME 0aHB 0aCC 0aSM 0aLL 0aMET 0aCONT 0aCITRUS 0aNaCIT 0aCaASC 0aNa/STP 0aBeef cows 0aHot boning 0aMoisture enhancement 0aShear force 0aPalatability attributes 0aTenderness1 aCampbell, C.P.1 aSwanson, K.1 aMandell, I.B.0 tMeat science.g2014 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.237-246dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2013.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013000170300001600300520105300316592002801369650001101397650002701408650000901435650001501444650001601459650002201475650000901497650000801506650001601514653001701530653001201547653001501559653002301574653002201597700001701619700001801636700001901654700002101673773009901694856008701793852000901880655001201889IND60542358120221119071506.0190402e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054235812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.11.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Chee Wei10aQuantitative assessment of moniliformin in cereals via alternative precipitation pathways, aided by LC-LIT-MS and LC-Q-TOF-MS  ap. 372-379.  aThe availability of a simple chemical precipitation workflow aided by targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry would provide an accurate diagnostic platform for the direct determination of moniliformin in cereals for food safety control. In-house method validation was performed at six concentration levels of 8, 40, 80, 200, 400, and 600ngg−1 in cereal flours of wheat, corn, rye, oats and barley. Spiking experiments were made at three concentration levels of 20, 40 and 100ngg−1. Protein precipitation and “PHREE” column cleanup strategy provided recoveries of 81–108% for all cereals matrices using external calibrants. “PHREE” purification provided significant (p<0.05) ion signal enhancement reduction advantage for all matrices except corn flour. Moniliformin underwent significant (p<0.05) degradation over 2weeks when prepared in acidified water. A simple, low-cost and fit-for-purpose procedure for the identification and quantitation of moniliformin in cereals becomes available to support prospective regulatory function.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3achemical precipitation 3acorn 3acorn flour 3afood safety 3amass spectrometry 3aoats 3arye 3awheat flour 0aMoniliformin 0aCereals 0aDiagnostic 0aPHREE purification 0aMass spectrometry1 aLai, Kit Yee1 aYeo, Jie Fang1 aTai, Siew Hoon1 aChan, Sheot Harn0 tFood chemistry.g2015 May 01, v. 174 p.372-379dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.11.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002800176245004600204300001500250520129000265592002801555650001101583650001101594650001601605650001301621650001901634650001201653650001501665650001201680700002401692700002101716700001801737700001801755700002001773773015201793856006901945856007202014990002302086852000902109655001202118IND60643655520221120074142.0190512e20150706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064365552DNAL7 a10.3791/529392doi7 aPMC45451652pmcid7 a261677112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, F.q(Francesca),13aAn “all-laser” endothelial transplant  ap. e52939.  aThe “all laser” assisted endothelial keratoplasty is a procedure that is performed with a femtosecond laser used to cut the donor tissue at an intended depth, and a near infrared diode laser to weld the corneal tissue. The proposed technique enables to reach the three main goals in endothelial keratoplasty: a precise control in the thickness of the donor tissue; its easy insertion in the recipient bed and a reduced risk of donor lenticule dislocation. The donor cornea thickness is measured in the surgery room with optical coherence tomography (OCT), in order to correctly design the donor tissue dimensions. A femtosecond laser is used to cut the donor cornea. The recipient eye is prepared by manual stripping of the descemetic membrane. The donor endothelium is inserted into a Busin-injector, the peripheral inner side is stained with a proper chromophore (a water solution of Indocyanine Green) and then it is pulled in the anterior chamber. The transplanted tissue is placed in the final and correct location and then diode laser welding is induced from outside the eyeball. The procedure has been performed on more than 15 patients evidencing an improvement in surgery performances, with a good recovery of visual acuity and a reduced donor lenticule dislocation event.  aPublisher supplied data 3acornea 3adiodes 3aendothelium 3apatients 3arisk reduction 3asurgery 3atomography 3awelding1 aCanovetti, Annalisa1 aMalandrini, Alex1 aLenzetti, Ivo1 aPini, Roberto1 aMenabuoni, Luca0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2015 July 06, , no. 101 p.e52939-e52939dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/529393Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/52939/an-all-laser-endothelial-transplant  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009900159300001600258520100000274592002801274650002501302650001401327650001701341650001601358650001201374650001401386650000901400650001901409650001601428650002401444650001101468700002101479773013101500856007501631852000901706655001201715IND60537464520221118183245.0160809e20130109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053746452DNAL7 a10.1021/ie302399v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWindom, Bret C.10aApplication of Pressure-Controlled Advanced Distillation Curve Analysis: Virgin and Waste Oils  ap. 327-337.  aOne of the most important properties measured for liquid fuels is the volatility, usually expressed by the distillation curve. In previous work, we introduced the composition-explicit or advanced distillation curve (ADC) metrology, which we have applied to a wide variety of liquid fuels including biodiesel fuels. Application of this method to high-boiling-point fluids such as oils has required the addition of an inert-gas purge in the apparatus. Despite this precaution, there is clear evidence of thermal decomposition or polymerization at high distillation temperatures. To address this complication, a low-pressure version of the ADC was introduced. In this work, we have applied the low-pressure ADC method to the study of virgin and waste engine (motor) oils (5W-30, 10W-30, 20W-50), reclaimed comingled oil, reclaimed cutting oil, and used transformer oil. The results parallel similar measurements performed at atmospheric pressure, but with little evidence of chemical decomposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiodiesel 3adistillation 3aengineering 3aliquids 3ametrology 3aoils 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3awastes1 aBruno, Thomas J.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Jan. 09, v. 52, no. 1 p.327-337dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie302399v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245006600164300001800230520089200248592002801140650002301168650002701191650001601218650002301234650002401257650001301281700001901294700002201313773013301335856007401468852000901542655001201551IND60660136520221117071127.0190823e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066013652DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc00339j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, Kasper S.10aSingle-molecule magnet engineering: building-block approaches  ap. 4396-4415.  aTailoring the specific magnetic properties of any material relies on the topological control of the constituent metal ion building blocks. Although this general approach does not seem to be easily applied to traditional inorganic bulk magnets, coordination chemistry offers a unique tool to delicately tune, for instance, the properties of molecules that behave as “magnets”, the so-called single-molecule magnets (SMMs). Although many interesting SMMs have been prepared by a more or less serendipitous approach, the assembly of predesigned, isolatable molecular entities into higher nuclearity complexes constitutes an elegant and fascinating strategy. This Feature article focuses on the use of building blocks or modules (both terms being used indiscriminately) to direct the structure, and therefore also the magnetic properties, of metal ion complexes exhibiting SMM behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acoordination compounds 3aengineering 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetic properties 3atopology1 aBendix, Jesper1 aClérac, Rodolphe0 tChemical communications.g2014 Apr. 1, v. 50, no. 34 p.4396-4415dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc00339j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003300143245010600176520161200282592002801894650001701922650003101939650002601970650001701996650001302013650001902026650001102045650001802056650002102074650001702095650002002112650000902132650001502141650001602156650001302172650001302185650002702198650001402225700002502239700002202264700002202286700002102308773012002329856007802449852000902527655001202536IND60757696020221123031404.0211125e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075769602DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101127532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerzić-Vidojević, Amarela 10aEnterococci from Raw-Milk Cheeses: Current Knowledge on Safety, Technological, and Probiotic Concerns  aThe present study is focused on the safety, technological characteristics, and probiotic evaluation of Enterococcus species from different artisanal raw milk dairy products, mainly cheeses with ripening. Apart from proteolytic and lipolytic activities, most enterococci show the ability to metabolize citrate and convert it to various aromatic compounds. Long-ripened cheeses therefore have a specific flavor that makes them different from cheeses produced from thermally treated milk with commercial starter cultures. In addition, enterococci are producers of bacteriocins effective against spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, so they can be used as food preservatives. However, the use of enterococci in the dairy industry should be approached with caution. Although originating from food, enterococci strains may carry various virulence factors and antibiotic-resistance genes and can have many adverse effects on human health. Still, despite their controversial status, the use of enterococci in the food industry is not strictly regulated since the existence of these so-called desirable and undesirable traits in enterococci is a strain-dependent characteristic. To be specific, the results of many studies showed that there are some enterococci strains that are safe for use as starter cultures or as probiotics since they do not carry virulence factors and antibiotic-resistance genes. These strains even exhibit strong health-promoting effects such as stimulation of the immune response, anti-inflammatory activity, hypocholesterolemic action, and usefulness in prevention/treatment of some diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteriocins 3acitrates 3adairy industry 3aflavor 3afood industry 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3aimmune response 3amilk 3aprobiotics 3aproteolysis 3araw milk 3aspoilage 3atraditional technology 3avirulence1 aVeljović, Katarina 1 aPopović, Nikola 1 aTolinački, Maja 1 aGolić, Nataša 0 tFoods.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101127533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01308naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012400157300001800281520019000299592002800489650001000517650001400527650001800541650002300559650002300582650001200605650001200617700001900629700002100648700001800669700002500687700001700712773013400729856007400863852000900937655001200946IND60660136620221117070139.0190823e20140218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066013662DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc00340c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Iain D.12aA second-generation ligand for the enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed addition of arylboronic acids to alkenylazaarenes  ap. 2865-2868.  aA 2,4,6-trialkylanilide-containing chiral diene has been identified as a superior ligand for the enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed arylation of alkenylazaarenes with arylboronic acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aarylation 3aboronic acids 3acatalytic activity 3aenantioselectivity 3aligands 3arhodium1 aBurns, Alan R.1 aPattison, Graham1 aMichel, Boris1 aParker, Alexandra J.1 aLam, Hon Wai0 tChemical communications.g2014 Feb. 18, v. 50, no. 22 p.2865-2868dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc00340c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012100171300001600292520144300308592002801751650002001779650002801799650001501827650002401842650001801866650001701884650002301901650004301924650002201967650000901989653001301998653001402011653001002025653003602035653001702071700002702088700001502115700002102130700002402151700001902175700001802194700001902212700005702231773010302288856008602391852000902477655001202486IND60590820920221122172049.0190321e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059082092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2017.12.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Byung-Jae10aUnique biomarkers as a potential predictive tool for differentiation of Bacillus cereus group based on real-time PCR  ap. 131-137.  aThe aim of the study was to develop unique biomarkers for qPCR detection of Bacillus cereus group. Clinical and soil isolates were identified by specifically designed biomarkers – Lipoprotein (OPL-114-lipo), Methyltransferase (MT-17) and S-layer homology domain protein (151-1BC). In order to design biomarkers, we used 120 bacterial strains grouped into B. cereus and non-Bacillus group. The B. cereus group was confirmed by 108 strains of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis (30 reference and 78 wild), along with 3 strains of B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, and B. weihenstephanensis; while the non-Bacillus group was composed of 9 Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Direct analysis of samples revealed specificity towards identification and characterization of B. cereus group. The newly developed markers OPL-114-lipo and MT-17 showed specificity of 95% and 81%, respectively in identification of B. cereus. They are efficient tools to identify contaminated sources and the degree of bacterial contamination. Environmental and food samples do not require band isolation, re-amplification, sequencing or sequence identification. Thus, reducing the time and cost of analysis. Hence, it will be an alternative approach to traditional culture methods. Commercial food processing industries will be able to employ these biomarkers specific for B. cereus group as a detection tool to reduce economic loss due to B. cereus contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3abacterial contamination 3abiomarkers 3afinancial economics 3afood industry 3alipoproteins 3amethyltransferases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology 3asoil 0aBacillus 0aDetection 0aGenes 0aPCR (polymerase chain reaction) 0aRapid method1 aChelliah, Ramachandran1 aWei, Shuai1 aPark, Joong-Hyun1 aForghani, Fereidoun1 aPark, Youn-Seo1 aCho, Min-Seok1 aPark, Dong-Suk1 aOh, Deog-Hwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7472-04360 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2018 Feb., v. 115 p.131-137dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.12.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01221naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007400157300001800231520031800249592002800567650002300595650001200618650001200630650001300642700001300655700001700668700001700685773013400702856007400836852000900910655001200919IND60660136720221117070746.0190823e20140213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066013672DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc00344f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchubert, H.12aA bidentate boryl ligand: syntheses of platinum and iridium complexes  ap. 2738-2740.  aA methylenediphenylphosphine substituted diazaborole was obtained in a two-step procedure in amounts around 4 g.

Intraperitoneal injection of RAPA significantly decreased the mRNA level of BD-2 and the concentrations of p-mTORC1 and BD-2 in the jejunal and ileal mucosa of rats with administration of l-Trp (P < 0.05). Oral administration of 1-MT decreased the IDO activity and the mRNA and protein levels of BD-2, and increased the concentrations of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-22 in the jejunal and ileal mucosa of rats with administration of l-Trp (P < 0.05). Intraperitoneal injection of PCPA decreased the TPH activity and increased the mRNA and protein levels of BD-2, but did not change the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-17, or IL-22 in the jejunal and ileal mucosa of rats with administration of l-Trp. The results indicate the Trp-promoted BD-2 expression in the jejunum and ileum via the mTOR pathway and its metabolites: kynurenine banding to aryl hydrocarbon receptor in rat intestine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3aaryl hydrocarbon receptors 3agene expression 3aileum 3aindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 3ainterleukin-17 3aintestinal mucosa 3aintraperitoneal injection 3ajejunum 3akynurenine 3alaboratory animals 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3aoral administration 3aprotein content 3arapamycin 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atryptophan 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aShi, Baoshi1 aSun, Weizhong1 aYin, Yulong1 aChen, Qingju1 aMohamed, Taha1 aLu, Changwen1 aSun, Zhihong0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 21, v. 10, no. 6 p.3371-3379dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra10477a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005900170300001600229520092100245592002801166650001101194650001201205650001101217650001101228653000801239653002601247653002201273653002401295773009801319856008601417852000901503655001201512IND60610126720221120091238.0181015e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061012672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoti, Valerio,12aA new tight and general bound on return predictability  ap. 140-145.  aWe propose a novel upper bound on the predictability of asset returns. This bound is tighter than the bound proposed by Ross (2005) because it takes into account not only the volatility of the pricing kernel but also the correlation between the pricing kernel and trading strategies that exploit predictability. It is also at least as tight as the bound proposed by Huang and Zhou (2017). We apply our bound to study the predictability of returns on currencies of emerging and developed economies from 1994 to 2016. We find evidence of return predictability in excess of the bound, especially for emerging markets currencies. This implies either market inefficiency or, alternatively, that investors either can become very risk-averse or price currencies using a model radically different from the CAPM. In contrast, the evidence of excess-predictability is much weaker under the wider bound proposed by Ross (2005).  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 0aF31 0aPredictability bounds 0aMarket efficiency 0aCurrency strategies0 tEconomics letters.g2018 Jan., v. 162 p.140-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2017.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245015600161520114900317592002801466650002601494650001901520650001001539650002001549700001501569700001901584700001601603700001801619700001801637700001701655700001301672773012001685856007801805852000901883655001201892IND60754186820221118043554.0211023e20211009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075418682DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101023922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shuang 10aComparison of Potent Odorants in Traditional and Modern Types of Chinese Xiaoqu Liquor (Baijiu) Based on Odor Activity Values and Multivariate Analyses  aPredominant odorants in modern and traditional types of Chinese xiaoqu liquor (Baijiu) were identified and compared by the combined use of gas chromatography−olfactometry, odor activity values (OAVs), and multivariate analyses. A total of 79 aroma compounds were identified in a typical modern type xiaoqu Baijiu (M) and a typical traditional type xiaoqu Baijiu (T), 42 of them had OAV > 1 in both M and T samples. The main differences between the two samples were obtained for the concentration of 23 aroma-active compounds. A total of 22 samples made by different brewing processes were analyzed to confirm the differences. Partial least squares discriminant analysis confirmed that 20 compounds could be used as potential markers for discrimination between modern type xiaoqu Baijiu and traditional type xiaoqu Baijiu. Their difference in content is between 1.5 and 17.9 times for modern type xiaoqu Baijiu and traditional type xiaoqu Baijiu. The results showed the aroma characteristics of modern and traditional type xiaoqu Baijiu clearly and comprehensively, which will provide guidance for modern Baijiu quality control and evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscriminant analysis 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aquality control1 aTang, Jie 1 aFan, Shanshan 1 aZhang, Jun 1 aChen, Shenxi 1 aLiu, Yuancai 1 aYang, Qiang 1 aXu, Yan 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 09, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101023923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245005100197300001500248520087500263592002801138650001601166650002001182650001801202650001901220650002701239650001101266650001501277650001301292650001801305650001301323700002201336700002401358773015201382856006901534856008301603990002301686852000901709655001201718IND60643655820221120074303.0190512e20150730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064365582DNAL7 a10.3791/529432doi7 aPMC45446912pmcid7 a262743862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerlach, Gary F.10aMicrobead implantation in the zebrafish embryo  ap. e52943.  aThe zebrafish has emerged as a valuable genetic model system for the study of developmental biology and disease. Zebrafish share a high degree of genomic conservation, as well as similarities in cellular, molecular, and physiological processes, with other vertebrates including humans. During early ontogeny, zebrafish embryos are optically transparent, allowing researchers to visualize the dynamics of organogenesis using a simple stereomicroscope. Microbead implantation is a method that enables tissue manipulation through the alteration of factors in local environments. This allows researchers to assay the effects of any number of signaling molecules of interest, such as secreted peptides, at specific spatial and temporal points within the developing embryo. Here, we detail a protocol for how to manipulate and implant beads during early zebrafish development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryogenesis 3agenetic models 3agermplasm conservation 3ahumans 3amicrobeads 3aontogeny 3aorganogenesis 3apeptides1 aMorales, Elvin E.1 aWingert, Rebecca A.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2015 July 30, , no. 101 p.e52943-e52943dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/529433Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/52943/microbead-implantation-in-the-zebrafish-embryo  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014000164300001600304520094500320592002801265653002001293653001601313653001501329653001601344653000801360653001201368700001801380700002101398700002101419773010101440856008401541852000901625655001201634IND60122816820221119091536.0150325e20150316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012281682DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2014.8835542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDriss, M.10aTraffic safety prediction model for identifying spatial degrees of exposure to the risk of road accidents based on fuzzy logic approach  ap. 243-257.  aThis article, we propose a traffic accident prediction system based on fuzzy logic which allows to identify ‘the degree of exposure to road accidents’ risk’ and to analyse the level of complexity of the factors involved. We focus our study on the possible influence of a series of local criteria observed and selected for each kilometre per segment of the road network studied. The study was conducted on a road network within the rural area of the Wilaya of Mascara in the north-western region of Algeria. A Geographic Information System was integrated into the analysis process to enable a spatial visualization of the degrees of exposure to road accidents’ risk, providing a cartographically measurable solution to establish and attenuate accident risk. Results show that the developed system can be effectively applied as an useful Road Safety tool capable of identifying risk factors related to the characteristics of the road.  aPublisher supplied data 0aexposure degree 0aroad safety 0arural area 0afuzzy logic 0aGIS 0aAlgeria1 aBenabdeli, K.1 aSaint-Gerand, T.1 aHamadouche, M.A.0 tGeocarto International.g2015 Mar. 16, v. 30, no. 3 p.243-257dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2014.8835543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01400naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007000161300001800231520034200249592002800591650002300619650001500642650002300657650002300680650001500703650002100718650001200739650001500751700002200766700002200788700002400810773013300834856007400967852000901041655001201050IND60660137020221117070800.0190823e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066013702DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc00359d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBooth, Samuel G.10aElectrochemical modulation of SERS at the liquid/liquid interface  ap. 4482-4484.  aA surface enhanced Raman scattering system to detect silver nanoparticle adsorption at the water|1,2-dichlorobenzene interface is reported.

The welfare of broiler chickens in cages is affected by movement restriction, poor bone strength due to lack of exercise, and prevention of key behavioral patterns such as dustbathing and ground scratching. Cages for broiler chickens also have a long history of causing skin and leg conditions that could further compromise welfare, but a lack of controlled studies makes it difficult to draw conclusions about newer cage designs. Cage environments are usually stocked at a higher density than open floor systems, and the limited studies available suggest that caging may lead to increased levels of fear and stress in the birds. Further, birds reared on the floor appear less likely to harbor and shed Salmonella, as litter may serve as a seeding agent for competitive exclusion by other microorganisms. Cages for laying hens used in egg production have met with substantial opposition due to welfare concerns and caging broiler chickens will likely be subject to the same kinds of social disapproval.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3aanimal welfare 3abone strength 3acompetitive exclusion 3adust bathing 3aegg production 3aexercise 3afearfulness 3afood safety1 aGreger, Michael0 tAnimals.g2013 May 13, v. 3, no. 2 p.386-400dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani30203863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008900169300001600258520107400274592002801348650001501376650002001391650001201411650001401423650001601437650002801453650001101481650001801492650001101510650001201521653001501533653002301548653001101571653001501582653002101597653001101618700001901629700002701648773009901675856008701774852000901861655001201870IND60542358620221119071617.0190402e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054235862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.11.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRead, Andrew10aIn vitro bioaccessibility and monolayer uptake of lutein from wholegrain baked foods  ap. 263-269.  aLutein-enriched foods would contribute towards promoting the consumption of this important carotenoid.

Digestive conditions representative of the fed state conditions associated with significantly higher lutein bioaccessibility compared with the fasted state (p<0.001). Lutein bioaccessibility of cookies and muffins was higher than flatbreads due to their elevated fat content, measured under either fed or fasted conditions. Lutein concentration in the aqueous phase was the most important factor in determining apical cell uptake of lutein, with cookies and muffins exhibiting a higher lutein uptake than flatbreads (p<0.05).

Specifically, we combine morphotaxonomic and DNA barcode methods to document the identities and host associations of hymenopteran parasitoids that emerge from egg, larval, and pupal stages of seven Neochlamisus species and four Neochlamisus bebbianae (Brown) “host forms.” Data derive from 7,839 specimens reared from field-collected Neochlamisus eggs, larvae, and pupae. Twenty-two species of parasitoid were identified, of which 17 had not previously been documented from Neochlamisus. These represented seven families: Eulophidae (six species), Ichneumonidae (six sp.), Pteromalidae (four sp.), Eupelmidae (three sp.), Chalcididae (one sp.), Eurytomidae (onesp.),and Torymidae (onesp.). Twenty of 22 species were reared from N. bebbianae, the host for which sampling was most intensive. Considerable overlap was observed in the parasitoid guilds associated with different Neochlamisus taxa, but differences in guild composition were also observed. N. bebbianae is of interest to evolutionary biologists because populations associated with different tree taxa (different “host forms”) exhibit host-plant-specific ecological differentiation and appear to be undergoing ecological speciation. This work will allow for future explorations into whether parasitoids identified here likewise exhibit host-beetle-associated differentiation, such that ecological speciation “cascades” across trophic levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChalcididae 3aDNA barcoding 3aEulophidae 3aEupelmidae 3aEurytomidae 3aIchneumonidae 3aNeochlamisus bebbianae 3aPteromalidae 3aTorymidae 3abiologists 3aeggs 3ahosts 3alarvae 3anatural history 3aparasitoids 3apopulation 3apupae 3arearing 3atrees 0aAprostocetus 0aBaryscapus 0aGelis 0aConura 0aScambus1 aFunk, Daniel J.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2013 Nov., v. 106, no. 6 p.818-831dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01306naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011700157300001800274520025300292592002800545650001100573650002300584650002300607650002100630650001400651650002300665650002100688700001300709700001900722700001200741773013200753856007400885852000900959655001200968IND60660137220221117071450.0190823e20140506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066013722DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc00374h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Xiaolin10aAccess to 6H-naphtho[2,3-c]chromenes by a palladium-catalyzed reaction of 2-haloaryl allene with 2-alkynylphenol  ap. 5891-5894.  aA palladium-catalyzed reaction of 2-haloaryl allene with 2-alkynylphenol is described, leading to 6H-naphtho[2,3-c]chromenes in good to excellent yields.

Although native to tropical and subtropical areas of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and Australasia, a number of the pest species, largely members of the Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) complex, have become widespread through accidental introduction associated with agricultural trade. The B. dorsalis complex includes several morphologically and ecologically similar pests, making species designations uncertain. One of these, Bactrocera invadens Drew, Tsuruta, and White, endemic to Sri Lanka, has spread across Africa in the last decade and become a major agricultural pest. We sequenced one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes from 73 specimens, belonging to 19 species to construct phylogenies and examine species relationships and limits within the genus Bactrocera and several species of the B. dorsalis complex-specifically addressing the placement of B. invadens. Results indicate the B. dorsalis complex is polyphyletic. B. invadens and several other species within the B. dorsalis complex (B. dorsalis, Bactrocera papayae Drew &Hancock, and Bactrocera philippinensis Drew & Hancock) are also paraphyletic with respect to each other and probably represent a single genetically indistinguishable, phenotypically plastic, pest species that has spread throughout the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aBactrocera invadens 3aBactrocera papayae 3aBactrocera philippinensis 3afruits 3agenes 3aparaphyly 3apests 3apolyphyly 3atrade 3avegetables 3aAfrica 3aAustralasian region 3aIndia 3aSouth East Asia 3aSri Lanka 0aBactrocera dorsalis 0aDiptera 0aTephritidae 0aB. invadens 0ainvasive species1 aLeblanc, Luc1 aGeib, Scott M.1 aRubinoff, Daniel0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2013 Nov., v. 106, no. 6 p.684-694dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245015600202300001600358500001400374506007600388520133600464592002801800506003701828650001301865650001401878650000901892650000901901650001101910650001401921650001501935650001101950650001001961650002101971650001801992650001602010650001402026650001502040650001102055650001002066650001702076650001702093700001902110773012902129856007402258852000902332655001202341IND60646992920221207113224.0190614e20130626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064699292DNAL7 a10.3390/ani30305582doi7 aPMC44944392pmcid7 a264795212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWecke, Christian10aImproving the Reliability of Optimal In-Feed Amino Acid Ratios Based on Individual Amino Acid Efficiency Data from N Balance Studies in Growing Chicken  ap. 558-573.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThree consecutive nitrogen balance experiments with fast-growing male broiler chickens (ROSS 308), both during starter and grower periods, were conducted to determine the ideal ratios of several indispensable amino acids relative to lysine. The control diets based on corn, wheat, fishmeal, field peas, wheat gluten and soybean oil were formulated by computer optimizing to meet the assumed ideal amino acid ratios and to fulfill both the energy and nutrient requirements of growing chicken. According to principles of the diet dilution technique, balanced control diets were diluted by wheat starch and refilled by crystalline amino acids and remaining feed ingredients, except the amino acid under study. The lysine, threonine, tryptophan, arginine, isoleucine and valine diluted diets resulted in significantly lower protein quality as compared to control diet, especially following increased dietary lysine supply (experiments II and III) and stronger amino acid dilution (experiment III). Accordingly, the limiting position of individual amino acids was confirmed, and the derived amino acid efficiency data were utilized to derive ideal amino acid ratios for the starter period: Lys (100): Thr (60): Trp (19): Arg (105): Ile (55): Val (63); and the grower period: Lys (100): Thr (62): Trp (17): Arg (105): Ile (65): Val (79).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarginine 3acomputers 3acorn 3adiet 3aenergy 3afish meal 3aisoleucine 3alysine 3amales 3anitrogen balance 3aprotein value 3asoybean oil 3athreonine 3atryptophan 3avaline 3awheat 3awheat gluten 3awheat starch1 aLiebert, Frank0 tAnimals.g2013 June 26, v. 3, no. 3 p.558-573dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani30305583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245004400164300001600208520033900224592002800563650001500591650001700606650004400623650001100667650002200678653002600700653001700726653004200743700002500785700002000810700001800830700002200848773015200870856007801022852000901100655001201109IND60523021320221122040234.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052302132DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2002-7-8072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇaliş, İhsan10aSugar Esters from Globularia orientalis  ap. 591-596.  aFrom the methanolic extract of the underground parts of Globularia orientalis, a new antioxidant sugar ester was isolated.

In modern medicine, innate immunity-induced inflammation is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, little is known about the anti-inflammatory effects and molecular mechanism of Danshen.To evaluate the molecular mechanisms of Danshen on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-triggered inflammation in macrophages and identify its bioactive components.Pam3CSK4-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were treated with Danshen water extract (DSE), and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) were measured by both real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based bioinformatics analyses were applied to reveal the novel molecular mechanisms of DSE, followed by western blotting for verification. Additionally, HPLC-UV analysis along with bioassays was performed to identify the bioactive ingredients of DSE.The results of RT-qPCR and ELISA showed that DSE significantly inhibited proinflammatory cytokine expression in a dose-dependent manner. Transcriptome analyses revealed that a wider panel of inflammatory cytokines responded to the regulatory effect of DSE, and that the TNF signaling pathway might have played a vital role. Western blotting data confirmed the involvement of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) and Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) related singling pathway. Among the seven components identified in DSE, Danshensu (DSS) and protocatechuic aldehyde (PA) were confirmed as bioactive ones with anti-inflammatory effects.DSE showed a promising effect against TLR2-triggered inflammation associated with the inhibition of the TNF cascade down-streamed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, in which IL-6 acts as the key effective molecule, and ERK and JNK phosphorylation was inhibited. Notably, DSS and PA were considered bioactive components with anti-inflammatory bioactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3aToll-like receptors 3aWestern blotting 3aaldehydes 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abioactive compounds 3abioassays 3abioinformatics 3acardiovascular diseases 3adanshensu 3adose response 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainflammation 3aingredients 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amedicine 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aAsia 0aDanshen 0aRNA-SEQ 0aTnf signaling pathway 0aIL-6 0a5-HMF 0aBMMs 0aBSA 0aCSF2 0aCXCL10 0aDEGs 0aDSE 0aDSS 0aELISA 0aERK 0aFPKM 0aIL 0aJNK 0aLA 0aLPS 0aMAPK 0aM-CSF 0aNF‐κB 0aPA 0aPMSF 0aPPI 0aPRRs 0aRA 0aRNA-seq 0aRT-qPCR 0aSaA 0aSaB 0aTLR 0aTNF1 aXiong, Difeifei1 aChen, Libing1 aLi, Yufei1 aGong, Shuqing1 aZhang, Luquan1 aLi, Bailing1 aPan, Jianyang1 aQian, Jing1 aQu, Haibin0 tPhytomedicine.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 70 p.153228-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1532283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245013700130300001600267520108600283592002801369650002901397700001901426773010901445852000901554939003301563945000801596946001301604655001201617IND8013018120221120195844.0181002e198004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND801301812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPLEYSIER, J.

Fifty-seven selected surface and lower B horizon samples of Alfisols, Ultisols, and Oxisols with low-activity clays derived from a wide range of parent materials were used.The two extraction methods gave essentially the same CEC values for all soils studied (R = 0.92). Good agreements were also obtained between the dilute AgTU-extractable bases (Ca, Mg, K, Na) and N NH4OAc-extractable bases. The dilute AgTU extraction gave slightly larger values of exchange acidity (Al + H) than the N KCl extraction for most soils.The single-extraction method using unbuffered Ag-thiourea is suitable for rapid, routine measurements of effective CEC and exchangeable cations for soils dominating in variable-charge colloids.  aPublisher supplied data 3acation exchange capacity1 aJuo, A.

To understand children’s snacking habits, snack choices of parents are essential to take into account. General parenting is one of the important factors that can influence the development of healthy eating patterns and weight status among children. Therefore, this study aims to explore how the key constructs of general parenting (nurturance, structure, behavioral control, overprotection and coercive control) relate to mothers’ snack choice for their children aged 2–7 years. The Dutch version of the validated Comprehensive General Parenting Questionnaire (CGPQ) was used to assess the key constructs of general parenting. An extensive, 13-day diary study with 136 Dutch mothers was used to measure the snacks mothers provided their children aged 2–4 years and 5–7 years. For both groups of mothers in our sample, differences were found on the scores of coercive control and overprotection. No differences between the mothers were present on the key constructs behavioral control, nurturance, and structure. Results give a first indication that more mothers who scored relatively higher on coercive control provided unhealthy products, like candy and cookies, and fewer mothers provided vegetables, compared to mothers who scored lower on coercive control. A higher score on coercive control combined with a higher score on overprotection was associated with fewer mothers providing unhealthy products like cookies and candies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acandy 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acookies 3ahealthy eating habits 3amothers 3aparenting 3aquestionnaires 3asnacks 3avegetables 0aGeneral parenting 0aFood choice 0aDiary research 0aGeneral Comprehensive Parental Questionnaire 0aChild dietary behavior 0aSnack1 aSteenbekkers, Bea L.P.A.1 ade Vaal, Marielle T.1 aKampen, Jarl K.1 aFogliano, Vincenzo1 aLuning, Pieternel A.0 tFood quality and preference.g2020 Oct., v. 85 p.103961-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.1039613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245007100157300001600228500001900244520166900263592002801932650001101960650001001971650002701981650001702008650000902025650002002034650001502054650003202069650001502101650001802116650001302134650001702147650001902164650001202183650001202195650000902207653002102216653002002237653001802257700001702275700001802292773010202310856007102412852000902483655001202492IND60707232320221120094230.0200819s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070723232DNAL7 a10.1071/SR192462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrawford, D.

Instead, data collected for other purposes are re-used as has been the case in our area of interest here: managing the threat of soil erosion on farm land in East Gippsland. The dynamic nature of soil fertility challenges this approach, so we conducted a new survey using 234 paddocks selected at random. These new data were compared to re-purposed legacy data. Plant tissue samples from a selected subset were used to assess micronutrients. Separately, 27 paddocks that had been sampled during 1975–89 were re-tested to examine temporal changes. We concluded that many paddocks are now strongly or very strongly acidic and deficient in molybdenum (Mo) and boron (B). More specifically, those under dairying, cropping and horticulture are likely to have adequate phosphorus (P) while those grazed for meat and wool are likely to be deficient in P. We concluded that grazing enterprises need to either re-adopt soil testing and fertiliser treatment or adopt management practices suitable for acid soils deficient in P, Mo and B, if their paddocks are to support sustainable productive agriculture. Data from the re-tested paddocks suggest that, in general, many were once less acidic, highlighting the difficulties in using legacy data. Also, contrasts in soil pH and available P between paddocks under different management regimes, highlighted the difficulties in using re-purposed data. We concluded that a statistically designed survey is a preferable basis for natural resource management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3aboron 3afertilizer application 3ahorticulture 3ameat 3amilk production 3amolybdenum 3anatural resource management 3aphosphorus 3aplant tissues 3aresearch 3asoil erosion 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asurveys 3awool 0adryland cropping 0anutrient status 0apasture soils1 aMitchard, B.1 aBurton, W.

M2 macrophages and activated fibroblasts (AFs) modulate behavior of cancer cells in the TME. Since nutritional effects on cancer progression, including colorectal cancer (CRC), may be mediated by alterations in the TME, we determined the ability of β-carotene (BC) to mediate anti-cancer effects through regulation of macrophage polarization and fibroblast activation in CRC. The M2 macrophage phenotype was induced by treating U937 cells with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and interleukin (IL)-4. Treatment of these M2 macrophages with BC led to suppression of M2-type macrophage-associated markers and of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. In separate experiments, AFs were induced by treating CCD-18Co cells with transforming growth factor-β1. BC treatment suppressed expression of fibroblast activation markers. In addition, conditioned media from BC-treated M2 macrophages and AF inhibited cancer stem cell markers, colon cancer cell invasiveness and migration, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In vivo, BC supplementation inhibited tumor formation and the expression of M2 macrophage markers in an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis-associated CRC mouse model. To our knowledge, the present findings provide the first evidence suggesting that the potential therapeutic effects of BC on CRC are mediated by the inhibition of M2 macrophage polarization and fibroblast activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3aantineoplastic activity 3aazoxymethane 3abeta-carotene 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adextran 3afibroblasts 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasm progression 3aphenotype 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aβ-Carotene 0aColon cancer 0aColitis-associated colorectal cancer 0aM2 macrophages 0aActivated fibroblasts1 aKim, Yerin1 aKim, Yoo Sun1 aShin, Jae-Ho1 aRubin, Lewis P.1 aKim, Yuri0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2020 Aug., v. 82 p.108402-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2020.1084023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245009800196300001600294520116500310592002801475650002101503650002501524650001901549650002101568650002601589650002001615650002201635650001101657650001001668650000901678650001401687650001601701650006801717650002101785650002201806650001301828650003001841650002301871650004301894650003301937650003101970651001102001651001102012700002902023700003002052700003502082700003102117700003002148773009502178856008102273852000902354655001202363IND50072385120221120172222.0150212e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007238512DNAL7 a241907562pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-013-0454-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Queiroz, Casley Borges10aUse of the IRAP Marker to Study Genetic Variability in Pseudocercospora fijiensis Populations  ap. 358-364.  aPseudocercospora fijiensis is the etiological agent of black Sigatoka, which is currently considered as one of the most destructive banana diseases in all locations where it occurs. It is estimated that a large portion of the P. fijiensis genome consists of transposable elements, which allows researchers to use transposon-based molecular markers in the analysis of genetic variability in populations of this pathogen. In this context, the inter-retrotransposon-amplified polymorphism (IRAP) was used to study the genetic variability in P. fijiensis populations from different hosts and different geographical origins in Brazil. A total of 22 loci were amplified and 77.3 % showed a polymorphism. Cluster analysis revealed two major groups in Brazil. The observed genetic diversity (HE) was 0.22, and through molecular analysis of variance, it was determined that the greatest genetic variability occurs within populations. The discriminant analysis of principal components revealed no structuring related to the geographical origin of culture of the host. The IRAP-based marker system is a suitable tool for the study of genetic variability in P. fijiensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudocercospora 3aanalysis of variance 3ablack Sigatoka 3acluster analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ahosts 3aloci 3apathogens 3atransposons 2aAscomycotaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCluster Analysis 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Typingxmethods 2aMusaxmicrobiology 2aMycological Typing Techniquesxmethods 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aSantana, Mateus Ferreira1 ada Silva, Gilvan Ferreira1 aMizubuti, Eduardo Seiti Gomide1 ade Araújo, Elza Fernandes1 ade Queiroz, Marisa Vieira0 tCurrent microbiology.g2014 Mar., v. 68, no. 3 p.358-364dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-013-0454-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013500173300001600308520119800324592002801522650002601550650001901576650002101595650002101616650001801637650003801655650001901693650001101712650002301723650003901746650002201785650005201807650001201859653001901871653001901890653001401909653002301923700002201946773013301968856008702101852000902188655001202197IND60605274120221120212534.0200110e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060527412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsfandiari, Neda13aAn isolate of Potato Virus X capsid protein from N. benthamiana: Insights from homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation  ap. 939-946.  aSince Potato Virus X (PVX) is easily transmitted mechanically between their hosts, its control is difficult. We have previously reported new isolate of this virus (PVX-Iran, GenBank Accession number FJ461343). However, the molecular basis of resistance breaking activity and its relation to capsid protein structure are still not well-understood. SDS-PAGE, ELISA, Western blot and RT-PCR molecular examinations were performed on the inoculated plants Nicotiana benthamiana. The pathological symptoms were related to the PVX isolate. The capsid protein (CP) structure were modeled based on homology and subjected to three independent 80 ns molecular dynamics minimization (GROMACS, OPLS force field) in the SPC water box. The RMSD, RMSF, SASA, and electrostatic properties were retrieved from the trajectories. Flexibility and hydrophilic nature of the N-terminal residues (1–34) of solvated CP could be observed in conformational changes upon minimization. The obtained structure was then docked with NbPCIP1 using ClusPro 2.0. The strong binding affinity of these two proteins (≈−16.0 Kcal mol⁻¹) represents the formation of inclusion body and hence appearance of the symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPotato virus X 3aWestern blotting 3abinding capacity 3acoat proteins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein structure 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 0aPotato Virus X 0aCapsid protein 0aPathology 0aMolecular dynamics1 aSefidbakht, Yahya0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Sept., v. 116 p.939-946dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012500161300001600286520142700302592002801729650001301757650001901770650001601789650001601805650001001821650001001831650001701841650001901858650003701877650001201914650001601926653001601942653002301958653002701981653003002008700001902038700002002057700001502077700001702092700001702109700001602126700001702142773013502159856007802294852000902372655001202381IND60520602320221120224259.0160522e20160119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052060232DNAL7 a10.1515/pjvs-2015-01122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakimiuk, E.10aEvaluation of selected serum biochemical and haematological parameters in gilts exposed per os to 100 ppb of zearalenone  ap. 865-872.  aZearalenone (ZEN) widely contaminates animal feed of plant origin. The recommended safe concentrations of ZEN in feeds for various animal species are set mainly based on the mycotoxin’s hormonal properties (NOEL). Our growing knowledge about biologically active concentrations of ZEN, molecular mechanisms and cells/tissues targeted by ZEN indicates that the harmful effects exerted by this mycotoxin on animals may be far greater than previously believed. This experiment was performed on pre-pubertal gilts divided into a control group (n=9) and an experimental group (ZEN, n=9). The control group received placebo, whereas the experimental group was administered ZEN at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg feed (equivalent to 5 μg/kg BW/day) for 42 days. On days 14, 28 and 42 blood samples were collected from the animals to determine the concentrations of selected zearalenols, serum biochemical and haematological parameters. Conjugated ZEN was found in the blood serum of the experimental gilts. Changes in the analysed biochemical parameters included a transient increase in albumin and cholesterol levels. A statistically significant increase in the concentrations of neutrophilic and acidophilic granulocytes was observed in the white blood cell system. The results indicate that long-term per os exposure of pre-pubertal gilts to low doses of ZEN (below NOEL) has a modulatory effect on liver function and white blood cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3afeeds 3agilts 3agranulocytes 3aliver function 3ano observed adverse effect level 3apuberty 3azearalenone 0azearalenone 0apre-pubertal gilts 0abiochemical parameters 0ahaematological parameters1 aRadwińska, J.1 aPomianowski, A.1 aWoźny, M.1 aObremski, K.1 aGajęcka, M.1 aBrzuzan, P.1 aGajęcki, M.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2016 Jan. 19, v. 18, no. 4 p.865-872dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:J000000145x2300-25577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjvs-2015-01123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245014800165300001800313500002000331520147700351592002801828650002501856650001901881650001101900650002301911650001401934650001001948650004201958650000902000650001702009650001502026650003702041650001302078650001402091650000902105700001902114700003102133700002902164700001802193700002802211700001802239700002302257773011002280856007902390852000902469655001202478IND60579438820221121163731.0170817e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057943882DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.137562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte, Márcia10aFunctional soil metagenomics: elucidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation potential following 12 years of in situ bioremediation  ap. 2992-3011.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA culture‐independent function‐based screening approach was used to assess the microbial aerobic catabolome for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degradation of a soil subjected to 12 years of in situ bioremediation. A total of 422 750 fosmid clones were screened for key aromatic ring‐cleavage activities using 2,3‐dihydroxybiphenyl as substrate. Most of the genes encoding ring‐cleavage enzymes on the 768 retrieved positive fosmids could not be identified using primer‐based approaches and, thus, 205 fosmid inserts were sequenced. Nearly two hundred extradiol dioxygenase encoding genes of three different superfamilies could be identified. Additional key genes of aromatic metabolic pathways were identified, including a high abundance of Rieske non‐heme iron oxygenases that provided detailed information on enzymes activating aromatic compounds and enzymes involved in activation of the side chain of methylsubstituted aromatics. The gained insights indicated a complex microbial network acting at the site under study, which comprises organisms similar to recently identified Immundisolibacter cernigliae TR3.2 and Rugosibacter aromaticivorans Ca6 and underlined the great potential of an approach that combines an activity‐screening, a cost‐effective high‐throughput sequencing of fosmid clones and a phylogenomic‐routed and manually curated database to carefully identify key proteins dedicated to aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3abioremediation 3aclones 3acost effectiveness 3adatabases 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3airon 3ametagenomics 3aoxygenases 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aproteins 3ascreening 3asoil1 aNielsen, Agnes1 aCamarinha‐Silva, Amélia1 aVilchez‐Vargas, Ramiro1 aBruls, Thomas1 aWos‐Oxley, Melissa L.1 aJauregui, Ruy1 aPieper, Dietmar H.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2017 Aug., v. 19, no. 8 p.2992-3011dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.137563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03605naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245012000152300001600272520216700288592002802455650001202483650001902495650002602514650002702540650001402567650001002581650001202591650001202603650001102615650001502626650001302641650002702654650002002681650001002701650002002711650002102731650002102752650002202773650001202795700001702807700001502824700001802839700001802857700001202875700001502887700002002902773010402922856004003026852000903066655001203075IND50072144420221120031248.0140122e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007214442DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.122002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHongyun,10aAntisense suppression of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) sucrose synthase 3 (CsSUS3) reduces hypoxic stress tolerance  ap. 795-810.  aSucrose synthase (SUS; EC 2.4.1.13) plays important roles in sugar metabolism and abiotic stress response. But the genes encoding SUS in cucumber (Cucumis sativusL.) have not been well studied. Here, we isolated four cucumber sucrose synthase genes (CsSUS). Among them, CsSUS3, which highly expressed in the roots, was chosen for further study. Immunolocalization and subcellular localization analysis indicated that CsSUS3 localized in the cytosol and the plasma membrane, and mainly existed in the companion cells of phloem in the roots. When suffering hypoxia stress from flooding, CsSUS3 expression and SUS activity in roots increased, especially in the lateral roots; moreover, the soluble SUS activity increased clearly, but the membrane fraction hardly changed. Compared with the wild-type cucumbers, the transgenic lines with antisense expression of CsSUS3 were more sensitive to flooding. After 6 d of flooding, the SUS activity, soluble sugar and uridine 5′-diphosphate glucose (UDPG) content and the ratio of ATP/ADP in the roots of transgenic plants were significantly lower than that in wild-type plants. Moreover, the transgenic lines grew more slowly with more yellow necrosis in the leaves. These findings suggested CsSUS3 participated in resisting hypoxic stress. Furthermore, the mechanism of CsSUS3 in resisting hypoxic stress was also discussed. Cucumber is an important horticultural crop, but it often suffers from the heavy rainstorm which led excessive accumulation of water in field so affected the growth in summer growing season. It has been reported that sucrose synthase (SUS; EC 2.4.1.13) was a low oxygen induced protein, but the role and functional mechanism of SUS in low oxygen conditions is controversial. In this study, four putative CsSUS cDNA were first isolated from cucumber. Among these genes, CsSUS3, which was highly expressed in the root and strongly induced by flooding treatment, was chose for the further research. Via histochemical, subcellular localization and antisense suppression of CsSUS3 in cucumber, we found that CsSUS3 played an important role in resisting hypoxic stress. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis 3aabiotic stress 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acucumbers 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahypoxia 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3anecrosis 3aphloem companion cells 3aplasma membrane 3aroots 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3asucrose synthase 3atransgenic plants 3auridine1 aSUI, XIAOLEI1 aGUO, JINJU1 aWang, Zhenyu,1 aCHENG, JINTAO1 aMa, Si,1 aLi, Xiang,1 aZHANG, ZHENXIAN0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2014 Mar., v. 37, no. 3 p.795-810dBlackwell Sciencex0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.12200  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245012400212300001800336520155800354592002801912650001201940650001701952650001601969650001601985650001402001650001902015650001902034650001502053650002802068650001302096650001802109650000702127650002402134650001102158650001602169650001602185700003802201700002202239700006102261700006102322773011302383856008402496852000902580655001202589IND60685936120200413000000.0200311e20200219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068593612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b036482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjörkegren, Sanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7425-205410aPhase Inversions Observed in Thermoresponsive Pickering Emulsions Stabilized by Surface Functionalized Colloidal Silica  ap. 2357-2367.  aIn this study, the emulsification performance of functionalized colloidal silica is explored with the aim to achieve phase inversion of particle-stabilized (Pickering) emulsion systems. An increased understanding of inversion conditions can facilitate surfactant-free emulsion fabrication and expand its use in industrial applications. Phase inversion was achieved by adjusting the temperature but without changing the composition of the emulsion formulation. Silica nanoparticles modified with hydrophobic propyl groups and hydrophilic methyl poly(ethylene)glycol (mPEG) groups are used as emulsifiers, enabling control of the wettability of the particles and exploration of phase inversion phenomena, the latter due to the thermoresponsiveness of the attached PEG chains. The phase inversion conditions as well as the reversibility of the emulsion systems were examined at varying electrolyte concentrations and pH values of the suspensions. Transitional phase inversions, from oil-in-water and water-in-oil and back, were observed in functionalized silica particle-stabilized butanol emulsions at distinct temperatures. The phase inversion temperature was affected by electrolyte concentration and pH conditions due to salting-out effects, PEG–silica interactions, and the effects of the particle surface charge. Investigations of phase inversion conditions, temperature, and hysteresis effects in Pickering emulsions can improve the theoretical understanding of these phenomena and facilitate the implementation of low-energy emulsion preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutanol 3aelectrolytes 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ahysteresis 3aindustrial applications 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3asilica 3atemperature 3awettability1 aFreixiela Dias, Maria Costa Artur1 aLundahl, Kristina1 aNordstierna, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6580-06101 aPalmqvist, Anders1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7579-39360 tLangmuir.g2020 Feb. 19, v. 36, no. 9 p.2357-2367dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b036483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245009000160300002000250500001900270520113700289592002801426650002101454650001601475650001301491650002101504650001201525650001301537653002501550653001901575653003401594653003201628653003501660700005601695700002001751700001701771700001501788700001601803700001301819700001301832700001501845700001701860700005201877700005401929700001501983773014101998856007802139852000902217655001202226IND60739059720221119174149.0210526e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073905972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c036152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yunfeng10aUltrasensitive and Wearable Carbon Hybrid Fiber Devices as Robust Intelligent Sensors  ap. 23905-23914.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe growing applications of wearable electronics, electronic textiles, and biomedical devices have sparked explosive demand for high-performance flexible sensors. Herein, we report a facile approach for fabricating a highly sensitive carbon hybrid fiber, which is composed of a graphene fiber skeleton and carbon nanotube (CNT) branches. In this hierarchical fiber, in situ grown CNTs prohibit the stacking of graphene sheets and bridge graphene layers simultaneously, making the hybrid fiber fluffy and conductive. Due to the well-designed architecture, the assembled fiber sensor exhibits satisfactory performance with a high gauge factor (up to 1127), a fast response time (less than 70 ms), and excellent reliability and stability (>2000 cycles). This work provides a feasible and scalable pathway for the fabrication of ultrasensitive fiber-based sensors, achieving the full realization of monitoring human physiological signals and architecting a real-time human–machine controlling system. Moreover, these practical sensors are used to monitor the sitting posture to prevent cervical spondylosis and lumbar disc herniation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectronics 3agraphene 3ahuman physiology 3aposture 3askeleton 0acarbon hybrid fibers 0astrain sensors 0aflexible wearable electronics 0ahuman−machine interaction 0apersonalized health monitoring1 aHuang, Tieqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9755-76351 aZhang, Hongjian1 aLin, Huijuan1 aZhang, Yao1 aKe, Longwei1 aCao, Wei1 aHu, Kang1 aDing, Ying1 aWang, Xueyou1 aRui, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9921-52841 aZhu, Jixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8749-89371 aHuang, Wei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 May 13, v. 13, no. 20 p.23905-23914dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c036153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002900113040001800142100002700160245013600187300001600323520176000339592002802099650001702127650003302144650001402177650001802191650001402209650002002223650001202243650001802255650003702273650002702310650001402337650001902351653002602370653001702396653002802413653002102441653001302462700002302475700002002498700002402518700002702542700002302569700001902592773011502611856007502726852000902801655001202810IND60114908420221119194601.0141124e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011490842DNAL7 a235357732pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.12003302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerckx, Vincent S.F.T.10aPhylogenetic relationships of the mycoheterotrophic genus Voyria and the implications for the biogeographic history of Gentianaceae  ap. 712-721.  a• Premise of the study: The angiosperm family Gentianaceae comprises over 1700 species in 91 genera. Gentianaceae are distributed worldwide, but most species occur in temperate zones. Phylogenetic studies demonstrate that the family consists of six monophyletic tribes. However, the phylogenetic position of the mycoheterotrophic genus Voyria, with a remarkable trans-Atlantic distribution, remained unknown.• Methods: We used nuclear ITS and 18S rDNA and mitochondrial apt1 and matR data to infer the phylogenetic position of Voyria in Gentianaceae. In addition, with Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses we obtained age estimates for the diversification of Voyria and Gentianaceae in general and used these results to reconstruct the ancestral areas associated with the early diversification events in Gentianaceae.• Key results: Our results demonstrate that Voyria is an early diverging lineage within Gentianaceae with no close relationships to other mycoheterotrophic Gentianaceae lineages. Voyria originated in the neotropics during the Early Eocene but only reached its current transoceanic distribution around the end of the Oligocene. The neotropics were an important area for the early diversification events in Gentianaceae, most of which occurred during the Eocene.• Conclusions: Voyria is an old, phylogenetically isolated lineage within Gentianaceae, and the current distribution of the genus is indicative of the ancestral area in which the early diversification events of Gentianaceae occurred. In parallel with many other pantropical families, our results suggest that migration of tropical taxa through Laurasia during the Early Eocene has played an important role in shaping the current global distribution of Gentianaceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGentianaceae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amonophyly 3aribosomal DNA 3asymbiosis 3atemperate zones 3atropics 2aBayes Theorem 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistry 2aGentianaceaexgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPhylogeography 0aDisjunct distribution 0aGentianaceae 0along-distance dispersal 0amycoheterotrophy 0aVoyrieae1 aKissling, Jonathan1 aHentrich, Heiko1 aJanssens, Steven B.1 aMennes, Constantijn B.1 aSpecht, Chelsea D.1 aSmets, Erik F.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2013 Apr., v. 100, no. 4 p.712-721dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.12003303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245016600203300001800369500002000387520071700407592002801124596008501152596008501237596008601322596008501408596008501493596007201578596006901650596006801719596010301787650001601890650001001906650001101916650002001927650002001947650001601967700007001983700002902053700002902082700002502111700003402136773012202170856007302292852000902365655001202374IND60677587920221120061807.0191130e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067758792DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.129172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Iara Oliveira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1785-838010aReef‐building coralline algae from the Southwest Atlantic: filling gaps with the recognition of Harveylithon (Corallinaceae, Rhodophyta) on the Brazilian coast  ap. 1370-1385.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Southwest Atlantic is notable for having extensive reef areas cemented by nongeniculate coralline red algae.

Our findings highlight the importance of using an approach with several lines of evidence to solve the taxonomic status of the cryptic species.  aPublisher supplied data  a564945/2010‐2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a477614/2013‐2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a150068/2017‐ 4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a307368/2015‐7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a440575/2015‐0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aPNE. 0020/2011cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia  aRED006/2012cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a2015TR1702cFundação de Apoio à Pesquisa Científica e Tecnológica do Estado de Santa Catarina 3aHydrolithon 3aalgae 3acoasts 3acryptic species 3agenetic markers 3anew species1 aJesus, Priscila Barreto de1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6072-14221 ade Jesus, Tiana da Silva1 aSouza, Poline dos Santos1 aHorta, Paulo Antunes1 aNunes, José Marcos de Castro0 tJournal of phycology.g2019 Dec., v. 55, no. 6 p.1370-1385dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl23523x0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.129173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008300176300001200259520109400271592002801365650001501393650001501408650002201423650002201445650001301467650001101480650001101491650000701502650002301509650001501532650001301547700001801560700002501578700002401603773012401627856008101751852000901832655001201841IND60574460120221119230952.0170816e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057446012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3469-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacioiu, Ionela-Gabriela10aRemoval of Tartrazine from Aqueous Solution by Adsorption on Activated Red Mud  ap. 298.  aIn this study, activated red mud was used to develop an effective adsorbent in order to remove a toxic azo dye (tartrazine E102) from aqueous solutions. To increase the adsorption capacity, the red mud was activated by acid-heat treatment using 20 wt.% HCl (RM-HCl). To establish the optimum operating parameters, the influence of pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, initial dye concentration, and stirring rate was investigated. The adsorption equilibrium was studied using Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Temkin isotherm models, and the characteristic parameters for each adsorption isotherm were determined. The kinetics of the adsorption process was analyzed by means of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models. The maximum removal efficiency obtained under optimum conditions was 84.72%. These results were in accordance with the isotherm and kinetic data. The results suggested that tartrazine adsorption process follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and also that fits Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was 136.98 mg/g.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3ahydrochloric acid 3akinetics 3amixing 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atartrazine 3atoxicity1 aStoica, Ligia1 aConstantin, Carolina1 aStanescu, Ana-Maria0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Aug., v. 228, no. 8 p.298-298dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3469-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012500166300001600291520183800307592002802145650002102173650003302194650002002227650001602247650002402263650001302287700002102300700002002321700001902341700002302360700002302383700001802406700001902424700002102443700001702464700002002481773010902501856008202610852000902692655001202701IND60787274420221122084334.0220808e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078727442DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617223001782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPimenov, N. V.10aIntroduction of Exogenous Activated Sludge as a Way to Enhance the Efficiency of Nitrogen Removal in the Anammox Process  ap. 356-363.  aThe effect of introduction of exogenous activated sludge (bioaugmentation) on the activity and composition of the microbial consortium carrying out the nitritation-anammox process in an SBR bioreactor was investigated. Two bioaugmentation strategies were tested: the exogenous sludge was added either immediately after inoculation with the anammox activated sludge or when the stable mode of nitrogen removal was achieved. The share of introduced sludge (by the amount of volatile dry matter) was 28‒35% of the total activated sludge mass. The growth conditions and community composition for activated sludges differed significantly: members of the genera “Candidatus Brocadia” and “Ca. Jettenia” were predominant in the aboriginal sludge, while “Ca. Kuenenia” and “Ca. Jettenia” predominated in the exogenous one. While bioaugmentation at the time of launching resulted in a 15% increase in nitrogen removal efficiency, this positive effect was short-lived (by day 46 of cultivation, the values of nitrogen removal efficiency in the control and experimental reactors were the same). Addition of exogenous activated sludge after the stable nitrogen removal mode was reached (day 53) increased the efficiency of nitrogen removal by 21‒35%, and this difference was maintained until the end of the experiment (90 days). The introduced anammox bacteria did not get acclimatized in the community of the SBR reactor; whatever was the method of their introduction, their abundance decreased to the minimum values. Our data indicate that the efficiency of nitrogen removal by the nitritation-anammox process may be enhanced by introduction of activated sludges differing in both the composition and the cultivation conditions from the aboriginal ones, either at reactor launching or into an actively operating bioreactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abioaugmentation 3abioreactors 3acommunity structure 3anitrogen1 aNikolaev, Yu.

Here, flexible Heusler alloy Ni–Mn–Sn films have been deposited on mica substrates by pulsed laser deposition with a Ti buffer layer. Clear ferromagnetic (FM) transition followed by the martensitic transformation at around room temperature and exchange bias (EB) with a blocking temperature of 70 K are observed. Under the application of both tensile and compressive strains by bending the mica substrates, all the characteristic temperatures of Ni–Mn–Sn films, including the FM transition temperature, martensitic transformation temperature, and blocking temperature of EB, are significantly increased by about 10 K. Furthermore, EB field and coercivity are both strongly strengthened, which is mainly caused by the simultaneous enhancement of FM and anti-FM Mn–Mn coupling because of their shortened separations by strain and verified by the Monte Carlo simulation results. The strain controlling for structural and magnetic properties provides efficient manipulation for Heusler alloy-based magnetic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalloys 3aambient temperature 3aferromagnetism 3amica 3aphase transition 0amartensitic transformation 0aexchange bias 0aspin glass 0aflexible thin films 0astrain control1 aHu, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5595-76251 aWang, Haobo1 aNiu, Ben1 aChen, Jiawei1 aLiu, Ruobai1 aYuanyuan,1 aWang, Guangyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8896-33671 aWu, Di1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3619-14111 aXu, Mingxiang1 aHan, Zhida1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1976-17421 aDu, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9967-945X1 aXu, Qingyu0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 May 14, v. 13, no. 20 p.24285-24294dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c037013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245007200167300001800239500002000257520139100277592002801668650003501696650002401731650001301755650002601768650001401794650002301808650001001831650001001841650001501851650002501866650001401891650001801905650002601923650001001949700002301959700002001982700002702002700003402029700002002063773011002083856007902193852000902272655001202281IND60579439020221123041334.0170817e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057943902DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.138502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalke, Jenifer B.10aDominance‐function relationships in the amphibian skin microbiome  ap. 3387-3397.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSome amphibian skin bacteria inhibit growth of a fungal amphibian pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), but it is unclear how dominant these anti‐Bd bacteria are in skin communities. Using in vitro co‐culture challenge assays, we quantified Bd inhibition by bacterial isolates collected from the skin of four amphibian species: bullfrogs, Eastern newts, spring peepers and American toads. The 16S rRNA sequences for each isolate were matched to culture‐independent amplicon sequences from the same individuals to assess inhibitory function versus relative abundance. Dominant bacteria had higher Bd inhibition than rare bacteria in bullfrog and newt populations, in which Bd was prevalent (> 25%). Dominant and rare bacteria did not differ in Bd inhibition in spring peeper and toad populations, in which Bd was absent or at low prevalence (< 7%). In addition, over half of the relative abundance of cultured bacteria on bullfrogs and newts was comprised of inhibitory bacteria, while only 25% and 37% of the relative abundance was inhibitory on spring peepers and toads, respectively. These results suggest that the dominant members of the amphibian skin bacterial community may be functionally important in terms of disease‐resistance, and that Bd prevalence and/or host species identity may impact the relative abundance and inhibitory properties of skin bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 3aPseudacris crucifer 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3acoculture 3adisease resistance 3afungi 3ahosts 3amicrobiome 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aribosomal RNA 3asalamanders and newts 3atoads1 aBecker, Matthew H.1 aHughey, Myra C.1 aSwartwout, Meredith C.1 aJensen, R.

After hydrolysis with subtilisin, the yields of the peptides that were soluble in trichloroacetic acid (TCA-soluble) and the antioxidant activities of the resulting hydrolysate were determined using an orthogonal design and a hydroxyl radical scavenging reaction. The hydrolysate was fractionated using Sephadex G-15 gel filtration chromatography, and the two resulting bioactive peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC with a Kromasil C18 (ODS) column. The amino acid sequences were analyzed by nano-ESI-MS/MS.The critical reaction temperature, pH, hydrolysis time and enzyme-to-substrate (E/S) ratio were determined for the optimum hydrolysis with subtilisin, and the E/S ratio was found to be the most critical reaction condition. The amino acid sequences of the peptides (518 and 440Da) were proline-valine-methionine-glycine-aspartic acid (PVMGA) and glutamine-histidine-glycine-valine (QHGV), respectively. These two novel peptides exhibited high antioxidative actions based on their hydroxyl and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoysters 3apeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3afree radical scavengers 3agel chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3aprotein hydrolysates 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atrichloroacetic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3aCrassostrea 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aChromatography, Reverse-Phase 2aCrassostreaxchemistry 2aDietary Proteinsxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aDietary Supplements 2aFree Radical Scavengersxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aHydroxyl Radicalxantagonists & inhibitors 2aMicrochemistry 2aOligopeptidesxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Fragmentsxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProtein Hydrolysatesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aShellfishxanalysis 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aSubtilisinxmetabolism 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 0aChina 0aSubtilisin 0aRadical scavenging activity 0aOyster Crassostrea talienwhanensis 0aAntioxidative peptide 0aHydrolysate 0asize exclusion chromatography1 aLi, Wei1 aHe, Yunhai1 aRen, Dandan1 aKow, Felicia1 aSong, Linlin1 aYu, Xingju0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 145 p.991-996dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010700171300001600278520126900294592002801563650001201591650002601603650001901629650003101648650001701679650002801696650002001724650002001744650001301764650001601777650001201793653001601805653002401821653002501845653001301870653002001883700001501903773013501918856008702053852000902140655001202149IND60605274520221120212446.0190131e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060527452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabbani, Gulam10aRoles of osmolytes in protein folding and aggregation in cells and their biotechnological applications  ap. 483-491.  aNature has selected osmolytes to protect intracellular macromolecules exposed to denaturing conditions and stabilize proteins. Osmolytes are small naturally occurring compounds that act as chemical chaperones under changing environmental conditions and in disease states, and are present in microorganisms, animals, and plants. In the intracellular environment osmolytes naturally accumulate at high concentrations when cells/tissues are exposed to stressful conditions, which is important because protein aggregation, misfolding, and destabilization underlie the pathogenesis of several life-threatening neurodegenerative disorders. The chaperone abilities of osmolytes suggests they may be therapeutically used for the treatment of several diseases associated with protein misfolding, and their abilities to protect proteins against denaturing stresses impinges on the fundamental problem of protein stabilization, which plagues the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnologists, and researchers. We hope that this review will encourage further research in this area and catalyze increased collaboration at the interface of chemistry and biology to decipher the mechanisms and roles of protein folding, misfolding and aggregation in the fields of health and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aenvironmental factors 3amicroorganisms 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apathogenesis 3apharmaceutical industry 3aplants (botany) 3aprotein folding 3aproteins 3aresearchers 3atissues 0aAggregation 0aChemical chaperones 0aInflammation disease 0aOsmolyte 0aProtein folding1 aChoi, Inho0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 109 p.483-491dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002900113040001800142100002100160245011500181300001600296520163900312592002801951650001801979650002501997650001702022650002602039650001002065650001702075650002502092650001602117650001202133650001702145650003102162650002202193651001002215651001002225653001702235653001802252653000902270653001602279653001502295700001902310700002002329700001602349700001902365700001902384773011502403856007502518852000902593655001202602IND60114908620221119194743.0141124e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011490862DNAL7 a235107602pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.12005552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbihara, Atsushi12aA survey of the fern gametophyte flora of Japan: Frequent independent occurrences of noncordiform gametophytes  ap. 735-743.  a• Premise of the study: Ferns and lycophytes are the only extant land plants with two free-living generations (sporophytes and gametophytes); hence, a single species may have two different distributions. The distribution of the gametophytes of most fern species, which are much smaller in size than sporophytes, are almost unknown due to the difficulty of identifying gametophytes using morphological characters.• Methods: Twelve quadrats (1 m2 or 0.25 m2), each subdivided into a grid of 100 (10 × 10) or 25 (5 × 5) squares, were used to survey gametophytes in the Japanese Archipelago, where distribution data of sporophytes and “DNA barcodes” for identification of gametophytes have fully been established in previous studies. Collected gametophytes were identified using the plastid rbcL-a region.• Key results: In total, gametophytes of 38 species in two broad morphological categories (28 cordiform and 10 noncordiform species) were identified among 407 collections. The cordiform gametophytes discovered are without exception accompanied by their conspecific sporophytes at the periphery of the quadrats. On the other hand, the sporophytic counterparts of the noncordiform gametophytes are often not found or are rare around the sites.• Conclusions: This study demonstrates with a regional flora that fern gametophytes do not always co-occur with sporophytes of the same species. In particular, noncordiform gametophytes tended to occur independently of conspecific sporophytes. This pattern may be due to the capability for indeterminate growth and vegetative reproduction by gemmae in noncordiform gametophytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aasexual reproduction 3aembryophytes 3aferns and fern allies 3aflora 3agametophytes 3aindeterminate growth 3asporophytes 3asurveys 2aBiodiversity 2aFernsxanatomy & histology 2aGerm Cells, Plant 3aJapan 0aJapan 0adistribution 0aDNA barcoding 0afern 0agametophyte 0asporophyte1 aYamaoka, Asami1 aMizukami, Naoko1 aSakoda, Aki1 aNitta, Joel H.1 aImaichi, Ryoko0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2013 Apr., v. 100, no. 4 p.735-743dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.12005553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300001200274520150400286592002801790650002301818650001501841650001501856650002901871650002601900650002001926650001801946650001201964650001001976650001401986650001702000650001102017650001702028650001802045650003402063650001902097650001402116650002102130650001602151651001402167773014102181856008202322852000902404655001202413IND60574460420221119231141.0180619e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057446042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3460-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFergusson, Lee10aAnthrosols and Technosols: the Anthropogenic Signature of Contaminated Soils and Sediments in Australia  ap. 269.  aThis paper explores the proposition that we are living in an era marked by unprecedented quantities and exotic types of human waste and environmental contamination by examining the impact of anthropogenic activity on the Earth’s epiderm. Specifically, the paper introduces anthrosols and technosols as critical markers of unfettered human activity as recorded in the terrestrial stratigraphic signature of soils and sediments adversely impacted by municipal, agricultural, industrial and maritime activities. The paper presents examples of the sources and fates of some of the most worrisome contaminants, many of them persistent organic pollutants, including common heavy metals-metalloids and hydrocarbons but also instances of more unfamiliar drug residues and antibiotic resistant genes, at Australia’s 160,000 contaminated sites.Consideration is given to how anthropogenic elements and compounds in soil may bioaccumulate and bioconcentrate in animals, and how they can subsequently be consumed to the detriment of human health. Among the 75,000 identified contaminants in Australian soils are tributyltin, which has a half-life of at least 10 years and is one of the most toxic chemicals introduced into the environment by man, and uranium-contaminated mine tailings, which require constant and careful management for up to 75,000 years if their polluting effects are to be minimized. The author concludes that anthrosols and technosols provide evidence of the Anthropocene in Australia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aAnthrosols 3aTechnosols 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantibiotic resistance 3abioaccumulation 3adrug residues 3aexcreta 3agenes 3ahalf life 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ahydrocarbons 3amine tailings 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolluted soils 3asediments 3atoxic substances 3atributyltin 3aAustralia0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Aug., v. 228, no. 8 p.269-269dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3460-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245008000173520114200253592002801395650002001423650002501443650001501468650002101483650002001504650001201524650002801536650002201564651001801586653002001604653002101624653002001645653001201665700002001677700002101697700002201718773011001740856009001850852000901940655001201949IND60738537420221122231516.0210812e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073853742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1041482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatias, Nikos10aSustainable urban development indicators in Great Britain from 2001 to 2016  aCurrent planning strategies promoting suburbanisation, land use zoning and low built-up density areas tend to increase the environmental footprint of cities. In the last decades, international and local government plans are increasingly targeted at making urban areas more sustainable. Urban structure has been proved to be an important factor guiding urban smart growth policies that promote sustainable urban environments and improve neighbourhood social cohesion. This paper draws on a series of unique historical datasets obtained from Ordnance Survey, covering the largest British urban areas over the last 15 years (2001–2016) to develop a set of twelve indicators and a composite Sustainable Urban Development Index to quantitatively measure and assess key built environment features and their relative change compared to other areas at each point in time based on regular 1 km² grids. The results show that there is a relative increase in urban structure sustainability of areas in and around city centres and identify that the primary built environment feature driving these improvements was an increase in walkable spaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecological footprint 3alandscapes 3alocal government 3asocial cohesion 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aurban development 3aGreat Britain 0aUrban structure 0aSpatial analysis 0aComposite index 0aBritain1 aRowe, Francisco1 aCavazzi, Stefano1 aArribas-Bel, Dani0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2021 Oct., v. 214 p.104148-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1041483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009600158300001800254520019300272592002800465650002700493650001700520650000900537650000900546650001600555650001300571650001100584650001400595650001100609650001900620650001900639650002000658650002100678700002200699700001800721700002000739700002300759700001800782773013300800856007400933852000901007655001201016IND60659822820221123023019.0190823e20130404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065982282DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc41174e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIde, Yūsuke,10aTernary modified TiO₂ as a simple and efficient photocatalyst for green organic synthesis  ap. 3652-3654.  aTiO₂ ternary-modified with Fe³⁺, Ni²⁺, and Au nanoparticles exhibited a noticeable photocatalytic activity for selective cyclohexane oxidation with O₂ under sunlight irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3acyclohexanes 3agold 3airon 3airradiation 3ananogold 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide1 aKawamoto, Naoyuki1 aBando, Yoshio1 aHattori, Hideya1 aSadakane, Masahiro1 aSano, Tsuneji0 tChemical communications.g2013 Apr. 4, v. 49, no. 35 p.3652-3654dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc41174e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01633naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008300178300001600261520080100277592002801078650001201106650001101118650001501129773014401144856008201288852000901370655001201379IND60609832020221119124001.0180904e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060983202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10806-018-9742-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordeiro-Rodrigues, Luís,10aAnimal Abolitionism Revisited: Neo-Colonialism and Morally Unjustified Burdens  ap. 499-510.  aBob Fischer has written a reply to my article ‘Animal Abolitionism and ‘Racism without Racists’’.

Lactobacillus strains were isolated from a flock of healthy laying hens. The first selection criterion was the ability to inhibit the growth of Salmonella Enteritidis. Then the tolerance to low pH and bile salt, the ability to coaggregate with pathogenic bacteria and hydrogen peroxide production were evaluated. Four isolates showing the best antagonistic activity against Salmonella Enetritidis were selected for further research. All isolates tested tolerated low pH and bile salt, likewise all produced hydrogen peroxide. They efficiently coaggregated with C. perfringens and relatively less with E. coli. Isolate 03’04 displayed above-average results in all criteria, thus it is considered as a potential probiotic for chickens, and will be further evaluated for health promoting effect in animals. The results presented in this study confirm the strain specific probiotic properties and prove the probiotic potential of isolate 03’04. Strong antagonistic properties against C. perfringens exhibited by certain Lactobacillus strains indicate the possibility to use them as a component of probiotic supplement in necrotic enteritis of poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3abacteria 3abile salts 3aflocks 3ahealth promotion 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alaying hens 3anecrotic enteritis 3apH 3aprobiotics 0aLactobacillus 0aprobiotic 0achickens 0acoaggregation 0aE. coli 0aC. perfringens 0aSalmonella Enteritidis1 aBinek, M.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 19, no. 1 p.15-20dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:J000000145x2300-25577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjvs-2016-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012400158300002000282500001900302520136400321592002801685650000801713650002301721650001301744650001701757650001001774650001101784650001501795650001901810650001701829650001301846650001401859650001201873650001601885650002301901700002201924700002001946773012501966856007402091852000902165655001202174IND60715518720221122204838.0201028e20201019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071551872DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra04060f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Zhongkan10aFabrication and characterization of silicon oxycarbide fibre-mats via electrospinning for high temperature applications  ap. 38446-38455.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aElectrospinning is an emerging technique for synthesizing micron to submicron-sized polymer fibre supports for applications in energy storage, catalysis, filtration, drug delivery and so on. However, fabrication of electrospun ceramic fibre mats for use as a reinforcement phase in ceramic matrix composites or CMCs for aerospace applications remains largely unexplored. This is mainly due to stringent operating requirements that require a combination of properties such as low mass density, high strength, and ultrahigh temperature resistance. Herein we report fabrication of molecular precursor-derived silicon oxycarbide or SiOC fibre mats via electrospinning and pyrolysis of cyclic polysiloxanes-based precursors at significantly lower weight loadings of organic co-spin agent. Ceramic fibre mats, which were free of wrapping, were prepared by a one-step spinning (in air) and post heat-treatment for crosslinking and pyrolysis (in argon at 800 °C). The pyrolyzed fibre mats were revealed to be amorphous and a few microns in diameter. Four siloxane-based pre-ceramic polymers were used to study the influence of precursor molecular structure on the compositional and morphological differences of cross-linked and pyrolyzed products. Further thermal characterization suggested the potential of electrospun ceramic mats in high temperature applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acatalytic activity 3aceramics 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3aenergy 3afiltration 3aheat treatment 3amass density 3apolymers 3apyrolysis 3asilicon 3atemperature 3athermal properties1 aGervais, Christel1 aGurpreet Singh,0 tRSC advances.g2020 Oct. 19, v. 10, no. 63 p.38446-38455dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra04060f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02016naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245011400172300001600286500002000302520069500322592002801017650002301045650001101068650002001079650001901099650001201118650001101130650001201141650001901153650001701172650001401189650001501203650001301218650001001231650001501241650003601256651001101292651001001303651001801313700001401331773011401345856009001459852000901549655001201558IND60677588520221120071928.0191130e199412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067758852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2338.1994.tb01102.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aROSSLER, Y.14aThe Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, a major pest of citrus in Israel, its regulation and control  ap. 813-816.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn order to export citrus and subtropical fruits, Israel has to regulate and control Ceratitis capitata, to ensure that harvested fruits are free from the pest.

Antibacterial, antibiofilm and cytotoxic effects of these peptides were evaluated and compared with their C-terminally amidated forms. Both the amidated peptides (B1-NH₂ and B2-NH₂) showed significantly enhanced broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the latter was found to have potent biofilm inhibition properties against Klebsiella pneumoniae over other peptides. Both forms of B2 were less cytotoxic against human red blood cells (hRBC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). Hence, B2 and its amidated analog have good therapeutic value and these peptides could be considered as potential lead molecules for further development.  aPublisher supplied data  a717/2014/KSCSTEcKerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abiofilm 3acytotoxicity 3aerythrocytes 3afrogs 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3amononuclear leukocytes 3asecretion 3asequence analysis 3atherapeutics 3aIndia1 aVineethkumar, T.

The efficacy of postharvest fungicide treatments declines as the time between harvest and fungicide treatment increases. Foliar sprays of calcium chloride applied to âBoscâ pear trees beginning in mid-July and repeated every two weeks for a total of three applications slowed the increase in decay incidence observed when thiabendazole or fludioxonil treatments were delayed up to eight weeks after harvest. Increased decay incidence due to delayed postharvest fungicide application was also reduced by application of either pyraclostrobin+boscalid, thiophanate-methyl, or trifloxystrobin one week before harvest. Calcium chloride treatments followed by either of the pre-harvest fungicides provided the greatest decay suppression when postharvest fungicide treatments were delayed. Decay control by fludioxonil treatment was superior to that provided by thiabendazole when the fungicides were applied to fruit promptly after harvest, but differences between these two fungicides decreased as the delay in application approached eight weeks after harvest. A program of orchard calcium chloride followed by pre-harvest fungicide treatments can reduce overall decay incidence and mitigate the consequences of delays in postharvest fungicide treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acold storage 3afludioxonil 3afoliar spraying 3afruits 3aharvest date 3aorchards 3apears 3apesticide application 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest treatment 3astorage time 3athiophanate-methyl1 aBasile, Sally R.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2011 Apr., v. 60, no. 1 p.52-56dElsevier B.V.x0925-52147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2010.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245012500213300001600338506007600354520156600430592002801996596003802024506003702062650001402099650002902113650002602142650001502168650001202183650001202195650001402207650001002221650002002231650001702251650001402268700001802282700002202300773012702322856008202449852000902531655001202540IND60677588720221207085440.0191130e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067758872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00049-019-00288-y2doi7 aPMC68844332pmcid7 a318396932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaspotnig, Günther14aThe scent gland chemistry of neogoveid cyphophthalmids (Opiliones): an unusual methyljuglone from Metasiro savannahensis  ap. 189-197.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile the chemistries of scent gland secretions from a few selected species of three families of Cyphophthalmi, namely Sironidae, Pettalidae, and Stylocellidae, have already been reported and found to consist of complex blends of naphthoquinones and methyl ketones, nothing is known about the other families. We here report on the secretions of Metasiro savannahensis Clouse and Wheeler (Zootaxa 3814:177–201, 2014), a first representative of the family Neogoveidae. The secretions from males, females and one juvenile were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Twenty-five compounds were identified, all of which belong to the chemical classes of naphthoquinones and methyl ketones, confirming a hypothesized chemical uniformity of cyphophthalmid exudates. One major naphthoquinone compound, however, was new for cyphophthalmids and for arthropod exocrine secretions in general: a methyljuglone isomer, 6-methyljuglone (= 6-MJ; iupac name: 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), amounted for about 20% of the secretion and was eventually identified by synthesis. Hydroxy-naphthoquinones and their derivatives are known to possess a variety of antibiotic effects, probably enhancing the antimicrobial/antifungal potential of the Metasiro-secretion. Currently, without further data on neogoveids, the compound represents a chemical autapomorphy of M. savannahensis, and—just as the strange chloro-naphthoquinones of Sironidae and Pettalidae—adds to the repertoire of unusual naphthoquinone compounds across the Cyphophthalmi.  aPublisher supplied data  aP29699-B25cAustrian Science Fund0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSironidae 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3aarthropods 3afemales 3aisomers 3ajuveniles 3amales 3anaphthoquinones 3ascent glands 3asecretion1 aAnderl, Felix1 aClouse, Ronald M.0 tChemoecology.g2019 Dec., v. 29, no. 5-6 p.189-197dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870039x0937-74097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-019-00288-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011100159300001400270520132900284592002801613650002401641650003001665650002101695650002101716650001301737650001401750650001601764650003801780650001001818650002101828650003901849650002601888650001201914650002501926650001901951650001401970653001901984653001102003653002402014653002102038700001502059700001402074700001402088700001702102700001702119700001302136700001602149773013302165856007802298852000902376655001202385IND60520603320221123004028.0160522e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052060332DNAL7 a10.1515/pjvs-2016-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xulong10aProkaryotic expression, purification and antigenicity analysis of African swine fever virus pK205R protein  ap. 41-48.  aAfrican swine fever is an acute, febrile and highly virulent porcine disease causing serious economic losses worldwide. The pK205R protein of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) is largely expressed in the early stages of infection, which has given the K205R gene extensive attention. In this study, the ASFV K205R was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Expression of histidine-tagged pK205R with a molecular mass of 44 kDa was determined by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis. Optimisation of culture conditions allowed induction of the recombinant protein with 0.4 mM Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 37°C for 2 h. The protein existed in cellular supernatant and was purified using a Ni-NTA resin column. The purified protein was used to immunize rabbits four times to enable the production of polyclonal antibodies, and the antiserum titre was detected by ELISA. The results showed that the purified pK205R can react with ASFV positive serum specifically by Western blotting. The pK205R had high antigenicity, which indicated that pK205R could be used as an antigen for detection of ASFV-specific antibodies in ELISA testing, and the recombinant protein could contribute to further research of the action and structure of pK205R.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican swine fever 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3aEscherichia coli 3aWestern blotting 3aantigens 3aantiserum 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolyclonal antibodies 3arabbits 3arecombinant proteins 3aviral proteins 3avirulence 0aindirect ELISA 0apK205R 0apolyclonal antibody 0aWestern blotting1 aXiao, Lü,1 aPeng, Bin1 aWang, Yin1 aYang, Zexiao1 aYao, Xueping1 aHu, Ling1 aLin, Xingyu0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 19, no. 1 p.41-48dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:J000000145x2300-25577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjvs-2016-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04168naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100002300175245017000198300001800368500002400386520239100410650002302801650003002824650002302854650002702877650002702904650001202931650001802943650001402961650001902975650002202994650001403016650002403030650002303054650001203077650002903089650002303118650003103141650003803172650000903210650001403219651001003233653002103243700002103264700002603285773012403311852000903435856008703444930003303531945002503564946001303589655001203602IND4392998420221120033913.0070713e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439299842DNAL7 a171956602pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-99.6.19552doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aQuesada-Moraga, E.10aLaboratory Evaluation of Entomopathogenic Fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae Against Puparia and Adults of Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 1955-1966.  aIncludes references  aLaboratory experiments were done to measure the pathogenicity of 10 autochthonous isolates of Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuill. and of five Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorok. toward puparia and adults of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Although all isolates applied via inoculation of the fungal suspensions on the ventral surface of the abdomen were pathogenic to adults, with mortality rates ranging from 30 to 100% and average survival times (ASTs) from 6.5 to 8.6 d, when C. capitata puparia were immersed in the conidial suspensions, only B. bassiana Bb-1333 and EABb 01/103-Su and M. anisopliae EAMa 01/58-Su isolates caused >50% mortality of puparia. In a second series of bioassays conducted on five selected isolates, adults were sprayed with four 10-fold concentrations ranging from 1.0 x 10(5) to 1.0 x 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the four most virulent isolates ranged from 4.9 x 10(5) to 2.0 x 10(6) cfu/ml with estimated time to kill 50% of the insects ranging from 4.6 to 5.3 d. The effect of a sublethal dose (ca. LD50) of either B. bassiana EABb 01/103-Su or M. anisopliae EAMa 01/58-Su isolate was studied by reciprocal crossing. Treatment with B. bassiana reduced fecundity and fertility at 6, 8, and 10 d after treatment, with fecundity and fertility reductions ranging from 20.0 to 71.2% and from 33.6 to 60.0%, respectively. These reductions occurred in pairing combinations of treated females with either treated or nontreated males. M. anisopliae was more effective in reducing fecundity and fertility at 6 d after treatment, with the reduction varying from 58.4 to 72.1% and from 28.6 to 45.9%, respectively. In addition, the first oviposition was significantly delayed for 1 d in females treated by either fungal species. The above-mentioned five selected isolates were assayed against C. capitata puparia treated as late third instars in sterilized soil at 25°C under three moisture conditions (-0.1, -0.01, and -0.0055 MPa). At -0.01 MPa, all isolates were low pathogenic to C. capitata puparia, whereas significant differences in the puparia mortality occurred between isolates at -0.1 and -0.0055 MPa. The highest pupal mortalities ranged from 52.5 to 70.0%, as a function of soil moisture and were caused by EAMa 01/58-Su and Bb-1333 isolates. 3aCeratitis capitata 3abiological control agents 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3astrains 3apathogenicity 3amortality 3alethal dose 50 3asublethal effects 3afecundity 3ainsect reproduction 3asoil water content 2aAnimals 2aBeauveriaxpathogenicity 2aCeratitis capitata 2aMetarhiziumxpathogenicity 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aPupa 2aVirulence 0aSpain 0ainsect fertility1 aRuiz-García, A.1 aSantiago-Álvarez, C.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2006 Dec., v. 99, no. 6 p.1955-1966dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-99.6.19553Available from publisher's Web site  a20070717b20070802c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/07/17  aOther US 7aarticle02349naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007400167300001800241500001500259520114700274592002801421650001701449650002401466650000701490650001701497650001801514650001601532650002001548653002101568653002601589653001201615653001401627653001901641700001601660700001301676700001701689700001601706773011001722856008601832852000901918655001201927IND60530312020221121205052.0180904e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053031202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Qingzhi10aImmobilized multienzymatic systems for catalysis of cascade reactions  ap. 1193-1203.  a2019-12-06  aCascade reactions catalyzed by immobilized multienzymatic systems are an emerging technology, making catalytic strategies more sophisticated and effective. Thus, immobilized multienzymatic systems that exploit the chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity of biocatalysts have been developed. Recently, a variety of bioinspired immobilized multienzymatic systems was fabricated. In this review, immobilized multienzymatic systems were divided into three types: stepwise immobilized enzymes, mixed immobilized enzymes, or co-immobilized enzymes. General considerations such as coupling pH, coupling temperature, proportion of each enzyme, and cascade bottleneck analysis for the enzymatic cascade reaction were presented. For greater insight, we analyzed the effects of substrate channeling, mass transport limitation, synergistic mechanisms, and promotion of cofactor regeneration on immobilized multienzymatic systems. Some recent novel examples of immobilized multienzymatic systems were summarized. The aim of this review is to promote and broaden the application of immobilized multienzymatic systems in biocatalysis and other related fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3aimmobilized enzymes 3apH 3abiocatalysis 3amass transfer 3atemperature 3astereochemistry 0aCascade reaction 0aMultienzymatic system 0aenzymes 0aCatalysis 0aImmobilization1 aWang, Bochu1 aTan, Jun1 aZhu, Liancai1 aLi, Liuying0 tProcess biochemistry.g2016 Sept., v. 51, no. 9 p.1193-1203dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017300168300001800341520097500359592002801334650001201362650001401374650001301388650001301401650001901414650001301433650001601446653002601462653001701488653001401505653001201519653003401531700001601565700001801581700001901599700005401618700001701672773014301689856008501832852000901917655001201926IND60598914020221119031600.0180702e20180328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059891402DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b003292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Chuanwei10aSustainable Multiple- and Multistimulus-Shape-Memory and Self-Healing Elastomers with Semi-interpenetrating Network Derived from Biomass via Bulk Radical Polymerization  ap. 6527-6535.  aSustainable shape-memory and self-healing elastomers with semi-interpenetrating network were prepared by a simple, efficient, and green bulk radical polymerization of ethyl cellulose, furfural, and fatty-acid-derived monomers. This approach could in situ one-pot form a semi-interpenetrating network elastomer with properties combining multiple-shape-memory and self-healing under solvent-free conditions. These elastomers were found to possess excellent multiple-shape-memory properties toward temperature, water, THF, and methanol. Moreover, the multiple-shape-memory properties could assist the self-healing of these elastomers, which was triggered by heating. Self-healing behavior studies showed that the presence of linear polymers in these elastomers could significantly improve the self-healing performance. This work provides a facile, efficient, and green approach in a solvent-free system to design new-generation sustainable, green, and functional materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acellulose 3afurfural 3amethanol 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atemperature 0aShape-memory polymers 0aSelf-healing 0aElastomer 0aBiomass 0aSemi-interpenetrating network1 aLiu, Yupeng1 aLiu, Xiaohuan1 aWang, Chunpeng1 aWang, Jifu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5081-92821 aChu, Fuxiang0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Mar. 28, v. 6, no. 5 p.6527-6535dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b003293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01911naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010300157300001600260520086200276592002801138650002201166650002401188650001501212650002501227650001701252650001101269700001901280700001901299700001701318700002001335773013401355856007501489852000901564655001201573IND60776614120221119061028.0220904e20090111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077661412DNAL7 a10.17221/1361-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSynytsya, A.10aMushrooms of genus <i>Pleurotus</i> as a source of dietary fibres and glucans for food supplements  ap. 441-446.  aFruit bodies (separately pilei and stems) of mushrooms <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i> (four strains) and <i>Pleurotus eryngii</i> were characterised as a source of polysaccharides. The contents of glucans and dietary fibres were determined with using the respective Megazyme enzymatic kits. Enzymatic analysis of the fruit bodies confirmed significant differences in the contents of these components among the species and strains. The stems contained more insoluble dietary fibres than the pilei in all the cases and more β-glucans in most cases. However, relatively high contents of β-glucan (20–50% of dry matter) could be a result of incomplete enzymatic hydrolysis of insoluble α-1,3-glucans. Nevertheless, low food quality stems of mushrooms <i>Pleurotus</i> sp. could be a valuable source of cell wall glucans for the preparation of food supplements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus eryngii 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3acell walls 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afood quality 3afruits1 aMíčková, K.1 aJablonský, I.1 aSluková, M.1 aČopíková, J.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 26, no. 6 p.441-446dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/1361-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014400165300001300309520169200322592002802014650001402042650001402056650001302070650002902083650001902112653002302131653001902154653001202173653001002185700002202195700001802217700005702235700002202292700002002314773013602334856008302470852000902553655001202562IND60733288320221121203907.0210428e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073328832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.1512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirota, Yuko10aLAPTM4α is targeted from the Golgi to late endosomes/lysosomes in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1 and ESCRT proteins  ap. 9-15.  aLysosome-associated protein transmembrane 4α (LAPTM4α) is a four transmembrane-spanning protein primarily localized in endosomes and lysosomes and has several putative lysosomal targeting signals at its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, including tyrosine-based motifs (YxxΦ) and PY motifs (L/PxxY). LAPTM4α has been previously shown to be ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1 through binding to its PY motifs and sorted to lysosomes, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the localization of LAPTM4α to endosomes/lysosomes have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we show that LAPTM4α binds Nedd4-1 in a manner dependent on PY motifs, while the PY motifs and Nedd4-1 are not necessarily required for LAPTM4α ubiquitination. The binding of LAPTM4α with Nedd4-1, however, is necessary for an effective sorting of LAPTM4α from the Golgi to late endosomes/lysosomes. An unexpected finding is that LAPTM4α is localized in the lumen, but not in the limiting membrane, of late endosomes, and degraded in lysosomes over time. Interestingly, we further found that siRNA knockdown of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) components that mediate sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) of endosomes selectively blocks the transport of LAPTM4α to endosomes. Collectively, these results suggest that trafficking of LAPTM4α from the Golgi to endosomes is promoted by the interaction with Nedd4-1, which further requires ESCRT components. Furthermore, our findings highlight a novel function for ESCRT proteins in mediating protein and/or vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to endosomes/lysosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendosomes 3alysosomes 3aresearch 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination 0aLysosomal membrane 0aUbiquitination 0aNedd4-1 0aESCRT1 aHayashi, Masaharu1 aMiyauchi, Yuu1 aIshii, Yūji,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2069-02191 aTanaka, Yoshitaka1 aFujimoto, Keiko0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 June 04, v. 556 p.9-15dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.1513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012900162300001400291520079900305592002801104650001901132650001501151650001601166650001701182650004401199650001501243650000901258650001201267650001201279653002201291653003301313653000801346653001901354700001201373700001401385700001401399700001401413700001901427700001701446700002101463700001401484700001901498773009101517856008001608852000901688655001201697IND60558339720221116231342.0161216e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055833972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2016.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ming10aEstablishment and optimization of NMR-based cell metabonomics study protocols for neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiomyocytes  ap. 50-52.  aA quenching, harvesting, and extraction protocol was optimized for cardiomyocytes NMR metabonomics analysis in this study.

Turkey meat fits well into it as it contains low calories and high protein as compared to chicken meat. When chicken and turkey meat products were introduced on a broader scale a few decades ago, traditional red meat recipes where simply modified and was replaced by poultry meat. Now a day, the turkey meat can be used as an alternative to broiler meat. Very limited research work have been carried out in our country on suitability of cereal flours and natural preservatives on the comminuted meat products. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to develop turkey meat loaf with the incorporation of different levels of cereal flours (oat and ragi)., Three trials were conducted for the standardization of the level of textured soya protein, egg, vegetable oil, table salt and ice flakes for turkey meat loaf. The standardized turkey meat loaf comprised of 3.5% textured soy protein and egg, 5% vegetable oil, 1.8% salt and 10% ice flakes. After product standardization the levels of oat and ragi cereal flours were standardized and the levels are selected on the basis of sensory evaluation and pysico-chemical characteristics. After sensory and physico chemical evaluation it may concluded that formulation containing 3% oat and 3% ragi flour was found to be the best for development of functional turkey meat loaf.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleusine coracana subsp. coracana 3achicken meat 3adietary fiber 3aeggs 3aflour 3aice 3aloaves 3aoats 3apeptides 3ared meat 3asensory evaluation 3asoy protein 3atable salt 3aturkey meat 3avegetable oil 0aTurkey meat loaf 0aStandardization 0aOat flour 0aRagi flour1 aBeura, Chandrakant1 aBiswas, Ashim Kumar1 aBiswas, Avishek0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2018 Apr., v. 53, no. 1 p.103-106dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2018.00021.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245012500156300001600281520084200297592002801139650001201167650002001179650001001199650001401209650000901223650001201232650001701244650000901261650001701270700001901287700001701306700001901323700001801342700001701360773014801377856007901525852000901604655001201613IND60765068320221119024748.0220419e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076506832DNAL7 a10.17221/36/2021-cjgpb2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wen10aCharacterization of a naturally occurring early-flowering rice mutant resulting from a novel variation in the Ghd7 locus  ap. 166-169.  aRice is one of the main staple food crops and is consumed by more than half of the global population. Optimizing the flowering time may help to maximize grain production. In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, Zixiangnuo early-flowering mutant (ZXN-E). Compared with the wild-type variety, Zixiangnuo (ZXN), the mutant plants flowered earlier, were shorter and produced smaller panicles. Bulked segregant analysis revealed a 7-bp deletion in the first exon of the Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) locus. The allele with the 7-bp deletion was not detected in the rice varieties included in the 3 000 Rice Genomes Project. Thus, the 7-bp deletion identified in the naturally occurring mutant ZXN-E is a novel variation. Our findings suggest that ZXN-E may be a useful germplasm for breeding new rice varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aearly flowering 3aexons 3agermplasm 3aloci 3amutants 3aplant height 3arice 3astaple foods1 aZheng, Chongke1 aZhou, Jinjun1 aZhang, Zhizhen1 aZhou, Guanhua1 aXie, Xianzhi0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g, v. 57, no. 4 p.166-169dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/36/2021-cjgpb3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011200169300001800281520093300299592002801232650003301260650002801293650001501321650001601336650001701352650002101369650001301390650001001403650001801413650001101431650001301442650002201455650002101477653000901498653002201507653002101529653002101550653001401571700007001585700002001655700001801675700001401693700001701707700002001724700002501744773014301769856008501912852000901997655001202006IND60598914220180816000000.0180702e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059891422DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b003312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosu, Liliana10aEnhancing the Thermal and Fungal Resistance of Wood Treated with Natural and Synthetic Derived Epoxy Resins  ap. 5470-5478.  aThe paper describes new epoxy derivatives and their influences on wood thermal and fungi stability.

The samples impregnated with glycidyl methacrylate were first exposed to UV at 254 nm for 30 min on all surfaces and thermally cross-linked for 5 h at 130 °C and 30 min at 150 °C. The samples were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and decay resistance to fungi. The untreated samples exhibited the most significant mass losses. Evolved gas analysis was undertaken.

The morphology and chemical properties of the fabricated RGO–PEO hybrid materials were characterized by SEM, and Raman and FTIR spectroscopies, respectively. Sensitive properties of real-time response, sensitivity, repeatability and selectivity to toluene vapor were studied as well at room temperature. The experimental data show that the gas sensors based on composite film have a higher sensitivity than the ones based on bilayer film and pure RGO film at toluene concentrations from 80 ppm to 140 ppm. In addition, the effect of PEO volume fraction and humidity on the sensing performance was also studied. The sensor with a PEO volume fraction of 50% has a better sensitivity and faster response/recovery than others. With respect to selectivity, the gas response of the prepared sensors to toluene was at least 2-fold higher than those to other vapor species, including acetone, ethanol, hydrogen, water and formaldehyde. Furthermore, the sensing mechanism of the fabricated sensors was investigated by comparing the device performance in the presence of dry air or nitrogen as carrier gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aacetone 3aambient temperature 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3aethanol 3aformaldehyde 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahumidity 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen 3aphysicochemical properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atoluene 3avapors1 aXie, Guangzhong1 aChen, Jun1 aDu, Hongfei1 aZhang, Hulin1 aYuan, Zhen1 aYe, Zongbiao1 aDu, Xiaosong1 aTai, Huiling1 aJiang, Yadong0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 13, v. 6, no. 100 p.97840-97847dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21077e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245005600172300001800228520099200246592002801238650002101266650002101287650001401308650001101322650001101333650002101344650001501365650002201380650002401402653002401426653002201450653003301472653002501505653002001530653002301550653003401573700002201607700002601629700006201655773014201717856008501859852000901944655001201953IND60598914320221119032909.0180702e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059891432DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b003352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBawareth, Bander10aUnravelling Electrochemical Lignin Depolymerization  ap. 7565-7573.  aLignin valorisation via electrochemical depolymerization is a promising approach for commercial application due to its moderate reaction conditions. However, there is no available kinetics model for this reaction. Conventional reaction kinetics equations are inadequate when used for lignin degradation because of the limited kinetics information with respect the reaction mechanism. We suggest to use population balance equations to predict the evolution of molecular weight distribution of lignin with time. Solving the low molecular weight (MW) population balance equations is carried out discretely whereas a continuous solution was implemented for the high MW. Additionally, the model accounts for a recombination reaction for the depolymerized species. The model is capable of predicting the molecular weight distribution of lignin as a function of electrochemical processing time. New experimental results are used to extract kinetics constants for different kraft lignin samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3adepolymerization 3aelectrochemistry 3aequations 3alignin 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aprediction 3areaction kinetics 3areaction mechanisms 0apolymer degradation 0akinetics modeling 0apopulation balance equations 0afixed pivot solution 0arandom scission 0achain-end scission 0amolecular weight distribution1 aDi Marino, Davide1 aNijhuis, T.

They are present in small quantities in plants, microorganisms, and animals. The biosynthesis of FuFAs in plants and microorganisms is not fully described and their presence in animals is thought to be exclusively due to food with a high concentration in seafood products, which are themselves consumed by humans. The presence of the furan cycle makes FuFAs highly reactive with reactive oxygen derivatives. The three major biological effects of FuFAs are antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory. More specific studies on health effects have been conducted in recent years: FuFAs and their catabolic degradation products (e.g. CMPF) may influence lipid metabolism, insulin resistance and diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. FuFAs could thus be biomarkers of exposure to a healthy, seafood-rich diet, and also bioactive compounds in our diet capable of modulating signalling pathways with potential beneficial effects against metabolic disorders associated with a Western-style diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern diets 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3adiabetes 3afurans 3ainsulin resistance 3alipid metabolism 3aoxygen 3aseafoods 0aAcides gras furaniques 0aMétabolisme 0aEffets santé 0aAlimentation 0aBiomarqueurs 0aFuran fatty acid 0aMetabolism 0aHealth effects 0aDiet1 aDurand, Erwann1 aVaysse, Laurent1 aLiengprayoon, Siriluck1 aGaillet, Sylvie1 aCoudray, Charles1 aCasas, François1 aFeillet-Coudray, Christine0 tCahiers de nutrition et de diététique.g2021 Apr., v. 56, no. 2 p.117-125dElsevier Masson SASaSociété française de nutritionwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnd.2021.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245019300169300001400362520192500376592002802301650001602329650003002345650001002375650001102385650001702396650003002413650001502443650002602458650001202484650001402496650003402510650001402544650001302558650001102571653001402582653000802596653001502604653001502619700001802634700003202652773009702684856008202781852000902863655001202872IND60543914220221118071934.0190415e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054391422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2013.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Pedro Reis10aEstimating the contribution of N-sulfocarbamoyl paralytic shellfish toxin analogs GTX6 and C3+4 to the toxicity of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) over a bloom of Gymnodinium catenatum  ap. 35-40.  aGymnodinium catenatum, a dinoflagellate species with a global distribution, is known to produce paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins. The profile of toxins of G. catenatum is commonly dominated by sulfocarbamoyl analogs including the C3+4 and GTX6, which to date has no commercial certified reference materials necessary for their quantification via chemical methods, such as liquid chromatography. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of C3+4 and GTX6 and their contribution to shellfish toxicity. C3+4 and GTX6 were indirectly quantified via pre-column oxidation liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection after hydrolysis conversion into their carbamate analogs. Analyses were carried out in mussel samples collected over a bloom of G. catenatum (>63×103cellsl−1) in Aveiro lagoon, NW Portuguese coast. Concentration levels of sulfocarbamoyl toxin analogs were two orders of magnitude higher than decarbamoyl toxins, which were in turn one order of magnitude higher than carbamoyl toxins. Among the sulfocarbamoyl toxins, C1+2 were clearly the dominant compounds, followed by C3+4 and GTX6. The least abundant sulfocarbamoyl toxin was GTX5. The most important compounds in terms of contribution for sample toxicity were C1+2, which justified 26% of the PSP toxicity. The lesser abundant dcSTX constitutes the second most important compound with similar % of toxicity to C1+2, C3+4 and GTX6 were responsible for approximately 11% and 13%, respectively. The median of the sum of C3+4 and GTX6 was 27%. These levels reached a maximum of 60% as was determined for the sample collected closest to the G. catenatum bloom. This study highlights the importance of these low potency PSP toxin analogs to shellfish toxicity. Hydrolysis conversion of C3+4 and GTX6 is recommended for determination of PSP toxicity when LC detection methods are used for PSP testing in samples exposed to G. catenatum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGymnodinium 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aalgae 3acoasts 3afluorescence 3ageographical distribution 3ahydrolysis 3aliquid chromatography 3amussels 3aoxidation 3aparalytic shellfish poisoning 3ashellfish 3atoxicity 3atoxins 0aSaxitoxin 0aPSP 0aHydrolysis 0aHPLC–FLD1 aMoita, Teresa1 aRodrigues, Susana Margarida0 tHarmful algae.g2014 Jan., v. 31 p.35-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2013.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100001600200245010800216300001600324520046400340592002800804650002000832650002600852650001200878650002400890650003500914650001100949650002100960650000900981650002700990650004401017650000901061650003001070700001501100700002501115773011601140852000901256856008301265655001201348IND8209569120221116233252.0181203e19820701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND820956912DNAL7 a71095312pmid7 a10.1258/0023677827808917052doi4 a0023-6772(19820701)16:3L.271;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, Otto14aThe Influence of minerals and protein on the nephrocalcinosis potential for rats of semisynthetic diets  ap. 271-273.  aNephrocalcinosis is a common finding in rats, particularly in females fed a semisynthetic diet. In the present study groups of rats were fed a semisynthetic diet with varying levels of minerals and with lactalbumin instead of casein as the protein source. Adjustment in the Ca, P, and Mg content of the diet caused a marked decrease in renal calcification. The change of protein source alone led to a complete disappearance of calcium deposits in the kidneys.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Laboratory 2aDietary Proteinsxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aFood, Formulated 2aMale 2aMineralsxpharmacology 2aNephrocalcinosisxetiologyxveterinary. 2aRats 2aRodent Diseasesxetiology1 aBlom, Lars1 aSøndergaard, Dorrit0 tLaboratory animals.g1982 July 01, v. 16, no. 3 p.271-273dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/0023677827808917053Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03106naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245013100167300001600298520182800314592002802142650001202170650001902182650002102201650000902222650001902231650002402250650001302274650001102287650001902298650001402317650001902331650002302350650001002373700002502383700001902408700002102427700002202448773012702470856007802597852000902675655001202684IND60776614520221119061034.0220714e20220619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077661452DNAL7 a10.17221/148/2021-swr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽivanović, Nikola10aConstruction and calibration of a portable rain simulator designed for the in situ research of soil resistance to erosion  ap. 158-169.  aLand degradation caused by erosion processes is a widespread global problem. Rain simulators are one of the tools often used to determine the resistance of soils to erosion processes. The aim of this publication is to present the process of the construction and calibration of a small, portable field simulator which would be implemented in research studies designed to determine the changes in the soils’ shear strength parameters in forested areas (in situ) caused by a change in soil moisture content achieved by the rain simulation. The constructed simulator consists of a metal frame, sprayers (with specific nozzles), a sediment funnel/tray made of metal, water and a sediment collector unit, a water tank and pump, and a set of rubber hoses, manometer, valves, reducers, adapters and other supplementary equipment. The calibration was carried out by using the pluviometric method. The choice of nozzles was based on the criteria of low water consumption (losses), the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CU) and the possibility of achieving specific downpour intensities for the investigated area. The further calibration of the device consisted of determining the raindrop diameter and the distribution of the rainfall when the simulator is positioned on the slopes (7° and 15°). The achieved rain intensity was 1.7–1.9 mm/min, with a CU of 92.23–93.70% for the raindrop diameters (D<sub>50</sub>) equal to 1.2 mm. The kinetic energy of the simulated rain (Ke) was 2.82∙10<sup>–6</sup> J. The constructed simulator proved itself to be in accordance with all of the given criteria, and it can successfully be implemented in research studies aimed at determining the resistance of forest soils to erosion processes, infiltration, and sediment yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforests 3akinetic energy 3aland degradation 3arain 3arain intensity 3arainfall simulation 3aresearch 3arubber 3asediment yield 3asediments 3ashear strength 3asoil water content 3awater1 aRončević, Vukašin1 aSpasić, Marko1 aĆorluka, Stevan1 aPolovina, Siniša0 tSoil and Water Research.g, v. 17, no. 3 p.158-169dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21421x1801-53957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/148/2021-swr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03915naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100005800193245007400251506007600325506003100401520173600432592002802168596006602196506003702262650002002299650001202319650002102331650001902352650002702371650001902398650000902417650001602426650002502442650001602467650001302483650002802496650000902524650001902533650001302552650002202565650002102587650001602608650001102624650001102635650001302646650002202659650001202681650002202693650001602715650001802731650001702749650002202766651001302788653003302801653002902834653001602863653002102879700006102900700001702961773013202978856008603110961001203196852000903208655001203217IND60679658320221207124832.0200210e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067965832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100232chorus7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdi, M.

This study updates the i-Tree Cool River model to simulate restoration of these processes to reverse the urban river syndrome, while using the HEC-RAS model water surface profiles needed for flood hazard analysis in restoration planning. The new model was tested in a mountain river within the New York City drinking water supply area (Sawmill, SM, Creek), and then used for base case and restoration scenarios on the 17.5 km reach of the Los Angeles (LA) River where a multi-million dollar riverine restoration project is planned. The model simulated the LA River average temperature in the base case decreased from 29.5 °C by 0.3 °C when warm surface inflows were converted to cooler groundwater inflows by terrestrial green infrastructure; by 0.7 °C when subsurface hyporheic exchange was increased by removal of armoring and installation of riffle-pool bedforms; by 3.6 °C when riparian forests shaded the river; and by 6.4 °C when floodplain forests were added to riparian forests to cool surface reservoirs and local air temperatures. Applying all four restoration treatments lowered river temperature by 7.2 °C. The simulated decreases in river temperature lead to increased saturated dissolved oxygen levels, reaching 8.7 mg/L, up from the 7.6 mg/L in the base case scenario, providing improved fish habitat and reducing eutrophication and hypoxic zones. This study evaluating the performance of environmental management scenarios could help managers control the thermal pollution in rivers.  aPublisher supplied data  cNorthern Research Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000145110 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair temperature 3acooling 3adissolved oxygen 3adrinking water 3aecological restoration 3aeutrophication 3afish 3afloodplains 3agreen infrastructure 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3ahazard characterization 3aheat 3ahyporheic zone 3aplanning 3apollution control 3ariparian forests 3ariver water 3arivers 3arunoff 3asawmills 3asimulation models 3astreams 3athermal pollution 3aurban areas 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awater temperature 3aNew York 0aLos angeles river (LA river) 0aSawmill creek (SM creek) 0aUrban river 0aRiparian shading1 aEndreny, Theodore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1891-261X1 aNowak, David0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 258 p.110023-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100233Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169520158300272592002801855650001601883650001801899650002001917650001701937650001401954650001201968650001501980650002101995650002002016650001302036650001602049650001302065653003002078653001402108653002502122653002902147653002202176700001602198773010602214856008502320852000902405655001202414IND60733288820221120223213.0210729e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073328882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2021.1082952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasu, Nabamita10aRecent chemical syntheses of bacteria related oligosaccharides using modern expeditious approaches  aApart from some essential and crucial roles in life processes carbohydrates also are involved in a few detrimental courses of action related to human health, like infections by pathogenic microbes, cancer metastasis, transplanted tissue rejection, etc. Regarding management of pathogenesis by microbes, keeping in mind of multi drug-resistant bacteria and epidemic or endemic incidents, preventive measure by vaccination is the best pathway as also recommended by the WHO; by vaccination, eradication of bacterial diseases is also possible. Although some valid vaccines based on attenuated bacterial cells or isolated pure polysaccharide-antigens or the corresponding conjugates thereof are available in the market for prevention of several bacterial diseases, but these are not devoid of some disadvantages also. In order to develop improved conjugate T-cell dependent vaccines oligosaccharides related to bacterial antigens are synthesized and converted to the corresponding carrier protein conjugates. Marketed Cuban Quimi-Hib is such a vaccine being used since 2004 to resist Haemophilus influenza b infections. During nearly the past two decades research is going on worldwide for improved synthesis of bacteria related oligosaccharides or polysaccharides towards development of such semisynthetic or synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines. The present dissertation is an endeavour to encompass the recent syntheses of several pathogenic bacterial oligosaccharides or polysaccharides, made during the past ten-eleven years with special reference to modern expeditious syntheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus 3aT-lymphocytes 3adrug resistance 3ahuman health 3ainfluenza 3amarkets 3ametastasis 3aoligosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3aresearch 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aBacterial oligosaccharide 0aSynthesis 0aMulti-drug resistant 0aConvergent glycosylation 0aOne-pot synthesis1 aGhosh, Rina0 tCarbohydrate research.g2021 Sept., v. 507 p.108295-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2021.1082953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04234naa a2201513 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007000172300001400242520105000256592002801306650001601334650001001350650003001360650001001390650002001400650001201420653001501432653001901447653002201466653003001488653003701518653003101555653004301586653002501629653002601654653001701680653000901697653001101706653000901717653001101726653000901737653000801746653000701754653000801761653000801769653000801777653000801785653000801793653000801801653001201809653000701821653000801828653000801836653000701844653000901851653000801860653000701868653000801875653000801883653000801891653000801899653000801907653000701915653001301922653000901935653001001944653000901954653000701963653000801970653000701978653000901985653000901994653000902003653000902012653000802021653000802029653000802037653000802045653000802053653001402061653000902075653001302084653000802097653000802105653000702113653000802120653000802128653000802136653000802144653000902152653000902161653000802170653000802178653000802186653000902194653001002203653000802213653001002221653000902231653001002240653000802250653000702258653000702265653000702272653000802279653000802287653000802295653001002303653000902313653000802322653000802330653000602338653000802344653000802352653000802360653000902368653000702377653000802384653000802392653000802400653000802408653000802416653000802424653000802432653000802440653000802448700002002456700001502476700001702491773010902508856008202617852000902699655001202708IND60602650020221119215126.0180711e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060265002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2014.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-López, E.10aRecent contributions of capillary electrophoresis to neuroscience  ap. 82-99.  aContributions to neuroscience are necessary to understand the behavior of the brain. Powerful analytical techniques are needed to monitor neuroactive molecules and their concentrations in biological samples (fluids, cells, and brain tissues). Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is well known for its high resolution power, short analysis times, and low consumption of reagents and samples. It presents analytical advantages for the determination of neuroactive molecules not easily determined by other analytical techniques. CE also offers the possibility of controlling more than one neuroactive molecule at a time, making it interesting to detect changes as a result of a stimulus. CE is well established to accomplish enantioseparations, contributing a better understanding of the properties of a neuroactive chiral molecule. This review focuses on the most relevant articles published from January 2008 to July 2014, based on the determination in biological samples of potentially interesting molecules in neuroscience using CE and microchip-CE.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fluids 3abrain 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acells 3aneurophysiology 3atissues 0aAmino acid 0aBiogenic amine 0aBiological sample 0aCapillary electrophoresis 0aChiral capillary electrophoresis 0aLaser-induced fluorescence 0aMicellar electrokinetic chromatography 0aNeuroactive compound 0aNeurological disorder 0aNeuroscience 0a3-MT 0a5-HIAA 0a5-HT 0aµ-TAS 0aABEI 0aACh 0aAD 0aAla 0aArg 0aAsn 0aAsp 0aBGE 0aBPA 0aBr-BQCA 0aCD 0aCEC 0aC4D 0aCE 0aCFSE 0aCit 0aCL 0aCNS 0aCSF 0aCSP 0aCys 0aCZE 0aDA 0aDM-β-CD 0aDOPA 0aDOPAC 0aDTAF 0aEC 0aEKC 0aEP 0aFASS 0aFITC 0aFSCV 0aGABA 0aGln 0aGlu 0aGly 0aHim 0aHis 0aHPA-β-CD 0aHPLC 0aHP-β-CD 0aHVA 0aIle 0aIT 0aIXS 0aLED 0aLeu 0aLIF 0aLINF 0aLVSS 0aLys 0aMCE 0aMet 0aMEKC 0aMEEKC 0aMIP 0aMISPE 0aMMIP 0aNBD-F 0aNDA 0aNE 0aNM 0aOP 0aOPA 0aOrn 0aPBS 0aPDDAC 0aPDMS 0aPhe 0aPro 0aQ 0aSDS 0aSer 0aSPE 0aSPME 0aTA 0aTau 0aTCA 0aThr 0aTOF 0aTrp 0aTym 0aTyr 0aVal 0aVMA1 aMontealegre, C.1 aCrego, Al,1 aMarina, M.L.0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2015 Apr., v. 67 p.82-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2014.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013800173300001600311500001900327520140400346592002801750650001201778650001301790650002201803650002201825650000901847650001401856650000901870650001901879650001301898650001101911650001601922650001301938653002101951653001801972653002001990653002202010700001702032773014102049856008602190852000902276655001202285IND60721214720221117191111.0201224e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072121472DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00060.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivas, Gurram10aCauses of rural poultry losses and level of awareness of Ranikhet disease among rural farmers in Jagitial district of Telangana state  ap. 128-130.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was conducted to determine the major causes of rural poultry losses and to evaluate the level of awareness on the consequences of Ranikhet disease (RD) among rural poultry farmers in Jagitial district of Telangana State. Structured questionnaire was used for interviewing farmers. Results revealed that chickens are dominating the poultry population while turkey was the least. Majority of the respondents reared desi variety of birds followed by improved varieties such as Vanaraja, Giriraja, Rainbow rooster, Rajasri etc rearing under the extensive system by providing shelter in the form of local made bamboo baskets. The study also revealed that mortality due to high incidence of disease was the major cause of rural poultry losses which was supported by reports of whitish diarrhea, greenish diarrhea and twisting of head & neck mainly during the summer season. It was also observed that majority respondents were unaware of the disease symptoms or the vaccination strategy regarding Ranikhet disease (RD) and most of the farmers experienced disease outbreak once in a year. Majority of the respondents mentioned veterinary hospitals as their main source of treatment for their birds and taken the help of farmers in treating their birds. Among the persons having knowledge about vaccination against RD, majority have reported that the vaccine was available at veterinary hospitals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3adiarrhea 3adisease incidence 3adisease outbreaks 3ahead 3amortality 3aneck 3aquestionnaires 3aroosters 3asummer 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aRanikhet disease 0aRural poultry 0aTelangana state 0aJagitial district1 aBora, Swathi0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2018 Apr., v. 53, no. 1 p.128-130dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00060.53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007000172300001600242520174600258592002802004650000802032650002102040650001102061650001502072650001202087650001602099650001902115650001602134650001802150650003702168650002402205650001502229650004302244650000902287650001802296650002902314700001402343700001902357773012402376856008402500852000902584655001202593IND60099605820221120230740.0141105e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009960582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2011.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPillai, Malini S.10ap38 MAPK regulates G1-S transition in hypoxic cardiac fibroblasts  ap. 919-927.  aCardiac fibroblast hyperplasia associated with augmented matrix production is central to wound healing following myocardial injury. Regulation of the cardiac fibroblast cell cycle by factors in the diseased myocardium that can potentially modify the hyperplastic response of cardiac fibroblasts has, however, not been investigated. We examined the regulation of the cardiac fibroblast cell cycle by hypoxia, a major constituent of myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in DNA synthesis and cell number, and flow cytometry indicated decreased G1/S progression in hypoxic adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed reduced levels of cyclin D and cyclin A, induction of p27 and hypophosphorylation of Rb under hypoxia. Skp2, which targets p27 for degradation, was significantly lower and inversely related to p27 protein levels in hypoxic cells. Marked p38 MAPK activation was observed under hypoxia and its inhibition using SB203580 reversed the effects of hypoxia on DNA synthesis, cell cycle phase distribution, p27, and cyclin D1 but not cyclin A. Interestingly, a 2-fold increase in p27 mRNA in hypoxic cells, demonstrated by real-time PCR, was unaffected by SB203580, which, however, reversed the hypoxic inhibition of Skp2. In summary, p38 MAPK is an important determinant of hypoxia-induced G0/G1 block in cardiac fibroblasts. p27 induction in hypoxic cardiac fibroblasts may involve direct transcriptional regulation, independent of p38 MAPK, and post-translational regulation via p38 MAPK-dependent suppression of its degradation by Skp2. The study identifies Skp2 as a potential downstream target of p38 MAPK, suggesting a novel mechanism of G1-S regulation in cardiac fibroblasts exposed to stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3acell cycle 3acyclins 3afibroblasts 3aflow cytometry 3ahyperplasia 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amyocardial ischemia 3amyocardium 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3atissue repair 3atranscription (genetics)1 aSapna, S.1 aShivakumar, K.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2011 June, v. 43, no. 6 p.919-927dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2011.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006500172300001600237500001900253520161200272592002801884650001301912650001501925650002501940650001201965650000901977650001201986650001301998650001302011650001102024650001202035650001702047650002102064650002302085650001402108650001602122650002002138650002102158650001102179651002102190651001002211653001802221653002102239653002002260653002402280653001602304773014102320856008602461852000902547655001202556IND60721214820221116173902.0201224e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072121482DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2018.00024.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Avishek10aScenario of poultry farming in high altitude region of India  ap. 131-136.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring the last three decades, India has reached a level of self-sufficiency in chicken production, and the poultry industry has become more sophisticated, but the situation in the cold arid Himalayan part in India remains challenging. The main reasons for this condition are the non-existence of any commercial breeds or hatcheries, problems transporting day old chicks, poor availability of poultry feed ingredients and the fact that the majority of the population are Buddhist, and consequently largely vegetarian and generally avoid killing animals. There are varied climatic and topographic features are shows in the north western part of the Himalayan region of India. This area exhibits an extremely cold and dry climate for most of the year which hinders the growth and productivity of biomass. Vegetation cover is therefore very rare in these areas with the temperature falling to-30°C during winter and the altitude varies from 2000 to 3658 m from mean sea level (MSL). This type of cold, arid, desert-like conditions are not suited for natural habitat of poultry birds. At sea level, the oxygen concentration, barometric pressure, humidity and temperature should be 21%, 740 mm Hg, 65% and 99.8°F, respectively, however, in this cold desert area O2 concentration is 30% lower than at mean sea level, barometric pressure is only 510 mm Hg, humidity is less than 30% and temperature ranges from-30°C to +30°C. The objective of this review article is briefly described the problems, their solutions and opportunities for successful poultry farming in the high altitude cold arid region of India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aarid zones 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiomass 3acold 3adeserts 3ahabitats 3ahumidity 3aoxygen 3apoultry 3apoultry feed 3apoultry industry 3apoultry production 3asea level 3atemperature 3avegetarian diet 3avegetation cover 3awinter 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aHigh altitude 0aCold arid region 0aPoultry farming 0aBarometric pressure 0aConstraints0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2018 Aug., v. 53, no. 2 p.131-136dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2018.00024.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011000153300002000263520126100283592002801544650001601572650002601588650001601614650001101630650001101641650001501652650006601667650001401733650001601747650001501763650001301778650002501791650001101816650001601827650001401843650001001857700001701867700001601884700001901900700001601919700001601935700001701951700001801968700001701986773012502003856007402128852000902202655001202211IND60641263720221120065335.0190505e20161019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064126372DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21083j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jie10aFluorographene nanosheets: a new carbon-based matrix for the detection of small molecules by MALDI-TOF MS  ap. 99714-99719.  aFluorographene nanosheets (FG) were synthesized via one-pot chloroform-mediated sonochemical exfoliation under ambient conditions. For the first time, this material served as a novel matrix for the detection of small molecules by negative ion MALDI-TOF MS. The structural characterization and ionization mechanism of FG were illustrated. The unique properties of FG endow it with properties such as low background, excellent chemical compatibility and homogeneity over conventional carbon based matrices. Most significantly, application of FG as matrix resolved the contamination problem of conventional carbon based matrices to ion source. With the association of FG, a variety of small molecules containing amino acids, peptides, small metabolites, drugs and organonitrogen compounds were analyzed. The developed method was found to have excellent feasibility with biosystems. Based on this, qualitative analysis of sialic acid in human saliva, melatonin in human urine and in situ analysis of MCF-7 cells were done, besides, quantification of anti-cancer drug in human serum and uric acid in human urine were displayed. This work extends the application fields of FG and provides a good candidate of matrix for MALDI-TOF MS detection of small molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aantineoplastic agents 3ablood serum 3acarbon 3ahumans 3aionization 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amelatonin 3ametabolites 3ananosheets 3apeptides 3aqualitative analysis 3asaliva 3asialic acid 3auric acid 3aurine1 aChen, Suming1 aLiu, Huihui1 aXiong, Caiqiao1 aWang, Jiyun1 aXie, Xiaobo1 aXue, Jinjuan1 aChen, Penglei1 aNie, Zongxiu0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 19, v. 6, no. 102 p.99714-99719dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21083j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169520172200288592002802010650001902038650003002057650002002087650002502107650002202132650001502154650001002169650001502179650002302194650002002217651002102237653002502258653003702283653001602320653000902336700005702345700001802402700005902420700005802479773011802537856008602655852000902741655001202750IND60679658520221122045428.0200210e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067965852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Woo-Jin10aMonitoring the movement of artificially injected CO2 at a shallow experimental site in Korea using carbon isotopes  aThe greenhouse effect is closely related to elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and therefore, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has attracted attention worldwide as a method for preventing the release of CO₂ into the atmosphere, which highlights the importance of monitoring CO₂ released from subsurface deposits. In this study, CO₂ gas with a δ¹³C value of −30‰ was injected into soil through pipes installed at a depth of 2.5 m, and samples of CO₂ gas released from the soil surface and three soil depths were collected from September 2015 to March 2016 to estimate subsurface CO₂ movement. Before and after CO₂ injection, the δ¹³C values of CO₂ released from the soil surface ranged from −24.5 to −13.4‰ (average −20.2 ± 2.1‰, n = 25) and from −31.6 to −11.9‰ (average −23.2 ± 4.3‰, n = 49), respectively. The results indicated that the leakage of injected CO₂ was successfully detected at the surface. The δ¹³C values were visualized using an interpolation map to estimate the subsurface CO₂ distribution, which confirmed that diffusion of the injected CO₂ gas extended to the soil zone where CO₂ was not injected. Additionally, variation in δ¹³C for soil CO₂ was detected at the three soil depths (15, 30, and 60 cm), where the values were −16.1, −20.0, and −22.1‰, respectively. Different δ¹³C values horizontally and vertically indicated that soil heterogeneity led to different CO₂ migration pathways and rates. We suggest that the carbon isotope ratio of CO₂ is an effective tool for concurrently monitoring CO₂ leakage on and under surface in a soil zone if a thorough baseline study is carried out in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acarbon isotopes 3acarbon sequestration 3agreenhouse effect 3amonitoring 3apipes 3asoil depth 3asoil heterogeneity 3astable isotopes 3aKorean Peninsula 0aCarbon isotope ratio 0aCarbon capture and storage (CCS) 0aCO2 leakage 0aSoil1 aRyu, Jong-Sik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3061-24251 aChoi, Hye-Bin1 aYun, Seong-Taek1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9443-28721 aLee, Kwang-Sik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6400-75170 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 258 p.110030-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245015800207300002000365520164300385592002802028650002202056650003702078650001402115650002002129650003002149650002402179650001302203650001302216650001802229650001402247650001202261650002302273650002302296700006002319700001602379700006102395773013902456856008002595852000902675655001202684IND60614638520221116170535.0181002e20180911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b076402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatnagar, Ashish1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1409-153510aTiH₂ as a Dynamic Additive for Improving the De/Rehydrogenation Properties of MgH₂: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Mechanistic Investigation  ap. 21248-21261.  aWe report a mechanism for how low concentrations of TiH₂ can function as a dynamic additive for improving both the kinetics and the thermodynamics of the Mg/MgH₂–TiH₂ system. We use a combination of experimental and theoretical methods to study de/rehydrogenation in Mg/MgH₂–TiH₂ systems. Our experiments show that ball milling MgH₂ with 5 wt % TiH₂ improves the thermodynamics and kinetics of de/rehydrogenation in Mg/MgH₂, and these improvements are robust with respect to cycling. The enthalpy change for the Mg/MgH₂–TiH₂ system is about 7 kJ/mol H₂ lower than that for ball-milled MgH₂. Structural (X-ray diffraction, in situ X-ray diffraction) and microstructural (electron microscopy) characterization has been employed to understand the role and state of the catalyst. We have developed a theoretical model that broadly captures the experimental observations and performed first-principles density functional theory and phonon density of states calculations to identify the energetically preferred location of TiH₂ in the Mg/MgH₂–TiH₂ systems. We found that TiH₂ located beneath the surface of Mg is energetically more favorable than being located on top of Mg. In contrast, TiH₂ on the surface of MgH₂ is favored over subsurface configurations. We hypothesize that TiH₂ particles migrate from the subsurface to the surface during hydrogenation of Mg and in the opposite direction during dehydrogenation of MgH₂. The hypothesis of migration of TiH₂ particles during de/rehydrogenation of Mg/MgH₂–TiH₂ is supported by our microstructural (electron microscopy) and XPS studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3adehydrogenation 3adensity functional theory 3aelectron microscopy 3aenthalpy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amagnesium 3amilling 3aphysical chemistry 3atheoretical models1 aJohnson, J.

For the purpose of describing neutral, acid and sulphate mucopolysaccharides we used the Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction (PAS), Alcian blue-specific (pH = 1.0 and 2.5) and Toluidine blue-specific staining. Based on our results we have concluded that the herbal preparation Nozevit induces the production and secretion of mucous from the epithelial layer of treated bees, and additionally coats the peritrophic membrane to form a firm and resilient envelope. Thus, the preparation may ensure protection from new invasion with Nosema sp. spores and also from normal physiological processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aNosema 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahistopathology 3ahoney bees 3amucosa 3apH 3aperitrophic membrane 3asecretion 3asulfates1 aKozaric, Z.1 aBerta, D.1 aNejedli, S.1 aPetrinec, Z.0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 56, no. 7 p.344-351dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/1587-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245015300165520169500318592002802013650000902041650001902050650001502069650000902084650001702093650001202110650002002122650001602142650001402158653002502172653001802197653002602215653001802241653002402259653002602283700001302309700001702322700001602339700001202355700005802367700001802425700001802443700001402461773010602475856008702581852000902668655001202677IND60753057920221123042408.0211114e20211220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075305792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1276732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Bao10aEffect and mechanism of combined operation of profile modification and water shutoff with in-depth displacement in high-heterogeneity oil reservoirs  aThe main oil reservoirs in the Bohai area, with thick layer, high average permeability, high heterogeneity, loose rock cementation, and high oil viscosity, have entered the stage of medium and high water-cut development and faced serious problems of large channel development and injection profile reversal. For the actual demand, a comprehensive method of the combined operation of profile modification and water shutoff with in-depth displacement was proposed to enhance oil recovery in Bohai oilfield. The effects and mechanisms of both single operation and combined operation were compared quantitatively and clarified theoretically. The findings showed that the operation of profile modification and water shutoff using a composite gel system could effectively treat the channeling layer, and improve the macroscopic sweep efficiency of the oil displacement agents. For the in-depth displacement system using the surfactant/microsphere composites, the microspheres could realize the micro-fluid diversion by plugging the swept pores, and the carried surfactant solution could enter the unswept pores to displace the remaining oil, while the decrease of viscosity and interfacial tension could effectively reduce the seepage resistance and improve the oil displacement efficiency. Compared with the single operation, the combined operation could bring about the comprehensive treatment from three aspects of expanding the macro and micro sweep efficiency, as well as improving the oil displacement efficiency, which has achieved quite good performances in the field application. The proposed method can be an effective technology to treat similar oil reservoirs with high heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3agels 3amicroparticles 3aoil fields 3aoils 3apermeability 3aseepage 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3aviscosity 0aProfile modification 0aWater shutoff 0aIn-depth displacement 0aComposite gel 0aPolymer microsphere 0aEnhanced oil recovery1 aXie, Kun1 aLu, Xiangguo1 aCao, Weijia1 aHe, Xin1 aXiao, Zhongmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9958-27491 aZhang, Yunbao1 aWang, Xiaoyan1 aSu, Cheng0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Dec. 20, v. 631 p.127673-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1276733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006900164300001600233520089800249592002801147650001501175650001201190651001901202700002101221773012701242856008301369852000901452655001201461IND60776614920220904000000.0220904e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077661492DNAL7 a10.17221/16/2011-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikulec, J.10aLandscape and tourism potential in the protected landscape areas  ap. 272-278.  aReasons to travel and to visit concrete destinations in the Czech Republic are especially the nature and cultural/historical sightseeing.

CP⁺ rapidly self-associates into positively charged nanosheets based on a monolayer structure. In contrast, CP– self-assembles to form negatively charged monolayer nanosheets at a much slower rate, which can be accelerated in the presence of calcium(II) ion. A 2:1 mixture of unassociated CP– peptide with preformed CP⁺ nanosheets generates structurally defined triple-layer nanosheets in which two CP– monolayers have formed on the identical surfaces of the CP⁺ nanosheet template. Experimental data from electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) image analysis, zeta potential measurements, and charged nanoparticle binding assays support a negative surface charge state for the triple-layer nanosheets, which is the reverse of the positive surface charge state observed for the CP⁺ monolayer nanosheets. The electrostatic complementarity between the CP⁺ and CP– triple helical cohesive ends at the layer interfaces promotes a (CP–/CP⁺/CP–) compositional gradient along the z-direction of the nanosheet. This structurally informed approach represents an attractive strategy for the fabrication of two-dimensional nanostructures with compositional control.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acollagen 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3apeptides 3azeta potential1 aVail, Owen A.1 aJiang, Zhigang1 aZuo, Xiaobing1 aConticello, Vincent P.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 June 24, v. 137, no. 24 p.7793-7802dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b033263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009800171300001600269520190900285592002802194650005002222650001802272650001602290650001202306650001002318650001502328650002002343650001802363650002302381650001402404650001702418650001402435650001602449650001302465650001502478650001302493650001202506650001202518650003102530650001102561651001002572653002702582653000902609653000902618653001202627653002102639700002102660700002202681700006002703700002702763700002002790700002202810700001702832773010702849856008502956852000903041655001203050IND60582838620221118053808.0180911e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058283862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.08.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaysoni, Amit U.10aEvaluation of VOC concentrations in indoor and outdoor microenvironments at near-road schools  ap. 681-693.  aA 14-week air quality study, characterizing the indoor and outdoor concentrations of 18 VOCs at four El Paso, Texas elementary schools, was conducted in Spring 2010. Three schools were in an area of high traffic density and the fourth school, considered as a background school, was situated in an area affected minimally by stationary and mobile sources of air pollution. Passive samplers were deployed for monitoring and analyzed by GC/MS. Differences in the concentration profiles of the BTEX species between the high and low traffic density schools confirmed the pre-defined exposure patterns. Toluene was the predominant compound within the BTEX group and the 96-hr average outdoor concentrations varied from 1.16 to 4.25 μg/m³ across the four schools. Outdoor BTEX species were strongly correlated with each other (0.63 < r < 1.00, p < 0.05) suggesting a common source: vehicular traffic emissions. As expected, the strength of the associations between these compounds was more intense at each of the three high-exposure schools in contrast to the low-exposure school. This was further corroborated by the results obtained from the BTEX inter-species ratios (toluene: benzene and m, p- xylenes: ethylbenzene). Certain episodic events during the study period resulted in very elevated concentrations of some VOCs such as n-pentane. Indoor concentration of compounds with known indoor sources such as α –pinene, d-limonene, p-dichlorobenzene, and chloroform were generally higher than their corresponding outdoor concentrations. Cleaning agents, furniture polishes, materials used in arts and crafts activities, hot-water usage, and deodorizing cakes used in urinal pots were the likely major sources for these high indoor concentrations. Finally, retrospective assessment of average ambient BTEX concentrations over the last twenty years suggest a gradual decrement in this border region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3abenzene 3acakes 3achloroform 3acleaning agents 3adeodorization 3aelementary schools 3aemissions 3aethylbenzene 3afurniture 3ahandicrafts 3alimonene 3amonitoring 3asamplers 3atoluene 3atraffic 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene 3aTexas 0aAir quality monitoring 0aVOCs 0aBTEX 0aSchools 0aPassive samplers1 aStock, Thomas H.1 aSarnat, Jeremy A.1 aChavez, Mayra C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2511-08231 aSarnat, Stefanie Ebelt1 aMontoya, Teresa1 aHolguin, Fernando1 aLi, Wen-Whai0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Dec., v. 231 p.681-693dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.08.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245009000167520146400257592002801721650001501749650002301764650001801787650001801805650001401823650000901837700002901846700002701875700001901902700002401921700002001945700002101965700002501986700003002011773012002041856008002161852000902241655001202250IND60784090220221120081155.0220726e20220708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078409022DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130706162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesquesnes, Marc 14aThe Use of “Tail-Pedometers” to Evaluate the Impact of Dipterans in Feeder Cattle  aHematophagous flies are a pest for livestock; their direct impact reduces productivity, and they are vectors of parasites, bacteria and viruses. Their control using insecticides is inefficient and highly polluting. The validation of new control tools requires efficacy and cost-effectiveness evaluation. The quantification of hematophagous insects’ impact in livestock is a challenging prerequisite. Tail flicks counts can reliably evaluate fly-burden; however, visual records are tedious and time-consuming. In the present study, automation of tail flick counts was made through the use of pedometers attached to the tail, in two groups of feeder cattle. Group A was kept in a pen under the protection of a mosquito net, and Group B was kept in an open-air pen. The fly density of Group B was evaluated using fly traps. The apparent density per trap ranged from 130 to 1700 in the study. The mean pedometer records per 24 h ranged from 957+/−58 bits in Group A to 11,138+/−705 bits in Group B. The night/day records observed in Group A (200/800 bits) were drastically increased in Group B (1000–4000/4000–14,000 bits) and variable along seasons. A very high correlation was observed between fly density and visual records or pedometer records (PR). Two-hour PRs proved to be a reliable predictive tool for fly density. Moreover, the pedometers revealed an unsuspected but significant nuisance of mosquitoes, which should be thoroughly investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acost effectiveness 3afeeder cattle 3amosquito nets 3apedometer 3atail1 aThaisungnoen, Kornkanok 1 aChalermwong, Piangjai 1 aNevot, Adèle 1 aFossaert, Clément 1 aLucas, Antoine 1 aOnju, Sathaporn 1 aBoonsaen, Phoompong 1 aJittapalapong, Sathaporn 0 tInsects.g2022 July 08, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130706163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008100162500001900243520137300262592002801635650000901663650002601672650001001698651001201708700002501720773012001745856007301865852000901938655001201947IND60711911220221116142249.0200928e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071191122DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahjabin, Tasnuva 10aTrends in the Magnitude and Frequency of Extreme Rainfall Regimes in Florida  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTrends in the extreme rainfall regimes were analyzed at 24 stations of Florida for four analysis periods: 1950–2010, 1960–2010, 1970–2010, and 1980–2010. A trend-free pre-whitening approach was utilized to correct data for autocorrelations. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen approach were employed to detect and estimate trends in the magnitude of annual maximum rainfalls and in the number of annual above-threshold events (i.e., frequency). A bootstrap resampling approach was used to account for cross-correlations across sites and evaluate the global significance of trends at the 10% level (p-value ≤ 0.10). Dominant locally significant (p-value ≤ 0.10) increasing trends were found in the magnitudes of 1–12 h extreme rainfalls for the longest period, and in 6 h to 7 day rainfalls for the shortest period. The trends in 2–12 h rainfalls were also globally significant (i.e., exceeded the trends that could occur by chance). In contrast, globally significant decreasing trends were noted in the annual number of 1–3 h, 1–6 h, and 3–6 h extreme rainfalls during 1950–2010, 1960–2010, and 1980–2010, respectively. Trends in the number of 1–7 day extreme rainfalls were mixed, lacking global significance. Our findings would guide stormwater management in tropical/subtropical environments of Florida and around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3arain 3astormwater management 3awater 3aFlorida1 aAbdul-Aziz, Omar  I.0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01766naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245009700175300001600272506002800288520069400316592002801010506003701038650002301075650001001098650001601108650001101124650001301135653002501148653003501173773013501208856008801343852000901431655001201440IND60784751520221207095718.0181029e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078475152DNAL7 a10.20961/carakatani.v24i2.140382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSetyowati, Nuning10aDampak mobilitas ulang alik terhadap pendapatan rumah tangga petani di kabupaten karanganyar  ap. 126-136.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of the research is to know the factor which motivate commutation and its effect to labour farm household supply.

Considerable efforts are being made to find new sources for natural silk and also to develop regenerated protein fibers to supplement the limited amounts of B. mori and wild silks available in the market. In addition, it has been found that non-traditional silks have unique properties and utilizing uncommon wild silks can provide income and employment to indigenous people where the wild silks are found. Actias lunas belongs to the Saturniidae family of silk producing insects. However, the structure and properties of silk produced by A. lunas have not been studied. This research showed that the silk fibers produced by the luna moth had morphological and physical structure similar to that of the common wild silks but tensile properties similar to that of B. mori silk. A. lunas silk fibers are composed of higher amounts of hydrophobic amino acids and had much less glycine than B. mori and common wild silks. With a fineness of 2 denier, breaking tenacity of 4.3Â g/den and breaking elongation of 10.9Â %, the tensile properties of A. lunas silk fibers were similar to that of B. mori and much better than that of the common wild silks that are coarser and have lower breaking tenacity. A. lunas fibers show good potential to be useful for applications currently using B. mori silk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActias luna 3aBombyx mori 3aamino acids 3aemployment 3afineness 3ahydrophobicity 3aincome 3aindigenous peoples 3ainsects 3amarkets 3asilk1 aYang, Yiqi0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2012 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.659-664dSpringer-Verlagx1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-012-0482-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245010700207300001600314520138700330592002801717650001301745650001601758650001701774650001701791650002701808650001101835650001201846650001001858650001001868650001201878650002101890650002301911650000701934650001501941650001301956650001301969650001001982650001901992650002002011650002102031650001802052650001902070650001002089651001002099651001002109700001402119700001402133700001802147773010902165856008102274852000902355655001202364IND60633789220221118231132.0190321e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063378922DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-018-0348-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdul Rahman, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4073-561010aSheep and Goat Corralling Density Effect on Soil Properties and Weed Species Diversity of Arable Lands  ap. 125-131.  aThe hypothesis that livestock corralling improves soil properties and weed species richness was investigated in a 2-year on-farm trial conducted in Sudan savanna agro-ecology of Ghana. The effect of three stocking densities of sheep and goats corralling (0, 70 and 140 head ha⁻¹) on soil properties and weed species diversity was evaluated in a randomized complete block design with eight replicates. Sheep and goats weighing 27 ± 2.0 and 24 ± 1.5 kg, respectively, were corralled on fallow arable lands from 19: 00 to 06: 00 GMT hours daily for 178 nights during 2014 and 2015 cropping seasons. Soil parameters measured include pH, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, soil microbial quotient, earthworm cast, bulk density, porosity, and moisture. Soil properties and weed species diversity increased (P < 0.01) with sheep and goats corralling relative to the control. Broadleaf and sedge species were positively correlated with soil OC while the grass was positively correlated with soil OC, microbial biomass carbon, bulk density, and porosity. The results suggest that crop-livestock farmers could corral 70 head ha⁻¹ sheep and goats for soil fertility amendment on Ferric Lixisol in Sudan savanna agro-ecology of West Africa and similar agro-ecologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLixisols 3aagroecology 3aarable soils 3abulk density 3aexchangeable potassium 3afallow 3afarmers 3afarms 3agoats 3agrasses 3amicrobial carbon 3amicrobial nitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aporosity 3asavannas 3asheep 3asoil fertility 3asoil properties 3aspecies richness 3astocking rate 3atotal nitrogen 3aweeds 3aGhana 3aSudan1 aLarbi, A.1 aOpoku, A.1 aTetteh, F.

Bioanalysis of GSK1795091 is challenging as extremely low doses (<1 μg) are administered in clinical settings, requiring an assay with a quantitation limit of 2 pg mL⁻¹ or below. Other challenges associated with the bioanalysis of GSK1795091 include carryover and nonspecific binding issues. Due to these compound characteristics and the lack of precedence, extensive method development was performed to address these challenges. A novel extraction protocol was developed that included sample clean up with an Ostro™ pass-through sample preparation plate and a double chemical derivatization approach targeting hydrophilic functional moieties. The method was validated over the concentration range of 2 to 100 pg mL⁻¹ and employed to determine the exposure of GSK1795091 in a first time in human clinical study. Incurred sample reanalysis was also included and the results agreed with those of the original analysis. The method was found to be precise, accurate and robust, and the low LOQ was critical to adequately support clinical PK assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aagonists 3aanalytical methods 3aderivatization 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3amoieties1 aJunnotula, Venkatraman1 aBowen, Chester L.1 aFang, Kasie1 aQian, Yanwen1 aMatheny, Christopher0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 June 28, v. 10, no. 25 p.3074-3080dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay00571k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012700175300001800302520168700320592002802007596008402035650002002119650002002139650001902159650001302178650001302191650002402204650001202228650001502240650002702255650002102282650001302303650001002316650001002326650002402336650001902360700007002379700003002449700003102479700003402510700004102544773014502585856008202730852000902812655001202821IND60654674920221120054951.0190726e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065467492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-019-01724-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeite, Patrício Gomes10aEthology, physiological, and ingestive responses of sheep subjected to different temperatures and salinity levels of water  ap. 1091-1098.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological responses, ethology, and ingestive behavior of female Morada Nova sheep kept in a thermoneutral environment, after thermal stress and after consuming water with different levels of salinity. Thirty-six Morada Nova females with a mean age of 10.0 ± 2.0 months and a mean weight of 25.0 ± 3.0 kg were evaluated and distributed in a climatic chamber. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a factorial scheme of 2 (air temperature (AT)) × 3 (salinity levels (SLs)) and six replications. The sheep’s physiological responses, ethology (day/night), and ingestive behavior were evaluated while they were subjected to ATs of 26.0 and 32.0 °C and SLs of 3.0, 6.0, and 9.0 dS/m. With elevation in AT, the animals experienced increased (P < 0.05) rectal temperatures (RTs), respiratory rates (RFs), and surface temperatures (STs) and exhibited reduced (P < 0.05) heart rates (HRs). When consuming water with an SL of 9.0 dS/m, a HR reduction (P < 0.05) was observed. Sleep behavior increased (P < 0.05) with the increase in SL during the day. Sleeping and drinking behaviors increased (P < 0.05), and the time of inactivity was reduced (P < 0.05) during the nocturnal period with increased SLs. With increased SLs, sheep consumed more water (P < 0.05) and reduced (P < 0.05) the number of regurgitated ruminal boluses per day (NRBD). Under the conditions of thermal stress (32.0 °C), sheep need to make physiological adjustments to maintain homeothermy. Water consumption of SLs up to 9.0 dS/m causes a higher state of dormancy in female Morada Nova sheep.  aPublisher supplied data  a482955/2012-03cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aair temperature 3aanimal behavior 3abioclimatology 3adormancy 3adrinking 3aexperimental design 3afemales 3aheart rate 3aphysiological response 3arespiratory rate 3asalinity 3asheep 3asleep 3asurface temperature 3athermal stress1 aMarques, Jordânio Inácio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7665-82181 aFurtado, Dermeval Araújo1 aLopes Neto, José Pinheiro1 ade Souza, Bonifácio Benício1 ado Nascimento, José Wallace Barbosa0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2019 Aug., v. 63, no. 8 p.1091-1098dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46344x0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-019-01724-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245010100166520136100267592002801628650002101656650001901677650003401696650001301730650001101743650001501754650001601769650002501785650001401810650001501824650002601839650003101865650003101896700003001927700002801957700002801985700003102013700003002044700002102074700003402095773012102129856007302250852000902323655001202332IND60748769720221120131556.0210827e20210728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074876972DNAL7 a10.3390/v130814822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Tejeda, Yakelin 10aNanog, in Cooperation with AP1, Increases the Expression of E6/E7 Oncogenes from HPV Types 16/18  aPersistent infections with some types of human papillomavirus (HPV) constitute the major etiological factor for cervical cancer development. Nanog, a stem cell transcription factor has been shown to increase during cancer progression. We wanted to determine whether Nanog could modulate transcription of E6 and E7 oncogenes. We used luciferase reporters under the regulation of the long control region (LCR) of HPV types 16 and 18 (HPV16/18) and performed RT-qPCR. We found that Nanog increases activity of both viral regulatory regions and elevates endogenous E6/E7 mRNA levels in cervical cancer-derived cells. We demonstrated by in vitro mutagenesis that changes at Nanog-binding sites found in the HPV18 LCR significantly inhibit transcriptional activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Nanog binds in vivo to the HPV18 LCR, and its overexpression increases its binding as well as that of c-Jun. Surprisingly, we observed that mutation of AP1-binding sites also affect Nanog’s ability to activate transcription, suggesting cooperation between the two factors. We searched for putative Nanog-binding sites in the LCR of several HPVs and surprisingly found them only in those types associated with cancer development. Our study shows, for the first time, a role for Nanog in the regulation of E6/E7 transcription of HPV16/18.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3acarcinogenesis 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3aetiology 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3amutagenesis 3aneoplasm progression 3aoncogenes 3astem cells 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aGuido-Jiménez, Miriam C.1 aLópez-Carbajal, Helga 1 aAmador-Molina, Alfredo 1 aMéndez-Martínez, Rocío 1 aGariglio-Vidal, Patricio 1 aLizano, Marcela 1 aGarcía-Carrancá, Alejandro 0 tViruses.g2021 July 28, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130814823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010100161300001800262520108800280592002801368650001101396650001701407650003101424650004301455650001101498650002101509650001501530700002301545700002401568773012801592856007401720852000901794655001201803IND60617355520221123015840.0181025e20180524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061735552DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay00576a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShieh, Jeng-Jong10aClinical analysis and quantitation of MB-102, a novel fluorescence tracer agent, in human plasma  ap. 2376-2383.  aA rapid analytical method for the quantitation of MB-102 (a fluorescent tracer agent) in human plasma using HPLC with fluorescence detection has been developed and validated. This new plasma sample preparation method, 1/100 direct dilution with phosphate buffered saline instead of typical protein precipitation, improves both robustness and assay efficiency by eliminating the need for sample drying and the need for an internal standard. The validation results show that the new method is robust, specific, precise, accurate, and has a wide linear dynamic range (0.4 ng mL⁻¹ to 400 ng mL⁻¹) with good recovery. The results from 59 clinical study subjects analyzed by both methods yield an excellent correlation with a slope of 1.015 and an R² of 0.994. Sample preparation using direct dilution is easier and faster than the protein precipitation method, and is excellent for determining the MB-102 content in human plasma. The concentration of MB-102 in plasma as a function of time is used to calculate the glomerular filtration rate using a standard pharmacokinetic model.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrying 3afluorescence 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics 3aphosphates1 aRochelle Riley, I.1 aDorshow, Richard B.0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 May 24, v. 10, no. 20 p.2376-2383dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay00576a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001100112245010500123300001600228506002800244520172200272592002801994506003702022650001602059650001602075650001502091650002002106650001202126650000902138650001602147650002102163650001302184650002602197650001202223650001802235650001902253650001502272653001502287653001002302653002302312773014102335852000902476655001202485IND60784751820221207095717.0120326e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078475182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurdin10aDevelopment and Rainfed Paddy Soils Potency Derived from Lacustrine Material in Paguyaman, Gorontalo  ap. 267-278.  aResource is Open Access  aRainfed paddy soils that are derived from lacustrine and include of E4 agroclimatic zone have many unique properties and potentially for paddy and corn plantations. This sreseach was aimed to: (1) study the soil development of rainfed paddy soils derived from lacustrine and (2) evaluate rainfed paddy soils potency for paddy and corn in Paguyaman. Soil samples were taken from three profiles according to toposequent, and they were analyzed in laboratory. Data were analyzed with descriptive-quantitative analysis. Furthermore, assessment on rainfed paddy soils potency was conducted with land suitability analysis using parametric approach. Results indicate that all pedon had evolved with B horizons structurization. However, pedon located on the summit slope was more developed and intensely weathered than those of the shoulder and foot slopes.The main pedogenesis in all pedons were through elluviation, illuviation, lessivage, pedoturbation, and gleization processes. The main factors of pedogenesis were climate, age (time) and topography factors. Therefore, P1 pedons are classified as Ustic Endoaquerts, fine, smectitic, isohypertermic; P2 as Vertic Endoaquepts, fine, smectitic, isohypertermic; and P3 as Vertic Epiaquepts, fine, smectitic, isohypertermic. Based on the potentials of the land, the highest of land suitability class (LSC) of land utilization type (LUT) local paddy was highly suitable (S1), while the lowest one was not suitable with nutrient availability as the limiting factor (Nna). The highest LCS of paddy-corn LUT was marginally suitable with water availability as the limiting factor (S3wa), while the lower LSC was not suitable with nutrient availabily as the limiting factor (Nna).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEndoaquepts 3aEndoaquerts 3aEpiaquepts 3aagroclimatology 3aclimate 3acorn 3ailluviation 3aland suitability 3aland use 3anutrient availability 3apaddies 3apedoturbation 3asoil formation 3atopography 0alacustrine 0apaddy 0arainfed paddy soil0 tJurnal tanah Tropika dan Kualitas Lingkungan.g2011 Sept., v. 16, no. 3 p.267-278dUniversity of LampungwJournal:27737x2086-66827nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245018600170300001100356520181600367592002802183650002602211650001202237650001902249650001502268650001202283650001902295650001802314650001402332650001102346650001602357650001302373650001202386650001502398650001802413650001702431650003202448650001002480650001802490650002002508651001602528700002302544700002402567700006202591773011702653856008202770852000902852655001202861IND60654675020221120024738.0200308e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065467502DNAL7 a10.1186/s10086-019-1814-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilbero, Dennis M.10aSurface growth stress and wood properties of 8-year-old planted Big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) from different landrace provenances and trial sites in the Philippines  ap. 35.  aThe scarcity of timber to supply the wood-based industries is one of the prevailing problems worldwide. Tree plantations are the remaining solutions to subdue the shortage of raw materials, at the same time sequester atmospheric CO₂ in its biomass to reduce global warming. Planting Big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) contributes valuable economic inputs to small tree farmers in the Philippines. However, the occurrence of lumber defects during processing due to growth stresses reduces the potential value of timber. This study aimed to examine the differences of surface growth stresses and wood properties of an 8-year-old BL mahogany from six landrace provenances in two progeny trial sites, Butuan and Cagayan de Oro in the Philippines. The longitudinal released strains of the surface growth stress (SRS) were not significantly different among six landrace provenances and between two trial sites. The SRS were not significantly related to diameter at breast height (DBH) in both trial sites. The high level of negative SRS was observed in some tested trees with small diameter in both trial sites, which was attributed to the tension wood formation in an irregular-shaped stem. The xylem density (XD), average microfibril angle in the secondary cell wall (MFA), vessel element length (VL) and vessel element width (VW) had no significant differences among six landrace provenances. In terms of trial sites, Butuan trial site gave high lateral growth DBH, high XD, longer fiber length (FL) with a narrow fiber width (FW) and smaller MFA as compared to the Cagayan de Oro trial site. It was observed that an 8-year-old BL mahogany plantation with small-diameter trees exhibited high SRS, low XD, small FL, wide FW and large MFA, which are passively considered as properties of juvenile wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSwietenia macrophylla 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acell walls 3afarmers 3aglobal warming 3ajuvenile wood 3alandraces 3alumber 3aplantations 3aplanting 3aprogeny 3aprovenance 3araw materials 3atension wood 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3awood industry 3awood properties 3aPhilippines1 aAbasolo, Willie P.1 aMatsuo-Ueda, Miyuki1 aYamamoto, Hiroyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3288-30580 tJournal of wood science.g2019 Dec., v. 65, no. 1 p.35-35dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10086-019-1814-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014600169300001200315500001900327520145500346592002801801650002001829650002501849650001801874650002301892650001601915650001701931650001801948650002101966650001901987650001702006650001602023650001902039650001402058650002902072700006002101773011802161856008302279852000902362655001202371IND60715747320221119161115.0201121e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071574732DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-020-02493-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhator, Khushboo10aNitric oxide mitigates salt-induced oxidative stress in Brassica juncea seedlings by regulating ROS metabolism and antioxidant defense system  ap. 499.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present investigation was designed to determine the interaction of nitric oxide with other antioxidants in relieving oxidative stress induced by NaCl at morphological, physiological and molecular level. 15 days old seedlings of B. juncea were subjected to 50 mM NaCl alone, 100 μM SNP alone and in combination (SNP + NaCl) in hoagland growth medium for 96 h and to analyze the cellular homeostasis and salt tolerance mechanism via examining growth, stress parameters, enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants and expression level of NR. Exposure of 100 μM sodium nitroprusside to mustard seedling enhanced photosynthetic pigment content and prevented plant growth inhibition. Accumulation of MDA and H₂O₂ was more pronounced in individual NaCl treated seedling than in the combination of NaCl and SNP. Applying SNP enhanced NR activity by 1.70 folds and increased NO production by 2.26 folds than individual salt treated roots. Furthermore, the activities of CAT, GPX and NR act synergistically with endogenous NO level whereas APX work antagonistically. In addition, the study also demonstrates that NO regulated NaCl induced transcriptional expression of NR. Induction of BjNR in Indian mustard roots lead to enhanced the plant resistance against salinity stress. The present finding revealed that NO confers increased B. juncea tolerance to salt stress by stimulation of antioxidants and reestablishment of cellular redox status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aantioxidant activity 3aculture media 3agrowth retardation 3ahomeostasis 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3atranscription (genetics)1 aShekhawat, G.

To reconstruct how these processes reshaped social networks, we compiled a comprehensive artifact database from major sites dating to this interval in the western Southwest. We combine social network analysis with geographic information systems approaches to reconstruct network dynamics over 250 y. We show how social networks were transformed across the region at previously undocumented spatial, temporal, and social scales. Using well-dated decorated ceramics, we track changes in network topology at 50-y intervals to show a dramatic shift in network density and settlement centrality from the northern to the southern Southwest after A.D. 1300. Both obsidian sourcing and ceramic data demonstrate that long-distance network relationships also shifted from north to south after migration. Surprisingly, social distance does not always correlate with spatial distance because of the presence of network relationships spanning long geographic distances. Our research shows how a large network in the southern Southwest grew and then collapsed, whereas networks became more fragmented in the northern Southwest but persisted. The study also illustrates how formal social network analysis may be applied to large-scale databases of material culture to illustrate multigenerational changes in network structure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aceramics 3adatabases 3ageographic information systems 3asocial networks 3aUnited States 0aarchaeology 0aNorth American Southwest 0aspatial analysis 0anetwork visualization 0aregional interaction1 aClark, Jeffery J.1 aPeeples, Matthew A.1 aHaas, W.

L). The mosaic incidence with leaf filiformity, mosaic mottling and stunted growth was observed in major chilli growing regions of Tamil Nadu. CMV sap was inoculated on chilli, cowpea, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, ridge gourd, banana, cucumber, Nicotiana and Chenopodium plants. Host range studies revealed that CMV produced localized infection on Nicotiana and systemic symptoms on most of the test plants. The occurrence of CMV was confirmed through DAC-ELISA and RT-PCR analysis. Host plant samples tested with DAC-ELISA showed strong reaction with 1.7 optical density. For molecular characterization, total RNA isolated from infected plants used in RT-PCR with CMV specific primers. The specific amplicons were cloned and sequenced. The complete genome sequencing depicts CMV-RNA1 consist of 3339 nucleotides (nt), RNA2 and RNA3 with 3052nt and 2027nt respectively. Phylogenetic and nucleotide sequence analysis showed TN CMV isolates closely associated with subgroup IB rather than subgroup IA and II. Comparative sequence analysis indicates replicase protein to be more variable among five genes. CP sequence analysis showed 97–98 per cent identity with subgroup IB strains, 92–93 per cent identity with subgroup IA strains and 81–82 per cent identity with subgroup II strains. CMV-RNA3 was predicted to have recombination with Indian black pepper isolate (KU947031) between 165-505nt and Egyptian tomato isolate (KX014666) between 165-506nt positions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aChenopodium 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aLagenaria siceraria 3aLuffa acutangula 3aMomordica charantia 3aNicotiana 3aRNA 3aabsorbance 3abananas 3ablack pepper 3acowpeas 3acucumbers 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asap 3asequence analysis 3atomatoes 3aviruses 3aIndia1 aRajendran, Lakshmanan,1 aRaveendran, M.1 aRajasree, V.1 aKarthikeyan, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9502-84810 t3 Biotech.g2020 Nov., v. 10, no. 11 p.500-500dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02492-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245008500160300001600245520178600261592002802047596003102075596003102106596006002137650001902197650001602216650001902232650001902251650001302270650002602283650000902309650001702318650002602335650001802361650001502379650001902394650001102413650002002424650002102444650001202465650001402477650001002491650001002501700002202511700002302533700001702556700001502573700002502588700002602613700002502639700001302664700002102677773010602698856008102804852000902885655001202894IND60637007020221118060123.0190413e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-018-1240-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Fei10aTissue Microbiome of Norway Spruce Affected by Heterobasidion-Induced Wood Decay  ap. 640-650.  aPlants live in close association with microbial symbionts, which may affect the host fitness, productivity, and tolerance against biotic and abiotic stressors. The composition of plant microbial communities is influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors, but little is known about the effect of plant pathogens on the structure of these communities. In this study, we investigated the structure of bacterial communities associated with different tissues of asymptomatic and symptomatic (Heterobasidion-rotten) Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees. Our results demonstrated that each of the investigated anatomic tissues (root, bark, down stem, upper stem, and needles) harbored a unique bacterial assemblage. However, the health status of the host trees had little effect on the structure of bacterial communities, as the only significant differences among asymptomatic and symptomatic trees were found in the composition of the bacterial communities of needles. Proteobacteria was predominant in all anatomic regions with the highest abundance in needles (86.7%), whereas Actinobacteria showed an opposite trend, being more abundant in the woody tissues than in needles. Additionally, we performed profiling of terpenoid compounds present in spruce xylem and phloem. Total concentrations of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were considerably higher in asymptomatic trees. However, we found no significant correlations between terpenoid profiles of spruce trees and the composition of their bacterial communities. Our results provide an insight into the diversity of bacteria associated with Norway spruce tree tissues. At the same time, the health status and terpenoid content of host trees had a limited effect on the composition of bacterial communities in our survey.  aPublisher supplied data  a276862cAcademy of Finland  a278424cAcademy of Finland  a165010015cJiangsu Specially-Appointed Professor, China 3aActinobacteria 3aPicea abies 3aProteobacteria 3aabiotic stress 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abark 3adecayed wood 3aenvironmental factors 3ahealth status 3amicrobiome 3amonoterpenoids 3aphloem 3aplant pathogens 3asesquiterpenoids 3asurveys 3asymbionts 3atrees 3axylem1 aKovalchuk, Andriy1 aMukrimin, Mukrimin1 aLiu, Mengxia1 aZeng, Zhen1 aGhimire, Rajendra P.1 aKivimäenpää, Minna1 aHolopainen, Jarmo K.1 aSun, Hui1 aAsiegbu, Fred O.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2019 Apr., v. 77, no. 3 p.640-650dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-018-1240-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245013900166300002000305520186800325592002802193650001102221650001102232650002202243650001802265650002502283650001602308650002302324650002802347650002102375650001802396650002202414650001402436650001802450650001402468650001102482650001702493650001302510650001702523653002002540653001802560653002002578653001502598653003502613653002202648700001802670700001702688700003102705700002002736700002202756700001202778700001902790773012602809856008002935852000903015655001203024IND60534669520221121220606.0160803e20160803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053466952DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b055922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhaway, Sarang M.10aHierarchical Electrospun and Cooperatively Assembled Nanoporous Ni/NiO/MnOx/Carbon Nanofiber Composites for Lithium Ion Battery Anodes  ap. 19484-19493.  aA facile method to fabricate hierarchically structured fiber composites is described based on the electrospinning of a dope containing nickel and manganese nitrate salts, citric acid, phenolic resin, and an amphiphilic block copolymer. Carbonization of these fiber mats at 800 °C generates metallic Ni-encapsulated NiO/MnOₓ/carbon composite fibers with average BET surface area (150 m²/g) almost 3 times higher than those reported for nonporous metal oxide nanofibers. The average diameter (∼900 nm) of these fiber composites is nearly invariant of chemical composition and can be easily tuned by the dope concentration and electrospinning conditions. The metallic Ni nanoparticle encapsulation of NiO/MnOₓ/C fibers leads to enhanced electrical conductivity of the fibers, while the block copolymers template an internal nanoporous morphology and the carbon in these composite fibers helps to accommodate volumetric changes during charging. These attributes can lead to lithium ion battery anodes with decent rate performance and long-term cycle stability, but performance strongly depends on the composition of the composite fibers. The composite fibers produced from a dope where the metal nitrate is 66% Ni generates the anode that exhibits the highest reversible specific capacity at high rate for any composition, even when including the mass of the nonactive carbon and Ni⁰ in the calculation of the capacity. On the basis of the active oxides alone, near-theoretical capacity and excellent cycling stability are achieved for this composition. These cooperatively assembled hierarchical composites provide a platform for fundamentally assessing compositional dependencies for electrochemical performance. Moreover, this electrospinning strategy is readily scalable for the fabrication of a wide variety of nanoporous transition metal oxide fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3acarbonization 3achemical composition 3acitric acid 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aencapsulation 3alithium batteries 3amanganese 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3anitrates 3asurface area 0ablock copolymer 0aself-assembly 0aelectrospinning 0ananofibers 0aelectrochemical energy storage 0aordered mesopores1 aChen, Yu-Ming1 aGuo, Yuanhao1 aTangvijitsakul, Pattarasai1 aSoucek, Mark D.1 aCakmak, Mukerrem,1 aZhu, Yu1 aVogt, Bryan D.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Aug. 03, v. 8, no. 30 p.19484-19493dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b055923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012800164300001600292520179000308592002802098650000802126650001802134650001202152650001702164650001202181650001602193650001302209650001602222650001002238650002402248650001702272650001302289650001102302650002602313651001002339653002402349653002202373653002302395653002302418653001002441653001002451700001202461700001902473700001802492700001202510700001302522700005802535700001302593700001702606700001902623700001702642700001602659700001302675773010702688856008502795852000902880655001202889IND60582839120221118053632.0180911e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058283912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.08.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Ye10aHousehold air pollution and personal inhalation exposure to particles (TSP/PM2.5/PM1.0/PM0.25) in rural Shanxi, North China  ap. 635-643.  aPersonal exposure to size-segregated particles among rural residents in Shanxi, China in summer, 2011 were investigated using portable carried samplers (N = 84). Household air pollution was simultaneously studied using stationary samplers in nine homes. Information on household fuel types, cooking activity, smoking behavior, kitchen ventilation conditions etc., were also collected and discussed. The study found that even in the summer period, the daily average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM1.0 in the kitchen were as high as 376 ± 573 and 288 ± 397 μg/m³ (N = 6), that were nearly 3 times of 114 ± 81 and 97 ± 77 μg/m³ in the bedroom (N = 8), and significantly higher than those of 64 ± 28 and 47 ± 21 μg/m³ in the outdoor air (N = 6). The personal daily exposure to PM2.5 and PM1.0 were 98 ± 52 and 77 ± 47 μg/m³, respectively, that were lower than the concentrations in the kitchen but higher than the outdoor levels. The mass fractions of PM2.5 in TSP were 90%, 72%, 65% and 68% on average in the kitchen, bedroom, outdoor air and personal inhalation exposure, respectively, and moreover, a majority of particles in PM2.5 had diameters less than 1.0 μm. Calculated time-weighted average exposure based on indoor and outdoor air concentrations and time spent indoor and outdoor were positively correlated but, was ∼33% lower than the directly measured exposure. The daily exposure among those burning traditional solid fuels could be lower by ∼41% if the kitchen was equipped with an outdoor chimney, but was still 8–14% higher than those household using cleaning energies, like electricity and gas. With a ventilator in the kitchen, the exposure among the population using clean energies could be further reduced by 10–24%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aburning 3aclean energy 3acooking 3acorrelation 3adiameter 3aelectricity 3afuels 3ainhalation exposure 3aparticulates 3asamplers 3asummer 3atime-weighted average 3aChina 0aInhalation exposure 0aSize distribution 0aInfluencing factor 0aHousehold energies 0aPM2.5 0aPM1.01 aDu, Wei1 aChen, Yuanchen1 aShen, Guofeng1 aSu, Shu1 aLin, Nan1 aShen, Huizhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1335-84771 aZhu, Dan1 aYuan, Chenyi1 aDuan, Yonghong1 aLiu, Junfeng1 aLi, Bengang1 aTao, Shu0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Dec., v. 231 p.635-643dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.08.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010200169300001600271520107400287592002801361650000901389650001001398650000901408650001801417650001901435650001601454651001201470653001801482653001601500653002801516653002601544653001201570700001901582700002601601700001901627700001901646773010401665856008701769852000901856655001201865IND60552605520221121020234.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasso, Anja10aSecular trend of earlier onset and decelerated development of third molars: Evidence from Croatia  ap. 202-206.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the secular trend on development of third molars in 30 years period in Littoral region of Croatia.A total of 1103 panoramic radiographs of subjects aged from 6 to 18 years were analysed. First group comprised 531 panoramic radiographs (258 girls) taken from year period 1977 till 1979 and second group 572 radiographs (325 girls) taken from year period 2007 till 2009. Demirjian's method was used to determine the developmental stage of third molars.A secular trend in 30 years period was observed as earlier onset of third molars development in boys (6 months on average maxillary and 11 months mandibular) and girls (6 months for maxillary and 4 months for mandibular). Now-a-days, an increase in mineralisation for one Demirjian stage occurs at a slower pace of 5.2 months in boys and 3.4 in girls in maxilla and 2.3 or 2 months in mandible for boys and girls, respectively. The study showed a secular trend present as earlier onset but decelerated development of third molars in both genders and both jaws.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboys 3agirls 3ajaws 3alittoral zone 3amineralization 3aradiography 3aCroatia 0aSecular trend 0aThird molar 0aMineralisation of teeth 0aPanoramic radiography 0aCroatia1 aLegovic, Mario1 aMady Maricic, Barbara1 aPavlic, Andrej1 aSpalj, Stjepan0 tForensic science international.g2015 Apr., v. 249 p.202-206dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245011200167300001400279506002800293520122700321592002801548506003701576650002501613650001401638650003401652650001701686650001301703650001501716650001801731650001401749650001801763653002401781653001801805700001801823700001801841773015501859856008002014852000902094655001202103IND60784752320221207105944.0181013e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078475232DNAL7 a10.24845/ijfac.v3.i3.892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUtama, Jaya Putra10aEffect of DC Voltage on Prototype of Biodiesel Electrostatic Separator with Glycerin from Waste Cooking Oil  ap. 89-93.  aResource is Open Access  aThe limitations of fossil fuel support on fulfillment of energy need in a sustainable and environment friendly fashion has drove society to efforts of finding and developing fresh and renewably resources. Biodiesel is one the renewable energy resource and shows environment friendly property, consist of alkyl of fatty acids monoester originated from vegetable oil or animal fat. One of important steps in biodiesel production is separation of glycerin from product. Electrostatic method has been proved in accelerating saturation of glycerin. However, several aspects still need a careful assessment to acquire biodiesel production process with standard quality assigned. In this work, we designed an electrostatic separator of biodiesel from glycerin using waste cooking oil feed. The prototype was tested in several different voltages 12 Vdc, 20 Vdc, 30 Vdc and 33.5 Vdc. The result shows the highest voltage obtained is 33.5 Vdc, separation time 2 minutes 10 seconds having viscosity, water content and density i.e. 7.2139 cSt, 0.0321% and 0.85 g/mL respectively whereas flash point increase to 1917 C.

Fumaric acid is a very effective lactic acid bacteria inhibitor that is widely used in the food industry as an additive (E297). Using it to inhibit malolactic fermentation has recently been authorized by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV). However, the official analytical method for fumaric acid involves the classical HPLC method for organic acids, which is overly complicated for use in wineries. This research proposes a very simple and efficient enzymatic method that allows the simultaneous determination of L-malic acid and fumaric acid. The method uses a commercial enzymatic kit for L-malic acid and adds a supplementary step in which the fumarase enzyme is added to transform fumaric acid into L-malic acid. The results obtained show that this method could be used in different media (synthetic solution, white wine, red wine and white grape juice). This article also proposes a modification of the enzymatic method to be applied when the L-malic acid concentration of the sample is very high.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenzymatic treatment 3afumarate hydratase 3afumaric acid 3agrape juice 3ainternational organizations 3amalic acid 3amalolactic fermentation 3ared wines 3avines 3awhite wines 0aL-malic acid 0aenzymatic method1 aRozès, Nicolas1 aCanals, Joan Miquel1 aBordons, Albert1 aReguant, Cristina1 aZamora, Fernando0 tOENO One.g2021, v. 55, no. 3dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2021.55.3.48253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01399naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010100166300001400267500001400281520038800295592002800683650001200711650002100723651001000744653001000754653001500764653002000779653001600799653001300815700001400828700002200842773009400864856008200958852000901040655001201049IND60707146520221120205413.0210117e20200806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070714652DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.956.477842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Zhi-Min10aTwo new genera with species of the tribe Sarimini (Hemiptera, Fulgoromorpha, Issidae) from China  ap. 31-47.  aNAL-light  aTempsarima Chang & Chen, gen. nov.

The suspected Chryseobacterium spp. were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing and comparing the sequenced DNA with those on GenBank using the BLAST tool on GenBank, underlining its occurrence in raw cow milk samples with an incidence of 1.3%. The isolated strains showed the highest similarity with Chryseobacterium jip 108/83 (100%). According to obtained data and our knowledge, it is the first time to isolate Chryseobacterium spp. from raw milk in Egypt. The isolated strains were registered on the GenBank with the proposed names Chryseobacterium Egyam strain AM1 (Accession No. MK059947) and Chryseobacterium Egyam strain AM2 (Accession No. MK059948). A constructed phylogenetic tree by using the neighbour-joining method was applied to detect the exact taxonomic position of the obtained strains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChryseobacterium 3aDomiati cheese 3abutter 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3araw milk 3aEgypt 0achryseobacterium spp. 0amilk 0a16s rrna1 aEl-Malt, Laila M.1 aHameed, Karima G.

To reveal the origin of these pitcher plant mosquitoes, we attempted a molecular phylogenetic analysis with 11 Stegomyia species by using sequence data from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and 16SrRNA genes as well as the nuclear 28SrRNA gene. Ae. dybasi, a pitcher plant specialist, was sister to Aedes palauensis Bohart within the scutellaris group from the same islands. Ae. maehleri, an opportunistic pitcher plant mosquito, was in a distinct lineage related to the scutellaris group. The adaptation to pitcher plants could have occurred independently in these two species, and recent differentiation of the pitcher plant mosquito Ae. dybasi from the nonpitcher plant mosquito Ae. palauensis was suggested by a relatively small sequence divergence between these species. We also discuss the implications of this analysis for the phylogeny of some other Stegomyia species. 3aNepenthes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aribosomal DNA 3aphylogeny 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aaquatic habitat 3asequence homology 3aAedes 2aAedesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMagnoliopsida. 2aAnimals 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxchemistry 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistry 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxgenetics 2aGenetic Speciation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 28Sxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 0asequence analysis 0aAedes dybasi 0aAedes maehleri 0amolecular phylogeny1 aMogi, M.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2006 Sept., v. 43, no. 5 p.795-800dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585(2006)43[795:OOPPMI]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071010b20071102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/10/10  aOther US 7aarticle02579naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013000159500001900289520147700308592002801785650001201813650001101825650001601836650002201852650001401874650001801888650001201906650001501918650001501933651001101948700002501959700003101984773012002015856007302135852000902208655001202217IND60711912220221116142219.0200928e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071191222DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKay, Jessica 10aCharacterization of Flowpath Using Geochemistry and 87Sr/86Sr Isotope Ratios in the Yalahau Region, Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Yalahau region, located in the northeastern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula, hosts a series of elongated depressions trending north/south in the direction of Isla Holbox, identified as the Holbox Fracture Zone. Previous studies have explored the geomorphology and various hydrologic characteristics of the Yucatán Peninsula; however, there is a paucity of data concerning the interior region where the fractures are located. Strontium isotope ratios and major ion geochemistry data of the surface water and groundwater of this region serve as a hydrogeochemical fingerprint, aiding in constraining the hydrological boundaries, determining flow paths, and characterizing hydrogeochemical processes that impact the composition of the groundwater within the region. ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr isotope ratios indicate a different signature than the surrounding bedrock Sr ratio, suggesting that the flow throughout the Yalahau region is moving through channels faster than that of much of the Yucatán. Through major ion geochemistry and ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr isotope ratios, we were able to delineate at least two flow paths within the Yalahau region and identify a point of saline intrusion at least 35 km from the coast. Gaining an understanding of the hydrogeochemistry and water flow regions is crucial in determining the impact of various activities (e.g., extensive tourism, drinking water withdrawal, wastewater discharge/injection) that occur within the Yucatán Peninsula.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3acoasts 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeochemistry 3astrontium 3asurface water 3atourism 3awastewater 3awater flow 3aMexico1 aLenczewski, Melissa 1 aLeal-Bautista, Rosa  Maria0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01437naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002000141245011600161300001600277520053800293592002800831650001800859650002100877650002100898650001000919650001600929700002000945700002200965773009500987856004401082852000901126655001201135IND4479885520221116193840.0120727e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447988552DNAL7 a10.1007/s0028400101992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Satoshi10aEnhanced Tolerance Against Salt-Stress and Freezing-Stress of Escherichia coli Cells Expressing Algal bbc1 Gene  ap. 173-177.  aThe expression of the eukaryotic bbc1 (breast basic conserved) gene (the bbc1 gene of the marine green alga Chlamydomonas sp.

Previous studies generally focused on the ecosystem scale or only on C, N, P in the humus layer. Our objectives in this study are to establish these budgets for principal elements, considering dust inputs and, for the first time, particulate outputs. To achieve these objectives, the inputs and outputs of the elements in litterfall, particulates (dust inputs and particulates in the outgoing solution) and solution were quantified in mulls in two contrasting soils in beech ecosystems monitored for 7 years. The concentrations of the elements in the particulate outputs were 3 or 16 times higher than those in dust, because some particles were produced in the humus. The input/output budgets were balanced for K, Na and S in both soils and for P, Si and Mg in one soil. These elements were transported in the humus mainly as a solution or as a soluble form in plant tissues. For Ca and Mn in both soils and for P, Si and Mg in one soil, the elements found in biominerals, the inputs were higher than the outputs, indicating that other outputs were not taken into account in this balance, such as biomineral sedimentation or uptake by fungi. These results show the importance of the humus particles in element cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3adust 3aforests 3ahumus 3aparticulates 3aplant litter1 aCalvaruso, Christophe1 aTurpault, Marie-Pierre0 tBiogeochemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 151, no. 1 p.1-14dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-020-00702-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008200170300001200252520166700264592002801931596002501959650001301984650001201997650003502009650001602044650001202060650001102072650001802083650001202101650002102113650002302134650000902157650001402166650001002180650001402190650001102204650001502215650000902230650001302239650002202252650002402274650001202298650001102310650000802321650001302329651001102342700001602353700001402369700002702383700002102410700001802431700002402449700002402473700006102497773012002558856008102678852000902759655001202768IND60654675820221118030633.0190726e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065467582DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-018-1581-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkalny, Anatoly V.10aHair Trace Element Levels in Han and Indigenous Hualien Inhabitants in Taiwan  ap. 1-9.  aThe objective of the present study was to assess the impact of ethnicity on hair trace element content in Han and aboriginal inhabitants of Hualien in Taiwan. Fifty Han (female/male = 35/15) and 50 aboriginal (female/male = 40/10) Hualien inhabitants aged 40–60 years were involved in the present study. Anthropometric data and dietary patterns were recorded. Hair mineral, essential, and toxic trace element levels were assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at NexION 300D (PerkinElmer Inc., USA) equipped with ESI SC-2 DX4 autosampler (Elemental Scientific Inc., USA). No group difference in gender, age, body weight, height, or physical activity was observed. Fish intake was more frequent in Han inhabitants, whereas aborigines consumed significantly more nuts. Indigenous people were characterized by higher hair Al (45%), Ca (threefold), Co (71%), Fe (twofold), I (74%), K (60%), Mg (2.5-fold), Na (62%), P (6%), Sn (78%), and V (46%) content. In turn, Han Hualien inhabitants had higher hair Be (twofold), Li, Se, Si levels as compared to indigenous counterparts. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that ethnicity was significantly associated with hair Ca (β = 0.302), Mn (β = 0.284), P (β = 0.387), and Se (β = − 0.310) levels after adjustment for other confounders. At the same time, the overall models were significant for Ca, Mn, Se, and As.

Glycine supplementation is reported to reduce inflammatory responses in experimental colitis. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects remain unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: Female C57BL/6 mice are orally administered with glycine (3.5 or 5.2 g kg‐¹ body weight) for 14 continuous days. On day 8 post‐glycine supplementation, the mice are orally inoculated with 2 × 10⁹ CFU Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium). The results show that glycine alleviates C. rodentium‐induced body weight loss, increased disease activity index and spleen weight, colon length shortening, and colonic hyperplasia. Glycine suppresses the activation and infiltration of inflammatory cells, and secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissues. The apoptosis of colon epithelial cells is also abrogated by glycine, which is associated with the inactivation of activating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α)‐C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) signaling. In addition, glycine administration increases α diversity, restores β diversity, and abolishes the reduction in Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Turicibacter, and Alloprevotella in the colon. CONCLUSIONS: Glycine supplementation is a nutritional strategy that may ameliorate C. rodentium‐induced colitis by regulating ATF6α‐CHOP‐mediated ER stress and enhancing the abundance of Lactobacillus.  aPublisher supplied data  a31625025cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31272451cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31572412cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aBifidobacterium 3aCitrobacter rodentium 3aLactobacillus 3aapoptosis 3abody weight changes 3acolitis 3acolon 3acytokines 3adysbiosis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3aepithelium 3afemales 3afood research 3ahyperplasia 3aintestinal microorganisms 3anutrition 3asecretion 3aspleen 3atranscription factors1 aJiang, Da1 aJin, Yuhang1 aJia, Hai1 aYang, Ying1 aKim, In-ho,1 aDai, Zhaolai1 aZhang, Jinhua1 aRen, Fazheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6250-07541 aWu, Zhenlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9700-88740 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2021 Aug., v. 65, no. 15 p.e2001065-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2020010653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245011800160520140500278592002801683650002001711650001501731650001901746650001401765650001601779650001901795650001401814650002701828650002501855651001001880700001901890700001801909700001701927773012001944856008002064852000902144655001202153IND60784091520221120101708.0220726e20220714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078409152DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130706282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Qidi 10aPhylogeny and Integrative Taxonomy of the Genera Gymnaetoides and Pseudotachycines (Orthoptera: Rhaphidophoridae)  aThe genera Gymnaetoides and Pseudotachycines are endemic to China and are morphologically homogeneous. The few available diagnostic characters make species identification particularly challenging. Species cannot be classified according to the given generic diagnosis, and phylogenetic analyses have not been reported. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood and employ four approaches to delimit species. The results suggest that both Gymnaetoides and Pseudotachycines are paraphyletic. Therefore, we revise their taxonomy based on the combination of morphological characters and molecular data. A new genus Homotachycines Zhu & Shi gen. nov. is erected, and six new combinations are proposed. Species delimitation identifies 15 new species and one new subspecies: Gymnaetoides huangshanensis, G. petalus, G. yangmingensis, G. lushanensis, Pseudotachycines procerus, P. procerus guizhouensis, P. zhengi, P. nephrus, P. sagittus, P. fengyangshanensis, Homotachycines triangulus, H. quadratus, H. baokangensis, H. fusus, H. concavus, and H. qinlingensis sp. nov. Moreover, we find that the shapes of the dorsal lateral lobes and the dorsal median lobe of the male genitalia are also important characters for identifying these genera and that the shapes of the dorsal and lateral sclerites of the male genitalia are suitable for the classifications of species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aOrthoptera 3amale genitalia 3anew genus 3anew species 3anew subspecies 3aparaphyly 3aspecies identification 3astatistical analysis 3aChina1 aWang, Haijian 1 aZhou, Zhijun 1 aShi, Fuming 0 tInsects.g2022 July 14, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130706283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245008900201300001000290520169500300592002801995650002202023650001102045650002702056650001602083650001602099650001702115650001802132650001502150650001802165650001102183650001502194650001402209650001202223650001102235650001702246651001302263700001702276773012702293856008102420852000902501655001202510IND60633790620221119001909.0191230e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063379062DNAL7 a10.1186/s40100-019-0124-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSani, Seid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3667-238910aAnalysis of households food insecurity and its coping mechanisms in Western Ethiopia  ap. 5.  aThis study analyzed households’ food insecurity and its determinants along with the coping mechanisms opted against food insecurity and shortage in Assosa zone, western Ethiopia. The study used a primary data collected from 276 randomly selected households for 7 consecutive days from each sample using weighed records method. In addition, focus group discussions and key informants interview were also used. This study employed descriptive statistics, food insecurity index and Tobit model to analyze the data. The finding of the study revealed that, in the study area, the incidence of food insecurity was 53.62%, with the depth and severity of food insecurity being 16.84% and 7.32%, respectively. The study finding also pointed out that the mean kilocalorie intake of food insecure households was 1440.37kcal/AE/day, with the minimum and maximum being 597.65 kcal and 2048.13 kcal, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated Tobit model result revealed that age of the household head, family size and off-farm and non-farm income positively affected extent of households food insecurity; whereas access to irrigation, farm income, distance to market and access to credit negatively affected the extent of households’ food insecurity. Moreover, the study also identified that reducing meal size, reducing frequency of meal served, working as a daily laborer and selling livestock’s were the top four main coping mechanisms opted against food insecurity and/or shortage. Therefore, to reverse the incidence, future interventions should focus on the aforementioned factors to build the capacity of households through enhancing their access to human, financial and physical capital.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoping strategies 3acredit 3adescriptive statistics 3afamily size 3afarm income 3afocus groups 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3ahuman capital 3ahumans 3airrigation 3alivestock 3amarkets 3amodels 3aportion size 3aEthiopia1 aKemaw, Biruk0 tAgricultural and food economics.g2019 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.5-5dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:21601x2193-75327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40100-019-0124-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01485naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011600165300001600281520044500297592002800742650002200770650001800792650002400810650001000834650001100844650001400855650001200869650002200881700002200903700001900925700002000944773011400964856004801078852000901126655001201135IND50066326920221118084022.0130511e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006632692DNAL7 a10.1134/S106236041303003X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuluev, B.

The inclusion of fresh fruits and vegetables rich in (poly)phenols has been encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of the daily choices to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction and ease the socio‐economic burden of diabetes. Research in Food, Nutrition, and Cell Metabolism areas is revealing that the health benefits of (poly)phenol‐rich foods go beyond their antioxidant properties and are in fact key modulators of redox and glycaemia status, and inflammatory response contributing to improved endothelial function and vascular health in diabetes. Other beneficial aspects include appetite modulation, regulation of hydrolytic enzymes involved in sugar and lipid metabolism, and mediation of cell–cell aggregation events. This work overviews the current knowledge on the biological properties of ingested (poly)phenols in cultured endothelial cells with emphasis on the circulating (poly)phenols, providing support to (poly)phenol‐rich diets as alternatives to drug‐based therapies in the prevention, treatment, and management of diabetes. A critical evaluation on the caveats and challenges involve in current experimental cell‐based designs and approaches adopted is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aantioxidants 3aappetite 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes mellitus 3afood research 3ainflammation 3alipid metabolism 3aready-to-eat foods 3asocioeconomics 3asugars1 aOskolkova, Olga1 ade Freitas, Victor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0586-22781 aReis, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4537-99020 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2021 Aug., v. 65, no. 15 p.e2001130-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2020011303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008600206300001400292500001900306520156500325592002801890596004501918650001201963650002001975650001101995650001302006650001902019651002302038700002702061700002602088700002402114700002502138700002002163700002502183700001802208773012502226856008202351852000902433655001202442IND60715748420221119161442.0201103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071574842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-020-00706-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErler, Dirk V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1242-731110aCan coral skeletal-bound nitrogen isotopes be used as a proxy for past bleaching?  ap. 31-41.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is currently no reliable geochemical proxy of historical coral bleaching. Here we test the hypothesis that increases in the nitrogen isotopic signature of coral tissue, which is recorded in skeletal-bound organic material (CS-δ¹⁵N), can be used to detect coral bleaching events in the past. We measured CS-δ¹⁵N in coral colonies that showed high density thermal stress bands associated with the 1998 and 2002 mass bleaching events on the central Great Barrier Reef. Analysis of coral cores from 2 inshore and 1 mid-shelf reef found that increases in CS-δ¹⁵N occurred either side of the thermal stress events and were therefore unlikely to be a physiological response to bleaching. We then assessed whether CS-δ¹⁵N could be used to detect shelf-wide upwelling, which has been previously shown to coincide with mass bleaching events. For the inshore sites the response of CS-δ¹⁵N to upwelling was not uniform between reefs or between colonies from the same reef. However, on the mid-shelf reef, increased CS-δ¹⁵N during the known upwelling of 1998 was more consistent between cores. Analysis of a 23-year old coral core from the mid-shelf reef showed increased CS-δ¹⁵N between 1983–1985 and 1997–2000, periods where strong El Niño events were proceeded by intense wind-driven upwelling. We conclude that coral CS-δ¹⁵N is not a direct proxy for coral bleaching but can be used to detect prolonged and pervasive upwelling that coincides with mass bleaching events. Further validation with longer core records is required.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP170100734cAustralian Research Council 3aEl Nino 3abiogeochemistry 3acorals 3anitrogen 3athermal stress 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aRangel, María Salomé1 aTagliafico, Alejandro1 aRiekenberg, Jessica1 aFarid, Hanieh Tohidi1 aChristidis, Les1 aScheffers, Sander R.1 aLough, J.

K.10aCrystal Structure of a Retroviral Polyprotein: Prototype Foamy Virus Protease-Reverse Transcriptase (PR-RT)  aIn most cases, proteolytic processing of the retroviral Pol portion of the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor produces protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase (IN). However, foamy viruses (FVs) express Pol separately from Gag and, when Pol is processed, only the IN domain is released. Here, we report a 2.9 Å resolution crystal structure of the mature PR-RT from prototype FV (PFV) that can carry out both proteolytic processing and reverse transcription but is in a configuration not competent for proteolytic or polymerase activity. PFV PR-RT is monomeric and the architecture of PFV PR is similar to one of the subunits of HIV-1 PR, which is a dimer. There is a C-terminal extension of PFV PR (101-145) that consists of two helices which are adjacent to the base of the RT palm subdomain, and anchors PR to RT. The polymerase domain of PFV RT consists of fingers, palm, thumb, and connection subdomains whose spatial arrangements are similar to the p51 subunit of HIV-1 RT. The RNase H and polymerase domains of PFV RT are connected by flexible linkers. Significant spatial and conformational (sub)domain rearrangements are therefore required for nucleic acid binding. The structure of PFV PR-RT provides insights into the conformational maturation of retroviral Pol polyproteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3acrystal structure 3aintegrases 3anucleic acids 3apolyproteins 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3aprototypes 3areverse transcription 3aribonucleases 3aviruses1 aTuske, Steve 1 aDas, Kalyan 1 aRuiz, Francesc X.1 aBauman, Joseph D.1 aBoyer, Paul L.1 aDeStefano, Jeffrey J.1 aHughes, Stephen H.1 aArnold, Eddy 0 tViruses.g2021 July 29, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130814953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245030500175300001600480520170600496592002802202596007102230596009002301650002102391650001202412650001502424650002402439650001302463650001202476650003502488650001202523650001302535650001102548650001802559650001702577650000902594650001202603650002402615650001102639650003302650650002002683650002002703650001502723650000902738651001302747700002802760700001302788700005302801773012402854856008102978852000903059655001203068IND60654676120221118030612.0190726e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065467612DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-018-1588-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTadesse, Ababo Workineh10aDetermination of Heavy Metal Concentrations and Their Potential Sources in Selected Plants: Xanthium strumarium L.

A total of 57 samples were analyzed from four different plant species. Microwave-assisted digestion was applied to digest the samples and the concentration of nine elements namely: Al, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP- MS) (Thermos X SERIES2). The obtained data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS IBM version 20). The recorded mean concentration of heavy metals in the plants were 1.934, 0.023, 0.023, 0.045, 0.129, ND, 0.025, ND, and 0.009 mg/kg in Xanthium strumarium L.(Asteraceae); 0.834, 0.036, 0.024, 0.021, 0.090, ND, 0.002, 0.001, and 0.006 mg/kg in Ficus exasperata Vahl (Moraceae); 1.603, 0.018, 0.019, 0.025, 0.133, 0.005, 0.006, 0.002, and 0.012 mg/kg in Persicaria attenuata (R.Br) Sojak (Polygonaceae); and 0.557, 0.010, 0.010, 0.024, 0.098, ND, 0.012, 0.020, and 0.004 mg/kg in Kanahia laniflora (Forssk.) R.Br. (Asclepiadaceae) for Al, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb, respectively. Pearson’s correlation analysis indicated that there was a strong positive correlation between Al–Ni (r = 0.927**⁾ and Zn–Cu (r = 0.764**⁾ at α = 0.01 significant level. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the sources of heavy metals in the plants were associated with anthropogenic factors. The mean concentrations of all elements except Cd in Xanthium strumarium L. (Asteraceae) and Pb in Ficus exasperata Vahl (Moraceae) were below the permissible limit of FAO/WHO (2001 /2005).  aPublisher supplied data  aY329671K01cHundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  aY623321K01cProject of Sino-Africa Joint Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aFicus exasperata 3aKanahia 3aPersicaria 3aXanthium strumarium 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adata analysis 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3amicrowave treatment 3anickel 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk assessment 3asocial sciences 3awatersheds 3azinc 3aEthiopia1 aGereslassie, Tekleweini1 aYan, Xue1 aWang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7574-94680 tBiological trace element research.g2019 Sept., v. 191, no. 1 p.231-242dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-018-1588-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013500160300001400295500001900309520162100328592002801949596005901977596005902036596005902095596008402154596007302238650001402311650001302325650002202338650002002360650003302380650001402413650001202427650001502439650001802454650002102472650001802493650002102511650001402532650001502546650001102561650001402572650001302586651001002599700005802609700001602667700001702683700001902700773012502719856008202844852000902926655001202935IND60715748520221119161610.0201103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071574852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-020-00712-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Dan10aHydrodynamic impacts on tidal-scale dissolved inorganic nitrogen cycling and export across the estuarine turbidity maxima to coast  ap. 81-98.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEstuarine turbidity maxima (ETM) is a transition zone subject to the influence of river flow and tides. Here we showed the distinct impacts of fluvial and tidal hydrodynamics on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) cycling and export across the ETM to coast. We conducted tidal-scale hourly measurements at the ETM zone of the Jiulong River Estuary in Southeast China in May and December 2015. Generally, ammonium-N (NH₄-N) and nitrate-N (NO₃-N) increased in ebb tides, primarily controlled by freshwater input. In contrast, nitrite-N (NO₂-N) increased in flood tides, largely due to the horizontal advection of NO₂-N rich water from the middle estuary (5–10 PSU). During the fresh–saline water mixing period with high suspended particulate matters (SPM), the stronger tides and smaller river discharge in December increased SPM and NO₂-N in the ETM, indicating stronger ammonium oxidation in the water column. During the low tide period when freshwater dominated and particles were deposited, the increase of NH₄-N in the water column was related to the external source supply (e.g., wetland effluent), while the decline of NO₃-N and NO₂-N was likely associated with denitrification occurring in anoxic fluid muds and sediments. The larger DIN flux was found in May with larger river discharge, weaker tides and longer duration of the freshwater dominated period than December. This study highlights the combined effects of river and tides on hydrodynamics, which largely determine the major N sources, processes (e.g., nitrification and denitrification) and DIN fluxes across the ETM to coast.  aPublisher supplied data  a41676098cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41476004cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41706039cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018R007cFujian Environmental Protection Science and Technology Project (2018)  a20720180119cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aadvection 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3adenitrification 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3aestuaries 3aexports 3afreshwater 3ahydrodynamics 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrification 3anitrite nitrogen 3aoxidation 3ariver flow 3arivers 3aturbidity 3awetlands 3aChina1 aChen, Nengwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5200-10351 aCheng, Peng1 aYu, Fengling1 aHong, Huasheng0 tBiogeochemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 151, no. 1 p.81-98dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-020-00712-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04204naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245012000203300001600323500002000339520236800359592002802727596004202755596006202797596004902859596001702908650001902925650001902944650001502963650002002978650002402998650001703022650002303039650001603062650001203078650001303090650001203103650001703115650001503132650002103147650001103168650002003179651001103199700006003210700006103270700005803331700007003389773012603459856008003585852000903665655001203674IND60761979920221123003315.0220106e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076197992DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.140512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrimmer, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0744-606X10aFlower fields and pesticide use interactively shape pollen beetle infestation and parasitism in oilseed rape fields  ap. 263-273.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPollen beetles (Brassicogethes spp.) are the main pests of oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus) in Europe and responsible for massive yield losses. Upcoming pesticide resistances highlight the need for other means of crop protection, such as natural pest control. Sown flower fields aim to counteract the decrease of insect biodiversity in agricultural landscapes by providing resources to ecosystem service providers. However, the optimal age and size of flower fields to increase natural pest control is still unclear. We conducted experiments on 31 OSR fields located along a gradient of landscape‐scale semi‐natural habitat (SNH). OSR fields were located adjacent to flower fields which differed in age, continuity and size, or adjacent to crop fields or calcareous grasslands. Pesticide‐free areas were established to examine interactive effects of pesticide use and flower field characteristics. The abundance of pollen beetle adults and larvae, parasitism and superparasitism rates in OSR were recorded at increasing distances to the adjacent sites. Flower fields and calcareous grasslands increased pollen beetle parasitism when compared to OSR fields neighbouring crop fields. The threshold for effective natural pest control of 35% could be reached in the pesticide‐free areas of OSR fields adjacent to calcareous grasslands and flower fields maintained continuously for at least 6 years. In pesticide‐sprayed areas, pollen beetle parasitism and superparasitism declined with increasing distance to the adjacent field. Furthermore, flower fields larger than 1.5 ha were able to improve pollen beetle parasitism more than smaller fields. Synthesis and applications. To promote natural pest control in oilseed rape (OSR), large flower fields should be maintained for several years, to create stable habitats for natural enemies. The continuous maintenance of flower fields should be preferred, as ploughing and resowing after 5–6 years decreased the positive effects of the flower fields on natural pest control in adjacent OSR fields. However, pesticide use can abrogate positive effects of flower fields on pollen beetle parasitism. This study highlights that sown flower fields have the potential to increase natural pest control in OSR, but this potential is depending on its age, continuity and size and can be hindered by pesticide use.  aPublisher supplied data  aPCIN‐2014–048cBiodiversa‐FACCE  cOpen Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL  cJULIUS‐MAXIMILIANS‐UNIVERSITAET WURZBURG  cProjekt DEAL 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassicogethes 3aMeligethes 3aapplied ecology 3abeetle infestations 3abiodiversity 3aecosystem services 3aflower size 3aflowers 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3apest control 3apesticides 3aplant protection 3apollen 3asuperparasitism 3aEurope1 aMartin, Emily A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5785-91051 aHolzschuh, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5235-47461 aKrauss, Jochen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2304-91171 aSteffan‐Dewenter, Ingolf1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1359-39440 tJournal of applied ecology.g2022 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.263-273dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.140513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002400192245002600216506007600242520104300318592002801361506003701389650001601426650001001442650002301452650002501475650001001500650001701510650001801527650001301545650001401558653001601572653002901588653001201617653001701629700002301646700002301669773012001692856008501812852000901897655001201906IND60690193220221207120437.0200426e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069019322DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2016.11550172doi7 aPMC48839012pmcid7 a269104822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCvrčková, Fatima,10aOn growth and formins  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDevelopment of the plant aerial organs epidermis involves a complex interplay of cytoskeletal rearrangements, membrane trafficking-dependent cell surface expansion, and intra- and intercellular signaling, resulting in a pattern of perfectly interlocking pavement cells. While recent detailed in vivo observations convincingly identify microtubules rather than actin as key players at the early stages of development of pavement cell lobes in Arabidopsis, mutations affecting the actin-nucleating ARP2/3 complex are long known to reduce pavement cell lobing, suggesting a central role for actin. We have now shown that functional impairment of the Arabidopsis formin FH1 enhances both microtubule dynamics and pavement cell lobing. While formins are best known for their ability to nucleate actin, many members of this old gene family now emerge as direct or indirect regulators of the microtubule cytoskeleton, and our findings suggest that they might co-ordinate action of the two cytoskeletal systems during pavement cell morphogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aactin 3acell communication 3adevelopmental stages 3agenes 3amicrotubules 3amorphogenesis 3amutation 3apavements 0acell growth 0aepidermal pavement cells 0aformins 0aFH2 proteins1 aOulehlová, Denisa1 aŽárský, Viktor,0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 11, no. 3 p.e1155017-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2016.11550173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245008700203300001800290500001500308506007600323520142400399592002801823506003701851650001201888650001101900650001401911650001501925650002201940650001201962650001701974653001801991700002202009700001502031773009202046856008202138852000902220655001202229IND4487072620221207065803.0120502e20111107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448707262DNAL7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.02412doi7 aPMC31690282pmcid7 a214299242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcInnes, Lynsey10aDetecting shifts in diversity limits from molecular phylogenies: what can we know?  ap. 3294-3302.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLarge complete species-level molecular phylogenies can provide the most direct information about the macroevolutionary history of clades having poor fossil records. However, extinction will ultimately erode evidence of pulses of rapid speciation in the deep past. Assessment of how well, and for how long, phylogenies retain the signature of such pulses has hitherto been based on aâprobably untenableâmodel of ongoing diversity-independent diversification. Here, we develop two new tests for changes in diversification ârulesâ and evaluate their power to detect sudden increases in equilibrium diversity in clades simulated with diversity-dependent speciation and extinction rates. Pulses of diversification are only detected easily if they occurred recently and if the rate of species turnover at equilibrium is low; rates reported for fossil mammals suggest that the power to detect a doubling of species diversity falls to 50 per cent after less than 50 Myr even with a perfect phylogeny of extant species. Extinction does eventually draw a veil over past dynamics, suggesting that some questions are beyond the limits of inference, but sudden clade-wide pulses of speciation can be detected after many millions of years, even when overall diversity is constrained. Applying our methods to existing phylogenies of mammals and angiosperms identifies intervals of elevated diversification in each.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afossils 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aextinction 3aspecies diversity 3amammals 3aAngiospermae 0aMagnoliophyta1 aOrme, C.

Cost-competitive production of 5AVA from biomass is a key factor in the successful commercialization of nylon 5. Bioproduction of 5AVA is a promising candidate for the industrial process to the current petrochemical route. In this study, we developed an artificial 2-keto-6-aminocaproate-mediated pathway for cost-competitive and high efficiency production of 5AVA in engineered Escherichia coli. Firstly, the combination of native l-lysine α-oxidase (RaiP) from Scomber japonicas, α-ketoacid decarboxylase (KivD) from Lactococcus lactis and aldehyde dehydrogenase (PadA) from Escherichia coli could efficiently convert l-lysine into 5AVA. Moreover, the engineered strains ML03-PₙᵢᵣB-RKP, ML03-PPL₋PR-RKP, ML03-PM₁₋₉₃-RKP induced by anaerobic condition, temperature-induced, constitutive expression instead of expensive isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside were constructed, respectively. The use of nirB promoter induced by anaerobic condition not only could attain a higher titer of 5AVA than PL-PR and M1-93 promoters, but omit cost of expensive exogenous inducers. After the replacement of industrial materials, 5AVA titer successfully reached 33.68 g/L in engineered strain ML03-PₙᵢᵣB-RKP via biotransformation. This biotransformation process conduces to the cosmically industrial 5AVA bioproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactococcus lactis 3aScomber 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3acommercialization 3agene expression 3alysine 3anylon 3aresearch 0a5-Aminovalerate 0al-lysine HCl 0aAnaerobically-induced promoter nirB 0aArtificial pathway 0aConstitutive promoter1 aTu, Wenying1 aCao, Ruiqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3002-98351 aGou, Xinghua1 aZhang, Yin1 aWang, Dan1 aLi, Qiang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 May 07, v. 552 p.170-175dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010200167300001300269520093900282592002801221650001901249650001101268650001101279650002201290653001901312653002401331653002901355653002201384653002201406653001001428653002101438653001501459653002201474653002301496700002801519700001401547700002801561700001801589700001801607773010801625856008201733852000901815655001201824IND60602647420221119215050.0180711e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060264742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2014.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeo, Chin Chye10aAdvances in sample preparation and analytical techniques for lipidomics study of clinical samples  ap. 1-18.  aLipids play multiple key roles in biological systems, including acting as secondary energy reserves, being components of cellular membranes and participating in cell-signaling pathways.

This review documents the lipidomics workflow, beginning with a description of approaches to preparation of samples of lipids. We also describe progress in mass spectrometry technologies that led to the development of several widely-used techniques of lipid analysis.

The silica colloids were deposited in an orderly manner onto the gold surface, followed with the infiltration of the C₆₀ nanoparticles into the interspaces of the colloids. The as-formed SiO₂/C₆₀ hybrid colloidal crystals were subsequently immersed in hydrofluoric acid to remove the silica components fully to obtain 3DOM C₆₀ frameworks. The control of the C₆₀ infiltration solution concentration is the key to obtaining a high quality 3DOM structure of C₆₀. The band gaps of the SiO₂ colloidal crystal, SiO₂/C₆₀ hybrid colloidal crystal and 3DOM C₆₀ were measured by UV-Vis reflection spectrometry, calculated using Bragg's law, and simulated by Band SOLVE, respectively. It was demonstrated that the 3DOM C₆₀ possesses electrochemical activity and can be used in detecting dopamine with a detection limit of 1.3 × 10⁻⁹ mol L⁻¹. Having a three-dimensional ordered macroporous structure with a greater surface area, the 3DOM C₆₀ modified electrode performed better than an unordered C₆₀ modified electrode and a bare gold electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3acrystals 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afullerene 3agold 3ahydrofluoric acid 3ananogold 3aporous media 3asensors (equipment) 3asilica 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area1 aCong, Hailin1 aZhai, Feng1 aWang, Yuezhong1 aZhang, Xiaoyan0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 08, v. 6, no. 108 p.106096-106101dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21016c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011200155300002200267520125300289592002801542650001201570650001201582650001301594650003101607650001101638650001301649650001301662700001901675700001801694700001401712700001801726773012701744856007401871852000901945655001201954IND60641260820221123041335.0190505e20161108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064126082DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21018j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xing10aCooperative halogen bonds in V-shaped H₃N·X1X2·X3Y (X1, X2, X3 = Cl and Br; Y = F, Cl and Br) complexes  ap. 106285-106296.  aA series of V-shaped molecular complexes formed by NH₃, X1X2 and X3Y (X1, X2, X3 = Cl, Br; Y = F, Cl, Br) molecules via two halogen bonds (i.e., N⋯X1 and X2⋯X3 interactions) have been investigated at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory to obtain their optimized geometries, stretching modes and interaction energies. Molecular electrostatic potential was used to illustrate how X1 and X2 act as the halogen bond donor and acceptor in N⋯X1 and X2⋯X3 interactions, respectively. The evaluation of the binding distances, interaction energies and the electron density at the bond critical points of the halogen bonds reveals the existence of cooperativity between the two halogen bonds. Subsequently, the concepts of pair interaction and pairwise non-additive contributions to the total interaction energy, and the cooperativity factor were further employed to assess the cooperativity. The formation mechanisms of these complexes were analyzed based on the contour maps of the Laplacian (∇²ρ) of electron density. Energy decomposition analysis suggests that electrostatic force is the main net contribution to the stability of these complexes. The work would provide valuable insights into the design of related halogen-bonded complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abromine 3achlorine 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3afluorine 3ageometry1 aYan, Chao-Xian1 aZhou, Da-Gang1 aYang, Fan1 aZhou, Pan-Pan0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 08, v. 6, no. 108 p.106285-106296dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21018j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245011400211300002000325520089600345592002801241650001101269650001201280650001601292650001101308650001301319650004401332650002301376650002001399650001601419700002301435700002101458700005901479700001901538700001901557700006201576700005801638773013801696856008001834852000901914655001201923IND60614636020181121000000.0181002e20180831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b068142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenocrate, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0952-094810aSlow CH₃NH₃⁺ Diffusion in CH₃NH₃PbI₃ under Light Measured by Solid-State NMR and Tracer Diffusion  ap. 21803-21806.  aWe investigate methylammonium (MA) transport in MA lead iodide under illumination and show this, as in the dark, to be measurable but negligible when compared with the major carriers. ¹H and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra show constant linewidths as a function of temperature, indicating the absence of significant MA diffusion. ¹³C tracer-exchange experiments reveal two distinct diffusion processes, one attributed to bulk MA transport and the other most probably due to higher dimensional defects. The former process has a diffusion coefficient that is consistent with the upper limit extracted from NMR measurements. Derived bulk conductivities for MA cations are orders of magnitude below the experimental ionic conductivity, corroborating the picture of pure iodine transport under illumination, as it was previously experimentally shown only for the dark situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acations 3adiffusivity 3aiodine 3alighting 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aMoudrakovski, Igor1 aAcartürk, Tolga1 aMerkle, Rotraut1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3811-89631 aKim, Gee Yeong1 aStarke, Ulrich1 aGrätzel, Michael,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0068-01951 aMaier, Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2274-60680 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 31, v. 122, no. 38 p.21803-21806dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b068143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012000163300001800283520095800301592002801259650001201287650002001299650001301319650000901332650001801341650003401359650001601393700001701409773015201426856007701578852000901655655001201664IND60521891220221116231422.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052189122DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1990-08022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchubert, R.

The colourless crystals are monoclinic, space group A2/n, with a = 20.216(2) Å, b = 13.130(1) Å, c = 9.328(1) Å, and β = 109.69(1)°. The measured density is 1.45 g/cm³, which agrees with the calculated density of 1.40 g/cm³ for Ζ = 4. The structure was solved by Direct Methods using 674 independent reflections and refined by least-squares procedures to conventional and weighted R factors of 0.068 and 0.058, respectively. The nearly linear [Au(CN)₂]⁻-anions form pseudohexagonal layers, in which they are arranged parallel to each other. The shortest Au—Au distance is 8.05 A. The stacking of the layers produces pseudo-trigonal channels, occupied by the cations.

On the basis of physico-chemical (pH and TBARS value) and microbiological parameters (TPC, Coliform count and yeast and mould count) meat papad could be stored at room temperature in LDPE pouches for 45 days without marked deterioration in the quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3ablack gram 3acoliform bacteria 3acorn 3acorn flour 3ahardness 3ameat 3amicrowave treatment 3apH 3ashelf life 3aspent hens 3astorage time 3awater activity 3ayeasts 0aBlack gram flour 0aProximate composition 0aSensory quality 0aStorage1 aChatli, Manish Kumar1 aPavan Kumār,1 aMahetā, Nītina,0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2017 Dec., v. 52, no. 3 p.312-317dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00067.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012400159520145900283592002801742650002801770650001501798650002001813650001001833650001901843650002201862650001201884650002001896650001901916650002701935650001601962650003201978653000902010653001602019653003002035653001602065700001702081700001802098700001502116700001702131700002102148700001402169700002002183700002202203700001702225700002202242700001802264700002102282700006202303700002502365700001602390700005702406700006002463700001902523700001602542773011202558856008202670852000902752655001202761IND60679656120221122032643.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067965612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1110922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Yih10aNDAT suppresses pro-inflammatory gene expression to enhance resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation in oral cancer cells  aNano-diamino-tetrac (NDAT), a tetraiodothyroxine deaminated nano-particulated analog, has shown to inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory genes. NDAT inhibits expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). On the other hand, in addition to inhibiting inflammatory effect, the stilbene, resveratrol induces expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its accumulation. Sequentially, inducible COX-2 complexes with p53 and induces p53-dependent anti-proliferation. In current study, we investigated mechanisms involved in combined treatment of NDAT and resveratrol on anti-proliferation in human oral cancer cells. Both resveratrol and NDAT inhibited expression of pro-inflammatory IL-1β and TNF-α. They also inhibited expression of CCND1 and PD-L1. Both resveratrol and NDAT induced BAD expression but only resveratrol induced COX-2 expression in both OEC-M1 and SCC-25 cells. Combined treatment attenuated gene expression significantly compared with resveratrol treatment in both cancer cell lines. Resveratrol reduced nuclear PD-L1 accumulation which was enhanced by a STAT3 inhibitor, S31-201 or NDAT suggesting that NDAT may inactivate STAT3 to inhibit PD-L1 accumulation. In the presence of T₄, NDAT further enhanced resveratrol-induced anti-proliferation in both cancer cell lines. These findings provide a novel understanding of the inhibition of NDAT in thyroxine-induced pro-inflammatory effect on resveratrol-induced anticancer properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3acell lines 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aligands 3amouth neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aresveratrol 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aNDAT 0aL-thyroxine 0aProgrammed death ligand 1 0aOral cancer1 aWu, Chien-Yi1 aChin, Yu-Tang1 aLi, Zi-Lin1 aPan, Yi-shin1 aHuang, Tung-Yung1 aSu, Po-Yu1 aLee, Sheng-Yang1 aCrawford, Dana R.1 aSu, Kuan-Wei1 aChiu, Hsien-Chung1 aShih, Ya-Jung1 aChangou, Chun A.1 aYang, Yu-Chen S.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7589-85271 aWhang-Peng, Jaqulene1 aChen, Yi-Ru1 aLin, Hung-Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2824-64191 aMousa, Shaker A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9294-015X1 aDavis, Paul J.1 aWang, Guan,0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2020 Feb., v. 136 p.111092-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1110923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163500001900300520208400319592002802403650002302431650001502454650002402469650000802493650000902501650001302510650001402523650002602537650001102563650003602574650000902610653001002619653001402629653001902643653002202662653003002684700001802714700001302732700001602745700001102761700002002772700001602792700001802808700002002826700001802846700001702864773012102881856008203002852000903084655001203093IND60723872820221119182035.0210322e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072387282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2021.1040152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ya-Ping10aFunctional differences in the products of two TRAF3 genes in antiviral responses in the Chinese giant salamander, Andrias davidianus  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTumour necrosis factor receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3) is a crucial transducing protein for linking upstream receptor signals and downstream antiviral signalling pathways. Previous studies mostly clarified the functions of TRAF3 in mammals, birds and fish, but little is known about the characterization and function of TRAF3 in amphibians. In this study, the molecular and functional identification of two TRAF3 genes, AdTRAF3A and AdTRAF3B, were investigated in the Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus. The complete open reading frames (ORFs) of AdTRAF3A and AdTRAF3B were 1698 bp and 1743 bp in length, encoding 565 and 580 amino acids, respectively. Both AdTRAF3A and AdTRAF3B deduced proteins contained a RING finger, two TRAF-type zinc fingers, a coiled-coil and a MATH domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the AdTRAF3 protein clustered together with other known TRAF3 proteins. Gene expression analysis showed that AdTRAF3s were broadly distributed in all examined tissues with similar distribution patterns. AdTRAF3s in the blood or spleen positively responded to Giant salamander iridovirus (GSIV) and poly (I:C) induction but exhibited distinct response patterns. Silencing AdTRAF3A/B remarkably suppressed the expression of IFN signalling pathway-related genes when leukocytes were treated with DNA virus and the viral RNA analogue. Moreover, overexpression of AdTRAF3A may induce the activation of the IFN-β promoter, and the zinc finger, coiled coil and MATH domains of AdTRAF3A were essential for IFN-β promoter activation. However, the overexpression of AdTRAF3B significantly suppressed IFN-β promoter activity, and its inhibitory effect was enhanced when the RING finger or MATH domain was deleted. Furthermore, AdTRAF3A rather than AdTRAF3B significantly induced NF-κB activation, implying that AdTRAF3A may function as an enhancer in both the IFN and NF-κB signalling pathways. Taken together, our results suggest that the two TRAF3 genes play different crucial regulatory roles in innate antiviral immunity in Chinese giant salamanders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrias davidianus 3aIridovirus 3aRING finger domains 3aRNA 3afish 3aimmunity 3aphylogeny 3asalamanders and newts 3aspleen 3atumor necrosis factor receptors 3azinc 0aTRAF3 0aAmphibian 0aIFN signalling 0aNF-κB signalling 0aAntiviral innate immunity1 aZhou, Yi-Lian1 aXiao, Yi1 aGu, Wen-Bin1 aLi, Bo1 aCheng, Yuan-Xin1 aLi, Bing-Wu1 aChen, Da-Yong1 aZhao, Xiao-Feng1 aDong, Wei-Ren1 aShu, Miao-An0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2021 June, v. 119 p.104015-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2021.1040153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04622naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245008600166300001600252520323800268592002803506650001503534650001203549650002003561650002003581650001103601650001903612653002603631653002703657653001703684653002903701653003103730653002703761700001403788700001603802700001503818700001803833700001603851700001703867773020703884856008804091852000904179655001204188IND60753054720221120132944.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075305472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2021.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Biao10aRobust hierarchical structure from motion for large-scale unstructured image sets  ap. 367-384.  aStructure from Motion (SfM) is key to mixed computer vision and photogrammetry applications. However, the fast-growing needs for large-scale SfM bring challenges to current SfM solutions. Unlike traditional global and incremental SfM solutions, hierarchical SfM approaches demonstrate promising potential in effectively reconstructing large-scale image sets by dividing the image set into multiple image clusters, reconstructing each cluster separately, and gradually merging partial models into a complete model. However, current hierarchical SfM approaches still suffer from the following problems: accurate image clustering without ancillary information; automatic quality evaluation of each reconstruction unit and unreliable partial reconstruction removal; effective and efficient reconstruction of each image cluster; robust and accurate cluster merging considering the merging order and the handling of images taken with the same camera but divided into different clusters. These unstable factors limit the robustness and accuracy of hierarchical SfM approaches on different unstructured image sets.To systematically improve the performance of hierarchical SfM, we propose a novel robust hierarchical structure from motion (RHSfM) method for large-scale image sets, which does not rely on any additional information, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS). (1) We develop an automatic image clustering method based on image correlation and present a dynamic adjustment strategy, obtaining reliable image clustering results. (2) We remove the poor reconstructions by introducing multiple quality evaluation standards. (3) We put forward a fast incremental SfM algorithm that optimizes the image adding mode with an image pre-screening strategy and gets rid of the dependence by the proposed dynamic adjustment strategy. (4) We achieve accurate cluster merging by creating an optimal merging list and employing a stepwise global optimization strategy that merges structures first and then cameras. Significantly, the entire process is fully automated with only a few input parameters, and the final result is not sensitive to these parameters.We verify our method on various real image sets that cover different image conditions, different scenes, and different image scales, especially two large-scale image sets with 121,506 and 153,396 images, respectively. The experimental results reveal that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art SfM systems Colmap, 3DF Samantha, and Metashape in terms of robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. In particular, only our method successfully reconstructed all the seven challenging datasets. For the five datasets that the other systems can also reconstruct, our method obtains the highest accuracy, which is 25 percent better than the best result of the comparable methods on average; for the remaining two datasets, the accuracy of our method is higher than 0.75 pixels. Moreover, the efficiency of our method is about 18, 4.85, and 0.25 times faster than Colmap, 3DF Samantha, and Metashape averagely on the experimental image sets, respectively. After all, our contribution provides a comprehensive and practical solution for large-scale SfM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acameras 3acomputer vision 3adata collection 3amodels 3aphotogrammetry 0aStructure from motion 0aLarge-scale image sets 0aHierarchical 0aDynamic image clustering 0aUnreliable cluster removal 0aRobust cluster merging1 aZhang, Li1 aLiu, Yuxuan1 aAi, Haibin1 aWang, Baoqian1 aSun, Yushan1 aFan, Zhongli0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2021 Nov., v. 181 p.367-384dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In this expanded study of 133 shrews and 69moles captured during 2010–2013 in central and southeastern Poland, we demonstrate the co-circulation of BOGV in the Eurasian water shrew and SWSV in the Eurasian common shrew, Eurasian pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and Mediterranean water shrew (Neomys anomalus). In addition, we found high prevalence of Nova virus (NVAV) infection in the European mole (Talpa europaea), with evidence of NVAV RNA in heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and intestine. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation of the L segment among the SWSV strains was 0–18.8% and 0–5.4%, respectively. And for the 38 NVAV strains from European moles captured in Huta Dłutowska, the L-segment genetic similarity ranged from 94.1%–100% at the nucleotide level and 96.3%–100% at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analyses showed geographic-specific lineages of SWSV and NVAV in Poland, not unlike that of rodent-borne hantaviruses, suggesting long-standing host-specific adaptation. The co-circulation and distribution of BOGV, SWSV and NVAV in Poland parallels findings of multiple hantavirus species co-existing in their respective rodent reservoir species elsewhere in Europe. Also, the detection of SWSV in three syntopic shrew species resembles spill over events observed among some rodent-borne hantaviruses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aphylogeny 3agenetic similarity 3aNeomys 3aheart 3asequence diversity 3aamino acids 3aintestines 3aspleen 3aviruses 3aTalpa europaea 3aOrthohantavirus 3aamino acid sequences 3akidneys 3ahost specificity 3aSorex araneus 3amoles 3aliver 3ashrews 3aRNA 3arodents 3aPoland 0aPoland 0aSorex 0aHantavirus 0aPhylogeny 0aTalpa1 aHejduk, Janusz1 aMarkowski, Janusz1 aKang, Hae Ji1 aMarkowski, Marcin1 aPołatyńska, Małgorzata1 aSikorska, Beata1 aLiberski, P.

Examined here are unexpected side reactions promoted by the important Grubbs catalyst GII. Evidence is presented for attack of PCy₃ on the acrylate olefin to generate a reactive carbanion, which participates in multiple pathways, including further Michael addition, proton abstraction, and catalyst deactivation. Related chemistry may be anticipated whenever labile metal–phosphine complexes are used to catalyze reactions of substrates bearing an electron-deficient olefin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adepolymerization 3aesters 3aolefin 3apolymers1 aFogg, Deryn E.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 June 17, v. 137, no. 23 p.7318-7321dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b045243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013200172300001600304500001900320520187400339592002802213650001202241650001702253650001002270650001802280650001402298650001802312650001702330650001202347650001002359650002302369650002302392650001202415653001302427653002102440653002402461653000902485700001902494700001802513773014102531856008602672852000902758655001202767IND60721211620221117191109.0201224e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072121162DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00061.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalpotra, Kunal10aEffects of feed restriction and additional fat supplementation on chemical composition and sensory evaluation of broiler's meat  ap. 327-331.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA study was conducted to study the effects of feed restrictions and additional (1%) fat supplementation on meat quality of broilers. In this growth study, 480 chicks were distributed randomly into 8 treatments having total 60 birds per treatment (4 replicates x 15 chicks in each replicate).T₀-Control group fed ad-libitum as per ICAR 2013 specification, T₁-T₀ with additional 1% fat supplementation, T₂-T₀ with feed restriction at 8–14 DOA (8–10 hrs), T₃-T₁ with feed restriction at 8–14 DOA (8–10 hrs), T₄-T₀ with feed restriction at 15–21 DOA (8–10 hrs), T₅-T₁ with feed restriction at 15–21 DOA (8–10 hrs), T₆-T₀ with feed restriction at 22–28 DOA (8–10 hrs) and T₇-T₁ with feed restriction at 22–28 DOA (8–10 hrs).4 birds of from each treatment were sacrificed and sample of meat from breast and thigh muscle were taken and analyse for chemical composition and sensory evaluation. Crude protein content of meat was significantly higher in second week feed restriction as compared to control and other restriction groups. The carcass fat was significantly lower in second week restriction group than other groups including control. Crude protein was significantly high in 2ⁿᵈ week feed restricted group as compared to control and other groups at both levels of fat. Fat was significantly higher for 2ⁿᵈ week restricted group for both levels of fat. Also for 4ᵗʰ week restriction 1% additional fat had significantly lower fat content. For colour at 3% fat 2ⁿᵈ week feed restriction gave the better result as compare to other groups. Neither feed restriction nor fat levels had any effect on the odour of the meat. So it was concluded that feed restriction at 2ⁿᵈ week of age reduces the fat content of the meat and improved colour, texture, juiciness and overall acceptability of chicken meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreasts 3achicken meat 3acolor 3acrude protein 3ajuiciness 3alipid content 3ameat quality 3amuscles 3aodors 3arestricted feeding 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 0aBroilers 0aFeed restriction 0aFat supplementation 0aMeat1 aSingh, Udeybir1 aSethi, A.P.S.0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2017 Dec., v. 52, no. 3 p.327-331dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00061.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245013500214520188000349592002802229650002602257650001602283650002002299650002202319650001302341650000902354650002202363650001702385650001402402653002902416653001802445653001902463653002902482653002502511653002102536653001602557700006202573700005802635700003702693700006102730773013202791856009002923852000903013655001203022IND60753055020221120152809.0220110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075305502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.1064462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshikawa, Yuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8245-557510aFinancial strategies targeting healthcare providers to promote the prudent use of antibiotics: a systematic review of the evidence  aImproving prudent use of antibiotics is one way to limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of financial strategies targeting healthcare providers on the prudent use of antibiotics.A systematic review of the literature was conducted searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases, and the grey literature. Search terms related to antibacterial agents, drug resistance, financial strategies, and healthcare providers and/or prescribers.Twenty-two articles were included in the review, reporting on capitation and salary reimbursement, cost containment interventions, pay-for-performance initiatives, penalties, and a one-off bonus payment. There was substantial variation in the reported outcomes describing prescribing behaviours, including proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics, antibiotic prescriptions per patient, and number of cases treated with recommended antibiotic therapy. All financial strategies were associated with improvements in the appropriate prescription of antibiotics in the short-term, although the magnitude of observed effects varied across financial strategies. Financial penalties were associated with the greatest decreases in inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions, followed by capitation models and pay-for-performance schemes that paid bonuses upon achievement of performance targets. However, the risk of bias across studies must be noted.Findings point to the viability of financial strategies to promote the prudent use of antibiotics. Measuring the downstream impact of prescriber behaviour changes is key to estimating the true value of such interventions to tackle AMR. Research efforts should continue to build the evidence on causal mechanisms driving provider prescribing patterns for antibiotics and the long-term impact on antibiotic prescriptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3ahealth services 3along term effects 3apatients 3arisk 3asystematic review 3atherapeutics 3aviability 0aantimicrobial resistance 0ahealth policy 0aantibiotic use 0aappropriate prescription 0afinancial strategies 0ahealth providers 0aprescribers1 aFeldhaus, Isabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3170-39781 aÖzçelik, Ece1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2416-68281 aHashiguchi, Tiago Cravo Oliveira1 aCecchini, Michele1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7634-64360 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2021 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.106446-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.1064463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012600171300001600297520229800313592002802611650000902639650002102648650002002669650002202689650001802711650001102729650001502740650002002755650001602775650001702791650002002808650001802828700002202846773009602868856008602964852000903050655001203059IND60113610520221122093709.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011361052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2012.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanjani, Faika10a“We don't want to talk about that”: Overcoming barriers to rural aging research and interventions on sensitive topics  ap. 398-405.  aGeographical, economic, social and cultural barriers to accessing services in rural areas are widely reported. Less widely discussed are dilemmas posed by individual and community reluctance to address sensitive health issues. This article, focusing on the highly sensitive area of mental health, and employing a participatory action approach, describes the natural history of a project, the Mental Health and Aging Initiative (MHAI) to enhance awareness of mental health issues in rural Kentucky-Appalachian communities and overcome the reluctance of individuals in these communities to seek assistance. Funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), MHAI involved an educational intervention to improve knowledge about mental health and aging in rural Appalachian counties. The need to overcome significant community reluctance to engage in discussion of mental health resulted in significant modification of the protocol. The intervention was grounded in recognition of four key aspects of the local situation: (1) the need to understand the sensitivity of mental health as an element of rural culture; (2) the critical role of local community leaders as points of entry, acceptance, and action; (3) the need to overcome social stigma and reframe the topic of mental health in a more positive light; and (4) the need for methodological innovation in developing an empowering educational action plan oriented toward community-wide long-term impact. The intervention model that emerged from these considerations was based on engaging community leaders, providing educational and technical resources, and nurturing the acceptance by individual rural residents of responsibility for monitoring community mental health. This motif became a central theme in a strategy designed to facilitate culture change and acceptance of mental health as a community concern. It involved active engagement of community representatives in defining and implementing an intervention consistent with participatory action research as a means of empowering rural residents in monitoring and addressing sensitive health care issues. Given that many issues in rural health are difficult to address because of such sensitivity, the approach described is considered to have application in other contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3acommunity health 3ahealth services 3along term effects 3amental health 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anatural history 3arural areas 3arural health 3asocial barriers 3asocial stigma1 aRowles, Graham D.0 tJournal of rural studies.g2012 Oct., v. 28, no. 4 p.398-405dElsevier Ltdx0743-01677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2012.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013800170300001400308500001900322520087400341592002801215650003201243650000801275650003401283650001901317650003101336650002901367653001901396653002801415653000901443653003401452653001801486700002601504700002001530773008801550856008501638852000901723655001201732IND60679656520221122032631.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067965652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2019.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProstova, Maria10aAntitermination protein P7 of bacteriophage Xp10 distinguishes different types of transcriptional pausing by bacterial RNA polymerase  ap. 57-64.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBacteriophage-encoded transcription antiterminators play essential roles in the regulation of gene expression during infection. Here, we characterize the effects of the antiterminator protein P7 of bacteriophage Xp10 on transcriptional pausing by Xanthomonas oryzae RNA polymerase (RNAP) at different types of pause-inducing signals. When acting alone, P7 inhibits only hairpin-stabilized pauses, likely by preventing hairpin formation. In the presence of NusA, P7 also suppresses backtracking-stabilized pauses and the his elemental pause, but not the consensus elemental pause, suggesting that these pause signals may be mechanistically different. Thus, P7 and other bacteriophage proteins that bind near the RNA exit channel of RNAP have evolved to regulate transcription by suppressing RNAP pausing at a subset of regulatory signals, and to co-opt NusA in doing so.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3abacteriophages 3agene expression regulation 3atranscription (genetics) 0aRNA polymerase 0aTranscriptional pausing 0aNusA 0aTranscription antitermination 0aBacteriophage1 aKulbachinskiy, Andrey1 aEsyunina, Daria0 tBiochimie.g2020 Mar., v. 170 p.57-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2019.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245014800214300001800362520147000380592002801850650001501878650000901893650002401902650001301926650002401939650002501963650001301988650001302001650001502014650002302029650001902052653001802071653003602089653001202125653003202137700001902169700001702188773014302205856008502348852000902433655001202442IND60598912720221119032828.0180702e20180326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059891272DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b002492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChava, Rama Krishna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7293-889910aSmart Hybridization of Au Coupled CdS Nanorods with Few Layered MoS2 Nanosheets for High Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction  ap. 6445-6457.  aFabrication of core–shell heteronanostructures with excellent optical properties and light induced charge separation effects have recently emerged as promising materials for solar to hydrogen conversion. Here, one-dimensional CdS–Au/MoS₂ hierarchical core/shell heteronanostructures (CSHNSs) have been successfully synthesized by a facile two-step hydrothermal method. Such heteronanostructures exhibit high efficiency and excellent stability toward hydrogen production. The introduction of Au nanoparticles on to CdS nanorods not only made a Schottky junction with strong plasmonic absorption enhancement but also directed the growth of few layered MoS₂ nanosheets as a hierarchical protective shell around the CdS nanorods. These CdS–Au/MoS₂ hybrid structures possess a large number of edge sites in the MoS₂ layers which are active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, the CdS–Au/MoS₂ CSHNSs exhibit outstanding hydrogen evolution performance which is 7 times that of pure CdS nanorods. Also these CdS–Au/MoS₂ CSHNSs showed greater stability after a long-time test (16 h), and 90% of catalytic activity still remained. The enhanced hydrogen evolution activity of CdS–Au/MoS₂ CSHNSs was attributed to the improved visible light absorption and the formation of heterojunctions between CdS, Au, and MoS₂ components, which increases the charge separation efficiency and thereby suppresses the electron–hole recombination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3agold 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananogold 3ananorods 3ananosheets 3aoptical properties 3aphotocatalysis 0aCdS−Au/MoS2 0aCore/shell heteronanostructures 0a2D MoS2 0aPhotocatalytic H2 evolution1 aDo, Jeong Yeon1 aKang, Misook0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Mar. 26, v. 6, no. 5 p.6445-6457dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b002493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245006900209300001300278506007600291520174100367592002802108506003702136650001402173650002002187650001402207650002002221650002002241650001102261650000902272650001102281650002902292650002602321650001802347700003102365700002202396773010502418856007902523852000902602655001202611IND60119602820221207123637.0141214e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011960282DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2008-9-2-r252doi7 aPMC23746972pmcid7 a182413322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrrutia, Araxi O.,10aDo Alu repeats drive the evolution of the primate transcriptome?  ap. 1887.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Of all repetitive elements in the human genome, Alus are unusual in being enriched near to genes that are expressed across a broad range of tissues. This has led to the proposal that Alus might be modifying the expression breadth of neighboring genes, possibly by providing CpG islands, modifying transcription factor binding, or altering chromatin structure. Here we consider whether Alus have increased expression breadth of genes in their vicinity. RESULTS: Contrary to the modification hypothesis, we find that those genes that have always had broad expression are richest in Alus, whereas those that are more likely to have become more broadly expressed have lower enrichment. This finding is consistent with a model in which Alus accumulate near broadly expressed genes but do not affect their expression breadth. Furthermore, this model is consistent with the finding that expression breadth of mouse genes predicts Alu density near their human orthologs. However, Alus were found to be related to some alternative measures of transcription profile divergence, although evidence is contradictory as to whether Alus associate with lowly or highly diverged genes. If Alu have any effect it is not by provision of CpG islands, because they are especially rare near to transcriptional start sites. Previously reported Alu enrichment for genes serving certain cellular functions, suggested to be evidence of functional importance of Alus, appears to be partly a byproduct of the association with broadly expressed genes. CONCLUSION: The abundance of Alu near broadly expressed genes is better explained by their preferential preservation near to housekeeping genes rather than by a modifying effect on expression of genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatin 3aessential genes 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agenomic islands 3ahumans 3amice 3amodels 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome1 aOcaña, Leandro Balladares1 aHurst, Laurence D0 tGenome biology.g2008 Feb., v. 9, no. 2 p.1887-1887dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-2-r253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010400167520151800271592002801789650003201817650002501849650002001874650001101894650002901905650002201934650002201956650001701978650001201995650001102007650001102018650001102029650002902040650001702069650001002086650001202096650001502108653003002123653002102153653002902174700001602203700002502219700003102244773010802275856008402383852000902467655001202476IND60679656620221122032540.0200523e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067965662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1112002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kai-Hua10aChinese renewable energy industries’ boom and recession: Evidence from bubble detection procedure  aThis paper considers bubbles specific to Chinese renewable energy industries, including wind, solar and hydro through the Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.

Combining with the bubble model, the empirical results reveal that renewable energy industrial stock price may deviate from their market value, and bubble behaviours exist in these industries. The potential reasons can be contributed to economic growth, trade barrier, government supportive policies, global financial crisis, and environmental protection pressure. More attention is further paid on special factors such as extreme windy weather, unfair anti-dumping investigation and less policy support which can explain certain bubbles in wind, solar and hydro industries. The renewable energy industries' boom and recession that evidence from bubble behaviour, would harm industrial development, influence thousands of people's lives, and bring challenges for Chinese energy structure and policies. Therefore, depending on the timely identification of explosive behaviours and bubbles, policymakers could set up prudent policy framework, reduce government intervention and render firms autonomy to maintain the sustained and healthy development of industries. More importantly, enterprises should increase research and development expenditure, upgrade technical standard and exploit international renewable energy market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative energy industry 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic crises 3aenergy 3aenvironmental protection 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3amarket value 3amarkets 3amodels 3apeople 3aprices 3aresearch and development 3asolar energy 3atrade 3aweather 3awind power 0aRenewable energy industry 0aBubble behaviour 0aGeneralized supremum ADF1 aSu, Chi-Wei1 aLobonţ, Oana-Ramona1 aMoldovan, Nicoleta-Claudia0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Mar., v. 138 p.111200-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1112003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008400170300001600254520082000270592002801090650002001118650002301138650001101161650002501172651001901197773012701216856008201343852000901425655001201434IND60776612820220603000000.0220509e20170911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077661282DNAL7 a10.17221/1/2016-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamara, Rudinskaya10aHeterogeneity and efficiency of food processing companies in the Czech Republic  ap. 411-420.  aIn the paper, the observed heterogeneity and technical efficiency of Czech food processing companies are investigated. Recent studies proved that food processing firms’ heterogeneity can influence the result of the efficiency estimation. For the empirical study, the panel data set from the years 2005–2012 containing 2854 observations of 607 food processing companies was used. Variables representing heterogeneity factors were incorporated in the mean of inefficiency term distribution of the Battese and Coelli model (1995). The models were estimated in the form of translogarithmic production function using the Stochastic Frontier Approach. The results indicate the presence of significant heterogeneity among the firms in the analysed branches and among different branches of the food processing industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aempirical research 3amodels 3aproduction functions 3aCzech Republic0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 63, no. 9 p.411-420dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/1/2016-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245020500165300002200370520174200392592002802134650001102162650002302173650002102196650002202217650001302239650001302252650001002265650002002275650001202295650001902307650001102326650001902337650001402356650001302370650003302383650001302416650002002429700001502449700001402464773012702478856007502605852000902680655001202689IND60641261520221123025901.0210813e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064126152DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21032e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMousavi, S.

For this purpose, before ethylene–propylene gas phase co-polymerization to produce dispersed phase, propylene was co-polymerized by 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 3.0% wt of ethylene and hexene-1 co-monomers in two separate slurry procedures to produce the partially randomized iPP (PR-iPP). Dispersed phase content of reactor alloys was strongly affected by the amount of the co-monomers used in MPS, while ethylene–propylene segmented co-polymers (EPs), as the compatibilizer between the matrix and dispersed phase, were little changed for all samples. SEM micrographs of the modified reactor alloys displayed that matrix modification technique (MMT) improves the morphology of the dispersed phase insofar as a single-phase morphology was seen when an appropriate amount of hexene-1 was used in the MPS. Pal and Palierne rheological models were applied to determine the interfacial tension of reactor alloys and the results illustrated that MMT affects the interfacial tension of matrix-dispersed droplets. Next rheological studies revealed that the interfacial interaction of EPR with the matrix modified by hexene-1 is higher than the matrix modified by ethylene. Improvement of interfacial interaction reduced the degree of crystallinity and overspread the melting thermograms of PR-iPP reactor alloys. Also, the presence of ethylene through the growth of β crystalline forms and hexene-1 via changing the α-form distribution help to improve the toughness of PR-iPP reactor alloys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3acrystal structure 3adroplets 3aethylene 3agases 3aimpact strength 3amelting 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3apolypropylenes 3apropylene 3arheology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aslurries 3asurface tension1 aJahani, Y.1 aArabi, H.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 6, no. 106 p.104438-104450dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21032e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245007800206300001800284520118700302592002801489650001301517650001801530650003001548650001101578650001501589650001401604650001601618650001101634653001901645653002101664653002401685653002301709700001801732700001601750700001701766773014301783856008501926852000902011655001202020IND60598912820221119032912.0180702e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059891282DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b002552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Jujun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8194-298810aHeat Transfer in Vacuum Pyrolysis of Decomposing Hazardous Plastic Wastes  ap. 5424-5430.  aVacuum pyrolysis has been widely used to decompose plastic wastes for obtaining purity chemicals or remove hazardous organic pollutants. The pyrolysis temperature determined the variety of pyrolysis products. The final (highest) temperature was the most investigated factor. However, temperatures used in vacuum pyrolysis were not equally distributed. The lowest temperature also determined the variety of the products. Regrettably, this vital factor has not been researched and reported. In this paper, the heat transfer process of vacuum pyrolysis was fully analyzed. The models for computing the lowest temperature were constructed. The models were certified by the vacuum pyrolysis of novolac epoxy particles collected from crushed waste printed circuit boards. According to the models, we found the heat transfer coefficient of the crucible and the inner diameters of the crucible and alundum tube were the key factors for controlling the lowest temperature. The models can help us to modify and adjust the lowest and highest (final) temperatures in vacuum pyrolysis. This contributed to recovering pure chemicals or removing pollutants from plastic wastes by vacuum pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepoxides 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amodels 3apollutants 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3awastes 0aWaste plastics 0aVacuum pyrolysis 0aHeat transfer model 0aLowest temperature1 aHuang, Jiaxin1 aQin, Baojia1 aDong, Lipeng0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 6, no. 4 p.5424-5430dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b002553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245009200155300001600247520101300263592002801276650001701304650002101321650001301342650001601355650001201371650001501383650000901398650001601407650000901423700001101432700001301443700001801456700001201474773013101486856007701617852000901694655001201703IND60765066520221119024957.0220904e20110608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076506652DNAL7 a10.17221/36/2011-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, H.10aEffects of salt and alkali stresses on growth and ion balance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 286-294.  aRice seedlings were stressed with salt stress or alkali stress. The growth, organic acids (OAs) and inorganic ions in stressed seedlings were measured to investigate the physiological adaptive mechanism by which rice tolerates alkali stress. The results showed that the injury effect of alkali stress on rice was stronger than salt stress. Under salt stress, inorganic anions were dominant in maintaining intracellular ionic equilibrium; however, under alkali stress, the contents of inorganic anions decreased, which caused a severe deficit of negative charge. The deficit of negative charge was remedied by greatly accumulated OAs, especially malate and citrate, and OAs were the dominant components and contributed to 61&ndash;81% of total negative charge, indicating that OA accumulation might be necessary for intracellular ion balance in rice. In addition, the OA metabolism adjustment of rice differed from that of other plant species, implying that rice may have a special alkali-tolerance mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aalkali tolerance 3acitrates 3aenvironment 3amalates 3ametabolism 3arice 3asalt stress 3asoil1 aWu, Z.1 aChen, Y.1 aYang, Zhunhe,1 aShi, D.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 57, no. 6 p.286-294dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/36/2011-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010500165520144200270592002801712650001201740650001201752650001601764650001401780650001801794650002801812650002501840650001601865650001801881650001201899650001201911650001501923650001101938650001901949650002701968650001301995650000902008650001002017650001102027653002302038653001702061653001902078700001302097700001902110700001402129700002002143700001702163773011702180856008602297852000902383655001202392IND60753055420221122232436.0211030e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075305542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1141242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Hao10aFlow chemistry for a better fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass in products structure and yield  aTo achieve the valorization of whole compositions of lignocellulosic biomass, flow fractionation (FF) was developed based on the flow chemistry of the major components of biomass, i.e., glucan, xylan, and lignin. Three kinds of solvent, i.e., water, formic acid, and p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH), were employed in FF treatments of poplar wood for an evaluation of performance in structure and yield of products. The advantage of FF was firstly confirmed by the nearly complete recovery of glucan in solid product, and the greatly enhanced digestibility of enzymatic hydrolysis as indicated by the glucose yield of 68.1 % at a low cellulase dosage of 10 FPU/g solid product from water treated poplar wood. The second advantage of FF was the rapid hydrolysis and very slight degradation of xylan for the three solvents explored, especially for water as indicated by the xylose yield of 80.3 % from poplar wood treated at 200 °C just for 15 min.. Last but not least, structure-preserved lignins were harvested from biomass with good yield, e.g., 40.3 % of lignin yield and 99.8 % of β-O-4 retention from poplar wood using water as solvent. Thus-obtained lignin (F72T130t30) was successfully transformed to hydrocarbons over Ru/Nb₂O₅ catalyst with the yield of 21 wt%. In short, these remarkable performances of FF in products structure and yield build a feasible valorization of lignocellulosic biomass for sustainable biorefinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acatalysts 3adigestibility 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aformic acid 3afractionation 3aglucans 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3ap-toluenesulfonic acid 3asolvents 3awood 3axylan 3axylose 0aFlow fractionation 0aValorization 0aFlow chemistry1 aLiu, Qin1 aZhong, Xiuhong1 aChu, Yaqi1 aWang, Zhaojiang1 aWang, Yanqin0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 173 p.114124-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1141243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01766naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245006900164300001800233520074400251592002800995650001301023650001201036650001901048650001801067650002401085650001401109650002001123700002001143700002401163700002201187773013201209856007801341852000901419655001201428IND60541274120221120085905.0160821e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054127412DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b047672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteele, Andrew

Herein we report the concise, high-yielding total synthesis (eight steps, 35% yield) of promysalin, a natural product that displays antivirulence phenotypes against pathogenic bacteria. Guided by bioinformatics, four diastereomers were synthesized, and the relative and absolute stereochemistries were confirmed by spectral and biological analysis. Finally, we show for the first time that promysalin displays two antivirulence phenotypes: the dispersion of mature biofilms and the inhibition of pyoverdine production, hinting at a unique pathogenic-specific mechanism of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abioinformatics 3adiastereomers 3amechanism of action 3aphenotype 3astereochemistry1 aKnouse, Kyle W.1 aKeohane, Colleen E.1 aWuest, William M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 June 17, v. 137, no. 23 p.7314-7317dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b047673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245017400153300002000327520104300347592002801390650002201418650002401440650002101464650001101485650001701496650000901513650001901522650000701541650001401548650001401562650001601576700001801592700001601610700001701626700002001643773012501663856007401788852000901862655001201871IND60641261620221123014325.0190505e20160913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064126162DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21034a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qian10aCarbon dots–quinoline derivative nanocomposite: facile synthesis and application as a “turn-off” fluorescent chemosensor for detection of Cu²⁺ ions in tap water  ap. 87230-87236.  aIn this paper, a novel quinoline derivative: 8-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)quinoline-2-carboxylic acid (Q) has been successfully synthesized, then it was coupled with carbon dots (CDs) to synthesize a CDs–Q nanocomposite by a simple and green method. The CDs–Q nanocomposite can act as a “turn-off” fluorescent chemosensor for detection of Cu²⁺ ions. It's a good candidate for Cu²⁺ sensing on account of its excellent properties such as its high sensitivity and selectivity, easy synthesis, excellent fluorescence stability towards temperature and pH, direct detection in aqueous solution and tap water and distinct fluorescence quenching towards Cu²⁺. We have also discussed the fluorescence quenching mechanism of CDs–Q and the possible coordination mode of CDs–Q with Cu²⁺. CDs–Q have a wide linear range (0.01–1.2 μM) and high sensitivity towards Cu²⁺ ions with a detection limit of 0.56 nM. In addition, this fluorescent chemosensor was also applied to determine Cu²⁺ in tap water with satisfying results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon quantum dots 3acarboxylic acids 3acopper 3afluorescence 3aions 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aquinoline 3atap water 3atemperature1 aHuang, Qitong1 aZhu, Jie-Ji1 aJi, Wen-Gang1 aTong, Qing-Xiao0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 13, v. 6, no. 90 p.87230-87236dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21034a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245014600203300002000349520165600369592002802025650002602053650001702079650002302096650001402119650001102133650002002144650001902164650001502183650001502198650001202213650001102225653002602236653002402262653002702286653002302313700001602336700001602352700001702368700005602385773014202441856008002583852000902663655001202672IND60760422020221122045745.0211221e20211206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076042202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c051342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiangyao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1491-225710aOxygen Isotope Tracing Study to Directly Reveal the Role of O₂ and H₂O in the Photocatalytic Oxidation Mechanism of Gaseous Monoaromatics  ap. 16617-16626.  aO₂ and H₂O influence the photocatalytic oxidation mechanism of gaseous monoaromatics, but still in an unclear manner, due to the lack of direct evidence. Tracing an oxygen atom from ¹⁶O₂ and H₂¹⁸O to intermediates can clarify their roles. The low H₂¹⁸O content suppressed the formation of benzenedicarboxaldehydes during the oxidation of xylenes and ¹⁶O₂ greatly affected the yield of total intermediates, while neither of them altered the percentage order of the products. Methylbenzaldehydes, methylbenzyl alcohols, and benzenedicarboxaldehydes possessed greater ¹⁶O percentage (≥69.49%), while higher ¹⁸O distribution was observed in methylbenzoic acids and phthalide (≥59.51%). Together with the interconversion results of the products revealed, ¹⁶O₂ determined the transformation of xylenes initially to methylbenzaldehydes and then to methylbenzyl alcohols or benzenedicarboxaldehydes, while H₂¹⁸O mainly contributed to conversion of methylbenzaldehydes to methylbenzoic acids or phthalide. Further interaction sites of xylene and its products with H₂O and O₂ were confirmed by molecular dynamics calculations. The same roles of ¹⁶O₂ and H₂¹⁸O in the degradation of toluene, ethylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene were also verified. This is the first report that provides direct evidence for the roles of O₂ and H₂O in the photocatalytic oxidation mechanism of gaseous monoaromatics. These findings are helpful to achieve controllable product formation from the oxidation of monoaromatics and predict their migration process in the atmospheric environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental science 3aethylbenzene 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen isotopes 3aphotocatalysis 3aphthalides 3atechnology 3atoluene 3axylene 0agaseous monoaromatics 0aoxidation mechanism 0aoxygen isotope tracing 0arole of O2 and H2O1 aYi, Jiajing1 aZhu, Weikun1 aZhang, Weina1 aAn, Taicheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6918-80700 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Dec. 06, v. 55, no. 24 p.16617-16626dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c051343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009000166300001600256500001900272520140600291592002801697650001501725650001301740650001001753650001901763650001501782650000901797650002901806653001301835653001401848653002001862653002301882653001601905700002201921700002201943700001801965773014101983856008602124852000902210655001202219IND60721212220221117191132.0201224e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072121222DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00054.X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDivya, D.10aReproductive performance of two backyard chicken varieties with 25% Aseel inheritance  ap. 355-356.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA study was conducted to evaluate the reproductive performance of two synthetic backyard varieties of chicken (Type-I: black Australorp (50%), WLH (25%) and Aseel (25%) and Type-II: black Australorp (50%), Synthetic (25%) and Aseel (25%)) developed at AICRP on Poultry Breeding, SVVU, Hyderabad. Day old chicks from each genetic group were reared under deep litter and were shifted to cage system in order to record bird's performance. Traits such as age at first egg (AFE), egg production and egg weight at forty weeks age, shell color, fertility and hatchability were examined. AFE (in days) were 173.20 and 168.45, egg productions were 68.46 and 69.04 and weights (in grams) at forty weeks of age were 48.86 and 49.94 in Type I and Type II varieties. Shell color varied widely from brown to white with intermittent shades among the genetic groups. Fertility rate was 86.39 and 86.10% in respective Type I and Type II genetic groups. The hatchability in terms of total egg set and fertile egg set were 76.41 and 88.41% in Type I and 76.04 and 88.31% in Type II genetic groups with no significant difference among the groups. The performance of these genetic groups surpassed many of native breeds and their overall reproductive performance was related to that of backyard varieties evolved by various research institutes. Thus, these birds can be used as a backyard variety by the farming community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralorp 3achickens 3acolor 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3areproductive performance 0aBackyard 0aSynthetic 0aChicken variety 0aReproductive trait 0aPerformance1 aRao, S.

The structure, morphologies, luminescence, and magnetic properties of the synthesized nanomaterials have been characterized by a variety of techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that the as-obtained GdF₃:Eu³⁺ nanofibers have a pure orthorhombic structure. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations show that the directly electrospinning-made PVP/[Gd(NO₃)₃ + Eu(NO₃)₃] composite nanofibers have smooth surfaces, uniform size and good dispersion, and the surfaces of GdF₃:Eu³⁺ nanofibers become rough after calcination and fluorination process. The diameters of composite nanofibers and GdF₃:Eu³⁺ nanofibers are respectively 333.26 ± 1.80 nm and 86.54 ± 0.55 nm under the confidence level of 95%. Under 274 nm ultraviolet light excitation, GdF₃:Eu³⁺ nanofibers exhibit characteristic ⁵D₃,₂,₁,₀ → ⁷FJ emission of Eu³⁺ and the trend of their color tones changes from blue, cold white, warm white to red by adjusting the molar concentration of Eu³⁺. In addition, all of the samples exhibit paramagnetic features and the magnetic properties of GdF₃:Eu³⁺ nanofibers are tunable by modulating the doping concentration of Eu³⁺ ions. More importantly, the tunable multicolor luminescence, white light emission and paramagnetic properties are simultaneously realized in single-phase GdF₃:Eu³⁺ nanofibers, which are ideally suited to applications in many fields such as solid-state lasers, lighting and displays, magnetic resonance imaging. This design conception and construction strategy developed in this work may provide some new guidance for the synthesis of other rare earth fluoride nanostructures with various morphologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acold 3acolor 3aeuropium 3afluorides 3aions 3alasers 3aluminescence 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ananofibers 3anitrates 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation 3awhite light1 aMa, Qianli1 aSong, Yan1 aXi, Xue1 aDong, Xiangting1 aYu, Wensheng1 aWang, Jinxian1 aLiu, Guixia0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 30, v. 6, no. 114 p.113045-113052dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21039b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011200164300001200276520057900288592002800867650002200895650002000917650001300937650001000950650002600960650001000986650001200996650000901008650001501017650001401032650001401046650001501060651001001075653002801085653001001113653002101123653001901144653001701163700001501180700001601195700001901211700001401230700001901244700001901263700002001282700001901302700001801321700001601339773011101355856008501466852000901551655001201560IND60543912320221118072246.0190412e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054391232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.10.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Haibo10aIsolation and characterization of a novel H10N2 avian influenza virus from a domestic duck in Eastern China  ap. 1-5.  aDuring the surveillance for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in live poultry markets (LPMs) in Eastern China, in 2013, an H10N2 AIV was isolated from a domestic duck.

Herein, a sustainable system using ammonium persulfate (APS)-catalyzed deep eutectic solvent (ADES) was developed to produce functional cellulose Ⅱ nanocrystals (CNCs) with a high yield of 82.3 %. The obtained CNCs had excellent thermal stability (>350 ℃), high crystallinity of 76.6 % with surface carboxyl groups, and superior dispersion stability. CNCs played a role of both molecular bridging and nano-sized effect in gelatin matrix, which combined with gelatin tightly through multiple hydrogen bonds to prepare bio-nanocomposite films with outstanding electric-responsiveness and pH-sensitivity. It was proved that CNCs had remarkable reinforcing potential and effective stress transfer capacity, contributing to a 187 % enhancement in tensile strength and an approximately 110 % increase in Young’s modulus of the formed CNCs/gelatin nanocomposite films when 0.5 wt % CNCs was loaded. Therefore, the study may open the door for developing a green and sustainable avenue to produce functional CNCs, and is of great significance for the building of CNCs-based functional nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium persulfate 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3agelatin 3ahydrogen 3alignocellulose 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3asolvents 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 0aCellulose II nanocrystals 0aOne-pot processing 0aMolecular bridging 0aBio-nanocomposite films 0aElectric-responsiveness 0apH-sensitivity1 aWu, Jiayin1 aLi, Yonggui1 aHuang, Biao0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 173 p.114127-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1141273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009300169300001300262500001900275520130400294592002801598650001601626650001301642650001801655650001601673650000901689650001701698650001601715650001301731653001401744653001201758653001801770653001201788653002101800700002201821773013801843856008601981852000902067655001202076IND60721212420221117191123.0201224e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072121242DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2018.00009.02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhanja, S.K.10aBehaviour and welfare concepts in laying hens and their association with housing systems  ap. 1-10.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe majority of commercial layers in the world is kept in confined cage housing systems where the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours like dust bathing, perching, foraging and nesting etc. The space requirement in battery cage system is much less than the aviary and free range system. Though cage-free systems provide better welfare, there are issues of cannibalism, fracture, spread of diseases, air quality, egg quality and health of the birds. Worldwide there is diffusion in the welfare regulations for both layers and broilers. There is increasing awareness among consumers regarding the origin of their poultry products and simultaneous need to improve the current level of bird welfare by the egg industry. Thus, welfare concepts not only emphasize five freedoms but also have biological, cultural, economic, social, philosophical, emotional, legal, and political dimensions. The degree of free choices made by well informed and educated consumers may play an important role in implementing welfare measures. There is also a need for additional research on economic implications of welfare under different agro climatic conditions. This review will mostly highlight productivity, behavioural restrictions and welfare issues of laying chickens under different farming systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aaviaries 3abattery cages 3acannibalism 3adust 3aegg industry 3aegg quality 3apolitics 0aBehaviour 0aWelfare 0aFive freedoms 0aPoultry 0aIntensive system1 aBhadauria, Pragya0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2018 Apr., v. 53, no. 1 p.1-10dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2018.00009.03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100004100148245016200189300001600351520120000367592002801567650002901595650001901624650001501643650001101658650002501669650001201694650002401706650001501730650001101745650001801756650001501774650002501789650001701814650001301831653002501844653002401869653002601893700004001919700003901959700002001998773012502018856008302143852000902226655001202235IND60609456920221119230309.0200628e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060945692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.10.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz Gomes da Silva, Rafael Leonardo10aHow the interaction of PVP-stabilized Ag nanoparticles with models of cellular membranes at the air-water interface is modulated by the monolayer composition  ap. 792-800.  aThe antimicrobial property of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is believed to be associated to their interaction with biointerfaces such as microbial cell membranes, encouraging research on the identification of membrane sites capable of AgNPs binding. Although significant progress has been made in that regard, the exact molecular mechanism of action is yet to be fully understood. In this study, AgNPs dispersed in aqueous media and stabilized with polyvinylpyrrolidone were incorporated in Langmuir monolayers of selected lipids that served as cell membrane models. Results from pressure-area isotherms, vibrational spectroscopy and Brewster angle microscopy revealed condensation of glycoside-free lipid monolayers, evidencing that the AgNPs interact mostly with the lipid hydrophilic head groups. In contrast, the monolayers of systems containing glycoside derivatives were found to expand upon AgNPs incorporation, indicating that the glycosidic compounds might facilitate the incorporation of these nanoparticles in cellular membranes. These data can be therefore correlated with the possible toxicity and microbicide effect of AgNPs in lipidic surfaces of mammalian and microbial membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3acell membranes 3aglycosides 3alipids 3aliquid-air interface 3amammals 3amechanism of action 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aLangmuir monolayers 0aAir–water interface1 aOliveira da Silva, Heloiza Fernanda1 ada Silva Gasparotto, Luiz Henrique1 aCaseli, Luciano0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 512 p.792-800dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.10.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007000153245012500223520199100348592002802339650002302367650001602390650001402406650001302420650002202433650001502455650002002470650001502490650002802505650002502533653001902558653000802577653001702585653002702602653003302629700002502662773011902687856008802806852000902894655001202903IND60746568220221120152520.0220103e20211220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074656822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1494312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellegers, Petra J.

The rationale behind this indicator is to decouple a country's economic growth from its water use. Yet, this unwittingly results in an economic distortion of the water balance, favouring increased water withdrawal in service of higher water-use efficiency, at the expense of environmental sustainability. This paper discusses three methodological flaws. First, aggregation of only economic values across all sectors ignores social and environmental values and is very sensitive to changes in the relative water use by agriculture versus industry and services. Second, the economic value derived from agriculture and from imports cannot in fact be decoupled from agricultural water use. Third, the indicator completely ignores the effects of diminished return flows to the environment due to increased re-use of water. A novel alternative, disaggregated WUE approach is therefore proposed, which links water consumption to the water balance. It is defined as the economic value of irrigated and rainfed agriculture combined with water consumption (ETₐ) by rainfed and irrigated agriculture per area based on earth observation data. It is measured as the change in the ratio of gross economic value added by irrigated and rainfed agriculture to the volume of water consumed by rainfed and irrigated agriculture over time. This approach is more consistent and objective, while being methodologically, hydrologically and environmentally sound. It acknowledges the coupling of economic growth and water depletion, and the need to strike a balance between opportunities for economic growth and environmental sustainability. This better serves the full breadth of the water and sanitation goal as defined in SDG 6.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic valuation 3aenvironment 3ahydrology 3aindustry 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3arainfed farming 3asanitation 3asustainable development 3awater use efficiency 0aValue of water 0aWUE 0aReturn flows 0aEarth observation data 0aEnvironmental sustainability1 avan Halsema, Gerardo0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Dec. 20, v. 801 p.149431-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1494313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012300177300001600300520130400316592002801620650002101648650001501669650002201684650001201706650001301718650000901731650001701740650002501757650003101782650001101813650001901824650002701843650002301870650002101893650001201914650001101926653002101937653001701958653002101975653001501996653002102011700001702032700001702049700001402066773011402080856008602194852000902280655001202289IND60629942120221117232749.0190404e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062994212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.01.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPamphile, Ndagijimana10aSynthesis of a novel core-shell-structure activated carbon material and its application in sulfamethoxazole adsorption  ap. 602-612.  aThe increasing release of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) into water poses serious threats to human beings. In this study, a novel core-shell activated carbon (CSAC) material with a high-mechanical-strength porous ceramic shell was synthesized and tested by adsorbing sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from aqueous solutions. An activated carbon core (AC core) was synthesized from a mixture of powder AC (92%) and cassava waste splinters binder (8%). Moreover, a shell with a high thickness of 0.13 cm and compressive strength (2.92 MPa) was generated from the mixture of coal fly ash and clay at ratio of 60:40. It demonstrated high protection of the AC core. The adsorption efficiency of SMX by CSAC attained 99.0% and 97.9% at initial concentrations of 5 and 10 mg L−1, respectively. Furthermore, 77.0, 68.6 and 60.4% of SMX were adsorbed at higher concentrations of 30, 50, and 100 mg L−1, respectively. The kinetics study demonstrated that the adsorption of SMX followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Moreover, the sorption isotherm was better fitted to Freundlich isotherms. Finally, SMX adsorption on CSAC simultaneously depended on the pore texture of CSAC and the hydrophobic properties of SMX, as well as the π-π bonds and electrostatic interactions between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acassava 3aceramics 3aclay 3acoal fly ash 3acompression strength 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3apersonal care products 3asorption isotherms 3asulfamethoxazole 3atexture 3awastes 0aActivated carbon 0aCoal fly ash 0aCassava residues 0aAdsorption 0aSulfamethoxazole1 aXuejiao, Liu1 aGuangwei, Yu1 aYin, Wang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 368 p.602-612dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.01.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014400162300002000306520146900326592002801795650002101823650003301844650002601877650001201903650001901915650001301934650003401947650002201981650002002003700001602023700002402039700002302063773012302086856007402209852000902283655001202292IND60667553920221119055025.0190919e20150513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066755392DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05825b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabal, Arun Singh10aDepression in glass transition temperature of multiwalled carbon nanotubes reinforced polycarbonate composites: effect of functionalization  ap. 43462-43472.  aFunctionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (a-MWCNTs) and non-functionalized MWCNTs were melt mixed with polycarbonate polymer by utilizing twin screw micro compounder having a back flow channel to obtain nanocomposites with varying composition from 0.5 to 10 wt% MWCNT and 2 wt% a-MWCNT. Mechanical properties of composite samples were studied using dynamic mechanical analyzer, flexural and tensile tests. Both DMA and flexural and tensile tests suggest formation of continuous network of CNT-polymer that is supported by measured storage modulus for different loading of MWCNT and a-MWCNT. The composite sample showed lower glass transition temperature (Tg) as compared to pure PC. Effect of functionalization of MWCNTs on Tg of its of polycarbonate composites is studied and showed higher Tg depression in functionalized MWCNTs compared to non functionalized MWCNTs based composites over pure polycarbonate. In DMA, lowering of height of tan delta peak indicates that polymer in composite material participating in Tg was reduced along with loading of MWCNT, consistent with immobilization of polymer material present at the CNT interface. Effect of functionalization on morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscope and confirms the better interaction in case of a-MWCNTs compare to MWCNTs based composites. Further, Raman spectroscopic analysis indicates higher interaction between a-MWCNT and PC matrix as compared to as synthesized MWCNT.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aglass transition temperature 3amechanical properties 3amelting 3ananocomposites 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aspectral analysis 3astorage modulus1 aGupta, Ravi1 aSingh, Bhanu Pratap1 aDhakate, Sanjay R.0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 13, v. 5, no. 54 p.43462-43472dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05825b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012900168520131200297592002801609650003401637650002701671650002301698650002401721650001701745650001501762650002501777650001101802650002501813650001901838650003001857653003601887653003101923653004801954653002802002653002402030653001202054653001602066700001602082700001202098700001602110700001502126700001502141700001702156700001302173700001502186700001702201700002002218700001302238700001602251700001302267773009802280856008802378852000902466655001202475IND60649436720221119223121.0190712e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064943672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2019.1120622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Baowei12aA specific UDP-glucosyltransferase catalyzes the formation of triptophenolide glucoside from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f.  aTripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. is a perennial woody vine member of the Celastraceae family. As a traditional Chinese medicine, it contains complex chemical components and exerts various pharmacological activities. In the present study, we identified a glucosyltransferase, TwUGT1, that can catalyze the synthesis of an abietane-type diterpene glucoside, namely, triptophenolide14-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and investigated the pharmacological activity of triptophenolide glucoside in diverse cancer cells. Triptophenolide glucoside exhibited significant inhibitory effects on U87-MG, U251, C6, MCF-7, HeLa, K562, and RBL-2H3 cells as determined by pharmacological analysis. The triptophenolide glucoside content of T. wilfordii was analyzed using Agilent Technologies 6490 Triple Quad LC/MS. The glucosyltransferase TwUGT1 belongs to subfamily 88 and group E in family 1. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis of TwUGT1 revealed that the His30, Asp132, Phe134, Thr154, Ala370, Leu376, Gly382, His387, Glu395 and Gln412 residues play crucial roles in the catalytic activity of triptophenolide 14-O-glucosyltransferase. In addition, TwUGT1 was also capable of glucosylating phenolic hydroxyl groups, such as those in liquiritigenin, pinocembrin, 4-methylumbelliferone, phloretin, and rhapontigenin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aTripterygium wilfordii 3acatalytic activity 3acomputer simulation 3aditerpenoids 3aglucosides 3aglucosyltransferases 3alianas 3amedicinal properties 3aneoplasm cells 3asite-directed mutagenesis 0aTripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. 0aGlucosyltransferase TwUGT1 0aTriptophenolide 14-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside 0aKey amino acid residues 0aAnticancer activity 0aDocking 0aMutagenesis1 aLiu, Xihong1 aLu, Yun1 aMa, Xiaochi1 aWu, Xiaoyi1 aWang, Xing1 aJia, Meirong1 aSu, Ping1 aTong, Yuru1 aGuan, Hongyu1 aJiang, Zhouqian1 aGao, Jie1 aHuang, Luqi1 aGao, Wei0 tPhytochemistry.g2019 Oct., v. 166 p.112062-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2019.1120623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245012600208300001600334520105700350592002801407650001101435650002201446650002301468650001901491650002401510650001901534650001301553650001801566650002101584653001401605653003301619653002001652653001201672653001101684700001701695700001801712700001801730700005801748773011401806856008601920852000902006655001202015IND60629942320221117232814.0190404e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062994232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.01.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yusheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1022-673810aSensitive and rapid detection of aliphatic amines in water using self-stabilized micelles of fluorescent block copolymers  ap. 630-637.  aA kind of self-stabilized micelles of fluorescent block copolymers are constructed for rapid and sensitive detection of aliphatic amines in water based on capture-report strategy. An amphiphilic triblock copolymer functionalized with aggregation induced emission (AIE) chromophores self assembles into micelles with core-shell structures in aqueous solution. Hydrophobic AIE chromophores organize into cores, where hydrophobic interaction among the AIE chromophores inhibits the micelles from disassembling. The cores of AIE chromophores are surrounded by a corona of water-soluble polymer segments, endowing the micelles with superior dispersibility in water. Water-soluble polymer segments capture organic amines in water due to preferential hydrophobic interactions between them. The enriched amines in the corona subsequently diffuse into hydrophobic cores of micelles, quenching fluorescence of the AIE chromophores. The fluorescent micelles allow rapid detection of aliphatic amines in the order of seconds at a concentration as low as 8 μg/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3aaqueous solutions 3acomposite polymers 3adispersibility 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3arapid methods 3awater solubility 0aDetection 0aAggregation induced emission 0aBlock copolymer 0aMicelle 0aAmines1 aGao, Haiyang1 aZhu, Fangming1 aGe, Mingliang1 aLiang, Guodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9103-45450 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 368 p.630-637dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.01.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03976naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245014400203300001800347520217700365592002802542650001802570650001802588650001902606650002302625650002402648650000902672650002102681650004102702650001202743650003002755650002202785650004002807650001802847650001202865650002302877650002202900653001802922653001502940653001202955653001802967653002102985653001803006700005303024700005403077700005603131700005503187773011203242856008303354852000903437655001203446IND60782108620221121233338.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078210862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2022.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Xudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4877-149910aEffects of Lactobacillus supplementation on glycemic and lipid indices in overweight or obese adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 1787-1797.  aRecent evidence suggests that gut microbiota may represent an important factor to affect the development of obesity and obesity-related diseases. Although several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have explored the ability of Lactobacillus to improve metabolic parameters in adults who are overweight or obese, their findings have been inconsistent and require further analysis. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the ability of Lactobacillus supplementation to improve glycemic control, the lipid profile, and blood pressure in adults who are overweight or obese. Seven electronic databases and two trial registers were searched up to April 2022 to identify eligible RCTs evaluating the effects of Lactobacillus supplementation in overweight or obese adults. Mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences were pooled using a random-effects model. Nine eligible RCTs with 598 participants were included. We found that Lactobacillus supplementation significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD −5.27 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval [CI] −8.28, −2.25; P = 0.0006) and total cholesterol (MD −4.84 mg/dL; 95% CI −8.29, −1.39; P = 0.006), particularly when taken in capsule, powder, or tablet form, for 12 weeks, as ≥1 × 10¹⁰ colony forming units/day, or as part of a normal diet. Benefits of Lactobacillus on fasting plasma glucose were seen after 12 weeks of supplementation (MD −1.81 mg/dL; 95% CI −3.08, −0.54; P = 0.005) and on triglycerides when taking a normal diet (MD −14.14 mg/dL; 95% CI −24.38, −3.91; P = 0.007). Lactobacillus had only a short-term beneficial effect on fasting plasma insulin and blood pressure and no significant beneficial effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Lactobacillus supplementation has a beneficial effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol in adults who are overweight or obese, and also on fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides under certain conditions. Therefore, Lactobacillus supplementation represents a promising approach in the management of obesity-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3aclinical nutrition 3aconfidence interval 3adiet 3aglycemic control 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ainsulin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid composition 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ameta-analysis 3aobesity 3astatistical models 3asystematic review 0aMeta-analysis 0aOverweight 0aObesity 0aLactobacillus 0aGlycemic control 0aLipid profile1 aWu, Qiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0170-54001 aLi, Wenyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8870-98981 aTang, Kairan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5616-07111 aZhang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0313-68570 tClinical nutrition.g2022 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.1787-1797dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2022.06.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009600161300002000257520154700277592002801824650002201852650002001874650001301894650002101907650001301928650002401941650002401965650002101989650001502010650002002025650001402045650001102059650002202070650001402092650001302106650001402119650002102133650002202154650002202176650002002198650001402218650001702232650001302249700002402262700002002286700002502306773012302331856007402454852000902528655001202537IND60646381320221119042105.0190610e20190528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064638132DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra01252d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanafy, Belal I.10aEthylene glycol coated nanoceria protects against oxidative stress in human lens epithelium  ap. 16596-16605.  aChronic diseases are rising in incidence and prevalence because of increases in life expectancy in many parts of the world coupled with advances in medicine which manage disease progression, rather than curing and alleviating the causes. Cataract is one such chronic condition. Identifying a therapeutic intervention that is successful in reversing or preventing cataracts may have applications for other chronic diseases of protein misfolding, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease as these have similar causation factors, notably oxidative stress and/or glycation. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria) which have antioxidant, radioprotective and enzyme-mimetic properties have the potential to lead to an effective non-surgical treatment. However, nanoceria stability in physiological media is poor thus hindering their effective use in biomedical applications. Here we report a highly efficient one-pot synthesis of nanoceria (2–5 nm) coated with ethylene glycol, that is colloidally stable in physiological media and exhibits multiwavelength photoluminescence. The formulation, up to concentrations of 200 μg ml⁻¹, was not toxic to human lens epithelial cells and had no adverse effect on the cellular morphology or proliferation rate. More significantly, these nanoceria showed protective effects against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide in lens epithelial cells. Electron microscopy studies show the internalization and cytoplasmic localization of the nanoceria was found to be largely in the perinuclear region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aadverse effects 3acataract 3achronic diseases 3adiabetes 3adisease progression 3aelectron microscopy 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aethylene glycol 3aglycation 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alongevity 3amedicine 3ananoceria 3aoxidative stress 3aphotoluminescence 3aprotective effect 3aprotein folding 3asynthesis 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aCave, Gareth W.

It also has a strategic and political role in making important contributions related to the production of reserve assets. Given the increasing and often destabilizing role of the futures market on spot oil prices, this study tries to address the question of whether the oil market behaves efficiently and rationally, or do speculators lead it? Using monthly data from 2000M01–2020M12 for crude oil prices and a range of advanced econometric tools such as breakpoint unit root tests, probability-based bubble detection mechanism, right-tailed Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF), and Generalized SADF (GSADF) approaches based on Monte Carlo and bootstrap critical values, we detect multiple bubbles exhibited by the oil market in different periods. The exact identification of these bubbles is essential to analyze the underlying fundamentals that may have caused these bubbles. It can also help policymakers and regulators to assess the exposure oil prices have towards several economic and fundamental factors. Finally, detecting bubbles and exploring the factors causing them, may help improve the oil market's overall efficiency and thus improve investors' decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aeconometrics 3aenergy 3amarkets 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apolitics 0aBASDF 0aBubble 0aCrude oil price 0aGeopolitical and speculative events 0aGSADF 0aC22 0aC58 0aG23 0aO33 0aQ431 aSu, Chi-Wei1 aRizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas1 aLobonţ, Oana-Ramona0 tEnergy.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 231 p.120873-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1208733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007700148245007100225300001600296500001900312520177300331592002802104650001402132650002402146650002302170650002102193650001502214650002102229650001402250650001102264650001402275700008202289700006602371700007302437700006802510773010402578856008202682852000902764655001202773IND60741747520221121153311.0210618e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074174752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-020-00921-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos Wanderley, Luan Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4176-275210aNutritional Requirement by Irrigated Brazilian Sugarcane Varieties  ap. 762-775.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAboveground biomass and nutrient accumulation differ among varieties of sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) throughout the crop development. This study aimed to identify irrigated sugarcane varieties with similar pattern of aboveground biomass production and nutrient extraction using cluster analysis and to determine the nutritional requirement during the plant cane cycle. Aboveground biomass production and nutrient content (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) of sugarcane varieties (SP79-1011, RB813804, RB863129, RB872552, RB94336, RB72454, RB763710, SP78-4764, SP81-3250, RB867515, and RB92579) were determined at 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 days after planting (DAP). Sugarcane varieties were clustered using the Ward’s method based on aboveground biomass and nutrient accumulation. Next, the increase in aboveground biomass per month and nutritional requirement were determined for the varieties clusters. The sugarcane varieties were clustered in five groups: G1: RB92579; G2: RB863129 and SP81-3250; G3: SP78-4764 and RB867515; G4: SP79-1011; and G5: RB872552, RB813804; RB763710, RB72454, and RB943365. The RB92579 (G1) produced the highest aboveground biomass accumulation, corresponding to an average of 23 Mg ha⁻¹ higher than the other varieties. The SP79-1011 (G4) exhibited constant aboveground biomass production in the last phase. The highest nutritional demand was observed for most of the varieties at the beginning of the stalk elongation phase (120 DAP), except for SP78-4764 and RB867515 (G3), which showed at beginning of the tillering phase (30 DAP). The nutritional requirements decreased during the final stage of stalks elongation phase. These findings suggest that nutritional management of sugarcane must consider the variety and growth phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3aaboveground biomass 3abiomass production 3acluster analysis 3airrigation 3anutrient content 3asugarcane 3asugars 3atillering1 ade Oliveira, Emídio Cantídio Almeida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9283-79101 aFreire, Fernando José1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3264-712X1 aSimões Neto, Djalma Euzébio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2071-56741 ados Santos, Renato Lemos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7396-17590 tSugar tech.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.762-775dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-020-00921-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001300162245011800175300001800293520168800311592002801999650001102027650001002038650001302048650001302061650002102074650001902095650002402114650000902138650002102147650001702168650001602185650002202201650001802223650001302241650001202254650004102266650001102307650001102318650002302329651001202352651001102364700001602375700001602391700001902407700001702426700002602443710004102469773009902510856007702609852000902686655001202695IND60083398420221120155448.0141101e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008339842DNAL7 a226129292pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-48972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoss, G.10aShort communication: Appropriate and alternative methods to determine viable bacterial counts in cow milk samples  ap. 2916-2918.  aFarm milk consumption is reported to be inversely related to the development of asthma and atopy in children and it has been hypothesized that microorganisms in milk might contribute to this protective effect. The GABRIEL study was designed to investigate this hypothesis in a large population of European children, calling for a rapid alternative to classical culture techniques to determine bacteriological properties of milk samples. One objective was to evaluate 2 different rapid methods to determine bacteriological properties in a large number of cow milk samples collected under field conditions. BactoScan (Foss Analytical, Hillerød, Denmark), an automated standard flow cytometric method utilized for routine testing of milk quality, and TEMPO (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France), an automated most-probable-number method, were used to assess the total viable bacterial count in farm and commercial milk samples. Both methods were compared with standard plate count method and each other. Measurements based on the TEMPO method were in good agreement with the standard plate count method and showed reliable results, whereas BactoScan results did not correlate with standard plate count measurements and yielded higher bacteria counts in heat-treated milk samples compared with raw milk samples. Most likely, these discrepant results were due to inferences with staining reactions and detection of bacteria in heat-treated milk samples. We conclude that, in contrast to the routinely used BactoScan method, the TEMPO method is an inexpensive and rapid alternative to standard culture methods suitable to assess total bacterial counts in processed and raw milk samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3aatopy 3abacteria 3achildren 3acommercial farms 3aflow cytometry 3amicrobial detection 3amilk 3amilk consumption 3amilk quality 3aplate count 3aprotective effect 3arapid methods 3araw milk 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Loadxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aMilkxmicrobiology 3aDenmark 3aFrance1 aApprich, S.1 aKneifel, W.1 avon Mutius, E.1 aGenuneit, J.1 aBraun-Fahrländer, C.2 aon behalf of the GABRIEL study group0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 June, v. 95, no. 6 p.2916-2918dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-48973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013000163520161500293592002801908650000801936650001501944650001901959650001201978650001601990650001902006650002202025650001102047650001502058650001802073650002902091653001902120653002002139653002602159653001702185700001902202700001802221773009102239856008502330852000902415655001202424IND60737740320221120072222.0220103e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073774032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1209052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Hao10aPerformance analysis of a novel energy storage system based on the combination of positive and reverse organic Rankine cycles  aEnergy storage systems (ESSs) play a vital role in the efficient utilization of intermittent renewable energy and off-peak electricity. However, the traditional ESSs with air and CO₂ have the limitations of geographic dependence and high operating pressure. In this paper, a novel ESS based on reverse and positive organic Rankine cycles with refrigerants, integrating the concept of combined cooling, heating, and power, is proposed to effectively reduce the operating pressure and to improve the energy efficiency and system flexibility. Thermodynamic optimization of this efficient system is performed by connecting the genetic algorithm (GA) toolbox of MATLAB and Aspen HYSYS, and R134a, R1234yf, R1234ze(E), and R152a are considered as working fluids. Three objective functions: maximization of round trip efficiency (RTE), energy density, and total exergy efficiency (TEE), are selected. Parametric analysis and performance comparison are used to evaluate the effects of key parameters on the RTE, energy density, and TEE of the system. An optimal RTE of 0.70 and energy density of 8.61 kW/m³ are achieved by using R1234yf and R152a, respectively. The maximum TEE of 0.77 is obtained by using R152a and R1234ze(E). The comparison results revealed that the proposed system exhibits distinct advantages of low operating pressure below 3000 kPa and stable operating conditions. Therefore, commercial off-the-shelf items utilized in the fields of refrigeration and heat pump can be applied in most of the components of the system. Further, this system is particularly useful for unit distributed system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgorithms 3acarbon dioxide 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aenergy density 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3aheat pumps 3arefrigeration 3arenewable energy sources 0aStorage system 0aHeat pump cycle 0aOrganic rankine cycle 0aRefrigerants1 aGong, Maoqiong1 aSun, Hailiang0 tEnergy.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 231 p.120905-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1209053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04776naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245012200178300001800300520289400318592002803212650001303240650001503253650001303268650001003281650001503291650001603306650001403322650000903336650001803345650001403363650001403377650001103391650000703402650001703409650001503426650001903441650001903460650002103479650001703500650002503517650001503542650002303557650001203580650002303592650002403615650001103639650004003650650003803690650001103728650002703739650002603766650002303792650002603815650004903841700002103890700001803911773009903929856007704028852000904105655001204114IND60083398520221120155437.0141101e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008339852DNAL7 a226129302pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-42392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStorm, A.C.12aA model of ruminal volatile fatty acid absorption kinetics and rumen epithelial blood flow in lactating Holstein cows  ap. 2919-2934.  aRuminal absorption of volatile fatty acids (VFA) is quantitatively the most important nutrient flux in cattle. Historically, VFA absorption models have been derived primarily from ruminal variables such as chemical composition of the fluid, volume, and pH. Recently, a mechanistic model incorporated the control of VFA absorption from epithelial surface area of the reticulorumen. In the present study, we hypothesized that ruminal absorption of VFA was controlled through epithelial permeability to VFA and rumen epithelial capillary blood flow. The objective of the study was to construct a model of VFA exchange across the rumen wall that incorporates epithelial blood flow as a driving force for ruminal VFA removal. The bidirectional fluxes between the ruminal and epithelial pool of VFA were assumed mass action driven, given that passive diffusion of nonionized VFA is the dominant transmembrane VFA flux. Parameter estimates were derived by fitting the model to observed data. The model provided reliable unbiased estimates of ruminal VFA absorption and rumen epithelial blood flow. Blood flow was modeled using an equation that considered the effect of butyrate and dietary crude protein intake per kilogram of body weight. The rate constants related to the flux from ruminal fluid to epithelium were in the order isobutyrate < acetate < propionate < butyrate (0.32±0.02, 0.72±0.2, 0.91±0.06, and 0.97±0.02 /h, respectively). The rate constants for fluxes of isobutyrate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate from the rumen epithelium to the ruminal fluid, relative to the pool size of the epithelium, were 4.78, 10.6, 13.4, and 14.3 /h, respectively. Ruminal concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and isobutyrate were predicted with root mean square prediction errors as percentage of the observed means (RMSPE) of 5.86, 5.75, 11.3, and 4.12, respectively. The epithelial blood flow was predicted with 26.3% RMSPE. Sensitivity analyses indicated that when ruminal butyrate concentration increased from 4.0 to 37.4mmol/L, blood flow of the epithelium increased 47% and the ruminal disappearance rate of propionate increased 11%. The concentration gradient of propionate between ruminal fluid and epithelium was no more than 3:1 and increased with increasing blood flow. In conclusion, a dynamic model based on rumen epithelial blood flow and bidirectional fluxes of VFA between ruminal fluid and epithelium gave unbiased predictions with low residual error of ruminal VFA absorption under washed rumen conditions. The model indicates that the effect of varying epithelial blood flow on the control of ruminal VFA absorption is related to the concentration gradient of individual VFA between ruminal fluid and epithelial blood. Epithelial blood flow may be an important determinant of ruminal absorption of VFA, a result that has not been evaluated on independent data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aabsorption 3aacetates 3ablood 3ablood flow 3abody weight 3abutyrates 3acows 3acrude protein 3aequations 3alactation 3amodels 3apH 3apermeability 3aprediction 3apropionic acid 3aprotein intake 3arumen epithelium 3asurface area 3avolatile fatty acids 2aAbsorption 2aAcetatesxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aApraxia, Ideomotor 2aButyratesxanalysis 2aCattle 2aEpitheliumxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aIsobutyratesxanalysis 2aLactationxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aPropionatesxanalysis 2aRumenxblood supplyxmetabolismxphysiology.1 aKristensen, N.B.1 aHanigan, M.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 June, v. 95, no. 6 p.2919-2934dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-42393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245016000203300001100363506007600374520178300450592002802233596008802261506003702349650001702386650001302403650002502416650001502441650001002456650001302466650001302479650002702492650002502519700002802544700005702572773009802629856008102727852000902808655001202817IND60594674820221207145056.0181230e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059467482DNAL7 a10.1186/s12863-018-0615-x2doi7 aPMC59414802pmcid7 a297393152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoy, Nisha12aA deeper view into the significance of simple sequence repeats in pre-miRNAs provides clues for its possible roles in determining the function of microRNAs  ap. 29.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The central tenet of ‘genome content’ has been that the ‘non-coding’ parts are highly enriched with ‘microsatellites’ or ‘Simple Sequence Repeats’ (SSRs). We presume that the presence and change in number of repeat unit (n) of SSRs in different genomic locations may or may not become beneficial, depending on the position of SSRs in a gene. Very few studies have looked into the existence of SSRs in the hair-pin precursors of miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). The interplay between SSRs and miRNAs is not yet clearly understood. RESULTS: Considering the potential significance of SSRs in pre-miRNAs, we analysed the miRNA hair-pin precursors of 171 organisms, which revealed a noticeable (29.8%) existence of SSRs in their pre-miRNAs. The maintenance of SSRs in pre-miRNAs even in the complex, highly evolved phyla like Chordata and Magnoliophyta shed light upon its diverse functions. Putative effects of SSRs in either regulating the biogenesis or function of miRNAs were more underlined based on computational and experimental analysis. A preliminary computational analysis to explore the relevance of such SSRs maintained in pre-miRNA sequences led to the detection of splicing regulatory elements (SREs) either in or near to the SSRs. The absence of SSRs correspondingly decreased the detection of SREs. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first implication for the possible involvement of SSRs in shaping the SREs to undergo Alternative Splicing events to produce miRNA isoforms in accordance with different stress environments. This part of work well demonstrates the importance of studying such consistently maintained SSRs residing in pre-miRNAs and can enhance more and more research towards deciphering the exact function of SSRs in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data  aSR/WOS-A/LS-1380/2014(G)cDepartment of Science and Technology, Government of India0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAngiospermae 3aChordata 3aalternative splicing 3abiogenesis 3agenes 3agenomics 3amicroRNA 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aregulatory sequences1 aMaimoonath Beevi, Y.

With an electrical field applied in a gas-solid fluidized bed, the charged particles there would be separated according to the opposite charge polarity. A charge-to-mass ratio test showed that quartz can easily be given a negative charge when tribo-charging with coal. A binary particle mixture was employed to explore the enrichment effect in an electrical-field fluidized bed unit. The results showed that the mass fraction of quartz in the products decrease gradually from negative plate to positive plate. The increase of fluidization time, plate voltage and gas velocity, along with low bed height, were beneficial to the improvement of the enrichment effect. The mass fraction of quartz close to the positive plate was >40%, while that of negative was around 10%. This work demonstrates the possibility of separating fine coal using a fluidized bed with applied electrical field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aelectric field 3afluidized beds 3aquartz 0aFine coal 0aFluidization charging 0aTriboelectrostatic separation 0aEnrichment1 aBai, Xuejie1 aPeng, Zhen1 aZhao, Xiaolu1 aYang, Jinshan1 aWang, Shuai1 aHe, Yaqun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8146-59740 tPowder technology.g2019 Sept., v. 354 p.743-749dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01461naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014500165300001800310520032200328592002800650650001400678650001200692650001400704650001700718650001700735650001600752650001800768700001700786700002100803700001700824773019000841856008301031852000901114655001201123IND60584909320221119052246.0181102e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058490932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2017.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Jenna10aChanges in Student-Athletes' Self-Efficacy for Making Healthful Food Choices and Food Preparation Following a Cooking Education Intervention  ap. 1056-1058.  aSocial Cognitive Theory-based cooking workshops were offered to student-athletes enrolled in a Life Skills college course.

METHODS: An electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry system was used to generate proteomic data of dwarf sheepgrass from a long-term overgrazed rangeland and normal sheepgrass from a long-term enclosed rangeland. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between dwarf and normal sheepgrass were identified, after which their potential functions and interactions with each other were predicted. The expression of key DEPs was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) using a multiple reaction monitoring method. RESULTS: Compared with normal sheepgrass, a total of 51 upregulated and 53 downregulated proteins were identified in dwarf sheepgrass. The amino acids biosynthesis pathway was differentially enriched between the two conditions presenting DEPs, such as SAT5_ARATH and DAPA_MAIZE. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network revealed a possible interaction between RPOB2_LEPTE, A0A023H9M8_9STRA, ATPB_DIOEL, RBL_AMOTI and DNAK_GRATL. Four modules were also extracted from the PPI network. The HPLC–MS analysis confirmed the upregulation and downregulation of ATPB_DIOEL and DNAK_GRATL, respectively in dwarf samples compared with in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The upregulated ATPB_DIOEL and downregulated DNAK_GRATL as well as proteins that interact with them, such as RPOB2_LEPTE, A0A023H9M8_9STRA and RBL_AMOTI, may be associated with the long-term overgrazing-induced dwarfism in sheepgrass.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014CB138804cNational Key Basic Research and Development Program  a31502008cNational Natural Sciences Foundation of China  a2016MS0323cNatural Sciences Foundation of Inner Mongolia0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeymus chinensis 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3adwarfing 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arangelands1 aXie, Jihong1 aHou, Xiangyang1 aLi, Xiliang1 aGuo, Huiqin1 aHu, Ningning1 aKong, Lingqi1 aZhang, Jize1 aChang, Chun1 aWu, Zinian0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.81-81dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1304-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245008200208300001800290520105700308592002801365650002501393650001401418650001001432650003701442650001401479650001201493650002801505650002301533650001101556650003601567650004301603700001601646773010901662856008101771990002301852852000901875655001201884IND60090697820221121101257.0141102e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009069782DNAL7 a222269832pmid7 aPMC37140122pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.11.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTitov, Denis V.10aIdentification and validation of protein targets of bioactive small molecules  ap. 1902-1909.  aIdentification and validation of protein targets of bioactive small molecules is an important problem in chemical biology and drug discovery. Currently, no single method is satisfactory for this task. Here, we provide an overview of common methods for target identification and validation that historically were most successful. We have classified for the first time the existing methods into two distinct and complementary types, the ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ approaches. In a typical top-down approach, the cellular phenotype is used as a starting point and the molecular target is approached through systematic narrowing down of possibilities by taking advantage of the detailed existing knowledge of cellular pathways and processes. In contrast, the bottom-up approach entails the direct detection and identification of the molecular targets using affinity-based or genetic methods. A special emphasis is placed on target validation, including correlation analysis and genetic methods, as this area is often ignored despite its importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3achemistry 3adrugs 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aphenotype 2aAnimals 2aDrug Discoveryxmethods 2aGenetic Techniques 2aHumans 2aProteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSmall Molecule Librariesxpharmacology1 aLiu, Jun O.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 20, no. 6 p.1902-1909dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.11.0703Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245013900173300001800312520189200330592002802222650002102250650001302271650002502284650002302309650001702332650001402349650001202363650002002375650002102395650001502416650001402431650001102445650001702456650001302473650002002486650001702506650001402523650001202537653002102549653001602570653001702586653002002603653002102623700002102644700001902665700002302684700002802707700001702735700002302752700002102775700001802796700006202814700001902876700002802895700002402923700002202947773011202969856008303081852000903164655001203173IND60782109220221120035648.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078210922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2022.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrigioni, Sébastien10aIntestinal permeability and appetite regulating peptides-reactive immunoglobulins in severely malnourished women with anorexia nervosa  ap. 1752-1758.  aIn the last decades, the role of microbiota–gut–brain axis has emerged in the regulation of eating behavior and in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN) that remains poorly understood. Particularly, a gut-derived dysregulation of immune response has been proposed leading to immunoglobulins directed against appetite-regulating peptides. However, intestinal permeability in patients with anorexia nervosa has been poorly documented. In the present prospective case–control study, we thus compared intestinal permeability, appetite-regulating peptides and their reactive immunoglobulins measured in severely malnourished women with AN (n = 17; 28 [21–35] y; 14.9 [14.1–15.2] kg/m²) to healthy volunteers (HV, n = 34; 26 [23–35] y; 22.3 [20.6–23.6] kg/m²). Patients with AN exhibited an increased urinary lactulose/mannitol ratio, both in 0–5 h (0.033 [0.013–0.116]) and 5–24 h samples (0.115 [0.029–0.582]), when compared to HV (0.02 [0.008–0.045], p = 0.0074 and 0.083 [0.019–0.290], p = 0.0174, respectively), suggesting an increased intestinal permeability. Urinary excretion of sucralose and plasma zonulin were not different. The levels of plasma total ghrelin and desacyl-ghrelin were increased in patients with AN compared to HV, whereas plasma leptin concentration was decreased. In addition, αMSH remained unchanged compared to HV. Finally, we did not observe any modification of the levels of total or free αMSH, leptin or ghrelin-reactive immunoglobulin G and M, as well as for their affinity properties. Only, a weak decrease of the dissociation constant (kd) for acyl-ghrelin-reactive IgG was observed in patients with AN (p = 0.0411). In conclusion, severely malnourished patients with AN show a higher intestinal permeability than HV without evidence of an effect on appetite regulating peptides-reactive immunoglobulins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanorexia nervosa 3aappetite 3acase-control studies 3aclinical nutrition 3adissociation 3aexcretion 3aghrelin 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aintestines 3alactulose 3aleptin 3amalnutrition 3amannitol 3apathophysiology 3apermeability 3asucralose 3azonulin 0aAnorexia nervosa 0aGut barrier 0aMalnutrition 0aImmunoglobulins 0aEating disorders1 aAchamrah, Najate1 aChan, Philippe1 aGuérin, Charlène1 aBôle-Feysot, Christine1 aDelay, Julie1 aColange, Guillaume1 aQuillard, Muriel1 aCoquard, Aude1 aBubenheim, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1883-68101 aJésus, Pierre1 aTavolacci, Marie-Pierre1 aDéchelotte, Pierre1 aCoëffier, Moïse0 tClinical nutrition.g2022 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.1752-1758dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2022.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014500153300002000298520134400318592002801662650002201690650002201712650002001734650003801754650001901792650001301811650003301824650001601857650003201873700001601905700001201921700001501933700001501948773012301963856007402086852000902160655001202169IND60667554720221119055132.0190919e20150513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066755472DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05844a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Tong10aInfluence of lamellar structure on the stress–strain behavior of β nucleated polypropylene under tensile loading at elevated temperatures  ap. 43496-43507.  aIn this article, five β nucleated polypropylene (β-iPP) cast films were prepared through crystallizing from 110 °C to 135 °C. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results show that all the five β-iPP samples had similar crystallinity, a high content of β-crystals but different β-lamellae distribution. Then the stress–strain behaviors of β-iPP at elevated temperatures were investigated in detail. We found that the slight difference in the β-lamellae distribution in β-iPP would affect the stress–strain behavior of β-iPP significantly. Based on the characterization of the morphological evolutions during stretching by 2D-WAXD and SEM, it is concluded that the β-iPP sample whose β-lamellae content along the flow direction was higher than that of the transverse direction would form a coarse fibrillar structure after longitudinal stretching and thus result in a low strain-hardening modulus. However, the β-iPP precursor film crystallizing at 126 °C, whose β-lamellae distribution with different angles to the tensile axis is most uniform, produced highly oriented fibrils and a homogeneous distribution of cavities, leading to the highest strain-hardening modulus and the narrowest pore size distribution after biaxial stretching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3apolypropylenes 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aXiang, Ming1 aCao, Ya1 aKang, Jian1 aYang, Feng0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 13, v. 5, no. 54 p.43496-43507dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05844a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009200157300002000249520102200269592002801291650002301319650002001342650001401362650001901376650002401395650001701419650001701436650001001453650004601463650001201509650002201521650001401543650001801557650004401575650001701619650001401636650002001650650001701670700001501687700001401702700001701716700001901733700001901752773012301771856007401894852000901968655001201977IND60646382120221119043124.0190610e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064638212DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra01605h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaofeng10aEfficient acylation of gastrodin by Aspergillus oryzae whole-cells in non-aqueous media  ap. 16701-16712.  aGastrodin, a bioactive compound extracted from the plant source of Gastrodia elata Blume, has a wide range of therapeutic effects on central nervous system (CNS) diseases, but suffers from poor brain permeability and short half-life in plasma. In this study, fatty acid esters of gastrodin were successfully synthesized by a whole cell-based biocatalytic method. Aspergillus oryzae cells showed different catalytic activities in the organic solvent systems tested. Tetrahydrofuran was confirmed as the most suitable pure organic solvent, with the highest substrate conversion of 98.0%. Addition of ionic liquids (ILs) into pyridine dramatically accelerated the reaction with conversion increased from 5.9% to 84.2%, and also changed the selectivity of the cells, mainly due to the use of IL-containing systems altering cell permeability and contact of the enzymes with solvent molecules possessing different polarities. The ester products were characterized by ¹³C-NMR and ESI-MS as gastrodin monoester and diester.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aGastrodia elata 3aacylation 3abenzyl alcohol 3abioactive compounds 3abiocatalysis 3ablood plasma 3abrain 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenzymes 3afatty acid esters 3ahalf life 3aionic liquids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apermeability 3apyridines 3atetrahydrofuran 3atherapeutics1 aMa, Maohua1 aXin, Xuan1 aTang, Yuqian1 aZhao, Guanglei1 aXiao, Xinglong0 tRSC advances.g2019 May 29, v. 9, no. 29 p.16701-16712dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra01605h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013000156300002000286520133700306592002801643650002201671650003701693650001401730650001301744650002001757650001401777650002301791650001101814650002001825650001301845650001801858650001501876650000901891650001401900650001401914650001801928650003701946650001401983700001701997700001502014773012402029856007402153852000902227655001202236IND60667554820221119055041.0190919e20150612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066755482DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05846e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Xinyou10aEffects of metal promotion on CuMgFe catalysts derived from layered double hydroxides for higher alcohol synthesis via syngas  ap. 51868-51874.  aCu–Mg–Fe–M–O (M = Mn, Zr, and Ce) catalysts derived from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursors were prepared using a co-precipitation method and tested for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) via carbon monoxide hydrogenation. The catalysts were subsequently characterized by N₂-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and H₂ temperature-programed reduction (H₂-TPR). The results show that Mn, Zr, and Ce promoters mainly contribute to the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated copper species, which favor the enhancement of the total alcohol selectivity. The addition of Mn facilitates the interaction between Cu and Fe, which causes the total alcohol selectivity and C₂₊ alcohol content in the total alcohols increased from 9.82% and 68.85% to 15.1% and 73.14%, respectively. However, the addition of Zr and Ce weakens the Cu–Fe interaction but increases the possibility of contact between Cu and Fe. As a consequence, the total alcohol selectivity is enhanced, while the C₂₊ alcohol content in the total alcohols is reduced upon Zr and Ce addition. Based on the characterization and catalytic results of the catalysts, a triple-active-site model is proposed to explain the different promoting effects of the three additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadditives 3aalcohols 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3acoprecipitation 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ahydroxides 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3asynthesis gas 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azirconium1 aFang, Kegong1 aSun, Yuhan0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 12, v. 5, no. 64 p.51868-51874dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05846e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04627naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245017000204300001800374506010400392506007600496520246400572592002803036506003703064650002303101650002503124650002703149650002303176650001803199650001803217650001803235650001603253650001603269650001403285650001003299650001903309650002103328650001803349650001103367650002003378650000903398650002203407650001603429653003803445653002203483653001703505653001803522653002303540700005703563700002103620700002403641700002103665700006003686700006203746773011303808856008303921852000904004655001204013IND60782109320221207052932.0220830e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078210932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2022.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaigh, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9229-412714aThe effectiveness and acceptability of Mediterranean diet and calorie restriction in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 1913-1931.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLifestyle interventions that focus on reduced energy intake and improved dietary pattern are the mainstay of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) management. However, it remains unclear which dietary approaches are most beneficial and promote greatest adherence. We aimed to synthesise data from randomised and clinical controlled trials, describing the effects of Mediterranean Diet and Calorie Restriction interventions on NAFLD surrogate markers, in adults. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (October 2021). Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tools: risk of bias for randomised controlled trials, and risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions. Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects model, and the I² statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. Of 4041 records identified, 26 articles with 3037 participants met the inclusion criteria, including studies on calorie-restricted interventions (CRI) (n 9), Mediterranean diet (MD) interventions (n 13) and MD component interventions (n 4). Studies were heterogeneous regarding intervention components, assessment of liver status and diet outcomes. 3 studies reported zero attrition and mean attrition rate for the remaining 23 studies was 14%. Post-intervention meta-analyses revealed that dietary interventions reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.004), Fatty Liver Index (FLI) (P < 0.001), hepatic steatosis (HS) (P = 0.02), and liver stiffness (P = 0.01). CRI had favourable effects on ALT (P < 0.001), HS (P < 0.001) and liver stiffness (P = 0.009). MD reduced ALT (P = 0.02), FLI (P < 0.001) and liver stiffness (P = 0.05). There was a dose–response relationship between degree of calorie restriction and beneficial effects on liver function and weight loss, suggesting that this approach should remain the cornerstone of NAFLD management. In addition, diet composition changes have potential for improving NAFLD and the limited data suggest that MD may be an effective diet therapy. These results support the current guidelines in NAFLD. However, further studies, which robustly evaluate the effects of interventions on dietary intake, acceptability and sustainability of the interventions, and quality of life and other patient-related outcomes are needed to support effective care delivery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean diet 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3aclinical nutrition 3adose response 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3afatty liver 3afood intake 3alifestyle 3aliver 3aliver function 3alow calorie diet 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aquality of life 3arisk 3asystematic review 3aweight loss 0aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease 0aSystematic review 0aDiet therapy 0aReducing diet 0aMediterranean diet1 aKirk, Colette1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5648-77251 aEl Gendy, Khalil1 aGallacher, Jennifer1 aErrington, Linda1 aMathers, John C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3406-30021 aAnstee, Quentin M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9518-00880 tClinical nutrition.g2022 Sept., v. 41, no. 9 p.1913-1931dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2022.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010800165300001600273520137000289592002801659650001101687650001301698650001501711653001501726653001801741653002501759653004201784700001901826700001501845700001601860700001501876773010001891856008501991852000902076655001202085IND60649437620221119223501.0200117e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064943762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2019.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zehua10aMean porosity variations in packed bed of monosized spheres with small tube-to-particle diameter ratios  ap. 842-853.  aThe transport phenomena in packed beds are sensitive to porosity variations. However, empirical correlations in the literature are not in agreement regarding the prediction of the mean porosity for packed beds, resulting in challenges for reactor design. In this study, the mean porosity variations in a densely packed bed with 1.2 < D/d < 7.1 are investigated experimentally. Moreover, a layer-stacking model is developed to explore the mean porosity variations for different D/d ratios. It is observed that analytical expressions obtained by the model can effectively track the experimental data for D/d < 3. When the D/d ratio increases further, changes in the mean porosity values can be interpreted by the model. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the mean porosity variations exhibit several inherent fluctuations as the D/d ratios vary, which may contribute to the significant differences between values predicted by the correlations in the literature. This significantly reduces the applicability of empirical correlations in the rigorous analysis of packed beds. Finally, the significance of the model is discussed with respect to the prediction of the pressure drop in the packed bed. This study can provide new perspectives to model mean porosity variations in packed beds, which is also useful for the evaluation of the hydraulic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aporosity 3aprediction 0aPacked bed 0aMean porosity 0aLayer stacking model 0aSmall tube-to-particle diameter ratio1 aSun, Zhongning1 aZhang, Nan1 aCao, Xiaxin1 aDing, Ming0 tPowder technology.g2019 Sept., v. 354 p.842-853dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245011500212520140700327592002801734650001501762650001401777650001201791650001601803650001101819650000901830650001101839650002001850650000901870650002101879650001501900650001801915653001601933653001401949653003601963653001701999653000902016653001602025700006702041700002602108700002502134773009102159856008502250852000902335655001202344IND60737740920221120072341.0220103e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073774092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1209182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordehi, A.

In this paper, a new model is proposed for unit commitment in renewable EHs with electric, thermal and cooling demands, different storage systems, combined heat and power (CHP) unit, boiler, electric chiller, absorption chiller, PV module, wind turbine and battery charging station (BCS). Using information gap decision theory (IGDT), day-ahead EH scheduling is done from risk-neutral, risk-averse and risk-seeking perspectives, considering the uncertainties of electric demands, BCS demands, heat demands, cooling demands, PV and wind power and electricity prices. Comprehensive models are used for storage systems considering their degradation, charging loss, discharging loss and storage loss; the ramp-up and ramp-down rate limits, start-up and shut-down costs of CHP, boiler and cooling components are considered. The effect of risk as well as effect of critical cost deviation factor and target cost deviation factor on EH operation cost and schedule of EH components is investigated. The findings indicate that the sensitivity of EH operation cost may be very different with respect to different sets of uncertain input data. The findings also show the significant effect of risk-awareness on schedule of EH components and its operation cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abatteries 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aheat 3amodels 3aoperating costs 3arisk 3asolar collectors 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aEnergy hubs 0aCCHP hubs 0aInformation gap decision theory 0aOptimisation 0aRisk 0aUncertainty1 aJavadi, Mohammad Sadegh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1484-25941 aShafie-khah, Miadreza1 aCatalão, João P.S.0 tEnergy.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 231 p.120918-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1209183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04122naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002100178245007200199300001600271506007600287520178200363592002802145506003702173650001802210650001902228650002202247650002802269650002802297650002502325650002302350650002302373650002102396650002002417650004102437650001402478650002502492650000802517650002302525650001702548650001402565650002502579650002102604650002102625650001702646650002402663650001002687650001702697650001502714650001002729650002802739650004402767650001102811650001102822650000902833650004802842650001502890650001702905650002402922650005002946650001602996651001003012651002503022700001603047700002003063700002103083700001803104700002503122700001803147773010203165856004003267852000903307655001203316IND4484660120221207054746.0120501e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448466012DNAL7 a223746432pmid7 aPMC33082942pmcid7 a10.2337/dc11-05372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaduka, Lydia U.10aPrevalence of Metabolic Syndrome Among an Urban Population in Kenya  ap. 887-893.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Developing countries are undergoing an epidemiologic transition accompanied by increasing burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) linked to urbanization and lifestyle modifications. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of CVD risk factors whose extent in Kenya remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and factors associated with its occurrence among an urban population in Kenya. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a household cross-sectional survey comprising 539 adults (aged ≥18 years) living in Nairobi, drawn from 30 clusters across five socioeconomic classes. Measurements included waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerides (TAGs), fasting glucose, and blood pressure. RESULTS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 34.6% and was higher in women than in men (40.2 vs. 29%; P < 0.001). The most frequently observed features were raised blood pressure, a higher waist circumference, and low HDL cholesterol (men: 96.2, 80.8, and 80%; women: 89.8, 97.2, and 96.3%, respectively), whereas raised fasting glucose and TAGs were observed less frequently (men: 26.9 and 63.3%; women: 26.9 and 30.6%, respectively). The main factors associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome were increasing age, socioeconomic status, and education. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic syndrome is prevalent in this urban population, especially among women, but the incidence of individual factors suggests that poor glycemic control is not the major contributor. Longitudinal studies are required to establish true causes of metabolic syndrome in Kenya. The Kenyan government needs to create awareness, develop prevention strategies, and strengthen the health care system to accommodate screening and management of CVDs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3aburden of disease 3acardiovascular diseases 3across-sectional studies 3adeveloping countries 3adisease prevalence 3aeducational status 3aglycemic control 3ahealth services 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alifestyle 3alongitudinal studies 3amen 3ametabolic syndrome 3arisk factors 3ascreening 3asocioeconomic status 3atriacylglycerols 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3awaist circumference 3awomen 3ayoung adults 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEthnicityxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexepidemiologyxetiology. 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Characteristics 2aUrban Populationxstatistics & numerical data 2aYoung Adult 3aKenya 0aKenyaxepidemiology.1 aKombe, Yeri1 aKenya, Eucharia1 aKuria, Elizabeth1 aBore, John K.1 aBukania, Zipporah N.1 aMwangi, Moses0 tDiabetes care.g2012 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.887-893dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc11-0537  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138245006400166300001600230520143500246592002801681650001701709650001301726650001701739650001501756650001201771650001201783650001601795651001401811700002601825700003101851700002601882773012301908856007402031852000902105655001202114IND60131529020221122224906.0151127e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013152902DNAL7 a10.1676/11-057.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, Gustavo A.,12aA Nation-Wide Standardized Bird Survey Scheme for Venezuela  ap. 230-244.  aWe developed a field survey protocol based on the North American Breeding Bird Survey to evaluate the efficiency and reliability of a bird monitoring scheme in the Neotropics, known as NeoMaps. A team of 21 amateur and professional ornithologists conducted bird counts at 27 locations distributed throughout Venezuela between March and April 2010. Locations selected followed a stratified spatial sampling design derived from environmental and biogeographical variables. Two complementary survey protocols were implemented in consecutive days along 40-km-long roadside transects. Three-minute point counts were performed at 50 stops, 800 m from each other on day 1. Cumulative species lists were recorded at a selection of 10 stops sampled for 9 min each, divided into three consecutive 3-min periods on day 2. We recorded 593 species at the 27 sites combined, representing 57% of the 1,033 potential species, or 43% of all known Venezuelan species. An additional 83 species were recorded outside of the formal point counts, for a total of 676 species detected. Groups such as hummingbirds and most waterbirds had unusually low numbers of both species and individuals, probably due to an abnormally dry year. Our survey methods appear to be appropriate for surveying most common diurnal non-colonial species. This is the first large-scale, systematic bird survey in Venezuela or, to our knowledge, in any other tropical country.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3abreeding 3ahummingbirds 3amonitoring 3asurveys 3atropics 3awater birds 3aVenezuela1 aRodríguez, Jon Paul,1 aFerrer-Paris, José Rafael1 aSánchez-Mercado, Ada0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2012 June, v. 124, no. 2 p.230-244dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F11-057.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001600174245007600190300001400266520169200280592002801972650002302000650002802023650001302051650001702064650002602081650002802107650001602135650001602151650001002167650001002177650001302187650001502200650002002215650002202235650001702257650003802274650004502312650001602357650004902373650006302422650002002485653001502505653001602520653001502536653001302551653001902564653002502583700001402608700001502622700001902637700001802656773015002674856009002824852000902914655001202923IND50069675420221121003756.0190318e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006967542DNAL7 a238594022pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.06.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoretti, A.10aMolecular biodiversity of mycotoxigenic fungi that threaten food safety  ap. 57-66.  aFungal biodiversity is one of the most important contributors to the occurrence and severity of mycotoxin contamination of crop plants. Phenotypic and metabolic plasticity has enabled mycotoxigenic fungi to colonize a broad range of agriculturally important crops and to adapt to a range of environmental conditions. New mycotoxin-commodity combinations provide evidence for the ability of fungi to adapt to changing conditions and the emergence of genotypes that confer enhanced aggressiveness toward plants and/or altered mycotoxin production profiles. Perhaps the most important contributor to qualitative differences in mycotoxin production among fungi is variation in mycotoxin biosynthetic genes. Molecular genetic and biochemical analyses of toxigenic fungi have elucidated specific differences in biosynthetic genes that are responsible for intra- and inter-specific differences in mycotoxin production. For Aspergillus and Fusarium, the mycotoxigenic genera of greatest concern, variation in biosynthetic genes responsible for production of individual families of mycotoxins appears to be the result of evolutionary adaptation. Examples of such variation have been reported for: a) aflatoxin biosynthetic genes in Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus; b) trichothecene biosynthetic genes within and among Fusarium species; and c) fumonisin biosynthetic genes in Aspergillus and Fusarium species. Understanding the variation in these biosynthetic genes and the basis for variation in mycotoxin production is important for accurate assessment of the risks that fungi pose to food safety and for prevention of mycotoxin contamination of crops in the field and in storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aFusarium 3abiodiversity 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolutionary adaptation 3afield crops 3afood safety 3afungi 3agenes 3agenotype 3amycotoxins 3arisk assessment 3atoxigenic strains 2aBiodiversity 2aCrops, Agriculturalxmicrobiology 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aFood Safety 2aFungixclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMycotoxinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRisk Assessment 0aAflatoxins 0aAspergillus 0aFumonisins 0aFusarium 0aTrichothecenes 0aBiosynthetic pathway1 aSusca, A.1 aMulè, G.,1 aLogrieco, A.F.1 aProctor, R.H.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 Oct. 01, v. 167, no. 1 p.57-66dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.06.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245010000208500001900308520182800327592002802155650001202183650001202195650000902207650001102216650002002227653003202247653001402279653002402293653001302317653002802330773010502358856008602463852000902549655001202558IND60713023920221122071237.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071302392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1255292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Wei-Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7202-948110aHydrological responses in a natural forested headwater before and after subsurface displacement  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSubsurface displacement can be a sign of shallow or deep-seated landslides. Although forested headwaters feature primarily active hydrological responses and erosional responses, the impacts of invisible subsurface displacement on hydrological responses are rarely reported. This study presents the changes in hydrological responses before and after subsurface displacement in a natural forested headwater. Using event-based analyses, the maximum values of rainfall, pore water pressure at the soil–bedrock interface, and surface runoff during rainfall events over 2 years were used to evaluate the changes in peak responses after subsurface displacement. The results showed that subsurface displacement increased the maximum pore water pressure, but reduced the rate of increase in pore water pressure, particularly for the measurement points where perennial subsurface saturation existed. Peak runoff was produced with at least two sources of near-surface flow and subsurface flow. Subsurface displacement reduced both the level and rate of increase in peak runoff. The internal relations in pore water pressure and the correlations between pore water pressure and runoff weakened after displacement. This weakening was likely due to displacement-induced cracks facilitating rainwater percolation into bedrock layers, and thereby decreasing the linkage between subsurface saturation and surface runoff. Subsurface displacement also modified the response time such that the maximum responses in pore water pressure and runoff tended to occur earlier than maximum rainfall during the period after displacement. This study demonstrates that invisible subsurface displacement directly changes hydrological behaviors, and that a headwater area is active, sensitive, and prone to disturbance, even if it is covered by forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3aforests 3arain 3arunoff 3asubsurface flow 0aHydraulic contribution area 0aHeadwater 0aPore water pressure 0aRainfall 0aSubsurface displacement0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Dec., v. 591 p.125529-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1255293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011200162300002000274520098700294592002801281650001501309650001601324650001901340650001801359650001501377650004401392650002601436650000901462650001001471650001901481700002801500700002801528773012301556856007401679852000901753655001201762IND60646382520221119042107.0190610e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064638252DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra01902b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaflak, Agnieszka14aThe solid-state proton NMR study of bone using a dipolar filter: apatite hydroxyl content versus animal age  ap. 16909-16918.  aThe hydroxyl content of bone apatite mineral has been measured using proton solid-state NMR performed with a multiple-pulse dipolar filter under slow magic angle spinning (MAS). This new method succeeded in resolving and relatively enhancing the main hydroxyl peak at ca. 0 ppm from whole bone, making it amenable to rigorous quantitative analysis. The proposed methodology, involving line fitting, the measurement of the apatite concentration in the studied material and adequate calibration, was proved to be convenient and suitable for monitoring bone mineral hydroxylation in different species and over the lifetime of the animal. It was found that the hydroxyl content in the cranial bone mineral of pig and rats remained in the 5–10% range, with reference to stoichiometric hydroxyapatite. In rats, the hydroxyl content showed a non-monotonic increase with age, which was governed by biological processes rather than by chemical, thermodynamically driven apatite maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal age 3acalibration 3ahydroxyapatite 3ahydroxylation 3amonitoring 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 3aswine 3athermodynamics1 aMoskalewski, Stanisław1 aKołodziejski, Wacław,0 tRSC advances.g2019 May 29, v. 9, no. 29 p.16909-16918dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra01902b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245011100166520192300277592002802200650000802228650002602236650002302262650001602285650001402301650002602315650001702341650000902358650001102367651001002378653002802388653002302416653001802439653002402457653002002481700001502501700001402516700001702530773011902547856008802666852000902754655001202763IND60746569520221122222432.0211227e20211210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074656952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1494452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBan, Jie10aPM2.5-associated risk for cardiovascular hospital admission and related economic burdens in Beijing, China  aThe study of ambient air particulate matter (PM₂.₅)-associated health and economic burdens of cardiovascular disease are crucial for air pollution control and disease prevention strategies. Quantified evidence remains inadequate.This study aimed to estimate the PM₂.₅ associated risk in cardiovascular hospital admission as well as attributable health burdens and economic costs.A total of 2,202,244 hospital admission records of cardiovascular disease and six common clinical subtypes in Beijing were included. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to estimate the associations and the concentration-response curve. Then, the annual average additional hospital admissions, days of hospital stay, and hospital expenditures were evaluated from 2013 to 2017 and compared between 2017 and 2013.The results showed that each 10 μg/m³ increase in previous-day PM₂.₅ concentration was associated with a risk increase of 0.44% (95%CI: 0.40%, 0.47%) for cardiovascular disease, 0.66% (95%CI: 0.58%, 0.73%) for angina pectoris, 0.53% (95%CI: 0.39%, 0.66%) for chronic ischemic heart disease, 0.48% (95%CI: 0.34%, 0.63%) for myocardial infarction, 0.44% (95%CI: 0.29%, 0.60%) for hypertensive heart disease and 0.40% (95%CI: 0.27%, 0.52%) for ischemic stroke. There were 1938 PM₂.₅ attributed additional hospital admissions, resulting in 21,668 additional days in hospital, along with 5527.12 and 1947.04 ten-thousand of additional total hospital cost and self-afforded cost, respectively. Compared with 2013, the above-mentioned four burdens decreased by 18.17%, 28.80%, 18.90% and 13.72% in 2017, respectively.PM₂.₅ exposure was significantly associated with substantial burdens of cardiovascular hospital admission and economic expenditures. The results highlight the necessity of continuous PM₂.₅ control from the perspective of healthy and sustainable city development in urban China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution control 3adisease prevention 3aenvironment 3ahospitals 3amyocardial infarction 3aparticulates 3arisk 3astroke 3aChina 0aCardiovascular diseases 0aHospital admission 0aAmbient PM2.5 0aShort-term exposure 0aEconomic burden1 aMa, Runmei1 aZhang, Yi1 aLi, Tiantian0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Dec. 10, v. 799 p.149445-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1494453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245008600179300001600265520190900281592002802190650002102218650001602239650001102255650001702266650001802283650001102301650001102312650001402323650002502337650001602362650001102378650002202389651001202411653002102423653002102444653000902465653001902474653002702493653003202520700005702552700002202609700001702631700002402648773011302672856008602785852000902871655001202880IND60581229920221118133058.0180831e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058122992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Koning, Jotte I.J.C.10aGetGreen Vietnam: towards more sustainable behaviour among the urban middle class  ap. 178-190.  aIn Vietnam, the middle class is expected to grow from 12 million to 33 million people between 2012 and 2020. The growth causes an increase as well as a shift in consumption. Products that were not accessible or affordable before will become increasingly so, such as cars, dishwashers, meat products and air-conditioning. In urban areas the changes are most prominent and so are the side effects: increased amounts of waste, smog, pollution and use of fossil energy or pesticides.The main objective of this study was to identify sustainable behaviour that followed or did not follow from the intervention project GetGreen Vietnam. 604 urban middle class consumers participated in a series of sustainable consumption trainings. Before, during and after the trainings, quantitative and qualitative data was collected on 90 sustainable actions.64% of the participants self-reported to be engaged in a sustainable action before the intervention and this percentage increased to 80% after. The group environment and activity-based meetings of GetGreen Vietnam project (GGVN) were critical for the success of the intervention. Participants reported that before GGVN certain actions were already habitual as a money saving strategy (e.g. sparse electricity use or food leftovers re-use) or due to past scarcity (e.g. sparse water use). Many participants reported the intention to buy sustainable products but fewer participants took action to do so.A powerful strategy toward more sustainable consumption in Vietnam can be to create more group-based activities around the themes of energy and shopping for food. A twofold approach is needed that both installs new sustainable consumption patterns and keeps old habits rooted in daily rituals. Role models should set an example for the young population and consumers and (Vietnamese) producers should be better connected to increase mutual trust and transparency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3adishwashers 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3ameat products 3amodels 3apeople 3apollution 3asocioeconomic status 3aurban areas 3awastes 3awater utilization 3aVietnam 0aBehaviour change 0aEmerging markets 0aAsia 0aSustainability 0aIntention–action gap 0aPro-environmental behaviour1 aTa, Thu Huong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7049-95461 aCrul, Marcel R.M.1 aWever, Renee1 aBrezet, Johannes C.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 134 p.178-190dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04532naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245014500178300001800323520254600341592002802887650001502915650002002930650001002950650001902960650002302979650001703002650002403019650001203043650001403055650002003069650002203089650001303111650000903124650001503133650002203148650001203170650001103182650003703193650004703230650001103277650004203288650003903330650003803369650005303407650002103460650002303481650004003504650005303544650001403597650003603611651001203647700001603659700001803675700001603693773009903709856007703808852000903885655001203894IND60083399120221120165154.0141101e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008339912DNAL7 a226129362pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-47912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHostens, M.10aOn-farm evaluation of the effect of metabolic diseases on the shape of the lactation curve in dairy cows through the MilkBot lactation model  ap. 2988-3007.  aThe effects of metabolic diseases (MD) occurring during the transition period on milk production of dairy cows have been evaluated in many different ways, often with conflicting conclusions. The present study used a fitted lactation model to analyze specific aspects of lactation curve shape and magnitude in cows that avoided culling or death in the first 120 d in milk (DIM). Production and health records of 1,946 lactations in a 1-yr follow-up study design were collected from a transition management facility in Germany to evaluate both short- and long-term effects of MD on milk production. Milk production data were fitted with the nonlinear MilkBot lactation model, and health records were used to classify cows as healthy (H), affected by one MD (MD), or by multiple MD (MD+). The final data set contained 1,071H, 348 MD, and 136 MD+ cows, with distinct incidences of 3.7% twinning, 4.8% milk fever, 3.6% retained placenta, 15.4% metritis, 8.3% ketosis, 2.0% displaced abomasum, and 3.7% mastitis in the first 30 DIM. The model containing all healthy and diseased cows showed that lactations classified as H had milk production that increased faster (lower ramp) and also declined faster (lower persistence) compared with cows that encountered one or more metabolic problems. The level of production (scale) was only lowered in MD+ cows compared with H and MD cows. Although the shape of the lactation curve changed when cows encounter uncomplicated (single) MD or complicated MD (more than one MD), the slower increase to a lower peak seemed to be compensated for by greater persistency, resulting in the overall 305-d milk production only being lowered in MD+ cows. In the individual disease models, specific changes in the shape of the lactation curve were found for all MD except twinning. Milk fever, retained placenta, ketosis, and mastitis mainly affected the lactation curve when accompanied by another MD, whereas metritis and displaced abomasum affected the lactation curve equally with or without another MD. Overall, 305-d milk production was decreased in complicated metritis (10,603±50kg vs. 10,114±172kg). Although care should be taken in generalizing conclusions from a highly specialized transition management facility, the current study demonstrated that lactation curve analysis may contribute substantially to the evaluation of both short- and long-term effects of metabolic diseases on milk production by detecting changes in the distribution of production that are not apparent when only totals are analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy cows 3adata collection 3adeath 3adisease models 3adisplaced abomasum 3aendometritis 3aexperimental design 3aketosis 3alactation 3alactation curve 3along term effects 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilk fever 3aretained placenta 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aEndometritisxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aKetosisxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aLactationxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMastitis, Bovinexphysiopathology 2aMetabolic Diseasesxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aModels, Biological 2aParturient Paresisxphysiopathology 2aPlacenta, Retainedxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Multiplexphysiology 3aGermany1 aEhrlich, J.1 aVan Ranst, B.1 aOpsomer, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 June, v. 95, no. 6 p.2988-3007dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-47913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012400204300001600328500001900344500001100363520138500374592002801759650001901787650001401806650001101820650001201831700001801843773010401861856008201965852000902047655001202056IND60741748720221122165122.0210618e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074174872DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-020-00940-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Vinay1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0702-516613aAn Industrial Survey on Electric Drives and Scope of Multilevel Inverter Based Induction Motor Drives in Sugar Industry  ap. 709-719.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aA typical sugar industry has electric motors ranging from a few kW to a few MW. For controlled speed–torque characteristics, at most of the places, variable frequency drives (VFDs) are used. DC drives are also used in place of VFDs at milling and batch type centrifugal machines. Slip ring induction motor (SRIM) drives are invariably used at sugarcane preparation station and also at some large pump and fan loads of the industry. At many places, the type and configuration of electric drives need to be reviewed keeping in view the recent developments in the area and improvements in similar applications in other industries. There is also a need to review the aspect of efficiency and harmonics associated with these conventional electric drives in the industry. Further, the VFDs, wherever installed in the sugar industry, are, invariably, 2-level inverter-based induction motor drives. The potential of the multilevel inverter (MLI)-based induction motor drives, being improved one, also needs to be explored in the industry. This paper presents a survey on types of electric drives presently being used for various applications in the sugar industry, their merits and demerits, further possible improvements in them for power saving and reduction in harmonics along with the potential of application of MLI-based induction motor drives, wherever feasible, in the industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3asugar industry 3asugarcane 3asugars 3asurveys1 aKumar, Sanjiv0 tSugar tech.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.709-719dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-020-00940-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011600175520200000291592002802291650002102319650001702340650002402357650002002381650001602401650001402417650001402431650001402445650002002459650001802479653002702497653002802524653000902552653002902561700001802590700002202608700002102630700002202651700002302673773011902696856008802815852000902903655001202912IND60746569620221122200255.0211227e20211210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074656962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1494462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Ammaro, Daniele12aA multi-criteria approach to evaluate the sustainability performances of wines: the Italian red wine case study  aThe wine industry has faced two significant environmental problems in recent years: productivity is challenged by environmental trends such as global warming, and buyers are becoming more environmentally conscious. From an environmental standpoint, the food industry is one of the most impacting sectors and wine results as one of the most studied agri-food products in the scientific literature. In general, comprehensive studies that consider an application of set of indicators to evaluate the overall sustainability of wine sector are lacking in literature. This paper aims to carry out a sustainable assessment using different indicators for fifteen Italian red wines: Water Footprint (WF), Carbon Footprint (CF), Vineyard Indicator (VI), and Territory Indicator (TI). VI is an indicator of the vineyard's agronomic management's sustainability at plot level with values ranging from 0 (fully sustainable) to 1 (fully not sustainable), while TI covers the socio-economical aspects of sustainability. Considering system boundaries from cradle to grave, at 90% confidence interval, CF results ranged between 0.97 kg CO₂ eq./functional unit and 1.97 kg CO₂ eq./functional unit, with an average estimated at 1.47 kg CO₂ eq./functional unit, while the WF of a 0.75 L bottle of wine from cradle to gate is 666.7 L/functional unit on average, out of which 86.75% is green, 1.92% is blue and 11.34% is grey water. Concerning the VI, at 90% confidence interval VI results were between 0.117 and 0.498 with an average estimated at 0.307. The results of the correlation analyses confirmed that each indicator is not statistically correlated with each other. Concerning the sub-indicators, a positive correlation has been found between the total CF and the sum of blue and grey WF. The application of a multi-criteria analysis for sustainability performances evaluation of the wine sector presented in this study can be used by wine companies' experts to better assess sustainability performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3acase studies 3aconfidence interval 3acradle-to-grave 3aenvironment 3agreywater 3ared wines 3avineyards 3awater footprint 3awine industry 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aVineyard sustainability 0aWine 0aGreenhouse gas emissions1 aCapri, Ettore1 aValentino, Fiamma1 aGrillo, Stefania1 aFiorini, Emanuela1 aLamastra, Lucrezia0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Dec. 10, v. 799 p.149446-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1494463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245018400164300001800348520188000366592002802246650001602274650001502290650001502305650001602320650003502336650001702371650001902388650001702407650001102424650001802435650001902453650002202472650001502494650001302509700001702522700002702539700002002566700002302586700002002609700002202629700002002651700002502671773012802696856008102824852000902905655001202914IND60523858420221122031145.0160629e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052385842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-015-9014-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoman, Marco10aHydrodynamic chromatography coupled to single-particle ICP-MS for the simultaneous characterization of AgNPs and determination of dissolved Ag in plasma and blood of burn patients  ap. 5109-5124.  aSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly used in medical devices as innovative antibacterial agents, but no data are currently available on their chemical transformations and fate in vivo in the human body, particularly on their potential to reach the circulatory system. To study the processes involving AgNPs in human plasma and blood, we developed an analytical method based on hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in single-particle detection mode. An innovative algorithm was implemented to deconvolute the signals of dissolved Ag and AgNPs and to extrapolate a multiparametric characterization of the particles in the same chromatogram. From a single injection, the method provides the concentration of dissolved Ag and the distribution of AgNPs in terms of hydrodynamic diameter, mass-derived diameter, number and mass concentration. This analytical approach is robust and suitable to study quantitatively the dynamics and kinetics of AgNPs in complex biological fluids, including processes such as agglomeration, dissolution and formation of protein coronas. The method was applied to study the transformations of AgNP standards and an AgNP-coated dressing in human plasma, supported by micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) and micro X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (μXANES) speciation analysis and imaging, and to investigate, for the first time, the possible presence of AgNPs in the blood of three burn patients treated with the same dressing. Together with our previous studies, the results strongly support the hypothesis that the systemic mobilization of the metal after topical administration of AgNPs is driven by their dissolution in situ.

In such a context, to explore the evolution of the region is of both political and theoretical interest. This study presents the result of a scenario-building exercise, based on a Delphi method – an interactive forecasting technique – relying upon about 60 practitioners, experts and academics representing 19 Mediterranean countries and a wide range of disciplines and expertise. The present article has three main purposes. First, to identify the main challenges, trends and driving forces that influence the agri-food systems in the Mediterranean over a short (2020) and medium (2030) term. Second, to discuss the alternative policy responses to the challenges that the region will face in terms of water resource management, farming systems and agri-food value chains in terms of desirability and feasibility. Thirdly, to provide informed, evidence-based recommendations that might help different stakeholders to take action in the region’s agri-food sector. Based on this Delphi’s results, the study suggests that the gap between the countries in the South and the North of the Mediterranean in terms of challenges posed in water management, farming systems and the agri-food value chain is expected to grow. Experts agree that climate change is going to play a key role in the future of both sides of the Mediterranean, but with a differential impact in the sub-two regions. Nutrition-related challenges will exert a growing pressure especially in the Southern Mediterranean countries. A set of desirable and feasible policy option for addressing the Mediterranean food-related challenges are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDelphi method 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aexercise 3afood industry 3aland degradation 3aland policy 3anutrition 3apolitics 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3asurveys 3awater management 3awater shortages 3aMediterranean region 0aDelphi study 0aMediterranean 0aWater scarcity 0aFarming 0aAgriculture 0aPolicy1 aBasile, Linda1 aGagliardi, Francesca1 aIsernia, Pierangelo0 tLand use policy.g2022 Sept., v. 120 p.106263-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.1062633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04041naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245013300207300001100340506007600351520225800427592002802685506003702713650001202750650002202762650002102784650001302805650002302818650001302841650001802854650001102872650002302883650001302906650002302919650001202942650000902954650002702963650001302990650001203003650001403015650001303029650001203042650001803054650002003072700002403092700002303116700002103139700002203160700001903182700002503201700001903226773010303245856008203348852000903430655001203439IND60594675620221207145100.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059467562DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1293-62doi7 aPMC59600972pmcid7 a297763872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCirilli, Marco10aIntegrative genomics approaches validate PpYUC11-like as candidate gene for the stony hard trait in peach (P. persica L. Batsch)  ap. 88.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Texture is one of the most important fruit quality attributes. In peach, stony hard (SH) is a recessive monogenic trait (hd/hd) that confers exceptionally prolonged firm flesh to fully ripe fruit. Previous studies have shown that the SH mutation affects the fruit ability to synthesize appropriate amounts of indol-3-acetic acid (IAA), which orchestrates the ripening processes through the activation of system 2 ethylene pathway. Allelic variation in a TC microsatellite located within the first intron of PpYUC11-like (a YUCCA-like auxin-biosynthesis gene) has been recently proposed as the causal mutation of the SH phenotype. RESULTS: The simple genetic determinism of the SH trait has been clarified through genome-wide association and LD analyses in a diverse set of accessions, restricting the hd locus to an interval of about 1.8 Mbp in chromosome 6. The comparison of fruit transcriptome data from non-SH (melting flesh) and SH accessions provided an expression patterns overview of the annotated transcripts within the hd locus, confirming the absence of PpYUC11-like expression in SH fruits. To explore further possible associations between genomic variants at the hd locus and the SH phenotype, re-sequencing data of the SH accession ‘D41–62’ were compared with several SH and non-SH accessions with different genetic backgrounds. A further step of validation was provided through the evaluation of variant-trait association in two bi-parental F₂ populations issued from the SH accession ‘D41–62’ and a panel of advanced breeding selections, showing perfect co-segregation of the PpYUC11-like intron TC₂₀ allele and the SH phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide a multi-level validation of the genetic control of the SH trait through the integration of genome-wide association mapping, transcriptome analysis and whole-genome resequencing data for SH and non-SH accessions, and marker-trait association in a panel of advanced breeding selections and segregating progenies. Collectively, our data confirm with high confidence the role of allelic variation at PpYUC11-like locus as the genetic determinant of the SH trait, opening interesting perspectives at both biological and applied research level.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aallelic variation 3aapplied research 3abreeding 3achromosome mapping 3aethylene 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agenetic background 3agenomics 3aindole acetic acid 3aintrons 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutation 3apeaches 3aphenotype 3aripening 3atexture 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aGiovannini, Daniela1 aCiacciulli, Angelo1 aChiozzotto, Remo1 aGattolin, Stefano1 aRossini, Laura1 aLiverani, Alessandro1 aBassi, Daniele0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.88-88dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1293-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009800157300002000255520112600275592002801401650002101429650001401450650001401464650001901478650002101497650002601518650001601544700001701560700001901577700001401596700001701610700001701627700001701644773012401661856007401785852000901859655001201868IND60667555420221119055038.0190919e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066755542DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05861a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lianbo10aEfficient ultraviolet photodetectors based on TiO₂ nanotube arrays with tailored structures  ap. 52388-52394.  aRecently, ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors based on TiO₂ semiconductors have attracted intensive attention, due to their wide applications in environmental and biological research, optical communication, astronomical investigations and missile launch detection. However, there still remain material- and fabrication-related obstacles in realizing highly efficient UV photodetectors. Here, we reported the exploration of the efficient UV photodetectors based on the highly ordered TiO₂ nanotube arrays (TNAs). The TNAs were prepared by a two-step anodic oxidation with tailored tube lengths and wall thicknesses, and then transplanted to a transparent FTO substrate to construct a front-illuminated photodetector. The as-assembled photodetectors exhibit a satisfactory stability and wavelength selectivity with a high photocurrent, photo-to-dark current ratio and responsivity up to 1395 μA, 10 730 and 176.3 A W⁻¹ under the UV illumination of 350 nm (45 μW cm⁻¹) at a given bias of 2 V with TiO₂ tube length of 14.7 μm, respectively, suggesting their promising applications in efficient UV photodetectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric current 3ananotubes 3aoxidation 3asemiconductors 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths1 aYang, Weiyou1 aChong, Haining1 aWang, Lin1 aGao, Fengmei1 aTian, Linhai1 aYang, Zuobao0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 15, v. 5, no. 65 p.52388-52394dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05861a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245012700217300001200344520104800356592002801404596006501432650002501497650002901522650001901551650001501570650001101585650001201596651001001608773013501618856008301753852000901836655001201845IND60741749020221122165128.0210624e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074174902DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-09747-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSujatha, Evangelin Ramani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4138-278413aAn integrated landslide susceptibility model to assess landslides along linear infrastructure for environmental management  ap. 447.  aLandslides are a serious concern in the Western and Eastern Ghats of India. They impede the social and economic development of the region. Landslides can manifest in various forms like translational slides, rock falls, debris flow, etc. Each type of landslide has a set of characteristic conditioning factors and are required to be modelled separately. This study attempts to develop an integrated model to assess different types of landslides in a region. A stretch of hill road severely affected by different of types of landslides along the Kodaikkanal–Palani traffic corridor is selected for the study. The model developed is capable of assessing the susceptibility of the region to translational slides, rock falls and debris flow. Analytical Network Process, a heuristic model that can accommodate the interdependency of the conditioning factors is used to model landslide susceptibility. The results of the study show that the model performs satisfactorily. Control measures are also suggested for mitigating landslides in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  aSR/FTP/ETA-0062/2011cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental management 3ainfrastructure 3alandslides 3amodels 3atraffic 3aIndia0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 June, v. 80, no. 12 p.447-447dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09747-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009400169300001600263506011700279506007600396520158500472592002802057506003702085650001602122650002402138650002202162650001502184650002002199650002302219650002102242650002202263650001002285650001102295653001002306653004002316653001402356653001002370653002502380700002502405700002702430700002002457773012602477856008402603852000902687655001202696IND60782670420221207140003.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078267042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jobab.2022.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mingquan10aOptimizing yield and chemical compositions of dimethylsulfoxide-extracted birchwood xylan  ap. 211-219.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) extraction is commonly used to study the chemical structures of original xylan in the plant cell wall, since the DMSO can preserve the original structure of the xylan as much as possible during the extracting process. In addition, the DMSO-extracted xylans have unique properties allowing their potential applications in emulsifying or filming materials. However, the yield of DMSO-extracted xylan is always low and the effects of different DMSO extraction conditions on the chemical compositions of xylan have not been fully studied, which greatly hinders its researches and applications. In this study, we have found that extensive delignification before DMSO extraction results in destruction of lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC), leading to xylan yield and xylose unit content increased by up to 220% and 20%, respectively. Tert-butanol washing of the holocellulose can further increase the DMSO extracted xylan yield by ∼10%. The yield of xylan extracted by the DMSO at 80 °C for 7 h was obviously higher than that at room temperature for 3 d by 30%–40%. Thermal analysis showed that the xylans extracted at different conditions had thermal stability without obvious differences. The results indicate that the DMSO-extracted xylan with a high yield, a high purity and a high degree of acetylation can be extracted at a high delignification level, a high reaction temperature and a short reaction time. This study is of great significance for studying xylan structure-property relationships and promoting the applications of DMSO-extracted xylan.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylation 3aambient temperature 3abiobased products 3acell walls 3adelignification 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3athermal analysis 3athermal stability 3axylan 3axylose 0aXylan 0aDimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) extraction 0aBirchwood 0aYield 0aChemical composition1 aBobokalonov, Jamshed1 aDzhonmurodov, Abduvali1 aXiang, Zhouyang0 tJournal of bioresources and bioproducts.g2022 Aug., v. 7, no. 3 p.211-219dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27491x2369-96987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobab.2022.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100005500185245013200240300002000372506007600392520099600468592002801464506003701492650002601529650001301555650002001568650001401588650002301602650001401625650001901639650002201658650001701680653002401697653002601721653002801747700006401775700005401839700006501893773014201958856007802100852000902178655001202187IND60688541620221207102410.0200415e20200323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068854162DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c014172doi7 aPMC71639182pmcid7 a322027632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSami, Selim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4484-032210aHow Ethylene Glycol Chains Enhance the Dielectric Constant of Organic Semiconductors: Molecular Origin and Frequency Dependence  ap. 17783-17789.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIncorporating ethylene glycols (EGs) into organic semiconductors has become the prominent strategy to increase their dielectric constant. However, EG’s contribution to the dielectric constant is due to nuclear relaxations, and therefore, its relevance for various organic electronic applications depends on the time scale of these relaxations, which remains unknown. In this work, by means of a new computational protocol based on polarizable molecular dynamics simulations, the time- and frequency-dependent dielectric constant of a representative fullerene derivative with EG side chains is predicted, the origin of its unusually high dielectric constant is explained, and design suggestions are made to further increase it. Finally, a dielectric relaxation time of ∼1 ns is extracted which suggests that EGs may be too slow to reduce the Coulombic screening in organic photovoltaics but are definitely fast enough for organic thermoelectrics with much lower charge carrier velocities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adielectric properties 3aethylene 3aethylene glycol 3afullerene 3amolecular dynamics 3ascreening 3asemiconductors 3asimulation models 3asolar energy 0adielectric constant 0aorganic photovoltaics 0aorganic thermoelectrics1 aAlessandri, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1948-53111 aBroer, Ria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5437-95091 aHavenith, Remco W.

Furthermore, the deep benthic macroinvertebrate communities of tropical lakes are almost unknown. The present work describes the benthic macroinvertebrate communities of three tropical, warm monomictic lakes in “Lagunas de Montebello” National Park, Mexico, by describing the differences along the bathymetric profile, from the littoral down to the profound benthos. We studied the benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the two contrasting hydrodynamic periods of the warm monomictic lakes: a) stratification, when the hypolimnion becomes anoxic, and b) mixing, when the water column becomes oxygenated. We expected: 1) a reduction in the benthic macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness, density, and biomass from the littoral to the deep zone, 2) an impoverished benthic macroinvertebrate community while stratified (anoxia) compared to mixing (oxygenated), and 3) depletion in the taxonomic richness, density, and biomass of the profundal benthic macroinvertebrates in the tropical compared to temperate lakes. We found: 1) a decreasing trend in taxonomic richness (6 ± 2–3 ± 1 taxa), density (1868.7 ± 1069.7–349.1 ± 601.8 in. m⁻²) and biomass (277.8 ± 188.9–85.1 ± 95.6 mg C m⁻²) from the littoral to the deep zone; chironomids dominated the littoral zone, while oligochaetes dominated the deep zone. 2) Lower density and biomass but not taxonomic richness while stratified (4 ± 3 taxa; 586.2 ± 527.6 in. m⁻²; 81.6 ± 164.3 mg C m⁻²) compared to mixing (4 ± 3 taxa; 877.5 ± 1051.4 in. m⁻²; 190.1 ± 131.1 mg C m⁻²). 3) lower taxonomic richness and density but not biomass in tropical Montebello oligotrophic lakes (3 ± 3 taxa; 349.1 ± 601.8 in. m⁻²; 85.1 ± 195.6 mg C m⁻²) compared to temperate analogous (2–48 taxa; 492−83,189 8 in. m⁻²; 0.13−201.5 mg m⁻²). We conclude the early onset and long-lasting hypolimnetic anoxia restrict the benthic macroinvertebrate community radiation and diversification in tropical, oligotrophic, warm monomictic lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aOligochaeta 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3ahydrodynamics 3ahypoxia 3alittoral zone 3amacroinvertebrates 3anational parks 3aMexico 0aBathymetric profile 0aAnoxic hypolimnia 0aChiapas 0aLagunas de Montebello1 aAlcocer, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0535-79361 aOseguera, Luis A.0 tLimnologica.g2021 July, v. 89 p.125888-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2021.1258883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245010100199300001400300500001400314500002000328520176900348592002802117650001102145650001602156650000902172650001402181650002302195650001702218650001202235650001302247650001202260650001602272650001802288650001302306650001402319650001102333650002402344700002202368773012202390856007302512852000902585655001202594IND60724682420221119064055.0210123e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072468242DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.127732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzepiel, Tara M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0879-737910aHypokalemia associated with topical administration of dorzolamide 2% ophthalmic solution in cats  ap. 12-19.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dorzolamide 2% ophthalmic solution on serum potassium and other hematologic parameters in cats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Part I: Medical records from a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criteria consisted of cats diagnosed with glaucoma for which appropriate clinicopathological data were available both prior to and after the initiation of therapy with dorzolamide 2% ophthalmic solution. Part II: Healthy adult cats were enrolled in a prospective double‐masked, randomized, cross‐over study. Either dorzolamide 2% ophthalmic solution or placebo was administered OU t.i.d. for 6 weeks. Serum potassium, sodium, chloride, glucose, ALP, and ALT levels were assessed every 2 weeks. After a 2‐week washout period, each cat was given the opposite topical preparation, and the study process was repeated. RESULTS: Part I: Of the twenty‐seven eligible cases, hypokalemia developed in 29.6% (n = 8). While female spayed cats were significantly more likely to become hypokalemic, serum potassium was not significantly affected by age, weight, dosing frequency, or number of eyes treated. Part II: Ten cats participated in the study. Potassium values were significantly lower in cats receiving dorzolamide 2% ophthalmic solution compared to placebo at each time point throughout the 6‐week study period. Additionally, chloride values were significantly greater in the treatment group at week two and four compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of dorzolamide 2% ophthalmic solution has a measurable effect on serum potassium level in cats and may result in clinical hypokalemia. Therefore, routine electrolyte monitoring is advised for feline patients receiving this medication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood serum 3acats 3achlorides 3across-over studies 3aelectrolytes 3afemales 3aglaucoma 3aglucose 3ahypokalemia 3aophthalmology 3aplacebos 3apotassium 3asodium 3atopical application1 aWasserman, Neal T0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2021 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.12-19dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.127733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010000166300002000266520133500286592002801621650001801649650001601667650001901683650002801702650001601730650001801746650001701764650001501781650001401796650001401810650001301824650002701837700002001864700002401884700002201908700002501930700002501955700006601980773015402046856008302200852000902283655001202292IND60739008120221118053951.0220527e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073900812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11420-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Eliane10aEcotoxicity and genotoxicity assessment of losartan after UV/H2O2 and UVC/photolysis treatments  ap. 23812-23821.  aLosartan potassium (LOS) is one of the most antihypertensives used in the world, and its presence in environmental matrices can cause impacts to biota. In this study, the ecotoxicity and genotoxicity of LOS was assessed before and after treatment by UVC/photolysis and UV/H₂O₂. The photodegradations were carried out at LOS solutions (2.5 mg L⁻¹; 4.6 μM) for 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, and 480 min of treatment. For chromatographic analysis, the samples were submitted to solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by HPLC-DAD. Ecotoxicity bioassays were conducted using Daphnia magna (acute) and Desmodesmus subspicatus (chronic) for all the degradation times. To evaluate the genotoxicity, the comet assay was performed with a D. magna whole organism cell suspension applying the alkaline gel electrophoresis technique. For both process, the degradation rate was over 99% at 30 min, which reduced the acute toxicity of LOS to D. magna. In addition, only the sample treated at 240 min by UV/H₂O₂ showed significant chronic and acute toxicity. However, the genotoxicity effect was observed for samples treated LOS before treatment and at 480 min by UV/H₂O₂. Therefore, even reaching high LOS degradation rates, for both processes, the bioassays demonstrated the importance of ecotoxicological analyses by AOPs treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aDesmodesmus 3aacute toxicity 3aantihypertensive agents 3acomet assay 3aecotoxicology 3agenotoxicity 3aphotolysis 3apollution 3apotassium 3aresearch 3asolid phase extraction1 aNeves, Bruno B.1 aProla, Liziê D.

The evolutionary driver for referential alarm calls has been hypothesized to be the mutually incompatible escape behaviours required to avoid different predators. However, some species produce acoustically distinctive and referential alarm calls but do not show highly referential abilities in other domains. We examined whether food-associated calls in many species are likely to be functionally referential and whether they specifically communicate about characteristic features of food. Food-associated calls are given in both feeding and nonfeeding contexts, and the types of information contained vary greatly. Most species do not produce unique calls for different foods; more common is variation in the call rate, which suggests that call structure reflects the callers’ internal state rather than the food type. We also examined the ultimate function of food-associated calls to evaluate whether there is a unifying explanation for the evolution of functionally referential food calls. Based on the literature, there does not appear to be a unifying function. In conclusion, while functionally referential food-associated calls have been convincingly demonstrated in a few species, it is more common for these vocalizations to reflect arousal rather than additionally providing specific referential information about the feeding event. At this point, there is no compelling hypothesis to explain the evolution of functionally referential food-associated calls. Given the multiple functions of food-associated signals, we should not expect a unitary explanation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantipredatory behavior 3abirds 3aevolution 3afoods 3amammals 3apredators1 aSmith, Carolynn L.1 aBlumstein, Daniel T.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 Feb., v. 83, no. 2 p.323-330dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245009900199300001800298500002000316520131600336592002801652596007201680596003101752596007801783596001301861650001101874650001001885650002001895650001201915650001301927650001201940650001401952650004401966650001402010650001602024650002002040650001302060650001502073650001302088650002002101650002002121650001002141700002402151700001402175700003102189700002302220700002002243700001902263700002202282700002302304700001702327700002002344700001402364700001702378700002002395700001502415700002002430700002902450700002602479700002302505700006102528700006402589773013202653856007902785852000902864655001202873IND60621978220221119075412.0181123e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062197822DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.144162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaly, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6863-253610aDichomitus squalens partially tailors its molecular responses to the composition of solid wood  ap. 4141-4156.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhite‐rot fungi, such as Dichomitus squalens, degrade all wood components and inhabit mixed‐wood forests containing both soft‐ and hardwood species. In this study, we evaluated how D. squalens responded to the compositional differences in softwood [guaiacyl (G) lignin and higher mannan content] and hardwood [syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) lignin and higher xylan content] using semi‐natural solid cultures. Spruce (softwood) and birch (hardwood) sticks were degraded by D. squalens as measured by oxidation of the lignins using 2D‐NMR. The fungal response as measured by transcriptomics, proteomics and enzyme activities showed a partial tailoring to wood composition. Mannanolytic transcripts and proteins were more abundant in spruce cultures, while a proportionally higher xylanolytic activity was detected in birch cultures. Both wood types induced manganese peroxidases to a much higher level than laccases, but higher transcript and protein levels of the manganese peroxidases were observed on the G‐lignin rich spruce. Overall, the molecular responses demonstrated a stronger adaptation to the spruce rather than birch composition, possibly because D. squalens is mainly found degrading softwoods in nature, which supports the ability of the solid wood cultures to reflect the natural environment.  aPublisher supplied data  a824.15.023cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek  a308284cAcademy of Finland  aDE‐AC02‐05CH11231cOffice of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy  cCatchbio 3aBetula 3aPicea 3aenzyme activity 3aforests 3ahardwood 3alaccase 3amanganese 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aperoxidases 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asoftwood 3atranscriptomics 3awhite-rot fungi 3axylan1 aLópez, Sara Casado1 aPeng, Mao1 aLancefield, Christopher S.1 aPurvine, Samuel O.1 aKim, Young‐Mo1 aZink, Erika M.1 aDohnalkova, Alice1 aSingan, Vasanth R.1 aLipzen, Anna1 aDilworth, David1 aWang, Mei1 aNg, Killian,1 aRobinson, Errol1 aOrr, Galya1 aBaker, Scott E.1 aBruijnincx, Pieter C.

The effects of plantations on natural forests  ap. 204-210.  aThe rapid growth in plantation forestry over the past two decades attests to the sector's importance in meeting rising global demand for timber, fuel and fiber. However, plantation forests differ dramatically from natural forests in the types of ecosystem services they can provide. As a result, it is important to understand the aggregate effects of plantation expansion on natural forests. Using a simple partial equilibrium model and a global panel dataset of forest statistics, this paper assesses the impacts of plantation expansion upon the extent of natural forests. The analysis shows that plantation expansion has resulted in a contraction of natural forests dedicated to forest product extraction, but an expansion of un-harvested natural forests and the associated generation of ecosystem services. The model and empirical evidence emphasize, however, that there is significant heterogeneity in this outcome depending upon the own-price elasticity of demand for forest products and, as a result, the trade intensity of the forestry sector. The potential for beneficial effects of plantation expansion on un-harvested natural forests is diminished in countries with trade-oriented forestry sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ademand elasticities 3aecosystem services 3aforest plantations 3aforest products 3aforest statistics 3aforests 3afuels 3amodels 3atrade 0aDeforestation 0aPlantation forests 0aForestry 0aLand use change 0aIntensification0 tEcological economics.g2014 Sept., v. 105 p.204-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03904naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011900164506011700283506007600400520190900476592002802385506003702413650001602450650001102466650002502477650001902502650001202521650002302533650003602556650003202592650002002624650001102644650001602655650001202671651002802683651001202711653002902723653002002752653000702772653001202779653000802791653000902799653000802808653000802816653000902824653000802833653000802841653000902849653000802858653000802866653000702874653001102881653000902892700002002901700001902921700002102940700002202961700001902983700002003002773010403022856008303126852000903209655001203218IND60760126520221207131809.0220321e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076012652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mran.2021.1002002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarra, Dima10aQualitative assessment of the probability of introduction and onward transmission of lumpy skin disease in Ukraine  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLumpy skin disease (LSD) is a transboundary disease affecting bovine animals, which may result in severe economic implications. Ukraine is considered particularly vulnerable to LSD due to its proximity to regions where the virus is circulating. In addition, its ecological and environmental parameters can sustain, in summer, the spread of the disease in case it entered the country. This qualitative risk assessment aimed to investigate the probability that LSD virus is introduced to Ukraine and, if introduced, what would be the probability of onward transmission in the country within the next year. The risk assessment followed the OIE import risk analysis for animals and animal products guidelines and was undertaken with the support of local experts via an expert elicitation workshop. A modified Delphi approach was used to gather experts inputs. The illegally traded cattle was the pathway considered to have the highest probability of LSD introduction; however the probability was estimated to be low. When assessing the probability of an animal being exposed to the virus and further onward transmission in Ukraine, the highest probability estimate was related to flying vectors (high probability). During the expert opinion workshop, the Delphi approach helped to increase the agreement between experts and to assess the uncertainty related to some of the probability estimates. Throughout the risk assessment, some data gaps were identified and highlighted. The lack of reliable data on animal movements and biosecurity in Ukraine were emphasized. Based on the elicited probability estimates, the local experts generated recommendations for risk management practices. To our knowledge, this is the first risk assessment performed on LSDV in Eastern Europe and the conceptual framework adopted can help other countries willing to do a risk assessment in a similar data scarce environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosecurity 3acattle 3adisease transmission 3aexpert opinion 3aimports 3alumpy skin disease 3amicrobiological risk assessment 3aqualitative risk assessment 3arisk management 3asummer 3auncertainty 3aviruses 3aEastern European region 3aUkraine 0aLumpy Skin Disease (LSD) 0aRisk Assessment 0aIE 0aUkraine 0aBTV 0aEFSA 0aEKE 0aFAO 0aGTPV 0aIBR 0aLSD 0aLSDV 0aOIE 0aPCR 0aRA 0aSSFSCP 0aSSPV1 aDe Nardi, Marco1 aLets, Viktoria1 aHolopura, Sergii1 aKlymenok, Oleksiy1 aStephan, Roger1 aBoreiko, Oksana0 tMicrobial risk analysis.g2022 Apr., v. 20 p.100200-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23482x2352-35227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2021.1002003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245007900173300002000252520125500272592002801527596006701555596006301622596004001685596007201725650001301797650001501810650001101825650001801836650001901854650001901873650001501892650001401907650001901921650001301940700002701953700001901980700001801999700001902017700002302036700002602059700006002085700001502145773015402160856008302314852000902397655001202406IND60739008220221118054120.0220527e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073900822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11328-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Ana Sofia10aDiclofenac photodegradation with the Perovskites BaFeyTi1-yO3 as catalysts  ap. 23822-23832.  aPerovskite oxides BaFeyTi₁₋yO₃, with y = 0, 0.6, 0.8 and 1, were prepared by ceramic (CM) and complex polymerization methods (CPM) and utilized in UV-LED (365 nm) photocatalytic degradation assays of 25 mg L⁻¹ diclofenac (DIC) model solutions. BaTiO₃-CM was also used in the photocatalytic degradation test of a real mineral water for human consumption spiked with 2 mg L⁻¹ DIC. The XRD patterns of the synthesized perovskites showed cubic structure for those prepared by CPM, with distortions of the cubic lattice to hexagonal or tetragonal when prepared by CM, except for BaTiO₃. All the perovskites showed good catalytic activity, higher than photolysis, except BaFeO₃-CM that presented similar results. BaTiO₃-CM and CPM and BaFeO₃-CPM were also utilized in UV-LED photocatalytic DIC degradation assays with peroxydisulfate addition. BaFeO₃-CPM and BaTiO₃-CPM showed better ability to persulfate activation, but the highest mineralization degree was obtained with BaTiO₃-CM. This last perovskite was also able to perform DIC degradation in a real matrix. The studied oxides show potentiality for photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds, with or without persulfate addition. A degradation mechanism is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFRH/BD/109901/2015cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aUIDB/00195/2020cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aP2018/EMT-4341cComunidad de Madrid  aIJCI-2017-32682cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades 3aceramics 3adiclofenac 3ahumans 3amineral water 3amineralization 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3apollution 3apolymerization 3aresearch1 aSilveira, Jefferson E.1 aCarbajo, Jaime1 aZazo, Juan A.1 aCasas, Jose A.1 aFernandes, Annabel1 aPacheco, Maria José,1 aCiríaco, Lurdes1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0020-12431 aLopes, Ana0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 19 p.23822-23832dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11328-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012800164300001800292500002000310520149600330592002801826596006001854596005401914596003501968650000802003650002302011650002602034650002502060650001902085650001202104650001702116650002102133650002602154650003002180650002302210650001502233650001602248700001902264700001702283700001602300700002002316773013202336856007902468852000902547655001202556IND60621978320221119075521.0181123e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062197832DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.144042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunon, Vincent10aTargeted metagenomics demonstrates the ecological role of IS1071 in bacterial community adaptation to pesticide degradation  ap. 4091-4111.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIS1071, an insertion element that primarily flanks organic xenobiotic degradation genes in cultured isolates, is suggested to play a key role in the formation and distribution of bacterial catabolic pathway gene clusters. However, in environmental settings, the identity of the IS1071 genetic cargo and its correspondence to the local selective conditions remain unknown. To respond, we developed a long‐range PCR approach amplifying accessory genes between two IS1071 copies from community DNA followed by amplicon sequencing. We applied this method to pesticide‐exposed environments, i.e. linuron‐treated agricultural soil and on‐farm biopurification systems (BPS) treating complex agricultural wastewater, as to non‐treated controls. Amplicons were mainly recovered from the pesticide‐exposed environments and the BPS matrix showed a higher size diversity compared to the agricultural soil. Retrieved gene functions mirrored the main selection pressure as (i) a large fraction of the BPS amplicons contained a high variety of genes/gene clusters related to the degradation of organics including herbicides present in the wastewater and (ii) in the agricultural soil, recovered genes were associated with linuron degradation. Our metagenomic analysis extends observations from cultured isolates and provides evidence that IS1071 is a carrier of catabolic genes in xenobiotica stressed environments and contributes to community level adaptation towards pesticide biodegradation.  aPublisher supplied data  cIWT‐Vlaanderen Strategic Basic Research project 91370  aG.0371.06cFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO)  a222625cEU project METAEXPLORE 3aDNA 3aagricultural soils 3abacterial communities 3abiochemical pathways 3abiodegradation 3alinuron 3ametagenomics 3amultigene family 3apesticide degradation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aselection pressure 3awastewater 3axenobiotics1 aBers, Karolien1 aLavigne, Rob1 aTop, Eva M.1 aSpringael, Dirk0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2018 Nov., v. 20, no. 11 p.4091-4111dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.144043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245007000210300001800280520088700298592002801185650001501213650000801228650001501236650002501251650000901276650001101285650001501296650002001311650001301331650000901344650001101353650001501364650002901379650001601408650001201424650003901436650003001475650006101505650003101566650003201597650002801629650005201657650002701709700002201736700001901758700002101777700002301798700002401821700002401845700001801869773009401887856008101981990002302062852000902085655001202094IND60093856320221117223920.0141104e20110823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009385632DNAL7 a218203112pmid7 aPMC32051162pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.06.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRangan, Prashanth10apiRNA Production Requires Heterochromatin Formation in Drosophila  ap. 1373-1379.  aProtecting the genome from transposable element (TE) mobilization is critical for germline development. In Drosophila, Piwi proteins and their bound small RNAs (piRNAs) provide a potent defense against TE activity. TE targeting piRNAs are processed from TE-dense heterochromatic loci termed piRNA clusters. Although piRNA biogenesis from cluster precursors is beginning to be understood, little is known about piRNA cluster transcriptional regulation. Here, we show that deposition of histone 3 lysine 9 by the methyltransferase dSETDB1 (egg) is required for piRNA cluster transcription. In the absence of dSETDB1, cluster precursor transcription collapses in germline and somatic gonadal cells and TEs are activated, resulting in germline loss and a block in germline stem cell differentiation. We propose that heterochromatin protects the germline by activating the piRNA pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aRNA 3abiogenesis 3acell differentiation 3aeggs 3agenome 3agerm cells 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3aloci 3alysine 3astem cells 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransposons 2aAnimals 2aChromatin Assembly and Disassembly 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDrosophila melanogasterxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHeterochromatinxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Small Interferingxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aMalone, Colin D.1 aNavarro, Caryn1 aNewbold, Sam P.1 aHayes, Patrick S.1 aSachidanandam, Ravi1 aHannon, Gregory J.1 aLehmann, Ruth0 tCurrent biology.g2011 Aug. 23, v. 21, no. 16 p.1373-1379dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.06.0573Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011700173300001600290520122100306592002801527650001901555650001301574650001701587650001801604650001501622650001901637650002301656650001301679650001301692650001801705650002201723650001601745651000901761653001801770653002801788653001501816700002501831700003101856700002501887773013201912856008502044852000902129655001202138IND60595650120221122065459.0180605e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059565012DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2018.14450352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaadatjoo, Behnaz10aAssessment of Variation in Essential Oil Content and Composition within and Among Salvia sp.

The essential oil (EO) content of each specimen was extracted using a Clevenger-type apparatus, and then was characterized by gas chromatography and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry methods. The EO content ranged from 0.03 to 0.5 % (w/w) and 38 components were detected in the samples. The main components were found to be caryophyllene oxide (52.4 %), (E)-caryophyllene (37.7 %), germacrene-B (35.5 %), germacrene-D (23.8 %), α-pinene (17.2 %), bicyclogermacrene (15 %), spathulenol (15 %) and linalool acetate (14.4 %). The relative composition of compounds was used to carry out a chemotaxonomic study on the species using hierarchical cluster analysis. The specimens fell into four chemotype groups based on the seven major constituents. Results showed a significant variation in content and composition of EO both within and among Salvia species. The differences of the EO content and composition of Salvia species could be used to differentiate among the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia syriaca 3aacetates 3aalpha-pinene 3achemotaxonomy 3achemotypes 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography 3ahabitats 3alinalool 3alipid content 3amass spectrometry 3aspathulenol 3aIran 0aEssential oil 0aenvironmental variation 0aSalvia sp.1 aSaeidi, Keramatollah1 aMohammadkhani, Abdolrahman1 aShirmardi, Hamze Ali0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 21, no. 1 p.237-245dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2018.14450353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245007200206520156700278592002801845650001701873650002301890650001801913650001101931650002401942650001901966650001201985653002301997653002802020653002902048653003202077700006002109700005802169700006502227700006302292700002002355700005702375773011502432856008302547852000902630655001202639IND60760126720221121195654.0220207e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076012672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1021142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfonso, Filipa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7360-745010aCommunity perceptions about mangrove ecosystem services and threats  aThe Ecosystem Service Framework discloses the ecosystem’s benefits to society and provides support to preserve threatened systems while considering the economic and social dimensions of the communities more dependent on its resources. Mangroves provide important and valuable goods and services to communities, at different spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, over-exploitation of these resources can generate poverty traps, where rural households can no longer use the ecosystem as a source of food security or income. This study uses three communities that live in surrounding areas of mangroves from São Tomé Island (Diogo Nunes, Angolares, and Malanza) as a case study. The main aim was to evaluate locals’ perspectives about ecosystem use, threats, and conservation. Questionnaires were conducted among local populations and provided valuable information to identify the major beneficiaries of mangrove resources. These results also indicated that the services and threats identified locally are different from those identified in the literature. The importance of considering the impact of local values and traditions in the use of ecosystem resources was also highlighted by the obtained results since São Tomé residents do not acknowledge the existence of services that do not bring a direct benefit. The absence of awareness about mangroves and their threats can cause severe damages to the ecosystem’s health, requiring the implementation of specific awareness-raising policies among populations that interact with mangrove ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3afood security 3aincome 3amangrove ecosystems 3amarine science 3apoverty 0aTransition systems 0aEcological conservation 0aSão Tomé and Príncipe 0aSocio-ecological evaluation1 aFélix, Pedro M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0466-34641 aChainho, Paula1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3539-99421 aHeumüller, Joshua A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8501-46441 ade Lima, Ricardo F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0184-39451 aRibeiro, Filipe1 aBrito, Ana C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6539-58300 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 Jan., v. 49 p.102114-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1021143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245009500202300001400297500001400311500002000325520181700345592002802162650001302190650002202203650000902225650001102234650001802245650001202263650002002275700002302295700001802318700002202336700006602358773012202424856007302546852000902619655001202628IND60724682720221119064212.0210123e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072468272DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.128302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowler, Kourtney K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5309-424510aCharacterization of postoperative “fibrin web” formation after canine cataract surgery  ap. 37-47.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPURPOSE: To describe the occurrence and associated factors for “fibrin web” (FW) formation following phacoemulsification in dogs. METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of all dogs undergoing phacoemulsification (MU‐Veterinary Health Center, 2014‐2018) was conducted to associate FW formation with signalment, systemic co‐morbidities, cataract stage, surgeon (resident vs faculty), phacoemulsification time, IOL, and intracameral injections including viscoelastic type. Both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to evaluate associations among variables with FW formation. RESULTS: Data from 398 eyes on 201 dogs were included; 4 left eyes (4 dogs) developed presumptive endophthalmitis and were excluded from further analysis. Forty‐eight eyes did not have cataract surgery. Hence, 350 eyes on 201 dogs were included in the analyses. Among these, 84 eyes (59 dogs) developed a FW. Univariate analyses showed that the odds of FW increased with age and phacoemulsification time. Additionally, FW web was associated lens type, lens brand, and viscoelastic type. Multivariate analyses showed that when comparing lens types in combination with a particular viscoelastic, viscoelastic impacted the estimated prevalence of FW formation the most. In contrast, when the data were analyzed by lens brand, lens brand impacted prevalence more than viscoelastic type. Diabetes mellitus was not associated with FW formation. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available data, intraocular lens implantation, viscoelastic type, dog age, and phacoemulsification time were associated with FW formation. Diabetes mellitus, gender, cataract stage, surgeon, intracameral injections other than viscoeleastic, and intra‐ and postoperative complications were not associated with FW formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acataract 3adiabetes mellitus 3adogs 3agender 3aophthalmology 3asurgery 3aviscoelasticity1 aMiddleton, John R.1 aDufour, Simon1 aHood, Margaret A.1 aGiuliano, Elizabeth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9874-89350 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2021 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.37-47dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.128303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007000172300001600242520167900258592002801937650001701965650002001982650002002002650001102022650001202033650001302045650001502058700001602073773008802089856008502177852000902262655001202271IND60111826520221119081638.0150812e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011182652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacLean, Evan L.10aBonobos and chimpanzees infer the target of another’s attention  ap. 345-353.  aWe examined the ability of bonobos, Pan paniscus (N=39), and chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes (N=74), to infer the target of an experimenter’s visual attention in a series of three experiments. In each experiment subjects were first introduced to a novel object while an experimenter’s (E1) visual access to this object was manipulated by (1) having E1 orient towards or away from the object, (2) positioning a visual occluder that did or did not block E1’s view of the object, or (3) substituting a different experimenter for E1 during the introduction phase of the trial. After subjects were introduced to the objects in one of these ways, E1 vocalized excitedly while gazing ambiguously towards the previously introduced target object and a second location on the same visual plane. In each experiment we measured whether subjects looked at the object or the alternative target of the E1’s gaze. We predicted that if subjects recognized when E1 was previously familiar with the object, they would search for an alternative target of his attention more frequently in these trials. In all three contexts, chimpanzees, and in one context, bonobos, behaved consistently with this prediction. These results are not easily explained by learning or behaviour-reading hypotheses because responses were never rewarded, few trials were conducted per subject, and the experimenter’s behaviour was the same across experimental conditions at the moment subjects were required to respond. Therefore, similar to human infants, subjects most likely remembered what the experimenter had or had not seen in the past, allowing them to infer the target of his attention in the present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPan paniscus 3aPan troglodytes 3aanimal behavior 3ahumans 3ainfants 3alearning 3aprediction1 aHare, Brian0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 Feb., v. 83, no. 2 p.345-353dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245017000168300001400338520096700352592002801319650002301347650002001370650001401390650002601404650003001430650003701460650000901497650001801506653001301524653000901537653001801546653004401564653003701608700001701645700001901662700001901681700001501700773010401715856008701819852000901906655001201915IND60545742820221118083056.0170719e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054574282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.05.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelnyk, A.10aConcentration and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in surface soil near a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill  ap. 18-27.  aDue to a continuous demand of land for infrastructural and residential development there is a public concern about the condition of surface soil near municipal solid waste landfills. A total of 12 surface (0–20cm) soil samples from a territory near a landfill were collected and the concentration of 16 PAHs and 7 PCB congeners were investigated in these samples. Limits of detection were in the range of 0.038–1.2μg/kg for PAHs and 0.025–0.041μg/kg for PCBs. The total concentration of ∑PAHs ranged from 892 to 3514μg/kg with a mean of 1974μg/kg. The total concentration of ∑PCBs ranged from 2.5 to 12μg/kg with a mean of 4.5μg/kg. Data analyses allowed to state that the PAHs in surface soils near a landfill were principally from pyrogenic sources. Due to air transport, PAHs forming at the landfill are transported outside the landfill. PCB origin is not connected with the landfill. Aroclor 1242 can be the source of PCBs in several samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair transportation 3adetection limit 3alandfills 3amunicipal solid waste 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoil 3asoil sampling 0aLandfill 0aSoil 0aContamination 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)1 aDettlaff, A.1 aKuklińska, K.1 aNamieśnik, J.1 aWolska, L.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 530-531 p.18-27dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.05.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245009100214300001600305520118100321592002801502650002201530650002501552650002501577650002301602650001101625650002701636653002801663653002401691653001601715653001101731653001201742653002101754773010301775856008701878852000901965655001201974IND60537812420221120072333.0190405e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053781242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaunders, Harry D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0429-951610aToward a neoclassical theory of sustainable consumption: Eight golden age propositions  ap. 220-232.  aPopular trends in ecological economics increasingly consign neoclassical economics to the sidelines of modern-day relevancy. The neoclassical tradition is often seen as reliant for its authenticity on a presumption of human avarice – both unbridled consumerism and corporate cupidity – and demanding for its real-world applicability an assumption of continuous economic growth in a world of hard limits.This article examines the question of whether neoclassical theory could instead provide keys to deeper understanding of sustainable consumption. By combining in a single framework neoclassical growth theory, general equilibrium theory and duality theory – and by explicitly considering leisure time – the analysis demonstrates that neoclassical economics yields several useful insights bearing on long-term sustainability. The analysis confirms several tenets of ecological economics and challenges others.Eight propositions emerge from this analysis that could help speed the development of a robust neoclassical theory of sustainable consumption, here branded “golden age” propositions as they strongly echo the “Golden Rule” discoveries of Edmund Phelps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer behavior 3aecological economics 3aeconomic development 3aequilibrium theory 3ahumans 3aneoclassical economics 0aSustainable consumption 0aNeoclassical growth 0aGolden Rule 0aPhelps 0aLeisure 0aResource rebound0 tEcological economics.g2014 Sept., v. 105 p.220-232dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012500169300001600294520110500310592002801415596011401443650003401557650002501591650002701616650002101643650002701664650003101691650002101722650002901743650002501772650001401797650002501811650001801836650001901854650002801873650001001901650004101911650002201952650001101974650001301985650003501998650004402033651001102077653002102088653001802109653001102127653001002138653001602148653001802164700002402182700002202206700001902228700002302247700002602270773013202296856008502428852000902513655001202522IND60595650420221122065423.0180605e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059565042DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2018.14496682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarin, Marija10aWild Thymus capitatus Hoff.

Chemical Composition, Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Activities of the Essential Oil  ap. 388-399.  aThe composition of the essential oil (EO) obtained by hydrodistillation from the leaves of Thymus capitatus Hoff. et Link. growing wild in Sythonia (Greece) was analysed by GC-FID, GC-MS and quantitative ¹H NMR spectroscopy. Thirty nine compounds were identified, representing approximately 99.0% of the oil. Major component determined by GC-FID was carvacrol (81.8%), followed by linalool (3.5%) and (E)-caryophyllene (3.5%). Abundance of carvacrol determined by quantitative ¹H NMR spectroscopy was 74.9% and was in reasonable agreement with GC-FID result. The oil was tested for the antioxidant activity in DPPH assay and showed a dose dependent free radical scavenging activity with EC₅₀ value of 1.03 μg/ml. Antimicrobial effect of the EO was tested against Gram negative, Gram positive bacteria, and fungi. The tested EO showed significant activity against fungi, especially S. cerevisiae. The most sensitive bacteria were E. coli ATCC 25922, E. fecalis and S. epidermidis. Human pathogen Burkholderia cepacia, ATCC 25416 was used in the investigation of T. capitatus for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data  aResearch projects 172058,Research projects 172053cMinistry of Science and Technologies of Republic of Serbia 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3aCoridothymus capitatus 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aanimal pathogens 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3acarvacrol 3achemical composition 3adose response 3aessential oils 3afree radical scavengers 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrodistillation 3aleaves 3alinalool 3amedian effective concentration 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aGreece 0aThymus capitatus 0aessential oil 0aGC-FID 0aGC-MS 0aantioxidant 0aantimicrobial1 aNovakovic, Miroslav1 aVučković, Ivan,1 aTeševic, Vele1 aKolarevic, Stoimir1 aVukovic-Gacic, Branka0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 21, no. 2 p.388-399dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2018.14496683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012600170300001400296520193400310592002802244650001902272650002502291650001202316650001702328650002302345650001102368650002002379650001702399650002002416650003102436650001602467650004202483650003602525650002202561650001902583650001402602650001102616650001202627650001402639653001802653653002002671653002002691653003202711653002202743653001802765700001702783700001502800773011902815856008802934852000903022655001203031IND60636622720221121063130.0190509e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063662272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZha, Lingyan10aDynamic Responses of Ascorbate Pool and Metabolism in Lettuce to Long-term Continuous Light Provided by Red and Blue LEDs  ap. 15-23.  aTo understand the dynamic changes of lettuce growth, ascorbate pool and metabolism under long-term red and blue continuous light (CL, 24/0 h, 200 μmol·m−2·s−1), growth parameters, ascorbate pool size, as well as activities and gene expression levels of key enzymes involved in the ascorbate metabolism in lettuce leaves were investigated every 3 days during 15 days. In comparison with normal photoperiod (Control, 16/8 h, 200 μmol·m−2·s−1), lettuce plants gained greater shoot fresh weight and dry matter under CL, which depended more on specific leaf weight than leaf area. Both reduced ascorbate (AsA) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) contents were remarkably enhanced by CL and keep a relatively stable level during the experiment. The consistent greater contents of AsA and DHA were respectively attributed to the up-regulation of L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase and ascorbate peroxidase activity rather than their gene expression. Although glutathione contents and glutathione reductase activities were elevated by CL, their contribution to AsA regeneration was limited on account of similar activity and expression level of dehydroascorbate reductase with control. In addition, H2O2 content was also raised obviously under CL compared with control, but it was maintained at a relative safety and stable level from day 6. Fluorescence imaging results also showed that CL did not induce oxidative damage on lettuce leaves compared with control. It is concluded that lettuce plants grown under red and blue continuous light for 15 days obtained greater shoot biomass and ascorbate pool size without leaf injury, and 9 days was the most cost-effective duration for yield improvement from an energy standpoint. Ascorbate accumulation under continuous light was primarily and rapidly regulated by the enzymes involved in AsA biosynthesis and oxidation at enzymatic activity level rather than gene expression level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimage analysis 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alettuce 3aoxidation 0aAscorbic acid 0aEnzyme activity 0aGene expression 0aAscorbate-Glutathione cycle 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aPlant factory1 aZhang, Yubin1 aLiu, Wenke0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2019 July, v. 163 p.15-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245006700211300001800278506007600296520048900372592002800861506003700889650001500926650001600941650002200957653002300979653002101002653001701023653001401040653002001054700002301074700002101097700002101118773008101139856008101220852000901301655001201310IND60529230520221207094809.0170719e20160630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052923052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.02.0592doi7 aPMC49869992pmcid7 a275469162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstipona, Benzi I.10aCatalytic enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-eucomic acid  ap. 3707-3712.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA catalytic enantioselective synthesis of (+)-eucomic acid is reported.

To achieve this goal, the following requirements for designing carbon/metal compound composites need to be met: (i) the carbon materials need to exhibit suitable specific surface area, void structure, and electrical conductivity; (ii) the weight content of the metal compounds should be low; and (iii) the metal compounds need to show a strong adsorption and efficient electrocatalytic function for LiPSs. In this study, inspired by the body structure of an octopus, a new carbon/NiS₂ hierarchical composite is reported, in which the apical NiS₂ nanoparticles (0D) on a 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are supported on a three-dimensional carbon (3DC) framework (3DC-CNTs-NiS₂). The 3DC-CNTs-NiS₂ composite has a high specific surface area (271 m² g–¹), good electrical conductivity, and low NiS₂ content (9.2 wt %), and the apical NiS₂ nanoparticles are capable of adsorption and electrocatalysis toward LiPSs, demonstrated by both electrochemical characterization and theoretical calculation. When used as a cathode host of the Li-S battery, it exhibits an ultra-stable cycling performance with a fade rate of 0.043% per cycle over 1000 cycles; even with a high S loading (6.5 mg cm–² with 90 wt % of S), the soft package battery delivers a high area capacity of 5.0 mAh cm–² under the E/S ratio of 5 μLE mg–¹ₛ. This work provides a new approach to design and fabricate multi-functional S hosts with high S loading.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium batteries 3ananoparticles 3asulfides 3asulfur 3asurface area 0ahierarchical architecture 0athree-dimensional carbon framework 0aCNTs 0aelectrocatalysis 0alithium sulfur batteries1 aZhen, Biao,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6181-21551 aQin, Kaiqiang1 aZhang, Rui1 aTang, Yu1 aLiu, Enzuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3331-25321 aShi, Chunsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3374-14491 aHe, Chunnian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5768-65981 aZhao, Naiqin0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Mar. 20, v. 12, no. 15 p.17528-17537dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c016403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010700164300001800271520069000289592002800979650002301007650002301030650001501053650001501068653003001083653002501113653001601138653002901154653004501183700002001228700001901248773008101267856008101348852000901429655001201438IND60529230620221119223407.0161019e20160421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052923062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.02.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dehui10aGeneral and cost-effective synthesis of 1-heteroaryl/arylcycloalkylamines and their broad applications  ap. 1941-1953.  aA general and cost-effective route has been developed to synthesize 1-heteroarylsubstituted cycloalkylamines from readily available heteroarylacetate in good yields.

In coastal environments where mariculture activities are developed, the physicochemical interactions between the water column and the sedimentary layer are intensified, promoting an intense influence on the P cycle. Here, we aim to evaluate the different P species in the surface sedimentary layer of an important mariculture area, Armação do Itapocoroy Bay, located in southern Brazil. Thirty-four samples of surface sediments were collected along the bay and sequential extractions were performed to determine five P species using the SEDEX method. The mean concentrations of the five P species observed in the collected samples were 28.62 ±8.08μg g⁻¹ for exchangeable or loosely adsorbed P (Ads-P); 1.59 ±0.71μg g⁻¹ for Fe-bound P (Fe-P); 208.0 ±19.29μg g⁻¹ for authigenic apatite/biogenic apatite CaCO ₃-bound P (Ca-P); 1.17 ±0.64μg g⁻¹ for detrital P (Det-P); and 1.82 ±1.19μg g⁻¹ for organic P (Org-P). The spatial distribution showed the impact of the shellfish farming on the composition of the different fractions of P, mainly in Ca-P, Ads-P, Fe-P and Org-P, while Det-P content showed to be more related to continental sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3amariculture 3amarine science 3aphosphorus 3ashellfish 3aBrazil 0aPhosphorus speciation 0aMussel farming 0aSedimentary phosphorus 0aArmação do Itapocoroy Bay1 aKuroshima, Kátia Naomi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4261-98781 aAbreu, José Gustavo Natorf1 aManzoni, Gilberto Caetano0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 Jan., v. 49 p.102137-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1021373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009900170520151500269592002801784650001301812650001501825650001201840650001401852650003501866650003101901650001801932650001301950650001301963650001501976650001401991650003302005650001502038650001302053650001802066650002002084653003402104653002002138700001402158700001402172700002002186700005302206773012202259856008802381852000902469655001202478IND60742977320221118135159.0210708e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074297732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1045652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Weiwei10aRelationship between ionomics and transcriptomics of rice plant in response to arsenite stress  aPaddy rice cultivated in flooded fields tends to accumulate more arsenic than other terrestrial crops. Ionomic profiling and transcriptomic variations of rice plants were investigated to understand the molecular mechanism used to counteract arsenite [As(III)] stress. The total concentrations of 29 elements in the rice shoots and roots under control and As(III) stress conditions were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Ionomic differences between rice tissues under different conditions were identified through principal component analysis. Compared to their external conditions, the genomic composition plays a more important role in rice ionomics. In the transcriptome analyses, a total of 3812 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the As(III)-treated shoots compared to the control shoots. The significant DEGs generated by gene ontology enrichment analysis were mainly associated with transmembrane transporters and ion binding, which were directly correlated with ionomics. Upregulation of transporter genes correlated with nutrient elements was observed, indicating that the rice plants tended to translocate more nutrients, such as potassium, phosphate and ammonium, to cope with As(III) toxicity. Transcriptomics also showed overexpression of aquaporins and ABC transporters for detoxification of As(III) in rice plants. Further investigation is necessary for a deeper insight into the molecular mechanism involved in the ionomics of rice plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aaquaporins 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenomics 3aionomics 3aphosphates 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3arough rice 3atoxicity 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aDifferentially expressed gene 0aStress response1 aLiu, Peng1 aWang, Kai1 aYang, Zhaoguang1 aWang, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0778-44720 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2021 Sept., v. 189 p.104565-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1045653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014800206300001600354520144500370592002801815650001901843650003501862650002101897650002101918650001001939650003001949650002601979650002202005650001002027650001202037650001802049650001002067650001602077650001102093650001802104650002002122650001202142651001202154700006402166773013402230856008302364852000902447655001202456IND60767335320221121022015.0220323e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076733532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-021-02428-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Kevin M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9928-135310aDetection of the Phoma pathogens Plenodomus biglobosus subclades ‘brassicae’ and ‘canadensis’ on wasabi, and ‘canadensis’ in Europe  ap. 751-756.  aPhoma stem canker / blackleg is an internationally important disease of Brassicas including B. napus (oilseed rape, OSR), caused by multiple genetic subclades of the fungi Plenodomus lingam (formerly Leptosphaeria maculans) and P. biglobosus (L. biglobosa). In Spring 2021, Phoma-like disease symptoms were observed on leaves and stems of Eutrema japonicum (wasabi) crops at three UK sites (Northern Ireland, Southern England and the West Midlands). Fungal isolation from wasabi leaf spots yielded colonies with two distinct phenotypes on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolates from the Northern Ireland and Southern England sites had white colonies with abundant pink cirri that were confirmed (based on ITS rDNA, beta tubulin and actin sequences) as P. biglobosus subclade ‘canadensis’ (Pbc). Those from the West Midlands site, however, had yellow pigmented colonies and were confirmed by sequencing as P. biglobosus subclade ‘brassicae’ (Pbb). Greenhouse pathogenicity testing showed that Pbb and Pbc wasabi isolates were pathogenic not only to this host but also OSR, B. oleracea (cabbage), and B. rapa (pak choi). Re-isolation of the fungi was attempted and confirmed from lesions that developed on inoculated OSR and wasabi, thus completing Koch’s postulates. These findings represent new discoveries for both Pbb and Pbc on wasabi, plus for Pbc in Europe. The crop health implications of these results are briefly considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aEutrema japonica 3aNorthern Ireland 3aPhoma 3aPhoma stem canker disease 3aPlenodomus biglobosus 3aPlenodomus lingam 3aactin 3acabbage 3aculture media 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathology 3atubulin 3aEngland1 aWest, Jonq(Jon S.),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5211-24050 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2022 Mar., v. 162, no. 3 p.751-756dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-021-02428-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245017800205300001800383500002000401520141200421592002801833650002701861650002701888650001401915650001301929650001601942650002301958650001701981650001501998650001302013650001302026650001902039650001402058700001802072700005902090773013202149856007902281852000902360655001202369IND60621979020221119080022.0181123e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062197902DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.143512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Filipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6828-177212al‐Rhamnosylation of wall teichoic acids promotes efficient surface association of Listeria monocytogenes virulence factors InlB and Ami through interaction with GW domains  ap. 3941-3951.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWall teichoic acids (WTAs) are important surface glycopolymers involved in various physiological processes occurring in the Gram‐positive cell envelope. We previously showed that the decoration of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) WTAs with l‐rhamnose conferred resistance against antimicrobial peptides. Here, we show that WTA l‐rhamnosylation also contributes to physiological levels of autolysis in Lm through a mechanism that requires efficient association of Ami, a virulence‐promoting autolysin belonging to the GW protein family, to the bacterial cell surface. Importantly, WTA l‐rhamnosylation also controls the surface association of another GW protein, the invasin internalin B (InlB), that promotes Lm invasion of host cells. Whereas WTA N‐acetylglucosaminylation is not a prerequisite for GW protein surface association, lipoteichoic acids appear to also play a role in the surface anchoring of InlB. Strikingly, while the GW domains of Ami, InlB and Auto (another autolysin contributing to cell invasion and virulence) are sufficient to mediate surface association, this is not the case for the GW domains of the remaining six uncharacterized Lm GW proteins. Overall, we reveal WTA l‐rhamnosylation as a bacterial surface modification mechanism that contributes to Lm physiology and pathogenesis by controlling the surface association of GW proteins involved in autolysis and infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aautolysis 3abacteria 3agametolysin 3alipoteichoic acids 3apathogenesis 3aphysiology 3aproteins 3arhamnose 3ateichoic acids 3avirulence1 aSousa, Sandra1 aCabanes, Didier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4001-13320 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2018 Nov., v. 20, no. 11 p.3941-3951dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.143513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245019500181300001300376520158000389592002801969650002201997650002902019650002802048650002502076650001102101650002402112650001902136650001902155650002202174650002402196650000902220650001902229650002102248650001302269653002202282653000902304653001402313653001702327653002202344700002302366700002102389700002102410700002302431773012902454856008502583852000902668655001202677IND60595650920221122082143.0180605e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059565092DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2018.14543432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Hameed, El-Sayed S.10aChemical Composition and Biological Activity of Mentha longifolia L. Essential Oil Growing in Taif, KSA Extracted by Hydrodistillation, Solvent Free Microwave and Microwave Hydrodistillation  ap. 1-14.  aEssential oils of aromatic plants as an important phytochemical class have been recognized for many years as a great source of pharmaceutical agents and food additives. There are many factors influencing the chemical composition of the essential oils including extraction techniques. In this project, the effect of extraction methods (hydrodistillation, microwave assisted hydrodistillation and solvent free microwave extraction) of Mentha longifolia L. growing in Taif, KSA on the yield and chemical composition of their essential oils were investigated. In addition, anticancer and antimicrobial activities of essential oils obtained were determined. The results showed no great difference between the oil yield obtained by the three different methods, but the methods used microwave were rapid, saving time and energy than the hydrodistillation method. The qualitative chemical compositions of the three oils for each species were similar with little quantitative differences of some compounds between the three methods. The oils consist mainly from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in which pulegone was the main component. All essential oils showed high antibacterial activity and moderate in vitro anticancer activity. In conclusion, this considered the first study represented the effect of microwave extraction in the chemical composition of M. longifolia essential oil growing in Taif, KSA. The authors recommended the usage of the microwave method in the extraction of mint essential oil because it is energy and time saving, in addition to environmentally friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMentha longifolia 3aantibacterial properties 3aantineoplastic activity 3achemical composition 3aenergy 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3afood additives 3ahydrodistillation 3amicrowave treatment 3amint 3amonoterpenoids 3asesquiterpenoids 3asolvents 0aMentha longifolia 0aTaif 0amicrowave 0asolvent free 0ahydrodistillation1 aSalman, Mahmood S.1 aFadl, Mohamed A.1 aElkhateeb, Ahmed1 aHassan, Mohamed M.0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 21, no. 1 p.1-14dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2018.14543433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011000171300001600281520201500297592002802312650001202340650001302352650001702365650001302382650001002395650001102405650002402416650001602440650001102456650002602467650001902493650001202512650002202524700002202546700001902568700002102587700003002608773008802638856008502726852000902811655001202820IND60111827120221119081807.0150812e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011182712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiegel, Adam J.10aOvarian regulation of foraging division of labour in Africanized backcross and pollen-hoarding honeybees  ap. 653-658.  aDivision of labour (i.e. differential task performance) is the hallmark of social insects. One highly studied component of honeybee division of labour is foraging specialization through collection of protein (pollen) or carbohydrates (nectar). The reproductive ground plan hypothesis proposes that this foraging division of labour is regulated by the same physiological control networks that controlled foraging behaviour during the reproductive life cycle of solitary honeybee ancestors. Based on observed differences in foraging behaviour and reproductive anatomy between bees selected for storing high and low quantities of pollen (high and low pollen-hoarding strains) and observed differences between wild-type pollen and nectar foragers, the reproductive ground plan hypothesis suggests that ovary size in facultatively sterile worker honeybees has a regulatory effect on variation in foraging division of labour, with increased protein bias correlated with increased ovary size (measured as ovariole number). An alternative explanation for the link between ovary size and foraging behaviour is that genes for ovarian development and foraging are inherited together because of genetic linkage or chance gene associations in the selected and natural populations. To address this alternative explanation, we investigated the relationship between ovary size and foraging bias in honeybees where genetic linkage was broken using a backcross mating design. We also studied high- and low-strain bees where ovary size effects were partitioned from other potential linkage effects. We found that ovariole number was related to foraging bias in the backcross bees and in the selected strains, as predicted by the reproductive ground plan hypothesis. An interaction effect between nectar sugar concentration and ovariole number was observed in the backcross and high-strain bees. This result suggests a potential mechanism by which the ovary affects sucrose perception, which in turn influences foraging behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aancestry 3abackcrossing 3aforaging 3agenes 3anectar 3aovarian development 3aplant ovary 3apollen 3areproductive behavior 3asocial insects 3asucrose 3aworker honey bees1 aKaftanoglu, Osman1 aFondrk, M.

This study assessed the impact of Carmenta mimosa, a stem‐mining moth, introduced into northern Australia as a biological control agent of mimosa Mimosa pigra. Litter fall, seed banks, vegetation cover, density and age structure of mimosa stands were compared using data collected at nine sites where Carmenta mimosa was present and eight sites where it was initially absent. 2 Mimosa seed rain was negatively correlated with Carmenta mimosa damage and declined by more than 90% at the highest Carmenta mimosa densities. Seed banks also declined with Carmenta mimosa damage. 3 Percentage cover of competing vegetation was significantly higher under stands defoliated by Carmenta mimosa and this inhibited mimosa seedling establishment and apparently increased the susceptibility of mimosa to fire, by increasing fuel loads beneath stands. 4 Four of the eight stands where Carmenta mimosa was absent expanded and none contracted. In contrast, none of the nine stands where Carmenta mimosa was present expanded and three contracted. Analysis of the age structure of mimosa stands indicated that contracting stands were typified by an absence of seedling regeneration. 5 In contrast to previous studies, no impact could be attributed to the flower feeder Coelocephalapion pigrae or to the stem‐mining moth Neurostrota gunniella, whilst the bruchid Acanthoscelides puniceus consumed up to only c. 10% of seed. However, it is argued that, while these agents are unlikely to suppress dense mimosa thickets, they may reduce the rate mimosa can expand. 6 Synthesis and applications. By preventing stand regeneration, Carmenta mimosa is predicted to cause widespread reductions in mimosa populations and should therefore be redistributed to areas of mimosa where it is absent. Differences between the age structures of stands with Carmenta mimosa present may highlight how biological control could succeed for a suite of woody legume weeds with long‐lived seed banks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3amoths 3aMimosa pigra 3aage structure 3abiological control agents 3afuel loading 3aseed dispersal 3aseedlings 3aflowers 3avegetation cover 3aweeds 3alegumes 3aAcanthoscelides 3abiological control 3aAustralia 0acontracting0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2005 Dec., v. 42, no. 6 p.1054-1062dBlackwell Science Ltdx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01105.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245011100211300001800322520133300340592002801673650002301701650001801724650001501742650001201757650001701769650001201786650003001798650001101828650001901839650001301858650001801871650002901889650002701918650002401945650001501969650001101984650003601995650004202031650001202073650002302085650002002108650003402128700003102162700002002193700002102213700002102234700002502255700002402280773009502304856008102399990002302480852000902503655001202512IND60093857020221118030718.0141104e20110913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009385702DNAL7 a218852822pmid7 aPMC31753352pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeaver, Lesley N.10aKif18A Uses a Microtubule Binding Site in the Tail for Plus-End Localization and Spindle Length Regulation  ap. 1500-1506.  aThe mitotic spindle is a macromolecular structure utilized to properly align and segregate sister chromatids to two daughter cells. During mitosis, the spindle maintains a constant length, even though the spindle microtubules (MTs) are constantly undergoing polymerization and depolymerization [1]. Members of the kinesin-8 family are important for the regulation of spindle length and for chromosome positioning [2–9]. Kinesin-8 proteins are length-specific, plus-end-directed motors that are proposed to be either MT depolymerases [3, 4, 8, 10, 11] or MT capping proteins [12]. How Kif18A uses its destabilization activity to control spindle morphology is not known. We found that Kif18A controls spindle length independently of its role in chromosome positioning. The ability of Kif18A to control spindle length is mediated by an ATP-independent MT binding site at the C-terminal end of the Kif18A tail that has a strong affinity for MTs in vitro and in cells. We used computational modeling to ask how modulating the motility or binding properties of Kif18A would affect its activity. Our modeling predicts that both fast motility and a low off rate from the MT end are important for Kif18A function. In addition, our studies provide new insight into how depolymerizing and capping enzymes can lead to MT destabilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding properties 3abinding sites 3achromatids 3aenzymes 3amicrotubules 3amitosis 3amitotic spindle apparatus 3amodels 3apolymerization 3aproteins 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aChromosome Positioning 2aComputer Simulation 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aKinesinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicrotubulesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMitosis 2aModels, Biological 2aProtein Binding 2aSpindle Apparatusxmetabolism1 aEms-McClung, Stephanie C.1 aStout, Jane R.1 aLeBlanc, Chantal1 aShaw, Sidney L.1 aGardner, Melissa K.1 aWalczak, Claire E.0 tCurrent biology.g2011 Sept. 13, v. 21, no. 17 p.1500-1506dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009000171300001600261520178900277592002802066650001702094650001502111650002002126650001602146650001202162650001002174650001902184650001702203700002102220700001902241700001902260700002302279773008802302856008502390852000902475655001202484IND60111827220221119081750.0150812e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011182722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurbeck, Martin10aMate competition, testosterone and intersexual relationships in bonobos, Pan paniscus  ap. 659-669.  aVariation in male testosterone levels across and within species is known to be related to mating systems, male dominance rank and aggression rates. When aggression enhances access to mates, dominance status and androgen levels correlate positively. Deviation from this pattern is expected when access to females is determined by factors other than male dominance or when high androgen levels interfere with nonaggressive forms of male reproductive strategies such as paternal care and pair bonding. Bonobos offer an interesting study species to test the relationship between male dominance, aggression and intersexual relationships. On the one hand, males form dominance hierarchies and compete for access to females and mating success varies with rank. On the other hand, males and females are equally dominant, male rank is not only the result of aggression, and strong intersexual relationships might be crucial to male reproductive success. We used behavioural and physiological data from wild bonobos to test relationships between behavioural correlates of mate competition and androgen levels. Aggression and rank were positively correlated, as were aggression and mating success. In the presence of potentially fertile females, male aggression increased but only low-ranking, less aggressive males showed increases in testosterone levels, which consequently tended to be negatively related to rank. High-ranking males who had lower testosterone levels and were less responsive in their testosterone increase were more often involved in friendly relationships with unrelated females. These results suggest that, in bonobos, amicable relationships between the sexes rather than aggressive interactions mediate males’ physiological reactivity during periods of mate competition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPan paniscus 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3acorrelation 3afemales 3amales 3amating systems 3atestosterone1 aDeschner, Tobias1 aSchubert, Grit1 aWeltring, Anja1 aHohmann, Gottfried0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 Mar., v. 83, no. 3 p.659-669dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245015900181300001600340520177200356592002802128650001202156650001902168650001202187650001902199650002502218650002302243650002902266650002102295650001102316650001102327650001602338651001002354653001902364653002202383653002402405653002302429653002902452700002702481700002002508700002802528700001902556700003302575773010602608856008702714852000902801655001202810IND60545743720221118082107.0170719e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054574372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.05.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía de León, David10aDisentangling the effects of feedback structure and climate on Poaceae annual airborne pollen fluctuations and the possible consequences of climate change  ap. 103-109.  aPollen allergies are the most common form of respiratory allergic disease in Europe. Most studies have emphasized the role of environmental processes, as the drivers of airborne pollen fluctuations, implicitly considering pollen production as a random walk. This work shows that internal self-regulating processes of the plants (negative feedback) should be included in pollen dynamic systems in order to give a better explanation of the observed pollen temporal patterns. This article proposes a novel methodological approach based on dynamic systems to investigate the interaction between feedback structure of plant populations and climate in shaping long-term airborne Poaceae pollen fluctuations and to quantify the effects of climate change on future airborne pollen concentrations. Long-term historical airborne Poaceae pollen data (30years) from Cordoba city (Southern Spain) were analyzed. A set of models, combining feedback structure, temperature and actual evapotranspiration effects on airborne Poaceae pollen were built and compared, using a model selection approach. Our results highlight the importance of first-order negative feedback and mean annual maximum temperature in driving airborne Poaceae pollen dynamics. The best model was used to predict the effects of climate change under two standardized scenarios representing contrasting temporal patterns of economic development and CO2 emissions. Our results predict an increase in pollen levels in southern Spain by 2070 ranging from 28.5% to 44.3%. The findings from this study provide a greater understanding of airborne pollen dynamics and how climate change might impact the future evolution of airborne Poaceae pollen concentrations and thus the future evolution of related pollen allergies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoaceae 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3aevapotranspiration 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahypersensitivity 3amodels 3apollen 3atemperature 3aSpain 0aDynamic system 0aAllergies-weather 0aAnnual Pollen Index 0aMediterranean area 0aClimate change scenarios1 aGarcía-Mozo, Herminia1 aGalán, Carmen,1 aAlcázar, Purificación1 aLima, Mauricio1 aGonzález-Andújar, José L.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 530-531 p.103-109dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.05.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002400188245011400212300001100326506007600337520094500413592002801358506003701386650002301423650002101446650002401467650002401491650001101515650001901526650001701545650002101562650001201583650002201595650002101617700002501638700002201663773010601685856008201791852000901873655001201882IND60572678220221207105653.0220831e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057267822DNAL7 aPMC54280882pmcid7 a284445912pmid7 a10.1007/s13205-017-0646-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDussadee, Natthawud10aBiotechnological application of sustainable biogas production through dry anaerobic digestion of Napier grass  ap. 47.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNapier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), represents an interesting substrate for biogas production. The research project evaluated biogas potential production from dry anaerobic digestion of Napier grass using batch experiment. To enhance the biogas production from ensiled Napier grass, thermal and alkaline pre-treatments were performed in batch mode. Alkali hydrolysis of Napier grass was performed prior to batch dry anaerobic digestion at three different mild concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The study results confirmed that NaOH pretreated sample produced high yield of biogas than untreated (raw) and hot water pretreated samples. Napier grass was used as the mono-substrate. The biogas composition of carbon dioxide (30.10%), methane (63.50%) and 5 ppm of H₂S was estimated from the biogas. Therefore, fast-growing, high-yielding and organic matter-enriched of Napier grass was promising energy crop for biogas production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCenchrus purpureus 3aalkali treatment 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy crops 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amethane 3aresearch projects 3asodium hydroxide1 aRamaraj, Rameshprabu1 aCheunbarn, Tapana0 t3 Biotech.g2017 May, v. 7, no. 1 p.47-47dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0646-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245015400177300001300331520111200344592002801456650001701484650002301501650001701524650001301541650002401554650001401578650001501592650001501607650001101622650002301633650002101656650001701677650001301694653002401707653002201731653001701753653002001770653002001790700002601810773009901836856008701935852000902022655001202031IND60537813320221120062017.0190405e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053781332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrésard, Marjolaine10aSustainable harvest of a native species and control of an invasive species: A bioeconomic model of a commercial fishery invaded by a space competitor  ap. 1-11.  aBiological invasions are nowadays an important challenge to biodiversity and human welfare. This paper deals with the control of an invasive species, void of market value, and acting as a space competitor for a valuable native harvested species. It presents a theoretical bioeconomic model describing the interacting dynamics of the two species and accounting for the undesirable consequences of native stock harvesters' behaviour on the spread of invasion. Dynamic optimisation of the model displays the existence of a time-path leading to an optimal stationary steady-state solution where the native species is sustainably harvested and the invasive species is kept under control, provided unit costs of native species harvesting and of invaded areas cleaning are quite low, natural and anthropogenic dispersal coefficients of invasion, and time-discount rate are moderate. Moreover, the problem should be addressed early enough. The model is applied to the Bay of Saint-Brieuc scallop fishery invaded by slipper-limpet. We show that it is nearly always optimal to control the invasion in that case study.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abioeconomic models 3acase studies 3acleaning 3aecological invasion 3afisheries 3aharvesters 3aharvesting 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amarket value 3ascallops 0aBiological invasion 0aSpace competition 0aBioeconomics 0aOptimal control 0aScallop fishery1 aRopars-Collet, Carole0 tEcological economics.g2014 Oct., v. 106 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012800170300001600298520083400314592002801148596008901176650001901265650002801284650001201312650002301324650003301347650001601380650001301396650001801409650003101427650001401458650002001472650001001492651001001502700002001512700001901532773013401551856008201685852000901767655001201776IND60767335920221122034434.0220323e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076733592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-021-02429-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xiang-rong10aOccurrence of Pestalotiopsis lushanensis causing leaf blight on Buddhist pine in China [Erratum: May 2022, v.163(1); p.255]  ap. 655-665.  aBuddhist pine (Podocarpus macrophyllus) is a widely cultivated evergreen tree species with high ornamental and economic value. Recently, severe leaf blight on Buddhist pine was detected in Anhui Province, China. Seven single-spore isolates obtained from symptomatic samples were identified as Pestalotiopsis lushanensis on the basis of morphology and multilocus (internal transcribed spacer region, translation elongation factor 1-α and β-tubulin) phylogenetic analysis. Pathogenicity tests of potted Buddhist pine seedlings revealed that regardless of whether a conidial suspension or mycelial disk was used, inoculation of P. lushanensis could result in leaf blight symptoms similar to those observed in the field.. These results have important implications for further research on targeted prevention and control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aKYCX20_0875cPostgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province 3aPestalotiopsis 3aPodocarpus macrophyllus 3aconidia 3aeconomic valuation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf blight 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathology 3atrees 3aChina1 aZhang, Mao-jiao1 aChen, Feng-mao0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2022 Mar., v. 162, no. 3 p.655-665dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-021-02429-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245011800215520146500333592002801798650002901826650001201855650001201867650000901879650001801888650000901906650000901915650000901924650001101933650000901944651002201953651001201975653002201987653001702009653002702026653003802053653002702091700002702118700006602145700001902211700002302230773014802253856008502401852000902486655001202495IND60649434820221119223442.0200819e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064943482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1092572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanait, Andrei Marian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7278-844810aDisentangling dust and sand deposition using a peat record in CE Europe (northern Romania): A multiproxy approach  aAeolian sediments play an important role in the global climatic system and occur in the atmosphere due to soil and bedrock erosion. Here, we applied three different methods: geochemical (XRF), manual and laser-based particle size analysis to an ombrotrophic peat profile in the Carpathian Mountains to determine changes in aeolian deposition and wind/storm activity over the last 7800 years. The results show the following changes in aeolian fluxes (dust and sand) over time: 7800–4150 cal. yr BP – generally low dust fluxes with a periodic intensification of sand fluxes; 4150–2300 cal. yr BP – intense deposition of both dust and sand; 2300–150 cal. yr BP – fluctuating dust and sand fluxes; the last 200 years – the highest amplitude of both sand and dust fluxes. This study found that patterns in aeolian fluxes were influenced by a combination of climate and human impact, but with anthropogenic drivers, such as disturbance by fire, becoming more important in recent times. We also found a good agreement with other studies of dust fluxes for the earlier part of this record, but an increasing divergence over the last 3500 years. In terms of a methodological approach, we suggest that the three approaches each have both advantages and disadvantages; though overall laser-based particle size dust and sand reconstruction appears to best capture the most complex changes in both aeolian deposition rates and sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abedrock 3aclimate 3adust 3aparticle size 3apeat 3asand 3asoil 3astorms 3awind 3aCarpathian region 3aRomania 0aAeolian particles 0aGeochemistry 0aParticle size analysis 0aManual counting of sand particles 0aParticulate mineralogy1 aHutchinson, Simon Mark1 aDiaconu, Andrei-Cosmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0958-48181 aTanţău, Ioan1 aFeurdean, Angelica0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 532 p.109257-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1092573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245014300208300001800351520110200369592002801471650001701499650001201516650000901528650001701537650001401554650003701568650001201605650001701617650003801634650000901672650000901681650003301690650004301723650003901766650003601805700002201841700001901863700002101882700002101903773010901924856008102033990002302114852000902137655001202146IND60090696020221121065651.0141102e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009069602DNAL7 a223415722pmid7 aPMC32985712pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiley, Jenny L.10aSynthesis and pharmacology of 1-alkyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indoles: Steric and electronic effects of 4- and 8-halogenated naphthoyl substituents  ap. 2067-2081.  aTo develop SAR at both the cannabinoid CB₁ and CB₂ receptors for 3-(1-naphthoyl)indoles bearing moderately electron withdrawing substituents at C-4 of the naphthoyl moiety, 1-propyl and 1-pentyl-3-(4-fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo-1-naphthoyl) derivatives were prepared.

Recently many investigations have focused mainly on the region of the Tibetan Plateau and Tian Shan Mountains. Dendroclimatological field research in the western and central parts of the Pamir-Alay Mountains was conducted in the summer of 2015, within glacial cirques at elevations above 3000 m. On the basis of 49 juniper samples with northern exposures, warm season (May–September) Tₘᵢₙ values were reconstructed from 1301 to 2015 a.d. The reconstruction explains 53.6% of the actual temperature variance during the period 1941–1990. On the basis of the newly-developed paleoclimatological record, the time and duration of the MWP, TP, and LIA was established for the Pamir region. Close agreement between other temperature-related proxy records suggest that the reconstruction is highly reliable and captures the regional cold/warm periods of Central Asia. Therefore, the results of this study can contribute to understanding historical temperature changes in the Pamir region and its surroundings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acold 3adendroclimatology 3agrowth rings 3amountains 3apaleoclimatology 3asummer 3atemperature 3avariance 3awarm season 3aCentral Asia 3aChina 0aCentral Asia 0aTajikistan 0aJuniperus semiglobosa 0aDendrochronology 0aClimate variability 0aPaleoclimatology0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 532 p.109248-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1092483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010200153300001800255520080400273592002801077650001601105650002401121650001101145650002301156650000901179650002201188650001901210650002101229650001501250700001601265700001501281700001401296700001401310700001701324700001801341700001401359700001601373773013301389856007401522852000901596655001201605IND60646379620221121120555.0190610e20190606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064637962DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc02971k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yang10aAmine-induced phase transition from white phosphorus to red/black phosphorus for Li/K-ion storage  ap. 6751-6754.  aAn amine-induced phase transition strategy is developed for converting white phosphorus into red or black phosphorus. Amorphous red phosphorus is prepared through the chemical dissolution of white phosphorus in amines and post-treatment at room temperature. It is demonstrated that the phase transformation mechanism involves an amine-induced nucleophile attack on white phosphorus and the generation of polyphosphorus ions. The amorphous phosphorus exhibits a specific capacity of 955.5 mA h g⁻¹ at 1.5 A g⁻¹ after 1000 cycles, and a capacity retention of 1210.2 mA h g⁻¹ even at 20 A g⁻¹ for Li-ion batteries. This methodology is also applicable to produce red phosphorus micro-spheres and black phosphorus particles by varying the types of organic amines and the reaction temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aambient temperature 3aamines 3achemical reactions 3aions 3alithium batteries 3amicroparticles 3aphase transition 3aphosphorus1 aJiang, Song1 aQian, Yong1 aHan, Ying1 aZhou, Jie1 aLi, Tieqiang1 aXi, Longchang1 aLin, Ning1 aQian, Yitai0 tChemical communications.g2019 June 6, v. 55, no. 47 p.6751-6754dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc02971k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01774naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009900154300002000253520065900273592002800932650001500960650001200975650001300987650001501000650001701015700001701032700001601049700001701065700001901082700001701101700001801118700001601136700001201152700001701164773012401181856007401305852000901379655001201388IND60640995120221118100607.0190505e20160805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064099512DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra14574d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Haili13aAn interfacial defect-controlled ZnO/PbS QDs/ZnS heterostructure based broadband photodetector  ap. 74575-74581.  aAn in situ successive ionic layer adsorption and deposition method is introduced for fabrication of PbS QDs-on-ZnO heterostructures, which improves carriers transport within PbS QDs by eliminating the introduction of ligands.

Field survey and emergy analysis were employed to investigate the operation situation of the straw collection, transportation and storage system based on the case of Laifa Straw Recycling Company. In the condition of collecting 2 × 10⁸ kg of straw production, the emergy input of the artificial model of the company was 173.02 × 10¹⁸ sej, which was higher than the emergy input of the mechanical model, 148.11 × 10¹⁸ sej. According to the emergy indicator system, the mechanical model had a high development degree of internal resources and environment, high productivity, high sustainable development ability, but a lower proportion of renewable resource emergy input than the artificial model. The emergy value of 1 kg commercial straw calculated from the commercial price was 0.25 × 10¹² sej, which was only one third of the average input of the company to produce 1 kg commercial straw (0.74 × 10¹²–0.87 × 10¹² sej). It was difficult for straw recycling company to survive in the market due to the low price of the commercial straw. Therefore, the government was suggested to take effective economic policies to support local straw recycling enterprises.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aemergy 3amarkets 3amechanical models 3apower generation 3aprices 3astraw 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3atransportation 3aChina 0aStraw collection 0aTransportation and storage system 0aEmergy indicator system 0aEmergy analysis 0aArtificial model 0aMechanical model1 aWang, Yapeng1 aYang, Bin1 aZheng, Zipeng1 aWang, Chun1 aChen, Bo1 aLi, Suiliang1 aYing, Jilai1 aLiu, Xinping1 aMa, Yukun,1 aMu, Wenlong0 tEnergy.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 231 p.120792-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1207923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013600171300001600307520097700323592002801300650001701328650001201345650001401357650002501371650001501396650002101411650002001432650001301452651001001465651001101475653002801486653001901514653001501533653001501548653001101563653001001574700002001584773011301604856008601717852000901803655001201812IND60581226720221118132928.0180831e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058122672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsenhour, Cindy10aDecoupling and displaced emissions: on Swedish consumers, Chinese producers and policy to address the climate impact of consumption  ap. 320-329.  aNew developments in consumption-based emissions accounting suggest that the reductions claimed by wealthy, environmentally progressive nations have often come at the expense of increased emissions elsewhere – and thus net growth in global GHG concentrations. This paper traces Sweden's attempts to translate growing recognition of displaced emissions into national environmental policy. Drawing on multi-sited ethnographic research and policy analysis in Sweden and China, we argue that while the logical implications of consumption-based analyses point to the need to address production and consumption as an integrated system, complex governance challenges and the political precariousness of these ideas have thus far limited policy to the reinvention of consumer awareness campaigns and an international extension of long-standing ecological efficiency efforts. We argue that consumption-based emissions indicators justify more ambitious demand-side policy response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropology 3aclimate 3aemissions 3aenvironmental policy 3agovernance 3agreenhouse gases 3apolicy analysis 3apolitics 3aChina 3aSweden 0aSustainable consumption 0aClimate policy 0aDecoupling 0aEfficiency 0aSweden 0aChina1 aFeng, Kuishuang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 134 p.320-329dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012000169300001400289500001900303520169800322592002802020650000802048650001402056650001902070650002402089650001602113650002802129650002002157650001302177650002402190650001402214650002002228650002602248650001302274653000802287653001002295653001302305653001402318653000802332700003402340700002402374700002202398700001802420700003302438700003002471700002602501700002602527700002102553700003402574700005902608773008802667856008502755852000902840655001202849IND60696255420221119121756.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069625542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2020.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jong Hyun10aVitexin abrogates invasion and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma cells through targeting STAT3 signaling pathway  ap. 58-68.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major malignancy that stands second in terms of global cancer-related mortality. STAT3 has been described as a latent transcription factor that promotes tumorigenesis. This study was designed to examine the effect of vitexin on STAT3 signaling and important hallmarks of cancer. HCC cells were employed to decipher the impact of vitexin on activation of STAT3 signaling using Western blotting, EMSA, immunocytochemistry, and reporter assay. The combinational apoptotic effects of vitexin with approved anti-cancer drugs was examined by live-dead assay, and its anti-invasive potential was studied using matrigel assay. The results obtained in cell-based assays were verified using in silico analysis. Vitexin effectively inhibited sustained activation of JAK1, JAK2, Src, and STAT3 in HCC cells. Vitexin downregulated DNA binding ability, reduced the nuclear pool of STAT3, and diminished epidermal growth factor (EGF)–driven STAT3 gene expression. Interestingly, treatment with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor altered the vitexin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, and the attenuation of STAT3 by vitexin was found to be driven through the upregulation of PTPεC. The combinational studies indicated that vitexin can exhibit substantial apoptotic effects with doxorubicin and sorafenib. It also suppressed the CXCL12-induced cell invasion. The results of cell-based assays are supported by in silico analysis as the vitexin displayed favorable interaction with kinase domain of JAK2 protein. Overall, this study demonstrated that vitexin can act as a potential blocker of the STAT3 signaling cascade and mitigate the survival as well as invasion of HCC cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acomputer simulation 3adoxorubicin 3aepidermal growth factor 3agene expression 3ahepatoma 3aimmunocytochemistry 3amortality 3aphosphorylation 3atranscription factors 3atyrosine 0aHCC 0aSTAT3 0aInvasion 0aMigration 0aPTP1 aMohan, Chakrabhavi Dhananjaya1 aShanmugam, Muthu K.1 aRangappa, Shobith1 aSethi, Gautam1 aSiveen, Kodappully Sivaraman1 aChinnathambi, Arunachalam1 aAlahmadi, Tahani Awad1 aAlharbi, Sulaiman Ali1 aBasappa, Salundi1 aRangappa, Kanchugarakoppal S.1 aAhn, Kwang Seok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2882-06120 tBiochimie.g2020 Aug., v. 175 p.58-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2020.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013100156300002000287520116700307592002801474650001401502650002101516650001301537650001301550650002101563650001401584650001101598650001301609700001701622700001701639700001601656700001801672700001801690700001801708773012501726856007401851852000901925655001201934IND60640995220221118100933.0190505e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064099522DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra14581g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xing10aOxidized multiwall carbon nanotube modified separator for high performance lithium–sulfur batteries with high sulfur loading  ap. 89972-89978.  aRecently, researchers have demonstrated that a thin conductive coating on a separator toward the cathode side of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries can improve their electrochemical performance significantly. However, their experimental data are mostly based on cathodes with low sulfur mass loading, while the practical application of Li–S cells requires cathodes with high sulfur loading (≥4 mg cm⁻²) and high sulfur content (≥70 wt%). Thus, research on the effects of such coatings on Li–S cells with high sulfur loading is essential. Herein, we demonstrate the effectiveness of an oxidized multiwall carbon nanotube (o-MWCNT) coating (0.4 mg cm⁻²) for improving the electrochemical performance of cathodes with sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm⁻². Due to the physical and chemical trapping of polysulfides, efficient electron conduction and fast ion transport induced by the coating, the fabricated Li–S batteries show dramatically improved specific discharge capacities of up to 925 mA h g⁻¹ (the areal capacity of the cathode is 4.6 mA h cm⁻²) at a current density of 100 mA g⁻¹ after 50 cycles; they also show good rate performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon nanotubes 3acathodes 3acoatings 3aelectrochemistry 3aoxidation 3asulfur 3atrapping1 aWang, Weikun1 aWang, Anbang1 aYuan, Keguo1 aJin, Zhaoqing1 aYang Yusheng,1 aZhao, Xiuying0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 6, no. 92 p.89972-89978dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra14581g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011600171300001600287520217900303592002802482650002202510650001702532650002102549650002202570650002302592650001502615650001302630650001502643650001102658650001202669650001902681651001102700653001502711653002102726653002102747653002502768653002602793700002702819700002202846700003102868773010002899856008602999852000903085655001203094IND60584907120221119051549.0190412e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058490712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoussel, Fabien10aTesting the applicability of ecosystem services mapping methods for peri-urban contexts: A case study for Paris  ap. 504-514.  aThrough their semi-natural and agricultural areas, peri-urban regions are pivotal in providing ecosystem services (ES) to city dwellers. To quantify the ES provided by these areas, it is possible to use ES mapping methods: many ES mapping methods rely on land cover maps, but most maps are coarse compared to the peri-urban scale. Nevertheless, readily-available land use data and methods are often used to map ES at such scales, without contextualisation. As a result, such methods may not be able to capture the diversity that is present in the peri-urban vegetation, which could have consequences for their accuracy and furthermore for urban planning policies.To increase our understanding of the applicability of ES mapping methods in peri-urban regions, we assessed to what degree sites with similar plant composition in the green belt of Paris, France, were also projected to have similar ES bundles. We considered two commonly used ES model types: proxy-based models (here: look-up tables) and phenomenological models. We used 252 sites for which botanical survey data were available and applied the ES models to seven ES relevant in the peri-urban context. A cluster analysis was used to group sites, hence facilitating analyse of the spatial congruence between types of vegetation and bundles of ES.Clustering sites based on plant composition revealed six distinct clusters. Clustering sites based on ES bundles as estimated by phenomenological models and proxy-based models, resulted in four and two clusters, respectively. The proxy-based clustering only highlighted broad-leaved forests as an important ES supply source. The phenomenological model estimates of ES allowed a more nuanced clustering of sites into four different groups. The level of congruence between the different sets of clusters based on plant composition and estimated ES bundles was low. Except for forests, the commonly used ES models tested here were not able to represent the same level of heterogeneity in the peri-urban landscape as was found in the vegetation. Our results demonstrate the need to integrate finer scale approaches and primary data in ES assessments of peri-urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3acluster analysis 3adeciduous forests 3aecosystem services 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3asurveys 3aurban planning 3aFrance 0aVegetation 0aBotanical survey 0aCluster analysis 0aGreen infrastructure 0aPeri-urban ecosystems1 aSchulp, Catharina J.E.1 aVerburg, Peter H.1 avan Teeffelen, Astrid J.A.0 tEcological indicators.g2017 Dec., v. 83 p.504-514dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011200167300001600279520118900295592002801484650001001512650001301522650001901535650001101554650001901565650002001584650002201604650002301626650001001649650002201659650001801681650001901699650001301718650001301731650000901744650001301753650001701766650002401783650002701807650002101834650001101855651001001866653001901876653001701895653003101912653002301943653002001966700005601986700001302042700002602055700001602081700001702097700001802114700001602132700001202148700001402160700001702174773009602191856008702287852000902374655001202383IND60580918720221122174209.0181002e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058091872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhijie10aEffects of snow absence on winter soil nitrogen dynamics in a subalpine spruce forest of southwestern China  ap. 107-113.  aThe lack of snow cover due to winter climate change has great potential to impact winter soil nitrogen cycling in boreal forests. A snow manipulation was conducted in a Tibetan spruce forest to explore the effects of snow absence on winter soil nitrogen dynamics by shelter method. Snow absence on average reduced soil temperatures at the depths of 0cm and 5cm by 1.44°C and 0.33°C, respectively, throughout the winter. Moreover, snow absence increased soil frost and freeze-thaw cycles. Soil net nitrogen mineralization and labile nitrogen pools (ammonium, nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen) were higher in the snow absence plots compared to control plots. Snow absence increased soil microbial biomass carbon but did not affect microbial biomass nitrogen. Nevertheless, soil enzyme activities involved in nitrogen cycles were often lowered by snow absence over the winter. The results noted in this study suggest that warming-induced absence in seasonal snowpack may stimulate winter soil nitrogen availabilities by changing soil microhabitats, which has important implications for soil biogeochemical cycles in the subalpine forest ecosystems on the eastern Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea 3aammonium 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aenzyme activity 3aforest ecosystems 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afrost 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrohabitats 3amineralization 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asoil enzymes 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asoil temperature 3awinter 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aSnow absence 0aSoil nitrogen availability 0aMicrobial property 0aEnzyme activity1 aYang, Wanqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4399-29141 aYue, Kai1 aJustine, Meta Francis1 aHe, Ruoyang1 aYang, Kaijun1 aZhuang, Liyan1 aWu, Fuzhong1 aTan, Bo1 aZhang, Li1 aXu, Zhenfeng0 tGeoderma.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 307 p.107-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010300161300002000264520198400284592002802268650001302296650001602309650001102325650001502336650002202351650001002373650002002383650001002403650002802413650000902441650001202450650001002462650001602472650001402488650002102502650001702523650001202540650001602552650001502568650001202583653002302595653001502618653000902633653001902642653001602661700001702677700002802694700002002722700001902742700002202761700001902783773015702802856007902959852000903038655001203047IND60713021520221122131556.0210201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071302152DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2020-189772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbaslou, Y.10aShort communication: Performance of Holstein calves fed high-solid milk with or without nucleotide  ap. 11490-11495.  aOur initial hypothesis was that the exogenous supply of nucleotides to neonatal calves would improve the development and functionality of gastrointestinal tissue, thereby enhancing their capacity to efficiently digest and utilize the nutrients in high-solids milk. Twenty 3-d-old male Holstein calves (37.9 ± 2.24 kg of body weight) were distributed randomly to 1 of 2 treatments (1 calf per pen; 10 pens per treatment) without or with added nucleotides to their daily milk. Dry milk powder was added to pasteurized milk and offered as 4 L/d from d 3 to 15, 6 L/d from d 16 to 49 (at 0900 and 1600 h), and 2 L/d in morning feeding from d 50 to 55. High-solids milk (fat = 4.47%, protein = 4.64%, lactose = 8.13%, and total solids = 17.7%) was made through the addition of milk powder into whole milk and supplemented without or with 2 g/d of a commercially available nucleotide product, and then fed until weaning. Nucleotide supplementation had no effect on preweaning growth rate, but tended to increase postweaning daily weight gain (d 56–75). Unexpectedly, nucleotide supplementation tended to increase fecal score within the 10 d of calf life; thereafter (until weaning), no difference was detected in fecal consistency. Nucleotide supplementation tended to increase and increased pre- and postweaning dry matter intake, respectively. Efficiency of feed utilization (kilogram of weight gain per kilogram of dry matter intake) was not influenced with treatment. The net gain (d 1–70) of withers height and hip height tended to be greater in nucleotide-fed calves. Overall, addition of nucleotides to the high-solids milk had marginal effects on preweaning performance and tended to increase fecal scores (looser feces) in the initial phase of life; however, it increased starter feed intake and growth rate after weaning. A longer-feeding experiment is recommended to elucidate the potential effects of nucleotide supplementation in high-solids milk on calf performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abody weight 3acalves 3adried milk 3adry matter intake 3afeces 3afeed conversion 3afeeds 3agastrointestinal system 3ahips 3alactose 3amales 3anucleotides 3anutrients 3apasteurized milk 3atotal solids 3aweaning 3aweight gain 3awhole milk 3awithers 0agrowth performance 0anucleotide 0acalf 0astarter intake 0apostweaning1 aMahjoubi, E.1 aAḥmadī, Faraj Allah,1 aFarokhzad, M.R.1 aZahmatkesh, D.1 aYazdi, M.

In this study, we reported the OCFA and BCFA concentrations in colostrum and transition milk and their stability after heating or freezing treatments (or both), which are processes commonly applied in dairy calf management. Milk samples were collected from 12 Holstein dairy cows (6 primiparous and 6 multiparous) at the first milking (colostrum), fifth milking (transition milk), and ninth milking (mature milk) after calving, respectively, and were used for fatty acid analysis using gas chromatography. The sum concentration of OCFA and BCFA (termed OBCFA) was 134 mg/100 g of milk in the colostrum, which was 24% and 35% lower than that in the transition milk and mature milk, respectively. Among these fatty acids detected, C15:0 and C17:0 were the top 2 abundant fatty acids in all milk types, accounting for 20 to 25% and 21 to 24% of the total concentration of OBCFA, respectively. Additionally, anteiso-C17:0 was the most abundant BCFA, followed by iso-C17:0, anteiso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C18:0, and iso-C14:0 in 3 types of milk. Significant interactions between milk type and cow parity were observed for all OCFA and BCFA concentrations. The milk samples were also treated with heating (at 65°C for 60 min), freezing (at −20°C for 30 d), and heating and freezing (at 65°C for 60 min and then at −20°C for 30 d), and milk OCFA and BCFA concentrations were similar between these treatments. In conclusion, the OBCFA concentration was lower in colostrum, compared with transition and mature milks, and it remained stable after heating and freezing treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aanimal and human health 3abranched chain fatty acids 3acalving 3acow colostrum 3adairy calves 3adairy cows 3afatty acid composition 3afreezing 3agas chromatography 3aheat 3amilk 3amilking 3aodd chain fatty acids 0aodd-chain and branched-chain fatty acids 0acolostrum 0atransition milk 0astability1 aXu, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7587-21941 aChen, Yanhong1 aChen, Guanqun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5790-39031 aSteele, Michael A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6941-62051 aGuan, Le Luo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8420-43710 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Dec., v. 103, no. 12 p.11483-11489dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-189943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012400165520133900289592002801628650000901656650001901665650001101684650000901695650001501704650002101719650001501740653003401755653003701789653002101826653003201847653002601879700001901905700001801924700001501942700001601957700001401973700001701987773009102004856008502095852000902180655001202189IND60737738720221120035942.0220103e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073773872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1208332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Lihua10aAnalysis on wind power accommodation ability and coal consumption of heat–power decoupling technologies for CHP units  aThe traditional combined heat and power (CHP) units restrict the operational flexibility and causes serious wind power curtailment. To study the wind power accommodation ability and coal consumption, a new method is proposed to calculate the heat–power characteristic of CHP units with different decoupling technologies. A series of mathematical models are established to quantitatively compare the wind power accommodation ability, coal consumption and pollutant emissions. The results show that the minimum electric power of traditional CHP units can be decreased equipped with a heat storage tank only under high heating load but it can be decreased when installed with an electric boiler and high pressure-low pressure (HP-LP) bypass heating under any heating load. With the increase of heating load, the wind power accommodation ability of CHP units with three typical decoupling technologies decreases. The amount of coal consumption of CHP units with HP-LP bypass heating saves twice more than with electric boiler, and saves 30 times more than with heat storage tank. Furthermore, HP-LP bypass heating technology can reduce pollutant emissions efficiently. In engineering practice, the optimal decoupling technology should consider the CHP unit self condition, wind power load, electric power generation and heating demands.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aheat 3apollutants 3apower generation 3awind power 0aCombined heat and power (CHP) 0aWind power accommodation ability 0aCoal consumption 0aHeat–power characteristic 0aDecoupling technology1 aWang, Zhanzhou1 aPan, Tongyang1 aDong, Enfu1 aHu, Pengfei1 aLiu, Miao1 aMa, Tingshan0 tEnergy.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 231 p.120833-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1208333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245007300211300001600284520126200300592002801562650002101590650001801611650001501629650001701644650001201661650001301673650001501686651001001701653001001711653001101721653001701732653001101749653003301760700001801793700005601811773011301867856008601980852000902066655001202075IND60581227020221118133001.0180831e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058122702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThøgersen, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0613-806210aHow stable is the value basis for organic food consumption in China?  ap. 214-224.  aThe objective this paper is to investigate whether a solid and stable value base exists in China for buying organic food, and which values that might be. We study the stability of the value basis for buying organic food in China by means of two surveys with ordinary Chinese consumers collected in 2009 (n = 529) and 2012 (n = 478) outside supermarkets selling organic food in Guangzhou, China. Consistent with previous studies in Western countries, we find that the attitude towards buying organic vegetables is related to the value type Schwarz terms “Universalism” and when Universalism is controlled, no other values increase explained variance. The value–attitude and the attitude–behavior relationships for organic vegetables are significant at both times and are not significantly different between the two time points. However, contrary to what we expected, the studied behavior (purchase of organic vegetables) is significantly related to basic values only in 2009, but unrelated in 2012. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of a sustainable consumption pattern in China and specifically for consumers adopting “green” solutions invented in the west, sometimes referred to as “green leap frogging”.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood consumption 3aorganic foods 3apurchasing 3asupermarkets 3asurveys 3avariance 3avegetables 3aChina 0aChina 0aValues 0aOrganic food 0aSurvey 0aStructural equation modeling1 aZhou, Yanfeng1 aHuang, Guang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1929-15680 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 134 p.214-224dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245004400165500001900209520110800228592002801336650001101364650001201375650001901387650001801406650002501424650001501449650001301464650001901477653002801496653003101524653002601555653001901581700002601600773009401626856008401720852000901804655001201813IND60696255820221119120217.0200726e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069625582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1114992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBento, Nuno10aDeterminants of internal carbon pricing  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAction against climate change is urgent and requires the participation of firms. The progressive internalization of carbon costs by firms is essential in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Internal carbon pricing is an emerging set of practices voluntarily adopted by companies to embed climate footprint in operations and business models. We explore the factors that explain the adoption of internal carbon prices (ICP) among global companies reporting to the Carbon Disclosure Project between 2015 and 2017. We specifically test whether the macroeconomic, regulatory, industry, and firm-specific characteristics affect the disclosed level of the ICPs. Results show that the ICPs depend to a large extent on the national climate policy, country's development, industry, and corporate governance. Furthermore, context explain more the differences in ICP than industry and firm-specific characteristics. Thus uncertainties around countries' climate policy hampers carbon pricing in business. These findings shed light on the factors that contribute to the dissemination of carbon pricing in society.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental policy 3agovernance 3aindustry 3amacroeconomics 0aEnvironmental economics 0aCorporate environmentalism 0aInternal carbon price 0aClimate policy1 aGianfrate, Gianfranco0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Aug., v. 143 p.111499-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1114993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245015600174506010400330506007600434520199900510592002802509506003702537650001402574650001002588650001302598650001502611650002202626650001702648650001602665653001902681653002402700653001902724653002402743653002102767653001202788653001802800700002102818700002602839773011202865856008402977852000903061655001203070IND60782667820221207071239.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078266782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e022202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFröhlich, Arkadiusz10aUrbanization filters woodpecker assemblages: Habitat specialization limits population abundance of dead wood dependent organisms in the urban landscape  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough urban landscapes are regarded as unsuitable for dead wood dependent organisms, some species, including woodpeckers, commonly occur in cities. As the availability of trees and dead wood resources is a primary dimension of the habitat-niche for most woodpeckers, we hypothesized that increasing habitat specialization (decreasing habitat-niche-volume) would limit species abundance within an urban landscape. We surveyed the woodpecker assemblage in the urban landscape, and for seven species we quantified the habitat-niche relying on four dimensions (the availability of trees, snags, fallen logs and dead tree branches). Then, we analysed the habitat preferences and habitat-niche partitioning of the woodpecker assemblage. For each species, we calculated the habitat-niche-volume and tested whether this trait correlated with species abundance in the urban landscape. Woodpeckers selected habitats with a high availability of either trees or dead wood (especially dead tree branches). The habitat-niches partially overlapped, but varied between species in terms of the availability of trees, dead tree branches, snags or fallen logs. The habitat-niche-volume varied among species and was positively associated with species abundance in the urban landscape. The regional abundance of species, body size and relative brain size did not affect the abundance of urban woodpecker populations. Our study highlights that urbanization filters woodpecker assemblages by limiting habitat-specialists and promoting habitat-generalists. We suggest that the alteration of woodpecker assemblages in the urban landscape may have a cascading effect on entire assemblages of dead wood dependent organisms, including cavity-nesters, saproxylic insects and wood-decomposing fungi. Urban development, which limits dead wood resources, is therefore a serious threat to biodiversity, whereas sustainable management of urban green spaces, e.g. the preservation of dead wood, may mitigate biodiversity loss.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody size 3abrain 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aspecies abundance 3aurbanization 3awoodpeckers 0aCavity-nesters 0aCoarse woody debris 0aCrown deadwood 0aDead standing trees 0aNiche dimensions 0aPicidae 0aUrban ecology1 aHawryło, Paweł1 aCiach, M.q(Michał),0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2022 Oct., v. 38 p.e02220-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e022203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245004700174520126700221592002801488650001201516650001301528650002501541650001201566650001201578650001301590650000801603650001201611650001401623650001601637651002101653651001501674700002001689700002201709773013301731856008501864852000901949655001201958IND60649435720221119223901.0200819e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064943572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1092512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLüning, Sebastian,14aThe Medieval Climate Anomaly in Antarctica  aThe Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) is a well-recognized climate perturbation in many parts of the world, with a core period of 1000–1200 CE. Here we are mapping the MCA across the Antarctic region based on the analysis of published palaeotemperature proxy data from 60 sites. In addition to the conventionally used ice core data, we are integrating temperature proxy records from marine and terrestrial sediment cores as well as radiocarbon ages of glacier moraines and elephant seal colonies. A generally warm MCA compared to the subsequent Little Ice Age (LIA) was found for the Subantarctic Islands south of the Antarctic Convergence, the Antarctic Peninsula, Victoria Land and central West Antarctica. A somewhat less clear MCA warm signal was detected for the majority of East Antarctica. MCA cooling occurred in the Ross Ice Shelf region, and probably in the Weddell Sea and on Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. Spatial distribution of MCA cooling and warming follows modern dipole patterns, as reflected by areas of opposing temperature trends. Main drivers of the multi-centennial scale climate variability appear to be the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which are linked to solar activity changes by nonlinear dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aMirounga 3acarbon radioisotopes 3aclimate 3acooling 3aglaciers 3aice 3aislands 3asediments 3atemperature 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aGałka, Mariusz1 aVahrenholt, Fritz0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 532 p.109251-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1092513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245006400167520133600231592002801567650001901595650001901614650001601633650002201649650001201671650001101683651001101694651001801705651001601723653003501739653002801774653001901802653002001821653001201841700001201853700001601865700001601881700001501897700002601912773009401938856008402032852000902116655001202125IND60696255920221119120036.0200726e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069625592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1115212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontoya, L.G.10aMeasuring inefficiency in international electricity trading  aInterconnectors reduce the cost of supplying electricity if they are operated efficiently. We show that established metrics which are used to monitor electricity trading inefficiency are inaccurate for several typical trading conditions. We propose two new metrics—the Unweighted and Price-Weighted Inefficient Interconnector Utilisation indices—to address these deficiencies. These metrics are substantially more accurate than existing ones and perform equally well whether or not interconnected markets have coupled trading. Our analyses show a substantial decrease in inefficient trading between Great Britain (GB) and both France and the Netherlands after the European Union's market coupling regulations were introduced in 2014.In view of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, we evaluate how uncoupling GB's market would affect cross-border trade. We find that uncoupling would lead to inefficiencies in trade, with the electricity price differential between GB and France (Netherlands) rising by 2% (0.6%), net imports into GB decreasing by 22% (6%), congestion income decreasing by 6% (1.5%), and infra-marginal surplus decreasing by 25% (9%). Should the EU decide to implement an equivalent carbon tax to GB's Carbon Price Floor, congestion income would decrease. Uncoupling markets would magnify this decrease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon markets 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aimports 3aincome 3aFrance 3aGreat Britain 3aNetherlands 0aElectricity trading efficiency 0aCross-border allocation 0aInterconnector 0aMarket coupling 0aMetrics1 aGuo, B.1 aNewbery, D.1 aDodds, P.E.1 aLipman, G.1 aCastagneto Gissey, G.0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Aug., v. 143 p.111521-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1115213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245014900167300002000316520152900336592002801865650004401893650002201937650001801959650001401977650002101991650001902012650001602031650002802047650002102075650001502096650002002111650002102131650001702152650001802169650001902187650001402206650004402220650000702264650001402271650001302285650002102298650003702319650003702356650001902393700002302412700001902435700002802454773012302482856007402605852000902679655001202688IND60667552820221119055038.0190919e20150519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066755282DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05803a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanthi, Krishnamurthy10aFabrication of a pH responsive DOX conjugated PEGylated palladium nanoparticle mediated drug delivery system: an in vitro and in vivo evaluation  ap. 44998-45014.  aEfficient delivery of therapeutics into tumor cells to increase the intracellular drug concentration is one of the key issues in cancer therapy. In this work, we designed pH responsive PEGylated palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) as an anticancer drug nanocarrier system for effective drug delivery. The synthesis of the nanocarrier involved conjugation of doxorubicin (DOX) to the surface of PEGylated PdNPs via a hydrazone interaction. The nanoparticles were characterized by UV-spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), zeta potential, Fourier transmission Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The drug release behavior was subsequently studied at different pH conditions. The results showed a sustained release of DOX preferentially at the desired endosomal pH (5.5). The biological activity of the DOX conjugated PEGylated PdNPs was studied by an MTT assay, fluorescence microscopy, and apoptosis. Intracellular-uptake studies revealed preferential uptake of these NPs into HeLa cancer cells. The in vitro apoptosis study revealed that the DOX conjugated PEGylated PdNPs caused significant death to the HeLa cells. Further, blank PEGylated PdNPs displayed low toxicity and good biocompatibility. DOX conjugated PEGylated PdNPs had the strongest anti-tumor efficacy against HeLa tumor xenograft models in vivo. These findings demonstrated that PEGylated PdNPs were deemed as a potential drug nanocarrier for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatibility 3acancer therapy 3adoxorubicin 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrazones 3ain vivo studies 3alight scattering 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apalladium 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential1 aVimala, Karuppaiya1 aGopi, Dhanaraj1 aKannan, Soundarapandian0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 19, v. 5, no. 56 p.44998-45014dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05803a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002400173245008200197300001400279500001500293520137200308592002801680650002101708650001801729650001401747650001901761650001901780650001601799650001001815650002601825650002201851650001401873650001201887650002901899650002401928650001901952650002101971653001401992653001402006700002302020700001902043700002302062700002302085773009702108856005502205852000902260655001202269IND50065335820221119104518.0130419e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006533582DNAL7 a239558242pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2012.01540.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaim, Rafaela M.

They are of medical importance because they are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease in the Americas. In recent years, the RNA interference (RNAi) technology has emerged as a practical and useful alternative means of studying gene function in insects, including triatomine bugs. RNAi research in triatomines is still in its early stages, several issues still need to be elucidated, including the description of the molecules involved in the RNAi machinery and aspects related to phenotype evaluation and persistence of the knockdown in different tissues and organs. This review considers recent applications of RNAi to triatomine research, describing the major methods that have been applied during the knockdown process such as the double‐stranded RNA delivery mechanism (injection, microinjection, or ingestion) and the phenotype characterization (mRNA and target protein levels) in studies conducted with the intent to provide greater insights into the biology of these insects. In addition to the characterization of insect biomolecules, some with biopharmacological potential, RNAi may provide a new view of the interaction between triatomine and trypanosomatids, enabling the development of new measures for vector control and transmission of the parasite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3amessenger RNA 3aphenotype 3avector control 3aChagas disease 3aTriatominae 3agenes 3ahematophagous insects 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aingestion 2aAnimals 2aGene Transfer Techniques 2aHemipteraxgenetics 2aInsect Control 2aRNA Interference 0aparasites 0aHemiptera1 aAraujo, Ricardo N.1 aLehane, M.

However, the reasons behind consumer preference for organic milk over conventional and other milk types are ill-defined. The objective of this study was to use an implicit association test (IAT) and primed and unprimed preference testing to determine if fluid milk consumer preferences for milk types are influenced by implicit biases and, if so, to define these biases within the context of the consumer sensory experience. Self-reported fluid milk consumers (n = 473) participated in online IAT exercises where pairwise comparisons of milk types (conventional, organic, local, pasture-raised) were measured on both positive and negative dimensions related to cow-welfare, sustainability, health, trust, safety, and quality. Latency times from IAT responses were subsequently transformed into standardized D-scores to categorize bias effect sizes. Additionally, fluid milk consumers (n = 174) participated in preference tests that compared commercial milks representing different milk types through presentations where milk type was shown (primed) or hidden (unprimed). Following preference tests, consumers were asked to explain their preferred sample using check-all-that-apply tasks. Analysis of IAT results showed that conventional milk was more associated with negative dimension descriptors compared with organic, local, and pasture-raised milks. Additionally, a positive bias in favor of organic milk was expressed when compared with pasture-raised milk offerings; however, no differences were found in pairwise comparisons of other nonconventional milk type pairings, suggesting that consumers may conflate these designations. Blinded preference testing showed that milk preferences were largely dictated by flavor, with consumers differentiating milk types based upon flavors related to packaging, pasteurization method, and feeding systems. In primed evaluations, consumers generally expressed preferences that aligned with their explicit beliefs, and flavor considerations appeared to be a secondary differentiator of preference. Based on these results, conventional milk is associated with negative implicit beliefs related to production and product quality more often than other milk types, which was reflected in IAT evaluations and primed preference tests. However, the blinded tastings suggested that conventional milk was preferred, or competitive with, other milk types based on flavor alone. Findings from this study suggest consumer differentiation and preference of milks is significantly affected by perceptions and beliefs related to milk type. In particular, conventional milk was associated with relatively few unique belief descriptions, indicating strict utilitarian consumer categorization. Organic and local milks were comparatively associated with greater care for nutrition, sustainability, animal welfare, and local farm support. These results demonstrate a need for greater education related to conventional milk offerings to dispel factors influencing negative implicit bias. Furthermore, improving product narrative via label information and alignment with locality and regionality were identified as possible opportunities for improving consumer sentiments related to conventional milk. A more thorough understanding of these attributes may reinforce stated beliefs more effectively and stave off consumer losses to plant-based alternatives that fulfill similar beliefs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aconsumer preferences 3aeducation 3afarms 3aflavor 3afluid milk 3aimplicit association test 3amilk 3amilk consumption 3aorganic foods 3apackaging 3apasteurization 3aUnited States 0amilk 0aorganic 0aimplicit 0abias 0alocal 0aconsumer1 aDrake, M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4744-24930 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Dec., v. 103, no. 12 p.11218-11227dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-190373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170300001600269520142500285592002801710650002301738650002001761650002701781650001401808650001101822650002101833650001601854650001001870650001201880650001801892650001301910650002101923650001301944650001301957650001401970653002001984653001202004653001502016653001202031653001702043700002502060700006902085700003002154773010102184856008602285852000902371655001202380IND60591763920221121232314.0190516e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059176392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Sarah L.10aPolysaccharide food matrices for controlling the release, retention and perception of flavours  ap. 253-261.  aPolysaccharides have many roles across both the food and pharmaceutics industries. They are commonly used to enhance viscosity, stabilise emulsions and to add bulk to food products. In the pharmaceutics industry, they are also utilised for their mucoadhesive nature. Mucoadhesive polysaccharides can facilitate retention of active ingredients at mucosal sites for a prolonged time and formulations can be designed to control their release and bioavailability. This study investigates how polysaccharides, with differing physicochemical properties (e.g. functional groups and molecular weight), affect the release and perception of flavour compounds from films. Polysaccharide films were prepared using either high or low viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose, pullulan or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Glucose, vanillin or a combination of both was also added to the films to assess the effect of flavour release and perception over time. The films were assessed for glucose release in vitro, swelling and disintegration times, and mucoadhesive ability. Results show that flavour release and perception depend on the polysaccharide matrix properties; this includes how quickly the films dissolve, the rate of release of tastant compounds, and the mucoadhesive strength of the polysaccharide. A higher viscosity and slower disintegration time resulted in slower release of glucose in vitro and flavour perception in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3abioavailability 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aemulsions 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3afood matrix 3afoods 3aglucose 3ahydrocolloids 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3apullulan 3avanillin 3aviscosity 0aPolysaccharides 0aFlavour 0aControlled 0aRelease 0aMucoadhesion1 aMethven, L.q(Lisa),1 aParker, J.

Herein, a catalyst composed of nitrogen-doped carbon and mesoporous alumina supported manganese (Mn) was prepared by pyrolysis and calcination. We demonstrated its excellent catalytic activity (27.8%), selectivity (>99%), and stability (without a significant decrease over eight cycles) for the solvent-free oxidation of ethylbenzene with molecular oxygen. In the heterogeneous catalytic system, phenanthroline had two functions. First, it acted as a versatile chelating ligand to lock Mn and improve its dispersity. Second, it served as a nitrogen source to provide doped pyridine-N (9.4%), which promoted the adsorption and bond breaking of molecular oxygen. More abundant active Mn in the bulk phase than on the surface guaranteed the stability and reusability of the catalyst. Meanwhile, the mesoporous aluminum oxides provided a stable support for active components and adsorption sites for reactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetophenones 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3aethylbenzene 3aligands 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3apyrolysis1 aChen, Wen-Jing1 aLi, De-Chang1 aCheng, Bin-Hai1 aJiang, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4261-79870 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Feb. 26, v. 58, no. 10 p.3969-3977dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b053283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012200155300001600277500002000293520164700313592002801960650003301988650000802021650001702029650001702046650002102063650001902084650001502103650001402118650002202132650002702154650001702181650001302198650001702211650001502228650001002243650001402253650005202267650002202319650001202341650001202353651001902365651001202384651001102396651001302407700001902420700002902439773009702468856007302565852000902638655001202647IND60587220120221118035910.0171215e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058722012DNAL7 a10.1111/ppa.127162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuļģe, N.10aOccurrence and genetic diversity of Blackcurrant reversion virus found on various cultivated and wild Ribes in Latvia  ap. 210-220.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA large‐scale survey was carried out to assess the occurrence, natural host range and genetic diversity of Blackcurrant reversion virus (BRV) in cultivated and wild Ribes in Latvia using RT‐PCR and sequence analyses of 3′ NTR of BRV RNA2. The virus was detected in all surveyed habitats in most of the studied Ribes, except gooseberries, Ribes sanguineum, Ribes laxiflorum and crossbreeds between blackcurrants and gooseberries. The overall occurrence of BRV was 27%, although it varied significantly among the surveyed Ribes habitats, exceeding 40% in home gardens and germplasm collections. Among cultivated Ribes, blackcurrants were the most infected and BRV was detected in all commonly grown cultivars. The virus was detected for the first time in Ribes aureum, Ribes fragrans, Ribes nigrum var. pauciflorum and Ribes fasciculatum var. chinense. The sequence identities of the studied fragments of RNA2 3′ NTR varied from 92.8% to 99.7% among 26 BRV isolates from various cultivated, ornamental and wild hosts from Latvia and from 91.1% to 97.1% when they were compared with 27 corresponding sequences from GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the major clustering of isolates was not related to host, origin or symptoms. Grouping of BRV isolates based on host or location was identified within the phylogenetic subclusters. Several well‐supported clades were formed within the subclusters, including a group of BRV isolates from redcurrants that had unique nucleotide substitutions. Five putative recombinants were identified for the first time among BRV isolates from Latvia, Finland, Scotland and the Czech Republic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlackcurrant reversion virus 3aRNA 3aRibes aureum 3aRibes nigrum 3aRibes sanguineum 3ablack currants 3acrossbreds 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm conservation 3agooseberries 3ahabitats 3ahome gardens 3ahost range 3ahosts 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asurveys 3aviruses 3aCzech Republic 3aFinland 3aLatvia 3aScotland1 aGospodaryk, A.1 aMoročko‐Bičevska, I.0 tPlant pathology.g2018 Jan., v. 67, no. 1 p.210-220dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0032-08627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppa.127163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03760naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014000168300001100308520241900319592002802738650004102766650001102807650001702818650002002835650001402855650002202869650002102891650001202912650001402924650001102938650002902949650001902978650000902997650001503006651002103021700002403042700002403066700001903090700002503109773009003134856008103224852000903305655001203314IND60440826820221119083136.0151225e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044082682DNAL7 a10.1186/s40663-015-0038-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerster, Colin J10aComparison of carbon-stock changes, eddy-covariance carbon fluxes and model estimates in coastal Douglas-fir stands in British Columbia  ap. 13.  aBACKGROUND: The global network of eddy-covariance (EC) flux-towers has improved the understanding of the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, however, the network has a relatively limited spatial extent compared to forest inventory data and plots. Developing methods to use inventory-based and EC flux measurements together with modeling approaches is necessary evaluate forest C dynamics across broad spatial extents. METHODS: Changes in C stock change (ΔC) were computed based on repeated measurements of forest inventory plots and compared with separate measurements of cumulative net ecosystem productivity (ΣNEP) over four years (2003 – 2006) for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var menziesii) dominated regeneration (HDF00), juvenile (HDF88 and HDF90) and near-rotation (DF49) aged stands (6, 18, 20, 57 years old in 2006, respectively) in coastal British Columbia. ΔC was determined from forest inventory plot data alone, and in a hybrid approach using inventory data along with litter fall data and published decay equations to determine the change in detrital pools. These ΔC-based estimates were then compared with ΣNEP measured at an eddy-covariance flux-tower (EC-flux) and modelled by the Carbon Budget Model - Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) using historic forest inventory and forest disturbance data. Footprint analysis was used with remote sensing, soils and topography data to evaluate how well the inventory plots represented the range of stand conditions within the area of the flux-tower footprint and to spatially scale the plot data to the area of the EC-flux and model based estimates. RESULTS: The closest convergence among methods was for the juvenile stands while the largest divergences were for the regenerating clearcut, followed by the near-rotation stand. At the regenerating clearcut, footprint weighting of CBM-CFS3 ΣNEP increased convergence with EC flux ΣNEP, but not for ΔC. While spatial scaling and footprint weighting did not increase convergence for ΔC, they did provide confidence that the sample plots represented site conditions as measured by the EC tower. CONCLUSIONS: Methods to use inventory and EC flux measurements together with modeling approaches are necessary to understand forest C dynamics across broad spatial extents. Each approach has advantages and limitations that need to be considered for investigations at varying spatial and temporal scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii 3acarbon 3aclearcutting 3aeddy covariance 3aequations 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3anet ecosystem production 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3atopography 3aBritish Columbia1 aTrofymow, JA (Tony)1 aCoops, Nicholas C.,1 aChen, Baozhang1 aBlack, Thomas Andrew0 tForest Ecosystems.g2015 Dec., v. 2, no. 1 p.13-13dBeijing Forestry University7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40663-015-0038-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011200159300001800271520136400289592002801653650002801681650002301709650001001732650001801742650002501760650001101785650001601796650002101812650001801833650001501851650001901866650001901885650001901904650001101923650001801934650002101952650001201973650001601985700002802001700003202029700001602061700001702077700002302094773012102117856007402238852000902312655001202321IND60641456320221118005747.0190505e20170116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064145632DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26688f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFong, Wye-Khay10aDynamic formation of nanostructured particles from vesicles via invertase hydrolysis for on-demand delivery  ap. 4368-4377.  aThe unique multicompartmental nanostructure of lipid-based mesophases can be triggered, on-demand, in order to control the release of encapsulated drugs. In this study, these nanostructured matrices have been designed to respond to a specific enzyme, invertase, an enzyme which catalyses the hydrolysis of sucrose. The effect of two sugar esters upon the phase behaviour of two different lipids which form cubic phases, phytantriol and monolinolein, was investigated. Factors affecting the hydrolysis of the sucrose headgroup are discussed in terms of the molecular structure of the sugar surfactant and also its ability to incorporate into the lipid bilayer. By hydrolysing the incorporated sugar esters, a dynamic change in mesophase nanostructure from vesicles to a cubic phase was observed. This phase change resulted in the triggered release of an encapsulated model drug, fluorescein. This investigation demonstrates, for the first time, that changes on a molecular level by subtly controlling the hydrophilic and hydrophobic features of an amphiphilic additive at the interface by enzymatic hydrolysis can result in a global change in the system and so paves the way towards the design and development of lipid-based matrices which are responsive to specific enzymes for the controlled delivery of pharmaceutically active molecules or functional foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3achemical structure 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aesters 3afluorescein 3afunctional foods 3aglobal change 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3asucrose 3asurfactants1 aSánchez-Ferrer, Antoni1 aOrtelli, Francesco Giovanni1 aSun, Wenjie1 aBoyd, Ben J.1 aMezzenga, Raffaele0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 16, v. 7, no. 8 p.4368-4377dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26688f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012200166300001800288520093800306592002801244650000801272650003101280650001501311650001901326650001301345650001501358650001601373700001701389700001201406700001601418700001901434700001601453700001701469773010501486856008201591852000901673655001201682IND60091475920221118033107.0141103e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009147592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaaboul, G.G.10aLED-based Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor for quantitative dynamic monitoring of biomolecular interactions  ap. 2221-2227.  aLabel-free optical biosensors have been established as proven tools for monitoring specific biomolecular interactions.

Our experiments show that this platform has comparable sensitivity to high-end label-free biosensors at a much lower cost with the capability to be translated to field-deployable applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3abiosensors 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3amonitoring 3areflectance1 aVedula, R.S.1 aAhn, S.1 aLopez, C.A.1 aReddington, A.1 aOzkumur, E.1 aÜnlü, M.S.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 26, no. 5 p.2221-2227dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014900166520133800315592002801653650002301681650002101704650002301725650001801748650002001766650001201786650002801798650001401826650001601840650002301856650000901879650001101888650001201899650001201911650001201923650001501935650001401950650002201964651002301986653001702009653001902026653001702045653002102062653002102083700006202104700006102166700002702227700006202254773012202316856008102438852000902519655001202528IND60682952520221117215920.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068295252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdiaye, Cheikh10aEffect of edible plant materials on provitamin A stability and bioaccessibility from extruded whole pearl millet (P. typhoides) composite blends  aBlends of cereals and nutrient dense plant materials are increasingly being explored as a strategy for food-to-food fortification in areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, where processing is often applied to enhance product attributes, shelf life and safety. However, little is known regarding the potential impact of these strategies on micronutrient retention and bioaccessibility. In this study whole grain pearl millet (WGM) was blended with carrot powder (source of provitamin A) and Adansonia digitata (Baobab) and Moringa oleifera (Moringa) leaf powders (source of iron) to provide formulations with 25% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for Vitamin A. These blends were extruded to produce instant cereal porridges appropriate for consumer markets. Recovery of provitamin A carotenoid ranged from 60.0 to 90.3% after extrusion with higher recoveries in formulations including Moringa and Baobab. Extrusion had a significant negative (p < 0.05) impact on β-carotene bioaccessibility compared to corresponding dry blends (52% versus 47%; P < 0.05). However, the presence of Baobab in the formulation did enhance provitamin A carotenoid bioaccessibility. These results suggest that extruded blends of native plant materials with whole grain millet has potential to deliver products with stable and bioaccessible provitamin A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdansonia digitata 3aMoringa oleifera 3aPennisetum glaucum 3abeta-carotene 3abioavailability 3acarrots 3adietary recommendations 3aextrusion 3afood plants 3aindigenous species 3airon 3aleaves 3amarkets 3amillets 3apowders 3ashelf life 3avitamin A 3awhole grain foods 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aPearl millet 0aAfrican plants 0aProvitamin A 0aBioaccessibility 0aStarch digestion1 aMartinez, Mario M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8520-77611 aHamaker, Bruce R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6591-942X1 aCampanella, Osvaldo H.1 aFerruzzi, Mario G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1384-26720 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Apr., v. 123 p.109109-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012400169500001900293520129400312592002801606650002601634650001601660650001201676650001701688650002101705650001901726653000901745653002701754653002601781653001301807700001801820700001901838700001701857700001401874773010701888856008601995852000902081655001202090IND60717116720221118165443.0201202e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071711672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1060232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHongbin, L.U.10aResponse mechanism of typical wetland plants and removal of water pollutants under different levofloxacin concentration  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAntibiotics are widely found in aquatic environments and pose a serious threat to natural habitats. Plants as an important part of constructed wetlands, phytoremediation is a potential way to purify antibiotic contaminated waters and soils and thus reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance. However, less is known about Response mechanism of typical wetland plants and removal of water pollutants under different levofloxacin concentration Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of the levofloxacin (LOFL) on chlorophyll and key enzyme activities among 8 typical wetland plants. At the same time, the removal of conventional water pollutants by different plant system treated with 0, 10, 1000 ug/L of LOFL was investigated. The results showed that the eight plants showed significant differences in the removal of contaminants as well as chlorophyll and key enzyme activities while the above indicators did not show obvious regularity due to the stress of antibiotics in the same type of plant. The removal rate of LOFL was 87.29-96.69% by plant system while only 0.26 to 5.89% was contributed by plant accumulation. Antibiotic contamination has potential impact on wetland plants and in practical applications, plants should be selected reasonably according to the target pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3achlorophyll 3aenzymes 3alevofloxacin 3aphytoremediation 3arisk reduction 0aLOFL 0aTypical wetland plants 0aKey enzyme activities 0aToxicity1 aWang, Huanhua1 aShaoyong, L.U.1 aJiaxin, L.I.1 aWang, Tao0 tEcological engineering.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 158 p.106023-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1060233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011400167300001600281520142700297592002801724650001701752650001401769650002801783650002101811650001101832650001401843650002701857650001901884650001801903650001801921650002101939650001301960650000901973650002101982650001502003650001302018650003402031650003302065650001802098650002402116650001502140650003702155650001402192653002502206653001602231653001902247653002102266653002202287700001302309700001202322700001902334700001402353700001702367700001602384773010102400856008602501852000902587655001202596IND60591764520221121232157.0190516e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059176452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Huimin10aFabrication of cellulose nanofibers from waste brown algae and their potential application as milk thickeners  ap. 473-481.  aSeafood wastes contain important bioactive polysaccharides that are good candidates for food additives. In this work, cellulose was isolated from the waste of brown algae (BA) after alginate extraction and was demonstrated to be cellulose I with a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 2.69 × 105. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements indicated that BA cellulose existed as nanofibers in the BA. Subsequently, the BA cellulose was oxidized by NaClO to obtain well-dispersed cellulose nanofibers in water. The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the average values of the width, length and aspect ratio of BA cellulose nanofibers were 4 nm, 1.1 μm, and 275, respectively. The rheology behavior of the nanofiber suspension in water demonstrated its high viscosity and shear-thinning behavior. More importantly, the BA cellulose nanofibers exhibited superior thickening behavior in milk because the BA cellulose nanofibers absorb casein micelles through hydrogen bonds to form a weak gel-like structure. The MTT test confirmed the nanofibers' safety and good biocompatibility. The cellulose nanofibers derived from an abundant marine bioresource could be expected to have applications in the food industry. This work opened a new pathway to fabricate bioactive cellulose nanofibers with a high aspect ratio as a food thickener.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeophyceae 3aalginates 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiocompatibility 3acasein 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3afood additives 3afood industry 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen bonding 3amicelles 3amilk 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3arheology 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseafood waste 3asodium hypochlorite 3athickeners 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviscosity 0aCellulose nanofibers 0aBrown algae 0aFood thickener 0aBiocompatibility 0aRheology behavior1 aDuan, Bo1 aLu, Ang1 aDeng, Hongbing1 aDu, Yumin1 aShi, Xiaowen1 aZhang, Lina0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2018 June, v. 79 p.473-481dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245010700212300001900319506007600338520155900414592002801973506003702001650001102038650001202049650001402061650001002075650002302085650001102108650000802119650003602127650002302163650001302186650002402199650000902223650001202232650001902244650001602263650001002279653002602289653002802315653001802343653002102361653002902382700001902411700002402430700001902454700001902473700002902492773018302521856008302704852000902787655001202796IND60591513620221207112319.0190412e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059151362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2017.11.0012doi7 aPMC58457842pmcid7 a292760192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristoph, Mary J.10aNutrition Facts Use in Relation to Eating Behaviors and Healthy and Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviors  ap. 267-274.e1.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInvestigate the relationship between use of Nutrition Facts labels on packaged foods and weight-related behaviors.Cross-sectional survey in 2015–2016.Young adult respondents (n = 1,817; 57% women; average age 31.0 ± 1.6 years) to the Project Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults–IV survey, the fourth wave of a longitudinal cohort study.Use of Nutrition Facts labels on packaged foods; healthy, unhealthy, and extreme weight control behaviors; intuitive eating; binge eating.Linear and logistic regression models were adjusted for age, ethnicity/race, education, income, and weight status.In women, greater Nutrition Facts use was associated with a 23% and 10% greater likelihood of engaging in healthy and unhealthy weight control behaviors, respectively, and a 17% greater chance of engaging in binge eating. In men, greater label use was associated with a 27% and 17% greater likelihood of engaging in healthy and unhealthy weight control behaviors, respectively, and a lower level of intuitive eating.Professionals advising patients and clients on weight management may consider possible gender differences in response to weight loss and management guidance. Since label use was related to engagement in some unhealthy behaviors in addition to healthy behaviors, it is important to consider how individuals may use labels, particularly those at risk for, or engaging in, disordered eating behaviors.

Calculations based on density functional theory predict the hexagonal T-PdSe₂ monolayer to be stable with the band gap of about 1 eV, the photoabsorption coefficient of ∼5 × 10⁵ cm–¹, the electron mobility of 2.3 × 10⁴ cm² V–¹ S–¹, and the electron/hole mobility ratio of ∼758 with an anisotropic character. Subsequently, we show that these extraordinary electronic properties can be used to fabricate the type-II heterostructures with the other transition metal dichalcogenides for photovoltaic cells. In particular, the calculated maximum power conversion efficiency of the engineered heterostructures consisted of T-PdSe₂/MoS₂, P-PdSe₂/MoTe₂, and P-PdSe₂/MoSe₂ can reach as high as ∼17, ∼17, and ∼22%, respectively, suggesting the layered PdSe₂ to be a candidate material for the next-generation photovoltaic solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3adensity functional theory 3aphase transition1 aJaspreet Singh,1 aKumar, Ashok1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3636-05021 aPandey, Ravindra0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Nov. 24, v. 124, no. 49 p.26565-26571dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c056323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245016200165300001800327520104000345592002801385650001601413650002401429650001101453650001401464650001201478650001601490650002101506650001201527650001101539650001801550650001701568650000901585650001501594650001901609650001201628700006501640773017101705856008001876852000901956655001201965IND60632282620221118174415.0190314e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063228262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b054322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaramesh, Amir10aPrediction of Asphaltene Precipitation in Reservoir Model Oils in the Presence of Fe₃O₄ and NiO Nanoparticles by Cubic Plus Association Equation of State  ap. 4293-4302.  aNanoparticle-technology was employed to address the challenges of asphaltene precipitation during oil production. Fe₃O₄ and NiO nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized. Asphaltene was extracted and dissolved in toluene to prepare reservoir model oil. The asphaltene precipitation onset in the presence and absence of the nanoparticles by the addition of n-heptane was measured using dynamic light scattering. Cubic plus association equation of state (CPA EoS) was employed to predict the asphaltene precipitation in the presence and absence of the nanoparticles. The CPA EoS determines the precipitate amount of the asphaltene by knowing the asphaltene average aggregate size in the liquid. In the presence of the nanoparticles, the asphaltene self-association energy is inferred to be a function of the molar density of the surface sites of the nanoparticles with an exponential relationship. The CPA EoS can be employed for designing chemical inhibitors of the asphaltene precipitation by the metal oxides nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasphaltenes 3achemical inhibitors 3aenergy 3aequations 3aheptane 3airon oxides 3alight scattering 3aliquids 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3anickel oxide 3aoils 3aprediction 3aprocess design 3atoluene1 aHosseinpour, Negahdar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6325-07580 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Feb. 19, v. 58, no. 10 p.4293-4302dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b054323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245012900164300001800293520146400311592002801775650004401803650001601847650001201863650002401875650001201899650001401911650002301925650001201948650001901960650001301979650001801992650001802010650002202028650001302050650004402063650001802107650002102125650003702146700001902183700002302202773012102225856007402346852000902420655001202429IND60641457120221118010349.0190505e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064145712DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26722j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLunagariya, Jignesh10aEfficient esterification of n-butanol with acetic acid catalyzed by the Brönsted acidic ionic liquids: influence of acidity  ap. 5412-5420.  aThe efficiency in the catalytic performance of halogen free functionalized room-temperature Brönsted acidic ionic liquids (BAILs), having different acidities (due to the ILs containing zero, a single, and or a double –SO₃H functional group), for the esterification of n-butanol with acetic acid under various reaction conditions was investigated. The synthesized BAILs have much weaker corrosiveness than that of H₂SO₄. The nature of both counter anion and cation as well as the presence of additional functional (–SO₃H) groups influenced the behavior of the catalyst. Interestingly, the acidic character of the ILs facilitates the reaction under extremely mild conditions, with a short reaction time, and reduction in the side reactions; moreover, the liquid–liquid biphasic reaction mode leads to good yields. The physicochemical properties of these BAILs were characterized by a variety of different analytical and spectroscopic techniques, such as NMR, FT-IR, mass spectrometry, TGA, and UV-vis spectroscopy for the determination of Hammett acidity. In particular, IL-5 having the highest acidity demonstrated excellent catalytic activity for esterification. An additional advantage of BAILs is the simple procedure for the separation of product and catalyst, where the catalysts can be easily recycled without the loss of catalytic activities, making IL-5 an important alternative catalyst for a commercially viable esterification process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetic acid 3aacidity 3aambient temperature 3abutanol 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3aesterification 3ahalogens 3ainterleukin-5 3aionic liquids 3amass spectrometry 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asulfuric acid 3athermogravimetry 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aDhar, Abhishek1 aVekariya, Rohit L.0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 17, v. 7, no. 9 p.5412-5420dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26722j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013500162300001800297520121000315592002801525650002501553650001501578650002001593650002101613650002101634650002201655650001201677650002001689650001301709650001901722650001701741650003101758700001401789700002001803700001201823700001501835700001701850773010501867856008201972852000902054655001202063IND60091476520221118032946.0141103e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009147652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kun10aEnhanced direct electrochemistry of glucose oxidase and biosensing for glucose via synergy effect of graphene and CdS nanocrystals  ap. 2252-2257.  aIntegrating graphene-based composites with enzyme provides a potent strategy to enhance biosensor performance due to their unique physicochemical properties. Herein we report on the utilization of graphene–CdS (G–CdS) nanocomposite as a novel immobilization matrix for the enzymes, which glucose oxidase (GOD) was chosen as model enzyme. In comparison with the graphene sheet and CdS nanocrystal, G–CdS nanocomposite exhibited excellent electron transfer properties for GOD with the rate constant (kₛ) of 5.9s⁻¹ due to the synergy effect of graphene sheet and CdS nanocrystals. Further, based on the decrease of the electrocatalytic response of the reduced form of GOD to dissolved oxygen, the obtained glucose biosensor displays satisfactory analytical performance over an acceptable linear range from 2.0 to 16mM with a detection limit of 0.7mM, and also prevents the effects of interfering species, which is suitable for glucose determination by real samples. These results mean that this immobilization matrix not only can be used for immobilizing GOD, but also can be extended to other enzymes and bioactive molecules, thus providing a promising platform for the development of biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3aphysicochemical properties1 aLiu, Qian1 aGuan, Qing-Meng1 aWu, Jun1 aLi, He-Nan1 aYan, Jia-Jia0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 26, no. 5 p.2252-2257dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008300170500001900253520173300272592002802005650001402033650001502047650001802062650002102080650002202101650002402123650001402147650001102161650001402172650001702186650001302203650002102216650001502237650001802252653001702270653001302287653000802300700001702308700002102325700002402346773012202370856008602492852000902578655001202587IND60717117420221118165256.0210112e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071711742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1060942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamesh, Rasika12aA secondary assessment of sediment trapping effectiveness by vegetated buffers  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVegetated buffers and filter strips are a widely used Best Management Practice (BMP) for enhancing streamside ecosystem quality and water quality improvement through nonpoint source pollutant removal. Most existing studies are either site-specific, rely on limited data points, or evaluate buffer width and slope as the only design variables for predicting sediment reduction, not considering other parameters such as soil texture, vegetation types, and runoff loads that can significantly influence the buffer efficiency. In this paper, we carry out a meta-analysis of published studies and fit regression models to explore the sediment removal capacity of riparian buffers. We compiled 905 data points from over 90 studies (including data from an online BMP database) documenting sediment trapping by vegetated buffers and recorded data regarding buffer characteristics such as buffer width, slope, area, vegetation type, sediment loading, water flow rates, and sediment removal efficiency. We found that an exponential regression model describing the relationship between sediment removal efficiency by the buffer and water inflow/outflow volume ratio explained 44% of the variance. Adding the square root of roughness increased the R² to 0.50. The model performance was compared with other sediment reduction regression models reported in the literature. The results point towards the importance of considering flow parameters in vegetative buffer design. The improved empirical relationships derived here can be used at local scales to understand sediment trapping potential by vegetated buffers for water quality mitigation purposes and can be built into extant hydrologic models for improved watershed-scale assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3ameta-analysis 3amodel validation 3apollution control 3aregression analysis 3aroughness 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil texture 3avariance 3avegetation types 3awater flow 3awater quality 0aFilter strip 0aSediment 0aBMP1 aKalin, Latif1 aHantush, Mohamed1 aChaudhary, Abhishek0 tEcological engineering.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 159 p.106094-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1060943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01790naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013400154300001800288520082500306592002801131650001701159650002301176650002301199650002101222650002001243700002101263773013301284856007401417852000901491655001201500IND60660767720221119004215.0190827e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066076772DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07909d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Xin10aRecent advances in asymmetric organocatalysis mediated by bifunctional amine–thioureas bearing multiple hydrogen-bonding donors  ap. 1185-1197.  aOrganocatalysis has proven to be one of the most rapidly developing and competitive research areas in asymmetric catalysis since 2000, and has become a third branch besides biocatalysis and transition metal catalysis. In this feature article, recent progress from our research group on asymmetric organocatalysis, focusing on fine-tunable amine–thiourea catalysis, is described. Design of novel bifunctional amine–thiourea organocatalysts based upon the synergistic activation strategy via multiple hydrogen bonds and their applications in asymmetric C–C, C–N, and C–S bond-forming reactions under mild conditions are discussed in detail. The most attractive feature of the newly designed fine-tunable amine–thiourea catalysts is the incorporation of multiple hydrogen bonding donors and stereogenic centers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysis 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3aorganocatalysts1 aWang, Chun-Jiang0 tChemical communications.g2014 Dec. 23, v. 51, no. 7 p.1185-1197dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc07909d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04165naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024001900111024002100130024002400151024001100175040001800186100002100204245013200225300001600357506017300373520120500546592002801751650002401779650001101803650001201814650002001826650001201846650001901858650002501877650002001902650001501922650001001937650000901947650002101956650000901977650002201986650001302008650001402021650001402035650002102049650000702070650001002077650002202087650001702109650002502126650001402151650003602165650004002201650002402241650003102265650001502296650002202311650001502333650001302348650002402361650002102385650002802406650003302434650008602467650002402553650001602577650004002593653001402633653001502647653001702662653001702679653000802696700001602704700002402720700002302744700002302767700002902790700002302819773010102842856011202943856007103055956009103126961001303217852000903230655001203239IND50090682620221214223813.0200516e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009068262DNAL7 a2545202aris7 a222416122pmid7 a10113/590232hdl7 a10.3852/11-1192doi8 ans4890  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJurick, Wayne M.10aPenicillium solitum produces a polygalacturonase isozyme in decayed Anjou pear fruit capable of macerating host tissue in vitro  ap. 604-612.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA polygalacturonase (PG) isozyme was isolated from Penicillium solitum-decayed Anjou pear fruit and purified to homogeneity with a multistep process. Both gel filtration and cation exchange chromatography revealed a single PG activity peak, and analysis of the purified protein showed a single band with a molecular mass of 43 kDa, which is of fungal origin. The purified enzyme was active from pH 3.5–6, with an optimum at pH 4.5. PG activity was detectable 0–70 C with 50 C maximum. The purified isozyme was inhibited by the divalent cations Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺ and Fe²⁺ and analysis of enzymatic hydrolysis products revealed polygalacturonic acid monomers and oligomers. The purified enzyme has an isoelectric point of 5.3 and is not associated with a glycosylated protein. The PG isozyme macerated fruit tissue plugs in vitro and produced ~1.2-fold more soluble polyuronides from pear than from apple tissue, which further substantiates the role of PG in postharvest decay. Data from this study show for the first time that the purified PG produced in decayed Anjou pear by P. solitum, a weakly virulent fungus, is different from that PG produced by the same fungus in decayed apple.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium solitum 3aapples 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3acations 3achromatography 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3afiltration 3afungi 3agels 3ain vitro studies 3airon 3aisoelectric point 3aisozymes 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apears 3apolygalacturonase 3apolyuronides 3apostharvest diseases 3avirulence 2aCations, Divalentxpharmacology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydrolysis 2aIsoelectric Point 2aIsoenzymes 2aKinetics 2aMalusxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Weight 2aPenicilliumxenzymology 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolygalacturonasexchemistryxdrug effectsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPyrusxmicrobiology 2aTemperature 2aUronic Acidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 0ablue mold 0aenzymology 0apolyuronides 0apurification 0arot1 aVico, Ivana1 aGaskins, Verneta L.1 aWhitaker, Bruce D.1 aGarrett, Wesley M.1 aJanisiewicz, Wojciech J.1 aConway, William S.0 tMycologia.g2012 May 1, v. 104, no. 3 p.604-612dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/590233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3852/11-1193Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Soli%20pear.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245008800202300001400290500001900304520192400323592002802247650001302275650001502288650001802303650002402321650002402345650001402369650000902383650001502392650001302407650001402420650001102434650001802445650001102463650001302474653002102487653002202508653002602530653002402556653001702580700005302597700005702650773011002707856008102817852000902898655001202907IND60678903920221120155444.0191218e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067890392DNAL7 a10.1017/S175173111900168X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSartori, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2091-228010aGenetic correlations of fighting ability with somatic cells and longevity in cattle  ap. 13-21.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe success in competitions may be stressful for animals and costly in terms of immune functions and longevity. Focusing on Aosta Chestnut and Aosta Black Pied cattle, selected for their fighting ability in traditional competitions, this study investigated the genetic relationships of fighting ability with udder health traits (somatic cell score and two threshold traits for somatic cells), longevity (length of productive life and number of calvings) and test-day milk, fat and protein yield. Herdbook information and phenotypic records that have been routinely collected for breeding programs in 16 years were used for the abovementioned traits. Data belonged to 9328 cows and 19 283 animals in pedigree. Single-trait animal model analyses were run using a Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate the variance components of traits, and bivariate analyses were then performed to estimate the genetic correlations. Moderate positive genetic correlations (rₐ) were found for fighting ability with somatic cell score (rₐ=0.255), suggesting that greater fighting ability is genetically related to a detriment in udder health, in agreement with the theory. The high positive genetic correlation between fighting ability and longevity (average rₐ=0.669) suggests that the economic importance of fighting ability (the winning cows get an higher price at selling) had probably masked the true genetic covariances. The genetic correlation between milk yield traits and fighting ability showed large intervals, but the negative values (average rₐ=−0.121) agreed with previous research. This study is one of the few empirical studies on genetic correlations for the competitive success v. immune functions and longevity traits. The knowledge of the genetic correlations among productive and functional traits of interest, including fighting ability, is important in animal breeding for a sustainable genetic improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aalgorithms 3aanimal models 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic improvement 3alongevity 3amilk 3amilk yield 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3aprices 3asomatic cells 3audders 3avariance 0asocial dominance 0afunctional traits 0aquantitative genetics 0aantagonistic traits 0alife history1 aGuzzo, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9866-53551 aMantovani, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1919-05590 tAnimal.g2020 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.13-21dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S175173111900168X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011300164300001400277520162200291592002801913650006701941650001502008650001602023650001102039650001502050650001402065650001902079650001402098650001502112650001602127651001102143653001402154653000802168653001902176653001302195653002702208700002202235700002202257773009702279856008102376852000902457655001202466IND60545016520221118052137.0160901e20140405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054501652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Soushi10aStatistical and in-situ validations of the ASTER spectral emissivity product at Railroad Valley, Nevada, USA  ap. 81-92.  aThis study investigated the accuracy of the surface emissivity generated as an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) standard product applying the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. We statistically compared the emissivity values using 61 daytime and 25 nighttime ASTER scenes at the Railroad Valley playa, USA from 2000 to 2012. The spectral emissivity was consistent within ±0.007 at bands 13 (10.60μm) and 14 (11.30μm), although the emissivity at bands 10 to 12 (8.30, 8.65, and 9.10μm) varied temporally, probably due to surface condition changes and errors in atmospheric correction. The atmospheric correction based on the climatology data resulted in poor accuracy in TES-retrieved emissivity for nighttime data because the contribution of the atmospheric effect on the at-sensor radiance increases due to decreased surface radiance in nighttime. For the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data, the agreement, which is comparable to the nominal accuracy (=0.015), between the emissivity based on the day and night ASTER data acquired on the same day suggested that NCEP data is sufficiently accurate to correct for the atmospheric effect on the ASTER data under nominally dry atmospheric condition. Although the spatial scales differ between ASTER data and laboratory data, the satellite and ground emissivity agreed within ±0.013. Despite the similarity of the spectral emissivity patterns, the ASTER emissivity was as much as 0.066 lower than the field emissivity at 8.30μm due perhaps to the roughness effect on the field emissivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aalgorithms 3aclimatology 3aplayas 3aprediction 3arailroads 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3asatellites 3atemperature 3aNevada 0aASTER TIR 0aTES 0aField campaign 0aDry lake 0aAtmospheric correction1 aMatsunaga, Tsuneo1 aTonooka, Hideyuki0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Apr. 05, v. 145 p.81-92dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002500170245010700195300001600302520157800318592002801896650001401924650003501938650001201973650002601985650001002011650001102021650002102032650002702053650002102080650001702101650004402118650001702162650001602179650003602195650004702231650003202278650005402310650002202364650002702386650003802413650005302451650005302504651001102557651001102568653001902579653001402598653001502612653003002627653003102657653003302688700002802721700002602749700002302775700002902798773010402827856008502931852000903016655001203025IND60113337920221118015651.0160903e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011333792DNAL7 a238507662pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandt, Emanuel M.F.10aBehaviour of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals in simplified sewage treatment systems  ap. 718-726.  aThis work assessed the behaviour of nine pharmaceuticals and/or endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in demo-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB reactors) coupled to distinct simplified post-treatment units (submerged bed, polishing ponds, and trickling filters) fed on raw sewage taken from a municipality in Brazil. The dissolved concentration of the studied micropollutants in the raw and treated sewage was obtained using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis in a liquid chromatography system coupled to a hybrid high resolution mass spectrometer consisting of an ion-trap and time of flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). The UASB reactors demonstrated that they were not appropriate for efficiently removing the assessed compounds from the sewage. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was an important parameter for the removal of the hydrophilic and less biodegradable compounds, such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The post-treatment units substantially increased the removal of most target micropollutants present in the anaerobic effluents, with a greater removal of micropollutants in simplified systems that require a large construction area, such as the submerged bed and polishing ponds, probably because of the higher HRT employed. Alternatively, compact post-treatment systems, such as trickling filters, tended to be less effective at removing most of the micropollutants studied, and the type of packing proved to be crucial for determining the fate of such compounds using trickling filters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeffluents 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3afilters 3aliquid chromatography 3aponds 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asolid phase extraction 3asulfamethoxazole 3atrimethoprim 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBioreactors 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFiltrationxinstrumentation 2aPharmaceutical Preparationsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSewagexchemistry 2aSolid Phase Extraction 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aMicropollutant 0aOestrogen 0aAntibiotic 0aUASB/submerged bed system 0aUASB/polishing pond system 0aUASB/trickling filter system1 ade Queiroz, Fernanda B.1 aAfonso, Robson J.C.F.1 aAquino, Sérgio F.1 aChernicharo, Carlos A.L.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 128 p.718-726dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245012200166500001100288520180700299592002802106650001202134650002502146650001002171650001702181650001402198650000902212650001202221650002102233650001902254650001902273650001202292650001402304650002402318650002202342650001502364650002302379650002002402700002502422700002102447700002102468773010002489856007402589852000902663655001202672IND60587221120221118035930.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058722112DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.124352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNwachukwu, Ifeanyi D.14aThe role of omega‐3 fatty acids in skeletal muscle anabolism, strength, and function in healthy and diseased states  aREVIEW  aOmega‐3 fatty acids (LCn‐3PUFAs) have become increasingly successful and important components of diet regimens used for improving and/or maintaining muscle mass, strength, and functional ability, especially in older adults, for certain illnesses or during traumatic injury. Using data from human, cell culture and animal model‐based studies, various investigators suggest that LCn‐3PUFAs are extremely potent in either directly stimulating muscle protein anabolism or reducing muscle and plasma levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines. However, a few others report that such benefits from LCn‐3PUFAs are at best minimal. In recognition of the growing importance of LCn‐3PUFAs in nutritional strategies aimed at maintaining adequate muscle mass, strength, and function during various circumstances, this work provides an examination of available data, reviews certain limitations of available studies on this theme, and suggests areas of focus for future research. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: As the largest tissue in the body, skeletal muscle metabolism has a substantial impact on an individual's overall health, thus dietary strategies are critical to help optimize its metabolic functions. This review will contribute toward increasing awareness of the growing efforts and strategies to incorporate LCn‐3PUFAs in diet regimens and supplements used to counteract diminishing muscle mass, strength, and function due to sarcopenia and other muscle impairment conditions such as cancers, traumatic injury, and infection (sepsis). More research is needed in this area to address issues such as the minimum dose of LCn‐3PUFAs supplementation required to maintain and/or increase muscle protein synthesis or lean body mass, and what ratio of administered LCn‐3PUFAs is absorbed into the blood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood 3acell culture 3acytokines 3adiet 3aelderly 3ahuman cell lines 3alean body mass 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3aneoplasms 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aprotein synthesis 3asarcopenia 3asepsis (infection) 3askeletal muscle1 aKouritzin, Trevor M.1 aAluko, Rotimi E.1 aMyrie, Semone B.0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 41, no. 6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.124353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009400164300002000258500001900278520128800297592002801585650001101613650003601624650001701660650001701677650001201694650001901706650001601725700002801741700001901769700005601788773013801844856008001982852000902062655001202071IND60720230120221122052000.0201210e20201123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072023012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c069282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tianyu10aDFT Study of Methane Activation and Coupling on the (0001) and (112̅0) Surfaces of α-WC  ap. 26722-26729.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding the mechanism of methane activation and coupling of its derivatives catalyzed by metal carbides is critical to efficiently converting methane to value-added products via a direct conversion route. In the present work, we report a systematic density functional theory-based computational study of methane conversion on the W-terminated α-WC(0001) and W–C exposed α-WC(112̅0) surfaces. Our results indicate that methane dissociates by sequentially breaking its C–H bonds, resulting in the (CH)ₐdₛ moieties on W-terminated α-WC(0001). Dimerization of (CH)ₐdₛ through C–C coupling is facile, leading to (C₂H₂)ₐdₛ. In contrast, the stepped W sites on the α-WC(112̅0) surface promote C–H bond activation, and the C sites on the surface bind the dissociation intermediates and result in (C₂H₂)ₐdₛ through C–C coupling. Meanwhile, such (C₂H₂)ₐdₛ on α-WC(112̅0) is thermodynamically more favorable to dehydrogenate to the C–C ensembles, eventually forming atomic carbon deposits on the surface.

Announced as a privately funded ocean fertilization effort to increase salmon returns, it attracted considerable press coverage, caused much public controversy and has been widely denounced by the science community. Here, we use available satellite bio-optical measurements from the MODIS/Aqua instrument and AVISO altimeter dynamic height data to examine the timing, magnitude and extent of this artificial iron fertilization experiment, comparing it with natural fertilization events such as volcanic ash deposition and mesoscale eddy transport in the Gulf of Alaska. With respect to other Haida eddies over the past 10years, this event produced the highest chlorophyll concentrations observed late (>400days) in eddy life history, produced the strongest bloom ever observed in an eddy in late-summer and induced this late-summer bloom earlier in the season than any other eddy. With respect to the local area of the fertilization, this experiment induced the most intensive phytoplankton bloom of the past 10years, ~2× stronger than that caused by Kasatochi volcano in 2008, ~5× that typically observed in the region, including any induced by passing eddies of previous years. Due to its limited spatial and temporal scales, however, estimated total annual carbon drawdown over the Gulf of Alaska by this experiment is one order of magnitude smaller than the Kasatochi volcano and mesoscale Haida eddies. The target eddy followed a path typical of previous Haida eddies, but with relatively weak dynamic height and rotational circulation. Satellite-based calculations also suggest that only a small fraction of the dumped iron might have been taken up by phytoplankton. The extent to which this localized experiment may impact higher trophic levels such as salmon remains uncertain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3adrawdown 3afertilizer analysis 3afertilizer application 3airon 3airon fertilizers 3alife history 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anews media 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3asalmon 3asatellites 3asummer 3asurface water 3atrophic levels 3avolcanic ash 3aGulf of Alaska 0aIron fertilization 0aHNLC 0aEddy 0aVolcano 0aIron limitation 0aRemote sensing data 0aChlorophyll 0aPhytoplankton1 aThomas, Andrew C.1 aChai, Fei0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Apr. 05, v. 145 p.38-46dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009000166300001800256520038900274592002800663650002300691650002300714650001700737650002100754650001300775700001400788700001700802700001600819700002300835700002800858700001600886700002400902700002700926700001800953700001800971700002000989773013401009856007401143852000901217655001201226IND60660767920221119004707.0190827e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066076792DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07911f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeung, Chris Wai Tung10aDetection of oligomers and fibrils of α-synuclein by AIEgen with strong fluorescence  ap. 1866-1869.  aWe report a fluorophore, TPE-TPP, with AIE characteristics which is utilized as a fluorescence probe to monitor the α-synuclein (α-Syn) fibrillation process.

Globally, status of colonial waterbird populations ranges from declining and in need of conservation to maintain their roles in aquatic ecosystems, to “overabundant” and managed to reduce human-wildlife conflict; both ends of this spectrum are observed in the North American Great Lakes. Conservation and management of colonial waterbirds should rely on knowledge of colony site use dynamics because the best approach may vary depending on the frequency with which historical colony sites are abandoned and new sites colonized. The goal of this study was to understand how site use dynamics are influenced by the physical and avian social environment, using the Great Lakes Colonial Waterbird Survey as a source of breeding-season site occupancy records. This study is the first to apply community occupancy modeling techniques to colonial waterbirds. Model parameter estimates were generated through a Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Sites with large waterbird colonies and those not susceptible to flooding were most likely to persist as breeding locations into the next survey period, and thus should be prioritized for conservation and management. Additionally, the model demonstrated that co-nester presence was positively related to persistence probabilities, while relationships between colonization probabilities and co-nester presence ranged from positive to negative for different focal species. Finally, species-specific responses to presence of other species and to environmental influences were apparent; knowledge of this relationship variability should be incorporated into management strategies to achieve optimal outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aMonte Carlo method 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3amodels 3asocial environment 3asurveys 3awater birds 3aGreat Lakes 3aUnited States 0aColony 0aNorth American Great Lakes 0aOccupancy 0aSite use dynamics 0aWaterbird 0aGreat Lakes Colonial Waterbird Survey1 aWires, Linda R.1 aCuthbert, Francesca J.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2014 Dec., v. 40 p.956-963dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2014.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245007900200300001600279500001900295520230300314592002802617650001302645650000902658651001202667653001602679653001802695653001302713653001302726653001102739700002102750700001402771700001602785700001602801773011202817856008102929852000903010655001203019IND60678904120221122035321.0191218e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067890412DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311190017572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0825-632110aEvaluation of three methods to assess the degree of milk-out in dairy cows  ap. 190-197.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe assessment of the completeness of milk-out in dairy cows is one of the indicators used to evaluate and optimise the milking process. A number of different methods and thresholds are available for this purpose, but procedures and validation of the methods are not always described in detail, and may vary between studies. The objective of this study was to introduce and evaluate a new, precisely defined hand-milking method (DEFINED) and to compare its outcome with two commonly applied methods to assess the completeness of milking: visual scoring of the degree of quarter filling (VISUAL) and quantitative assessment of the number of easy strips (EASYSTRIPS). Each of the three methods was applied in 131 Holstein cows of six dairy herds in northern Germany. The assessment of milk-out was carried out by three experienced but non-regular milkers (evaluators). Each evaluator visited the six herds once during afternoon milking. To avoid any transitions, the interval between visits of two evaluators was at least 2 days. Maximum hand-milking time per cow was set to 60 s. The total strip yield collected in 60 s (SY60) by the application of a strip frequency of 1 Hz was used as a reference for the amount of milk left in the investigated quarter after machine-milking. The three methods were evaluated by analysing their statistical relationship with SY60, and by ranking their suitability for quantitative or qualitative assessment of milk-out. VISUAL and SY60 were not related, indicating that VISUAL was unsuitable for estimating the amount of milk left actually in the udder quarters. The strip yield in 15 s (DEFINED) and SY60 was significantly related, but results varied among evaluators. With regard to EASYSTRIPS, a significant relationship with SY60 was found, but the results were influenced by evaluator and herd. The findings of this study imply that DEFINED allows a rapid and farm-independent quantitative estimate of the post-milking strip yield. Likewise, EASYSTRIPS was meaningful in assessing milk-out of quarters in a given herd, whereas VISUAL allowed neither a quantitative nor a qualitative assessment of post-milking strip yield or milk-out. Thresholds for complete or incomplete milk-out by DEFINED must be lower than those commonly applied in 15 s of post-milking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3amilk 3aGermany 0astrip yield 0audder filling 0ahandgrip 0asettings 0acattle1 aHaeussermann, A.1 aBarth, K.1 aLingner, S.1 aHartung, E.0 tAnimal.g2020 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.190-197dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311190017573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001600170245011800186300001600304520130100320592002801621650001501649650002201664650001201686650001701698650001101715650001101726650000701737650001501744650002301759650001501782650000901797650001501806650002301821650001401844650003101858650001301889650002401902650002101926650002201947650001401969650001901983650004202002650002002044653001502064653001702079653002702096653001202123653002102135653001602156700001802172700001802190700001802208700001702226773010402243856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60113338020221118015422.0160903e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011333802DNAL7 a238513182pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haibin10aCompetitive adsorption of Cd(II), Zn(II) and Ni(II) from their binary and ternary acidic systems using tourmaline  ap. 727-734.  aThe adsorption of Cd(II), Zn(II) and Ni(II) from aqueous solutions in binary and ternary component systems by tourmaline was investigated. Kinetic data were accurately fitted to pseudo-second order and internal diffusion models, which indicated that the adsorption of heavy metals occurred on the interior surface of the sorbent and internal diffusion was the controlling mechanism during heavy metal ion adsorption but was not the only rate-controlling step. Additionally, tourmaline had a very good adsorption capacity for Cd(II), Zn(II) and Ni(II) in multi-component aqueous solutions at strongly acidic pH values (in contrast to industrial wastewater pH values). This good adsorption capacity is attributed to the fact that tourmaline can automatically adjust the pH values of acidic (except pH 2.0 and 3.0), neutral or alkaline aqueous solutions to 6.0. Adsorption isotherms and separation factors showed that tourmaline displays a high selectivity toward one metal in a two-component or a three-component system with an affinity order of Cd(II) > Zn(II) > Ni(II). Thermodynamic parameters indicated that heavy metal adsorption was feasible, spontaneous, and endothermic. Therefore, tourmaline should be explored as a material for removing pollutants from the strongly acidic wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3amodels 3anickel 3apH 3apollutants 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 3azinc 2aAdsorption 2aCadmiumxchemistry 2aDiffusion 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aMineralsxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aNickelxchemistry 2aSolutions 2aThermodynamics 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 2aZincxchemistry 0aTourmaline 0aHeavy metals 0aCompetitive adsorption 0aKinetic 0aAdsorption model 0aEquilibrium1 aWang, Cuiping1 aLiu, Jingting1 aWang, Baolin,1 aSun, Hongwen0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 128 p.727-734dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245008800167500002000255520152100275592002801796650001801824650003101842650002901873650002501902650001101927650001501938650001501953650001701968650001801985650002502003650001002028650001702038650001502055650001702070650002202087650001802109650001802127650001002145650001602155650002002171650001702191650001402208650001102222650001102233650001502244650001102259700002102270700001702291700002102308773010002329856007402429852000902503655001202512IND60587221220221118035926.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058722122DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.124062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Sullivan, Siobhan M.10aBioactivity of bovine lung hydrolysates prepared using papain, pepsin, and Alcalase  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBovine lung tissue was hydrolyzed using three different proteases, papain, pepsin, or Alcalase, to generate hydrolysates. Hydrolysates showed little antioxidant activity in noncellular or cellular assays. The anti‐inflammatory activity of hydrolysates was assessed in RAW264.7 macrophages and Jurkat T cells. Treatment with the Alcalase hydrolysate significantly decreased the production of the pro‐inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)‐6 and IL‐1β in a dose dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells. Nitric oxide production also significantly decreased following treatment with this hydrolysate. The papain hydrolysate decreased IL‐6, IL‐1β, and NO production in RAW264.7 cells and IL‐2 production in Jurkat T cells. However, the decrease was likely due to cytotoxicity of this hydrolysate toward these cell lines. The pepsin hydrolysate had no effect on cytokine production in RAW264.7 cells and only slightly decreased IL‐2 production in Jurkat T cells. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Meat production generates large amounts of protein rich co‐products, which are often discarded as waste or sold as low value animal feeds. The enzymatic hydrolysis of these protein co‐products may produce hydrolysates that are capable of reducing oxidation or inflammation. Novel hydrolysates were generated from the hydrolysis of bovine lung and results from this study indicate that the hydrolysis of bovine lung using the commercially available protease Alcalase may have potential as an anti‐inflammatory agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aantioxidant activity 3acattle 3acell lines 3acoproducts 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afeeds 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3alungs 3amacrophages 3ameat production 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3apapain 3apepsin 3asubtilisin 3awastes1 aLafarga, Tomás,1 aHayes, Maria1 aO'Brien, Nora M.0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 41, no. 6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.124063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002500169245016500194300001600359520165600375592002802031653002402059653001802083653001402101653002302115700002802138700002002166700003002186700002302216700002802239773012702267856011702394852000902511655001202520IND60127927320221119150505.0151114e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012792732DNAL7 a10.1290/1543-706X(2003)039<0291:FOAPCC>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBURTEAU, CAROLINE C.10aFortification of a protein-free cell culture medium with plant peptones improves cultivation and productivity of an interferon-γγ––producing cho cell line  ap. 291-296.  aA strong tendency is currently emerging to remove not only serum but also any product of animal origin from animal cell culture media during production of recombinant proteins. This should facilitate downstream processing and improve biosafety. One way consists in the fortification of protein-free nutritive media with plant protein hydrolysates. To investigate the effects of plant peptones on mammalian cell cultivation and productivity, CHO 320 cells, a clone of CHO K1 cells genetically modified to secrete human interferon-γγ (IFN-γγ), were first adapted to cultivation in suspension in a protein-free medium. Both cell growth and IFN-γγ secretion were found to be equivalent to those reached in serum-containing medium. Eight plant peptones, selected on the basis of their content in free amino acids and oligopeptides, as well as molecular weight distribution of oligopeptides, were tested for their ability to improve culture parameters. These were improved in the presence of three peptones, all having an important fraction of oligopeptides ranging from 1 to 10 kDa and a small proportion of peptides higher than 10 kDa. These peptones do not seem to add significantly to the nutritive potential to basal protein-free nutritive medium. Nevertheless, supplementation of an oligopeptide-enriched wheat peptone improved cell growth by up to 30%% and IFN-γγ production by up to 60%% in shake-flask experiments. These results suggest that the use of plant peptones with potential growth factor––like or antiapoptotic bioactivities could improve mammalian cell cultivation in protein-free media while increasing the product biosafety.  aPublisher supplied data 0acell culture system 0aCHO 320 cells 0abiosafety 0abiopharmaceuticals1 aVERHOEYE, FRANÇÇIS R.1 aMOLS, JOHANN F.1 aBALLEZ, JEAN-SÉÉBASTIEN1 aAGATHOS, SPIROS N.1 aSCHNEIDER, YVES-JACQUES0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2003 July, v. 39, no. 7 p.291-296dTissue Culture Associationx1543-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1290%2F1543-706X%282003%29039%3C0291%3AFOAPCC%3E2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01406naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009500162300001600257520027200273592002800545650002300573650001400596650003600610650002300646650001100669650002400680650001200704650003000716650001400746700002500760700002300785700002200808773013100830856007400961852000901035655001201044IND60660768120221119004404.0190827e20141211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066076812DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07917e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuselli, Mickaël10aPd-Catalyzed direct C–H functionalization of imidazolones with aryl- and alkenyl halides  ap. 745-748.  aDirect C–H arylation and alkenylation of 4,4′-dialkylimidazolones with a broad range of halides under palladium and copper catalysis have been developed.

Experimental results have shown that the BDD electrode modified with folic acid can clearly denote folate receptor-rich cancer cells, such as HeLa cells, at a concentration down to 10 cellsmL⁻¹. The high sensitivity of BDD electrode is resulted from the change of field effect and surface charge density of BDD after cancer cells attachment. The BDD electrodes can be regenerated with 0.1M citric acid/glycine/HC1 at pH 3.0 and used seven times again. Therefore, electrochemical technique with BDD electrode has been introduced for cancer cells detection and a simple method to detect folate receptor-rich cancer cells without additional labeling has been developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananogold 3aelectrodes 3aelectrochemistry 3acell membranes 3afolic acid 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3acitric acid 3abiosensors 0aimpedance1 aZhang, Zhaowu1 aSun, Liping1 aWang, Jin-An,0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 26, no. 5 p.1847-1852dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2010.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04390naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002500170245012700195300001600322520215300338592002802491650002502519650001702544650001902561650001502580650002502595650001502620650002502635650001802660650001702678650001702695650002202712650002602734650001102760650001602771650001302787650001502800650002602815650002402841650001702865650002702882650002602909650003802935650001402973650001602987650002103003650001903024650001103043650000903054650003803063650007403101650002403175650003503199650002703234653000803261653001903269653001203288653000803300653002303308653001603331700002303347700002103370700002703391700002803418773010403446856008503550852000903635655001203644IND60113338220221118015434.0160903e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011333822DNAL7 a238513202pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalogerakis, Nicolas10aRecovery of antioxidants from olive mill wastewaters: A viable solution that promotes their overall sustainable management  ap. 749-758.  aOlive mill wastewaters (OMW) are rich in water-soluble polyphenolic compounds that show remarkable antioxidant properties. In this work, the recovery yield of compounds, such as hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, as well as total phenols (TPh) from real OMW was investigated. Antioxidants were recovered by means of liquid–liquid solvent extraction. For this purpose, a laboratory-scale pilot unit was established and the effect of various organic solvents, namely ethyl acetate, diethyl ether and a mixture of chloroform/isopropyl alcohol, on process efficiency was investigated. It was found that the performance of the three extraction systems decreased in the order: ethyl acetate > chloroform/isopropanol > diethyl ether, in terms of their antioxidant recovery yield. It was estimated that treatment of 1 m3 OMW with ethyl acetate could provide 0.247 kg hydroxytyrosol, 0.062 kg tyrosol and 3.44 kg of TPh. Furthermore, the environmental footprint of the whole liquid–liquid extraction system was estimated by means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to provide the best available and most sustainable extraction technique. From an environmental perspective, it was found that ethyl acetate and diethyl ether had similar environmental impacts. Specifically, for the production of 1 g hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol or TPh, 13.3, 53.1 or 0.949 kg CO2 equivalent would be released to the atmosphere, respectively. On the other hand, the chloroform/isopropyl alcohol mixture had detrimental effects onto ecosystems, human health and fossil fuels resources. In total, ethyl acetate yields low environmental impacts and high antioxidant recovery yield and thus it can be considered as the best solution, both from the environmental and technical point of view. Three alternative scenarios to improve the recovery performance and boost the sustainability of the ethyl acetate extraction system were also investigated and their total environmental impacts were estimated. It was found that with small process modifications the environmental impacts could be reduced by 29%, thus achieving a more sustainable antioxidants recovery process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarbon dioxide 3achloroform 3aecological footprint 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aethyl acetate 3afossil fuels 3ahuman health 3aisopropyl alcohol 3alife cycle assessment 3aolives 3apolyphenols 3asolvents 3awastewater 2a2-Propanolxchemistry 2aAcetatesxchemistry 2aAntioxidants 2aChemical Fractionation 2aChloroformxchemistry 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aEtherxchemistry 2aGlobal Warming 2aHumans 2aOlea 2aPhenolsxisolation & purification 2aPhenylethyl Alcoholxanalogs & derivativesxisolation & purification. 2aSolventsxchemistry 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWastewaterxchemistry. 0aOMW 0aHydroxytyrosol 0aTyrosol 0aLCA 0aSolvent extraction 0aPolyphenols1 aPolitē, Maria L.,1 aFoteinis, Spyros1 aChatzisymeon, Efthalia1 aMantzavinos, Dionissios0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 128 p.749-758dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016000172520090400332592002801236650003401264650002601298650004101324650002501365650001301390650000901403650001001412650002001422650001901442650001601461653001901477653001501496653001601511653002701527700002001554700002501574773012201599856008101721852000901802655001201811IND60682953520221117215914.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068295352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashfi, Atefeh Sadat10aSimultaneous study of the antioxidant activity, microbial decontamination and color of dried peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) using low pressure cold plasma  aThis study purpose was to investigate the effect of radiofrequency low pressure cold plasma (LPCP) process by using dried peppermint (Mentha piperita) on the reduction in microbial load, antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, and color. The microbial load of the sample was investigated by infecting it with 10⁶ CFU/g of Escherichia coli O157:H7, and after treatment with LPCP at 20, 50, and 60 W for 20 min. It was found that LPCP process had a significant effect on the removal of E. coli O157:H7 at 50 and 60 W, but at 20 W revealed no significant effect on this bacterium removal (p > 0.05). The LPCP significantly increased the total phenolic content (p < 0.05); consequently, antioxidant activity increased after studying the antioxidant properties by two methods of FRAP and DPPH in all 3 powers. The results also indicated that the LPCP darkened the treated sample's color.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3acold 3acolor 3adecontamination 3amicrobial load 3aradio waves 0aRF cold plasma 0aPeppermint 0aAntioxidant 0aTotal phenolic content1 aRamezan, Yousef1 aKhani, Mohammad Reza0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Apr., v. 123 p.109121-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245012500210300001800335520161700353592002801970650001401998650001702012650002202029650001102051650002402062650002702086650001402113650002102127650001802148651001202166700002402178700002302202700002202225700002002247700002402267773015202291856008302443852000902526655001202535IND60762155420221117112734.0220108e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076215542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-15151-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabatunde, Olubayo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6533-717110aAssessing the use of hybrid renewable energy system with battery storage for power generation in a University in Nigeria  ap. 4291-4310.  aThis paper analyzes the adoption of an off-grid hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for a high-rise building owned by a public institution in Nigeria. The analysis is based on the comparison between the use of a single criterion and multiple criteria in the selection of the most feasible energy system. The proposed HRES comprises of a wind turbine, diesel generator, photovoltaic (PV), and battery storage system. Hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources (HOMER) software was used to design the HRES for a case study (based on a single criterion-total net present cost), while Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method was used to evaluate the effect of choosing an optimal system based on multiple criteria. Based on the simulations conducted with HOMER, eight feasible HRES (ES1-ES8) were identified. When the feasible HRES were ranked based on total (NPC), the optimal configuration comprises 70 kW PV modules, 20 kW diesel generating set, 40 kW converter, and 70, 3000 Ah batteries. The results obtained from the optimization process were subjected to a multi-criteria analysis based on sustainability principles. The ranking of the first two systems (ES1 and ES2) returned by single criterion (total NPC) remained the same, while changes were observed in the ranks of the remaining systems (ES3–ES8). This modular feasibility study shows that it would be economical to power the entire university using HRES. It is expected that this study would help the university communities and other stakeholders make informed decision during the planning stage of similar projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3afeasibility studies 3agenerators (equipment) 3apollution 3apower generation 3awind turbines 3aNigeria1 aDenwigwe, Iheanacho1 aOyebode, Oluwaseun1 aIghravwe, Desmond1 aOhiaeri, Adaeze1 aBabatunde, Damilola0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 3 p.4291-4310dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15151-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010700168506010400275506007600379520094600455592002801401506003701429650002301466650001301489650002001502650001901522650002301541650000901564650002101573650001601594650001501610650001501625650001101640650000901651650002501660653002901685653002101714653002101735653002401756700002201780700003101802700002301833700002701856700006101883773009601944856005102040852000902091655001202100IND60783566120221207075554.0220719e20221230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078356612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fochms.2022.1001202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chengkang10aCysteine residues are responsible for the sulfurous off-flavor formed in heated whey protein solutions  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOdor-active volatile sulfur compounds are formed in heated food protein systems.

However, the addition of maleate (cis-configuration) to a fluorinated moiety is challenging due to its potential isomerization during esterification. Various synthetic routes were attempted and led to very low conversion or side-products. The immiscibility of both reagents combined with an easy isomerization or attack on the double bond were potential explanations. In this paper, the synthesis of maleates oligo(hexafluoropropylene oxide) is reported by Steglich esterification and the reaction conditions are discussed depending on the molecular weight of the fluorinated moieties. After UV-curing, hydrophobic polymers were obtained by copolymerization with vinyl ethers by electron acceptor–donor systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acopolymerization 3aesterification 3aethers 3ahydrophobicity 3aisomerization 3amaleates 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3apolymers1 aDecostanzi, Mélanie1 aBurgess, Julia1 aTrusiano, Giuseppe1 aBurgess, Trevor1 aBongiovanni, Roberta1 aJoly-Duhamel, Christine1 aFriesen, Chadron M.0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 21, v. 8, no. 57 p.32664-32671dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06354k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01971naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245009200212300001600304520079100320592002801111650001601139650002201155650001201177650002401189650001301213700003201226700002501258700002101283700002301304700002601327700002101353700002601374773009401400856008201494852000901576655001201585IND60530812120221123014432.0210124e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053081212DNAL7 a272941772pmid7 aPMC48898752pmcid7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelivanova, Olga M.10aX-ray diffraction and electron microscopy data for amyloid formation of Aβ40 and Aβ42  ap. 108-113.  aThe data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled “One of the possible mechanisms of amyloid fibrils formation based on the sizes of primary and secondary folding nuclei of Aβ40 and Aβ42” (Dovidchenko et al., 2016) [1].

Ten cosmic-ray probes were set up in the Rur catchment located in western Germany, and calibrated by gravimetric soil sampling campaigns. Aboveground biomass was estimated at the sites to investigate the role of vegetation cover on the neutron flux and the calibration procedure. Three parameterization methods were used to generate site-specific neutron flux – soil water content calibration curves: (i) the N0-method, (ii) the hydrogen molar fraction method (hmf-method), and (iii) the COSMIC-method. At five locations, calibration measurements were repeated to evaluate site-specific calibration parameters obtained in two different sampling campaigns. At two locations, soil water content determined by cosmic-ray probes was evaluated with horizontally and vertically weighted soil water content measurements of two distributed in situ soil water content sensor networks. All three methods were successfully calibrated to determine field scale soil water content continuously at the ten sites. The hmf-method and the COSMIC-method had more similar calibration curves than the N0-method. The three methods performed similarly well in the validation and errors were within the uncertainty of neutron flux measurements despite observed differences in the calibration curves and variable model complexity. In addition, we found that the obtained calibration parameters NCOSMIC, N0 and NS showed a strong correlation with aboveground biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3ahumid zones 3ahydrogen 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3auncertainty 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds 3aGermany 0aSoil water content 0aCosmic-ray probe network 0aNeutron 0aParameterization methods1 aBogena, H.R.1 aHendricks Franssen, H.-J.1 aHuisman, J.A.1 aQu, W.1 aMontzka, C.1 aVereecken, H.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Aug. 04, v. 516 p.231-244dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.02.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01842naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245013700208300001400345520071900359592002801078650001501106650002501121650002001146650001101166650001401177650002301191700002001214700002201234700002401256700001701280773009201297856008201389852000901471655001201480IND60530812220221123023142.0210124e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053081222DNAL7 a272845682pmid7 aPMC48875532pmcid7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Abhishek10aData on the evolutionary history of the V(D)J recombination-activating protein 1 – RAG1 coupled with sequence and variant analyses  ap. 87-92.  aRAG1 protein is one of the key component of RAG complex regulating the V(D)J recombination.

The soil moisture data from these models have been used for operational drought monitoring activities, but so far have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, three available in situ soil moisture observation data sets in the United States were used to evaluate the model-simulated soil moisture for different time scales varying from daily to annual. First, we used the observed multiple layer monthly and annual mean soil moisture from the Illinois Climate Network to evaluate 20-years (January 1985–December 2004) of model-simulated soil moisture in terms of skill and analysis of error statistics. Second, we utilized 6-years (1 January 1997–31 December 2002) of daily soil moisture observed from 72 sites over the Oklahoma Mesonet network to assess daily and monthly simulation skill and errors for 3 model soil layers (0–10cm, 10–40cm, 40–100cm). Third, we extended the daily assessment to sites over the continental United States using 8-years (1 January 2002–31 December 2009) of observations for 121 sites from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). Overall, all models are able to capture wet and dry events and show high skill (in most cases, anomaly correlation is larger than 0.7), but display large biases when compared to in situ observations. These errors may come from model errors (i.e., model structure error, model parameter error), forcing data errors, and in situ soil moisture measurement errors. For example, all models simulate less soil moisture due to lack of modeled irrigation and ground water processes in Illinois, Oklahoma, and the other Midwest states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adrought 3aenergy 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3asoil water 3astatistics 3aIllinois 3aOklahoma 0aSoil moisture 0aU.S. 0aValidation 0aNLDAS-2 0aLand surface models1 aSheffield, Justin1 aEk, Michael B.1 aDong, Jiarui1 aChaney, Nathaniel1 aWei, Helin1 aMeng, Jesse1 aWood, Eric F.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 May 06, v. 512 p.107-125dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008100174300001400255520135300269592002801622650002001650650000901670650000901679650001701688650001401705653000901719653001301728653002201741653001701763700001901780700001901799700002101818700002301839700001901862773011501881856008701996852000902083655001202092IND60532460820221123015035.0190318e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053246082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2014.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecques, Aurélie10aBehaviour in order to evaluate the palatability of pet food in domestic cats  ap. 55-61.  aPalatability of pet food has been mainly assessed by intake ratios. In the present study we have searched for behavioural clues of food palatability in domestic cats Felis catus. Two diets differing in palatability (Very Palatable Kibbles and Low Palatable Kibbles) were evaluated by a panel of 17 cats using an automated feeding station and video recordings. The cats tested each diet in two different sessions, with only one diet during a given session. A session lasted for two consecutive days with food continuously available during 20h per 24h period. At each of their visit to the feeding station, the quantity of food eaten by a cat, the speed of consumption and the latency to eat were recorded. The behaviour of the cat was also analysed for each visit. All the cats made at least four visits to the feeding station during a 24h period. We compared the different quantitative variables between the two diets for the first three visits and for the last visit of each of the two days of a session. Our results showed that, as expected, cats ate more VPK than LPK. Addressing behavioural patterns, the length of sniffing was significantly reduced with VPK on the two first visits of the first day, suggesting less hesitation in this situation. Neither the latency nor the speed of consumption was affected by the palatability of the kibbles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3acats 3adiet 3apalatability 3apet foods 0aCats 0aPet food 0aFeeding behaviour 0aPalatability1 aLarose, Claire1 aBaron, Céline1 aNiceron, Cécile1 aFéron, Christophe1 aGouat, Patrick0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2014 Oct., v. 159 p.55-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2014.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008600163506011700249506007600366520174600442592002802188506003702216650001002253650001002263650002002273650001202293650001902305650001502324650002002339650001102359650002202370650001002392651001002402653001902412653001202431653002102443653001402464653001502478700005602493700001602549700002002565773010602585856008202691852000902773655001202782IND60783566520221207075504.0220920e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078356652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tfp.2022.1003012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmponsah, A10aLand cover changes of Atewa Range Forest Reserve, a biodiversity hotspot in Ghana  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtected forests are areas of economic, social, and ecological significance which often depict the original fauna and flora of a region. Notwithstanding their significance, anthropogenic disturbances pose a major threat to the conservation of protected forests in Ghana. The Atewa Range Forest Reserve is a Globally Significant Biodiversity Area (GSBA) and an Important Bird Area in Ghana, but illegal mining and agriculture activities are depleting the vegetation of the reserve. The present study examined land cover change in the Atewa Range Forest Reserve using Remote Sensing and GIS methods. A vegetation study was also conducted to reveal the tree species diversity of Atewa. The image classification revealed that Closed Forest area of the reserve had increased by 10.5%, Opened Forest area had decreased by -24.0% and shrub/herb area also decreased by -37.1% between 1990 and 2021. On the contrary, bare/build-up area had increased by 243.7% between 1990 and 2021. A total of 102 tree species belonging to 33 families were identified in the reserve of which, an estimated 12% of these species are either vulnerable or near threatened based on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (ICUN) red list. The study concludes that bare/build-up areas within the reserve are increasing at a quicker pace which is a threat to the shrub/herb and opened forest covers and will subsequently affect the quality of the closed forest cover if left unchecked. Care and special attention are needed to prevent species which are either vulnerable or near threatened from getting extinct. Forest Services Division and Traditional authorities should strengthen law enforcement of anthropogenic exploitation to help protect the reserve.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afauna 3aflora 3aforest reserves 3aforests 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3alaw enforcement 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aGhana 0aForest reserve 0aLanduse 0aLandcover change 0aDepletion 0aVegetation1 aNasare, L.I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6001-635X1 aTom-Dery, D1 aBaatuuwie, B.N.0 tTrees, forests and people.g2022 Sept., v. 9 p.100301-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27502x2666-71937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tfp.2022.1003013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03773naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008500167300001500252500001500267520225000282592002802532650004302560650001602603650001102619650001102630650001802641650001102659650001602670650005202686650001902738650001802757650002202775650000902797650002202806650000702828650001302835650001402848650000802862653001202870653002202882653001602904653002502920653001402945700001702959700001602976700001702992700001603009773011103025856008603136852000903222655001203231IND60602680920221120044431.0180711e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060268092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerrin, A.10aRapid, simple and efficient method for detection of viral genomes on raspberries  ap. 95-101.  a2019-12-06  aIn recent years, foodborne viruses, especially human noroviruses (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), have been increasingly reported as the causes of foodborne disease outbreaks. Soft red fruits, especially raspberries, have a high incidence among the types of food concerned. Due to low infectious doses and low concentrations of enteric viruses in food samples, it is necessary to have an efficient and rapid detection method to implement prevention measures. A standard method for virus detection and quantification in food, including raspberries (XP CEN ISO/TS 15216-1 and -2, 2013) is currently available. This method proposes a consensus detection approach by RT-real time PCR (RT-qPCR) but also a virus extraction procedure based on the elution-concentration principle. In this study, an alternative method of extraction in which RNAs are directly extracted from food matrices (based on direct RNA extraction) has been optimized. First, each step was improved to make it a highly rapid, specific and simple method. Second, the standard virus concentration method was compared with the optimized direct RNA extraction one. Human enteric viral surrogates, Murine Norovirus (MNV) and F-specific RNA bacteriophage GA, were selected according to their adhesion properties and resistance to pH close to our main targets (NoV and HAV). Raspberries were artificially contaminated using two different techniques (immersion and spotting) in order to define a recovery rate and the amounts of virus recovered. Results showed that the direct RNA extraction method revealed significantly higher viral extraction efficiency (46.2%) than the elution-concentration method (20.3%), with similar proportions of inhibitors for both. In the same way with inoculation by spotting, the best recovery rate of GA phage (39.7% against 0.7%) and MNV (42.8% against 0.5%) was observed by direct RNA extraction. For the lowest concentrations of phage and virus in the immersion bath, only the direct RNA extraction method allowed their recovery. Direct RNA extraction proved to be more effective (best recovery rate), faster (<8h) and simpler (fewer steps) than the one proposed in the CEN ISO standard method when it came to detecting enteric viruses on raspberries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araspberries 3afruits 3ahumans 3aHepatovirus A 3agenome 3afood matrix 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3abacteriophages 3arapid methods 3adisease outbreaks 3amice 3afoodborne illness 3apH 3aadhesion 3aNorovirus 3aRNA 0aRT-qPCR 0aHepatitis A virus 0aRaspberries 0aF-specific RNA phage 0aDetection1 aLoutreul, J.1 aBoudaud, N.1 aBertrand, I.1 aGantzer, C.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2015 Nov., v. 224 p.95-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245011200159520135800271592002801629650001501657650001701672650001601689650001201705650001501717650002001732650002101752650001701773650001001790653003601800653003301836653001601869653002601885700001301911700001601924700001401940773012401954856008202078852000902160655001202169IND60775918820221121023003.0220509e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077591882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2022.1092672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tao10aVPO1/HOCl/ERK pathway mediates the right ventricular remodeling in rats with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension  aRight ventricular (RV) remodeling is a major feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Vascular peroxidase 1 (VPO1) is reported to participate in the process of PAH. This study aims to explore whether VPO1 contributes to hypoxia-induced cardiac hypertrophy and the underlying mechanisms. SD rats were exposure to continuous hypoxia (10% O₂) for 3 weeks, which showed RV hypertrophy (increases in the ratio of RV weight to tibia length, cardiac cell size and hypertrophic markers), concomitant with upregulation of VPO1, elevation in hypochlorous acid (HOCl) production and ERK phosphorylation. In hypoxia (3% O₂)-induced hypertrophic H9c2 cells, similar characteristics of cardiac hypertrophy to that of hypoxia-treated rats were observed. Administration of VPO1 siRNA or NaHS (the HOCl inhibitor) suppressed HOCl production, ERK phosphorylation, and cardiac hypertrophy. Replacement of hypoxia with NaClO (exogenous HOCl) could also induce cardiac cell hypertrophy and activate ERK signaling pathway. In addition, hypoxia-induced cardiac hypertrophy could be blocked by PD98059 (the ERK-specific inhibitor). Based on these observations, we conclude that VPO1 promotes RV remodeling in PAH rats through catalyzing HOCl production, leading to the activation of ERK signaling. Thus, VPO1 may have the potential as a therapeutic target for PAH.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophysics 3ahypertension 3ahypertrophy 3ahypoxia 3aperoxidase 3aphosphorylation 3apulmonary artery 3atherapeutics 3atibia 0aPulmonary arterial hypertension 0aRight ventricular remodeling 0aHypertrophy 0aVascular peroxidase 11 aLiu, Bin1 aLuo, Xiu-Ju1 aPeng, Jun0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2022 July 15, v. 723 p.109267-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2022.1092673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158300002000283520136300303592002801666650003701694650001101731650001401742650002301756650002301779650001801802650001301820650001201833650001101845650001101856650003701867700002001904700001401924700001701938700001601955700001701971700001601988773012502004856007402129852000902203655001202212IND60617180520221119053842.0181024e20180912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061718052DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra06365f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Linhong10aFabrication and catalytic properties of ordered cyclopalladated diimine monolayer : investigation on catalytic mechanism  ap. 31860-31867.  a“Channel-like” self-assembled monolayers having aliphatic and aromatic diimines (denoted as Si@1DIS, Si@2DIS and Si@3DIS) immobilized on substrates and their palladacycle monolayers (Si@1DIS-Pd, Si@2DIS-Pd and Si@3DIS-Pd) were prepared and characterized. Their catalytic performances were investigated using the Suzuki coupling reaction as a model. Si@3DIS-Pd showed the highest catalytic activity in water without ligands, and better recyclability than that of Si@2DIS-Pd and Si@1DIS-Pd. The reason was the carbon in the aliphatic diimine of Si@2DIS-Pd and Si@1DIS-Pd was easily hydrolyzed because of the active hydrogen of α-C, resulting in poor recyclability. Control of the amount of catalyst could be achieved by modulating the diameter of the channel-like structure, which also affected the catalytic activity. The catalytic process and mechanism were investigated systematically and proposed based on the experimental results obtained by the water contact angle, ultraviolet spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and atomic force spectroscopy. Changes in the morphology of monolayer surfaces during the catalytic process with or without stirring presented a clear process from order to disorder, and indicated that the reaction was a heterogeneous catalytic process occurring on the surface of the catalyst monolayer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3acontact angle 3ahydrogen 3aligands 3amixing 3amodels 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aHuang, Pingping1 aYang, Jun1 aLi, Tiesheng1 aMao, Luyuan1 aLiu, Minghua1 aWu, Yangjie0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 12, v. 8, no. 56 p.31860-31867dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06365f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013100176300001400307520150400321592002801825650001601853650000901869650002301878650002301901650003301924650002201957650002401979650001602003650001302019650002502032653002902057653006202086653003102148653002602179653002202205700006202227700002402289773009602313856008502409852000902494655001202503IND60554512420221120162317.0161024e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055451242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsharaa, Abdulnaser10aSingle-step microwave assisted headspace liquid-phase microextraction of trihalomethanes and haloketones in biological samples  ap. 43-48.  aA single-step microwave assisted headspace liquid-phase microextraction (MA-HS-LPME) method was developed for determination of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloketones (HKs) in biological samples. In this method, a porous membrane envelope was filled with few microliters of extraction solvent and then placed inside the microwave extraction vial. A PTFE ring was designed to support the membrane envelope over a certain height inside the vial. An optimum amount of biological sample was placed in the vial equipped with magnetic stirrer. After that nitric acid was added to the vial for digestion of biological sample. The sample was digested and the volatile THMs and HKs were extracted at headspace in the solvent containing porous membrane. After simultaneous digestion and extraction, the extract was injected to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for analysis. Factors affecting the extraction efficiency were optimized to achieve higher extraction performance. Quantification was carried out over a concentration range of 0.3–100ngg−1 for brominated compounds while for the chlorinated ones linear range was between 0.5–100ngg−1. Limit of detections (LODs) were ranged from 0.051 to 0.110ngg−1 while limit of quantification (LOQ) were in the range of 0.175–0.351ngg−1. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the calibrations were ranged between 1.1 and 6.8%.

In this study, a process-based terrestrial model, version 4 of the Community Land Model (CLM4), was used to quantify the spatiotemporal changes in runoff across the region, driven by the varying climate factors and CO2 concentration. Overall, our simulations suggest that climate-induced runoff in this region display a decreasing trend since 1960. Changes in precipitation, solar radiation, air temperature, and wind speed account for 56%, −14%, 13%, and −5% of the overall decrease in annual runoff, respectively, although their relative contributions vary across the study area. The rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration was determined to have a limited impact on runoff. A significant decrease in runoff in the southern and northeastern portions of the region is primarily attributed to decreasing precipitation, whereas decreasing solar radiation and increasing air temperature were the primary causes of a slight runoff increase in the northern portion. Our results also suggest that the magnitude of the decreasing trend may be greatly underestimated if the dynamic interactions of vegetation phenology and the environmental factors are not considered in the modelling, indicating the importance of including vegetation dynamics in the prediction of runoff trends in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3amodels 3aphenology 3aprediction 3arunoff 3asolar radiation 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3awind speed 3aChina 0aRunoff 0aClimate change 0aVegetation dynamics 0aCommunity Land Model 0aHaihe River basin1 aYang, Dawen1 aHuang, Maoyi0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Apr. 16, v. 511 p.786-799dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245012100202300001600323520082300339592002801162650002001190650002401210650002501234650002001259650001401279650001001293650003401303650001401337650002501351653002201376653003901398653000801437653001101445700001701456700001401473700001601487700001401503700001901517700001501536773009301551856008201644852000901726655001201735IND60530812620221123014452.0210124e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053081262DNAL7 a276726742pmid7 aPMC50303112pmcid7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei10aData set for phylogenetic tree and RAMPAGE Ramachandran plot analysis of SODs in Gossypium raimondii and G. arboreum  ap. 345-348.  aThe data presented in this paper is supporting the research article “Genome-Wide Analysis of Superoxide Dismutase Gene Family in Gossypium raimondii and G. arboreum” [1].

However, our knowledge of how nanoparticles enter plants, plant cells, and organelles is still insufficient. Here, we discuss the barriers that limit the efficient delivery of nanoparticles at the whole-plant and single-cell levels. Some commonly overlooked factors, such as light conditions and surface tension of applied nano-formulations, are discussed. Knowledge gaps regarding plant cell uptake of nanoparticles, such as the effect of electrochemical gradients across organelle membranes on nanoparticle delivery, are analyzed and discussed. The importance of controlling factors such as size, charge, stability, and dispersibility when properly designing nanomaterials for plants is outlined. We mainly focus on understanding how nanoparticles travel across barriers in plants and plant cells and the major factors that limit the efficient delivery of nanoparticles, promoting a better understanding of nanoparticle–plant interactions. We also provide suggestions on the design of nanomaterials for nano-enabled agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adispersibility 3aelectrochemistry 3aorganelles 3asurface tension 3atravel 0abarriers 0acell membranes 0acell wall 0aefficient delivery 0aelectrochemical gradients 0ananoparticles1 aLi, Zhaohu0 tPlant communications.g2022 June 06,  p.100346-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27283x2590-34627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xplc.2022.1003463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009500157300002000252520104300272592002801315650001501343650001501358650001801373650000901391650002001400650002001420650001701440650001101457650000701468650001701475650002401492650001901516650001601535650000901551651001001560700001701570700001801587773012501605856007401730852000901804655001201813IND60617180820221119053741.0181024e20180917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061718082DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra06376a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Feiqiang10aSimultaneous absorption of NO and SO₂ by combined urea and FeᴵᴵEDTA reaction systems  ap. 32138-32145.  aSO₂ and NO emitted from coal-fired power plants have caused serious air pollution in China. In this work, a novel mixed absorbent, FeᴵᴵEDTA/urea, was employed for simultaneous removal of SO₂ and NO in a packed tower, with a corresponding optimal ratio of 0.014 mol L⁻¹ : 5%. The effects of various factors, such as mixed absorbent constitutions, reaction temperature, pH, O₂ concentration, as well as concentrations of SO₂ and NO, on simultaneous removal were investigated. The desulfurization efficiency was 95–99% in all tests, whereas denitrification was affected significantly by various conditions. NO removal efficiency decreased increasing oxygen concentration as well as increasing NO concentration. With an increase in temperature, pH, or SO₂ concentration, NO removal efficiency increased first and then decreased. Under optimal conditions, SO₂ removal efficiency was 100% and NO removal efficiency could exceed 91% within 80 min. The reaction mechanism was speculated according to relevant literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3aair pollution 3acoal 3adenitrification 3adesulfurization 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen 3apH 3apower plants 3areaction mechanisms 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3aurea 3aChina1 aDeng, Xianhe1 aDing, Jianhua0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 17, v. 8, no. 56 p.32138-32145dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06376a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245007600154300001600230500001500246520156000261592002801821650003101849650001901880650001101899650001701910650002101927653002001948653001601968653002001984653002402004653002402028653001802052653002602070653002202096700001802118773011002136856007402246852000902320655001202329IND4436461720221120224937.0151127e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443646172DNAL7 a10.2193/2007-3132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarburton, B.10aTowards a Knowledge-Based Ethic for Lethal Control of Nuisance Wildlife  ap. 158-164.  a2019-12-06  aManagers of nuisance wildlife have to rely largely on using lethal methods until such time as nonlethal techniques, such as fertility control, become universally available for a wide range of species. Unfortunately, use of lethal tools has met with opposition from animal welfare and animal rights proponents. Although research has addressed some of the more tractable welfare concerns (e.g., making traps more humane), less tractable ethical issues associated with the justification of killing wildlife remain unresolved. Monistic welfare models or rights-based models have been proposed as ways of addressing these issues, but those that concentrate on the cognitive and conative capabilities of individual animals fail to resolve the ecological and social complexities involved in management of nuisance wildlife. Solutions need to recognize and accept the diversity of values (i.e., within a pluralistic strategy) as well as the uncertainty inherent in many of the systems being managed. Thus, when uncertainty is high in managing wildlife––resource systems, we propose the only ethically defensible action is to apply a knowledge-based ethic that ensures future actions will be carried out with increased understanding. Such an ethic can be made functional within an adaptive management framework that has, as its first tenet, the need to learn and reduce uncertainty. Failure to maximize learning in the presence of uncertainty has the potential to result in increased opposition to even soundly justified operations to manage nuisance wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 3awildlife damage management 3aanimal welfare 3aethics 3apest control 3avertebrate pests 0avertebrate pest 0auncertainty 0awicked problems 0awildlife management 0aadaptive management 0aanimal rights 0aknowledge-based ethic 0anuisance wildlife1 aNorton, B.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of the HPV-16 L1 methylation assay and E6/E7 mRNA test for detecting high-grade cervical lesions (CIN2+). A total of 81 women with liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples, histological results, and positive HPV–DNA test for HPV type 16 only were included in this study. HPV-16 L1 methylation and E6/E7 mRNA levels were measured using methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis and Quantivirus®HPV E6/E7 RNA 3.0 assay (bDNA), respectively, in the same residue of LBC samples. The current date showed a positive correlation between the HPV-16 L1 methylation and the E6/E7 mRNA levels. The L1 methylation and mRNA levels both increased with disease severity. The mRNA test method showed higher sensitivity and NPV (98.0 and 91.7% vs. 89.8 and 80.8%), while lower specificity and PPV (34.4 and 69.6% vs. 65.6 and 80.0%), than the L1 methylation assay for detecting histology-confirmed CIN2+. When using the detection method of mRNA test combined with L1 methylation assay, we obtained a sensitivity of 89.8% and a specificity of 71.9%.These findings suggest that assessment of HPV-16 L1 methylation testing combined with E6/E7 mRNA testing may be a promising method for the triage of women with HPV type 16 only.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell biology 3adisease severity 3ahistology 3amelting 3amessenger RNA 3amethylation 3awomen 0aCervical lesion 0aHuman papillomavirus 0aDNA methylation 0aE6/E7 mRNA1 aZhi, Yanfang1 aShen, Yong1 aGong, Jiaomei1 aLi, Ya1 aRong, Shouhua1 aOkunieff, Paul1 aZhang, Lulu1 aLi, Xiaofu0 tJournal of virological methods.g2015 Nov., v. 224 p.35-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010500166300001400271520104700285592002801332650001801360650002801378650002501406650001701431650001201448650001301460650001501473650001901488650001801507650001801525650001201543650001901555650002501574650001601599650000901615653001501624653002101639653003501660700001901695700002101714773011401735856008201849852000901931655001201940IND60530177720221120150812.0180830e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053017772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejbt.2015.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRevin, Victor10aEnzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of ultradispersed wood particles after ultrasonic pretreatment  ap. 14-19.  aA study of the correlation between the particle size of lignocellulosic substrates and ultrasound pretreatment on the efficiency of further enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to ethanol.The maximum concentrations of glucose and, to a lesser extent, di- and trisaccharides were obtained in a series of experiments with 48-h enzymatic hydrolysis of pine raw materials ground at 380–400rpm for 30min.

The glucose yield in this case (35.5g glucose l⁻¹) increased twofold compared to ground substrate without further preparation.Using a mechanical two-stage grinding of lignocellulosic raw materials with ultrasonication increases the efficiency of subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afermentation 3aglucose 3agrinding 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3aparticle size 3araw materials 3asawdust 3atrisaccharides 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3awood 0aBioethanol 0aLigsnocelluloses 0aYeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae1 aAtykyan, Nelli1 aZakharkin, Denis0 tElectronic Journal of Biotechnology.g2016 Mar., v. 20 p.14-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:17874x0717-34587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejbt.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245017000175300001400345520141800359592002801777650002301805650002101828650003801849650001101887650001701898650002301915650001801938650001801956650001601974650001101990650001502001650001202016650002602028700001802054700005602072773012102128856008902249852000902338655001202347IND60591248120221121021053.0190529e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059124812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruber, James V.10aIn vitro examination of an oleosome-based sun protection product on the influence of UVB-induced inflammation markers in human epidermal skin equivalent tissue model  ap. 39-45.  aIn vitro human epidermal skin equivalent tissues (MatTek EpiDerm™) were employed to examine the influence of UVB radiation on various established inflammation markers in the presence of topically applied sunscreens. MatTek EpiDerm™ tissues were treated with 2.0mg/cm2 of an Experimental oleosome-based SPF 30 product or a commercial SPF 30 beach product. Tissues were irradiated with 300mJ/cm2 of UVB radiation. Inflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as arachidonic acid cascade marker PGE2 were examined via ELISA-based antibody detection. Untreated tissues irradiated with 300mJ/cm2 of UVB radiation showed statistically significant upregulation of IL-1α, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as PGE2. Application of both the experimental oleosome-based SPF 30 formulation and the commercial SPF 30 formulation demonstrated an ability to prevent the upregulation of all four markers when applied prior to irradiation. The experimental oleosome-based SPF 30 product contained approximately 80% less sunscreen actives than the commercial formulation. This study demonstrates that in vitro reconstructed human tissues can be used to study the influences of sun screen actives in the presence of UVB radiation. The results support previously reported clinical results that demonstrated that oleosome-based sun care formulations can function with high protection effects with significantly less sun care actives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibody detection 3aarachidonic acid 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1alpha 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3airradiation 3amodels 3asunscreens 3atissues 3aultraviolet radiation1 aHoltz, Robert1 aIn Yang, Soo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2220-17030 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2018 Feb., v. 179 p.39-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245005700167300001600224520133400240592002801574506003701602650001401639650001001653650002001663650001701683650001101700650001701711650001501728650001601743650001701759650001501776650001601791700002001807773013301827856008501960852000902045655001202054IND60774727520221207131205.0220422e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077472752DNAL7 a10.1177/026119299001800124.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenssen, Dag10aStudies of Metabolism Mediated Mutagenicity In Vitro  ap. 243-250.  aTo understand the cause of the biological effects of xenobiotic metabolism in mammals, investigators have traditionally performed animal experiments by comparing the results of biochemical methods, such as measurement of enzyme activity analysis of the metabolites produced, with the observed toxicological effect. This article deals with in vitro methods for genotoxicity combined with drug metabolising preparations at the organelle, cell or organ levels, as exemplified by microsome preparations, isolated cells/cell lines and organ perfusion systems, respectively. The advantage of some of these methods for studying metabolism-mediated mutagenicity is that the measured endpoint reflects not only the bioactivating phase I reactions, but also the detoxifying phase II reactions, and the transfer of the non-conjugated reactive metabolites to other cells and their ability to cause mutations in these cells. In vivo, all these events are important factors in the initiation of cancer. A mechanistic advantage of the methods for metabolism-mediated mutagenicity in vitro is that the relevance of the different steps in metabolism for the mutational events can seldom be investigated in an in vivo assay. Furthermore, human studies can easily be performed using the co-culture technique with isolated human cells or cell lines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoculture 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3alaboratories 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amutagenicity 3atoxicology 3axenobiotics1 aRomert, Lennart0 tATLA.

PE was done at room temperature and 5 bar pressure (p). PEF treatment was done using bipolar near-rectangular pulse protocol. The traditional hot WE (T = 343 K, t = 2 h) gave the relatively high contents of proteins, total polyphenols and polysaccharides; however, the extracts were cloudy and their colloid stability was low. The extracts obtained using EE method were also cloudy and unstable. The sizes of particles in extracts, produced by WE and EE methods, were estimated as ≈ 0.25 and ≈ 5 μm, respectively. From the other side, the extracts, produced by PE and PE + PEF methods, were clear and their colloid stability was high. Moreover, both PE and PE + PEF methods allowed selective separation of different components. The PE + PEF method gave higher nucleic acid/proteins ratio as compared with that of PE method. Moreover, PE + PEF allowed production of mushroom extracts with high contents of fresh-like proteins and polysaccharides. Application of the EE method supplementary to the PE or PE + PEF techniques allowed for an effective extraction of the total polyphenols that was comparable with the efficiency of the WE method. ©Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aethanol 3amushrooms 3apolyphenols 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3apulsed electric fields 3atemperature1 aLebovka, N.

The process of its production is catalyzed by d-hydantoinase and d-carbamoylase in a two-step enzyme reaction. How to enhance the catalytic potential of the two enzymes is valuable for industrial application. In this investigation, an Escherichia coli strain genetically engineered with d-hydantoinase was immobilized by calcium alginate with certain adjuncts to evaluate the optimal condition for the biosynthesis of d-carbamoyl-p-hydroxyphenylglycine (d-CpHPG), the compound further be converted to d-hydroxyphenylglycine (d-HPG) by carbamoylase.The optimal medium to produce d-CpHPG by whole-cell immobilization was a modified Luria-Bertani (LB) added with 3.0% (W/V) alginate, 1.5% (W/V) diatomite, 0.05% (W/V) CaCl2 and 1.00mM MnCl2. The optimized diameter of immobilized beads for the whole-cell biosynthesis here was 2.60mm. The maximized production rates of d-CpHPG were up to 76%, and the immobilized beads could be reused for 12 batches.This investigation not only provides an effective procedure for biological production of d-CpHPG, but gives an insight into the whole-cell immobilization technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abeta-lactam antibiotics 3abiological production 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium alginate 3acalcium chloride 3adiatomaceous earth 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzymes 3agenetic engineering 3aindustrial applications 3amanganese chloride 3apesticides 0aCalcium alginate 0ad-Carbamoyl-p-hydroxyphenylglycine 0ad-Hydantoinase 0ad-Hydroxyphenylglycine 0aImmobilization 0aWhole cell1 aLi, Ya-dong1 aSun, Wan1 aFan, Shuai1 aFeng, Xiao-zhou1 aWang, Kang-you1 aHe, Wei-qing1 aYang, Zhao-yong0 tElectronic Journal of Biotechnology.g2016 May, v. 21 p.43-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:17874x0717-34587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejbt.2016.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009500164300001600259506011700275506007600392520178000468592002802248506003702276650002002313650002402333650001702357650002802374650001202402650000902414650002002423650001302443653001702456653001802473653003102491653002202522653002602544700002002570700001902590700005802609773010702667856008302774852000902857655001202866IND60779947920221207125639.0220619s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077994792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crfs.2022.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshaq, Anum10aPlant-based meat analogs: A review with reference to formulation and gastrointestinal fate  ap. 973-983.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe discussion about the development and consumption of plant-based meat alternatives has been raised since numerous decades and has become the topic of prime concern these days. Recently, the market of plant-based meat alternatives has enormously expanded. With the aim of investigating the present scenario of research on meat analogs and defining the future research areas, reasons for shifting the trends towards consumption of meat analogs due to several health and environmental issues, potential sources and technologies needed for the development of meat analogs, physicochemical properties of meat analogs, functionality of ingredients used for manufacturing plant-based meat analogs, gastrointestinal fate of meat analogs and resulting consumer acceptability are summarized in this review. Studies have revealed that various health and environmental concerns are associated with the meat production which is the key driving force for the development of meat analogs. Recently, modern structuring techniques of plant-based meat alternatives have improved their functionality, however, a need exists to focus on improving the functionality, sensory characteristics, safety, and selection of suitable ingredients for the production of meat analogs. Additionally, the consumers’ acceptability towards meat analogs is quite unsatisfactory which needs to be improved through proper research and creating awareness. Moreover, the gastrointestinal fate of the plant-based meat analogs needs further investigation in order to have a better understanding regarding the nutrient bioavailability of these products. The present review will be helpful in highlighting the current situation regarding the fate of meat analogs and opening new horizons of research in this domain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioavailability 3aconsumer acceptance 3afood science 3agastrointestinal system 3amarkets 3ameat 3ameat production 3aresearch 0aMeat analogs 0aFunctionality 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aConsumer behavior 0aGastrointestinal fate1 aIrfan, Shafeeqa1 aSameen, Arooba1 aKhalid, Nauman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8045-199X0 tCurrent research in food science.g2022, v. 5 p.973-983dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27271x2665-92717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2022.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245010200184300001600286520120200302592002801504650002601532650002101558650001501579650001401594650002401608650000901632650001201641650001001653650001201663650001801675650001401693650001201707650002601719650002901745650002001774650001201794650003101806650003101837650001101868650003101879650003001910650003201940650003001972650002902002650004302031650000902074650001302083650002402096650005302120650002102173650004402194650001702238650004002255650003002295700001802325700003002343700002202373773011202395856008202507852000902589655001202598IND4459918320221118232152.0141111e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445991832DNAL7 a212951432pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobback, Julie14aThe circadian clock genes affect reproductive capacity in the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria  ap. 313-321.  aThe circadian clocks govern many metabolic and behavioral processes in an organism. In insects, these clocks and their molecular machinery have been found to influence reproduction in many different ways. Reproductive behavior including courtship, copulation and egg deposition, is under strong influence of the daily rhythm. At the molecular level, the individual clock components also have their role in normal progress of oogenesis and spermatogenesis. In this study on the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria, three circadian clock genes were identified and their expression profiles were determined. High expression was predominantly found in reproductive tissues. Similar daily expression profiles were found for period (per) and timeless (tim), while the clock (clk) mRNA level is higher 12h before the first per and tim peak. A knockdown of either per or tim resulted in a significant decrease in the progeny produced by dsRNA treated females confirming the role of clock genes in reproduction and providing evidence that both PER and TIM are needed in the ovaries for egg development. Since the knockdown of clk is lethal for the desert locust, its function remains yet to be elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistocerca gregaria 3acircadian rhythm 3acopulation 3acourtship 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aeggs 3afemales 3agenes 3ainsects 3amessenger RNA 3aoogenesis 3aprogeny 3areproductive behavior 3areproductive performance 3aspermatogenesis 2aAnimals 2aCircadian Clocksxgenetics 2aCircadian Rhythmxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGene Knockdown Techniques 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenetic Fitnessxgenetics 2aGrasshoppersxphysiology 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMutation 2aOogenesisxgenetics 2aPeriod Circadian Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aReproduction 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 2aSpermatogenesisxgenetics1 aBoerjan, Bart1 aVandersmissen, Hans Peter1 aHuybrechts, Roger0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2011 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.313-321dElsevier Ltdx0965-17487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2011.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245021200170300001600382520131300398592002801711650001701739650001501756650002101771650001501792650004301807650001301850650002501863650001901888650001301907650002601920650002701946650002301973650001701996653003502013653003302048653002002081653002202101700001502123700001502138700001802153700002002171700002002191773009802211856008502309852000902394655001202403IND60554512920221120172553.0161024e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055451292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xian-Hua10aSynthesis of monodisperse molecularly imprinted microspheres with multi-recognition ability via precipitation polymerization for the selective extraction of cyromazine, melamine, triamterene and trimethoprim  ap. 127-131.  aThrough precipitation polymerization, three monodisperse molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) containing imprints of 2,4-diamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine (DM), cyromazine (CY) or trimethoprim (TM), were synthesized using methacrylic acid as functional monomer, divinylbenzene as cross-linker, and a mixture of acetonitrile–toluene (90/10, v/v) as porogen. The morphology and selectivity of the MIPs were characterized and compared systematically. The MIPs had the best specific binding in pure acetonitrile, and the data of adsorption experiment were fitted well with Langmuir and Freundlich model. In addition, DM-MIPs showed the excellent binding and multi-recognition capability for CY, melamine (ME), triamterene (TA) and TM, and the binding capacity were 7.18, 7.56, 5.66 and 5.45μmol/g, respectively. Due to the pseudo template and the ability of multi-recognition, DM-MIPs as sorbent material could avoid the effect of template leakage on quantitative analysis. Therefore, DM-MIPs were used as a solid-phase extraction material to enrich ME, CY, TA and TM from different bio-matrix samples for high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Under the optimized conditions, the recoveries of three spiked levels in different bio-matrix samples were ranged from 80.9% to 91.5% with RSD≤4.2 (n=3).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorption 3abinding capacity 3acyromazine 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amelamine 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aquantitative analysis 3asolid phase extraction 3asorption isotherms 3atrimethoprim 0aMolecularly imprinted polymers 0aPrecipitation polymerization 0aPseudo template 0aMulti-recognition1 aXie, Li-Fu1 aDong, Qian1 aLiu, Hao-Long1 aHuang, Yan-Ping1 aLiu, Zhao-Sheng0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 1007 p.127-131dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009100168300001400259520140800273592002801681650001101709650001201720650002401732650002701756650001001783650001101793650001501804650002201819653001301841653001401854653002201868653000801890700001501898700001601913700001701929700001801946700001501964773009001979856008502069852000902154655001202163IND60551310420221122031128.0161018e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055131042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinter, S.R.14aThe relation of hedonic hunger and restrained eating to lateralized frontal activation  ap. 64-69.  aAsymmetrical alpha activation in the prefrontal cortex (frontal asymmetry) in electroencephalography (EEG) has been related to eating behavior. Prior studies linked dietary restraint with right frontal asymmetry [1] and disinhibition with left frontal asymmetry [2]. The current study simultaneously assessed restrained eating and hedonic hunger (drive for food reward in the absence of hunger) in relation to frontal asymmetry. Resting-state EEG and measures of restrained eating (Revised Restraint Scale; RRS) and hedonic hunger (Power of Food Scale; PFS) were assessed in 61 non-obese adults. Individually, hedonic hunger predicted left asymmetry. However, PFS and RRS were correlated (r=0.48, p<0.05) and there was a significant interaction between PFS and RRS on frontal asymmetry, p<0.01. Results indicated that those high in hedonic hunger exhibited left asymmetry irrespective of RRS scores; among those low in PFS, only those high in RRS showed right asymmetry. Results were consistent with literature linking avoidant behaviors (restraint) with right-frontal asymmetry and approach behaviors (binge eating) with left-frontal asymmetry. It appears that a strong drive toward palatable foods predominates at a neural level even when restraint is high. Findings suggest that lateralized frontal activity is an indicator of motivation both to consume and to avoid consuming highly palatable foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abinging 3adietary restriction 3aelectroencephalography 3afoods 3ahunger 3amotivation 3aprefrontal cortex 0aAppetite 0aRestraint 0aFrontal asymmetry 0aEEG1 aFeig, E.H.1 aKounios, J.1 aErickson, B.1 aBerkowitz, S.1 aLowe, M.R.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 163 p.64-69dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245008000201500002200281506010400303506007600407520156400483592002802047506003702075650001502112650001802127650001002145650000902155650002602164650001102190700006102201700005902262700005802321773008702379856004502466852000902511655001202520IND60783567320221207060214.0220719e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078356732DNAL7 a10.3168/jdsc.2022-02432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolano, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1263-130410aMilking time behavior of dairy cows in a free-flow automated milking system  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objective of this preliminary observational study was to determine milking time behavior of cows in a free-flow automated (robotic) milking system (AMS) and identify potential factors that influenced the time waiting to be milked. Milking time behavior of 40 cows from 1 pen on a commercial dairy farm with a free-flow AMS was evaluated using video analysis over 2 d. For each study cow, data were assessed for waiting time to access the milking robot, the use of the fetch pen, robot refusals, and their lying behavior. On average, cows visited the robot to wait to be milked 6 times per day, for 15 min per visit, for a total daily waiting time of 88 min per cow (range 5 to 322 min). Daily waiting time was longer for primiparous cows and decreased with increasing days in milk, but this effect interacted with parity. Daily waiting time and number of visits to the robot were associated with voluntary use of the fetch pen. Furthermore, cows with long daily waiting times had shorter daily lying times compared with cows with short daily waiting times (9.5 vs. 11.1 h/d). It is possible that factors related to the design and layout of the AMS entry and fetch pen had an effect on waiting behavior. We inferred that adoption of grouping strategies intended to reduce competitive behavior, especially toward primiparous cows, could improve milking time behavior in a free-flow AMS. This preliminary observational data from a single herd highlights the need to confirm the findings across multiple AMS herds, both with free-flow and guided-flow systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautomation 3adairy farming 3aherds 3amilk 3aobservational studies 3arobots1 aHalbach, Courtney1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9879-61951 aBennett, Tommy,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1273-90351 aCook, Nigel B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2266-89950 tJDS communications.g2022 June 06, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27587x2666-91027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jdsc.2022-0243  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015500167300001800322500001900340520191200359592002802271650001402299650001502313650002202328650001902350650001402369650003802383650001902421650001802440650002002458650001802478650001602496650001202512650001402524650000702538650002102545650001702566650001602583650002602599700001902625700001202644700006002656773012302716856008202839852000902921655001202930IND60720413520221120092322.0201214e20201202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072041352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.0c014652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yingying10aPhotoresponsive Polypeptide-Glycosylated Dendron Amphiphiles: UV-Triggered Polymersomes, OVA Release, and In Vitro Enhanced Uptake and Immune Response  ap. 5345-5357.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEfficient therapeuic proteins’ delivery into mammalian cells and subcellular transport (e.g., fast escape from endolysosomes into cytoplasm) are two key biological barriers that need to be overcome for antigen-based immunotherapy and related biomedical applications. For those purposes, we designed a novel kind of photoresponsive polypeptide-glycosylated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendron amphiphiles (PGDAs), and their synthesis, UV-responsive self-assembly, and triggered ovalbumin (OVA) release have been fully investigated. The highly anisotropic PGDA₄ with a glycosylated second-generation PAMAM dendron self-assembled into stable polypeptide vesicles (polymersomes) within 20–50 wt % water, which exhibited UV-responsive reassembly, dynamic binding with a lectin of concanavalin A, and an accelerated OVA release in vitro. Moreover, upon 365 nm UV irradiation, the self-assembled polymersomes of those glycopolypeptides were transformed into micellar aggregates in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 but disassembled completely at pH 5. The OVA-loaded polymersomes could efficiently deliver OVA into RAW264.7 cells and achieve enhanced endolysosomes escape upon UV irradiation, as revealed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Furthermore, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the blank sugar-coated polypeptidosomes activated a high level of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) of 468 pg/mL, playing a better role of immune adjuvant for activating the macrophages. Upon the UV irradiation with a dose of 3 J/cm², the OVA-loaded polymersomes could further stimulate RAW264.7 and enhance the TNF-α level by about 45%. Consequently, this work provides a versatile platform to construct photosensitive and sugar-coated polymersomes of glycopolypeptides that have potential applications for protein delivery, immune adjuvant, and antigen-based immunotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aanisotropy 3aaqueous solutions 3aconcanavalin A 3acytoplasm 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3aglycosylation 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3amacrophages 3amammals 3aovalbumin 3apH 3aphotosensitivity 3apolypeptides 3asurfactants 3aultraviolet radiation1 aChen, Yanzheng1 aLi, Pan1 aDong, Chang-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7540-10820 tBiomacromolecules.g2020 Dec. 02, v. 21, no. 12 p.5345-5357dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c014653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012700156300001600283520125500299592002801554650001201582650001901594650001201613650001401625650002301639650001601662650002001678650001301698650002201711650002101733650002401754650002001778700002001798700001501818700002201833700002001855773012201875856007401997852000902071655001202080IND60662602320221116141743.0190906e20110208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066260232DNAL7 a10.1039/c0gc00828a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Manhoe14aThe effect of support material on the transesterification activity of CaO–La₂O₃ and CaO–CeO₂ supported catalysts  ap. 334-339.  aThe effects of support materials—lanthanum oxide, cerium oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, γ-alumina, and ZSM-5—on the transesterification activity of CaO–La₂O₃ and CaO–CeO₂ catalysts were investigated. The metal composition and surface acidity (or basicity) of the supported catalysts played a significant role in determining the activity of the catalyst. Results showed that both catalytic activity and basicity of the supported catalysts decreased in the following order: CaO–La₂O₃/La₂O₃ ≥ CaO–La₂O₃/CeO₂ > CaO–La₂O₃/ZrO₂ > CaO–La₂O₃/γ-Al₂O₃ > CaO–La₂O₃/ZSM-5 > CaO–La₂O₃/TiO₂. In addition, leaching of Ca species from the catalyst was more pronounced with basic supports. However, Ca leaching could be minimized by coupling with La₂O₃ or CeO₂ on an appropriate support. This was verified in a flow reactor study of the CaO–CeO₂/La₂O₃ catalyst, where, over 200 h of continuous operation, the transesterification yield held constant at 88∼90% while the initial Ca concentration in the product decreased from 194 ppm to below 5.0 ppm after 144 h.

Currently, global FVC products are usually available at coarse spatial resolutions, and so cannot satisfy the requirements for detailed investigations of the distribution of vegetation cover in different regions worldwide. Thus, a fine-resolution FVC product that covers a large spatial extent is needed. In this study, we develop an operational framework to produce Landsat-like spatial resolution FVC products using high-resolution images and a machine learning algorithm. We used 1 m Gaofen 2 data to calculate the 30 m FVC, and then applied as training and testing data for modeling. The random forest regression model using Landsat 8 surface reflectance and solar angle as inputs outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy and efficiency and was selected to estimate the 30 m FVC. The model has a high training accuracy, with an R² of 0.978 and an RMSE of 0.042. When validated using 346 independent ground measurements from 14 sites around the globe, the R² was 0.814 and the RMSE was 0.170. We compared three coarse-resolution FVC products at both regional and national scales, including GLASS, GEOV2 and CGLOPS FVC products. The 30 m Landsat FVC from this study was spatially and temporally consistent with all reference FVC products, but provided advantages in revealing the fine spatial details of vegetation cover. The performance of the 30 m FVC model varied with vegetation type, but showed the highest consistency with the GLASS FVC for most vegetation types. Finally, by applying the established 30 m FVC model to all Landsat 8 data over China from 2013 to 2018, we derived a seasonal maximum FVC mosaic, which successfully demonstrated the seasonal and spatial variations in vegetation cover in China. We conclude that the proposed framework enables accurate estimation of FVC at a high resolution over a large spatial scale and so, can be used as part of an operational approach for generating a global fine-resolution FVC product.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3afractional vegetation cover 3amodels 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3avegetation types 3aChina 0aFractional vegetation cover 0aLandsat 8 0aGaofen 2 0aRandom forest model1 aWang, Zihao1 aHe, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2079-79881 aWang, Huan1 aLiang, Shunlin0 tScience of remote sensing.g2022 Dec., v. 6 p.100058-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27391x2666-01727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.srs.2022.1000583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009100160300002000251520101900271592002801290650004401318650002201362650001501384650000801399650001601407650002301423650001501446650001301461650001701474650003201491650001401523650003301537650001201570700001401582700001501596773012501611856007401736852000901810655001201819IND60617181220221119054121.0181024e20180907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061718122DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra06414h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yongyong10aSynthesis of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on polyester fiber for PM₂.₅ removal  ap. 31471-31477.  aZeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was introduced on the surface of fibers of a non-woven fabric made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The phase structure, morphology, textural properties and chemical structure were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen (N₂) adsorption analyzer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The XRD, SEM and FTIR results indicated that ZIF-8 had been successfully coated on the PET fibers. N₂ adsorption analyses suggested that addition of ZIF-8 significantly increased the specific surface and micropore volume of composites. The PM₂.₅ removal experiment showed the filtration efficiency of ZIF-8/PET was twice as high as that of pure PET. Meanwhile, ZIF-8/PET also displayed a low pressure drop and good recycling performance. This research provided a facile method to deposit active ZIF-8 onto polymers with low air resistance, and that ZIF-8/PET was a good candidate as an air filter for PM₂.₅ removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aair 3aair filters 3achemical structure 3afiltration 3anitrogen 3aparticulates 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3arecycling 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atexture1 aJia, Ying1 aHou, Li'an0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 07, v. 8, no. 55 p.31471-31477dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06414h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002200186245013800208300001600346506007600362520199300438592002802431506003702459650002502496650002002521650001402541650004302555650001602598650001502614650001802629650001102647650001602658650001302674650001502687650001002702650002002712650001302732650001302745650001202758650002702770650002702797650003102824650002802855650004102883650002202924650004902946700002102995773010303016856004803119852000903167655001203176IND4474881620221207133948.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447488162DNAL7 a218148312pmid7 aPMC33189902pmcid7 a10.1007/s10886-011-0001-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrockett, Sara L.10aFlavonoid Glycosides and Naphthodianthrones in the Sawfly Tenthredo zonula and its Host-Plants, Hypericum perforatum and H. hirsutum   ap. 943-952.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLarvae of the sawfly Tenthredo zonula are specialized on Hypericum. Whether the sawfly is able to sequester plant metabolites was unknown. Aerial materials of Hypericum perforatum and H. hirsutum, as well as dissected larvae and prepupae of T. zonula, were analyzed by HPLC to determine the presence and content of flavonoid glycosides (rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, and quercitrin) and naphthodianthrones (pseudohypericin and hypericin). All flavonoid glycosides were detected in both Hypericum species, with hyperoside as major compound in H. perforatum (ca. 1.7 μmol/g fresh weight, FW) and isoquercitrin in H. hirsutum (0.7 μmol/g FW). Naphthodianthrones were present at low concentrations (0.02 μmol/g FW) in the former, and almost undetected in the latter species. In the body parts (i.e., hemolymph, digestive tract, salivary glands, or miscellaneous organs) of T. zonula, the surveyed compounds were detected more frequently in prepupae than in larvae. The compounds were not present in every sample, and flavonoid glycosides especially occurred in highly variable amounts, with maximal concentrations of 41 μg rutin/prepupa in salivary glands, 8 μg hyperoside/prepupa in hemolymph (= 0.36 μmol/g FW), 32 μg isoquercitrin/prepupa in salivary glands, and 63 μg quercitrin/larva in miscellaneous organs (mainly composed of the integument). We conclude that flavonoid glycosides are sequestered since they were detected in organs other than the digestive tract of larvae, and because prepupae are a non-feeding stage. The naphthodianthrone pseudohypericin, but not hypericin, occurred generally in the digestive tract (up to 0.25 μg/larva). Both naphthodianthrones and related unidentified compounds, but not flavonoid glycosides, were found in the larval excrement. The highly variable distributions of flavonoid glycosides and naphthodianthrones in T. zonula larvae and prepupae make it difficult to determine the ecological significance of these metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHypericum perforatum 3adigestive tract 3ahemolymph 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahost plants 3aintegument 3aisoquercitrin 3alarvae 3ametabolites 3aprepupae 3aquercitrin 3arutin 3asalivary glands 3asampling 3asawflies 2aAnimals 2aFlavonoidsxmetabolism 2aGlycosidesxmetabolism 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aHymenopteraxphysiology 2aHypericumxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aPerylenexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism.1 aBoevé, Jean-Luc0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2011 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.943-952dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-011-0001-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245011900180300001800299520158700317592002801904650002101932650001601953650001501969650001201984650001801996650001302014650002202027650002502049650000902074650001102083650001902094650000702113650002402120650001402144650002102158650001502179650001802194700001702212700002102229700001802250700002402268700002002292773010502312856008902417852000902506655001202515IND60580498520221119023457.0170921e20170921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058049852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b008542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Lydia Kyoung-Eun10apH Neutralization of Aqueous Bio-Oil from Switchgrass Intermediate Pyrolysis Using Process Intensification Devices  ap. 9455-9464.  aDespite the potential carbon-neutrality of switchgrass bio-oil, its high acidity and diverse chemical composition limit its utilization. The objectives of this research are to investigate pH neutralization of bio-oil by adding various alkali solutions in a batch system and then perform neutralization using process intensification devices, including a static mixer and a centrifugal contactor. The results indicate that sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are more appropriate bases for pH neutralization of bio-oil than calcium hydroxide due to the limited solubility of calcium hydroxide in aqueous bio-oil. Mass and total acid number (TAN) balances were performed for both batch and continuous-flow systems. Upon pH neutralization of bio-oil, the TAN values of the system increased after accounting the addition of alkali solution. A bio-oil heating experiment showed that the heat generated during pH neutralization did not cause a significant increase in the acidity of bio-oil. The formation of phenolic compounds during neutralization was initially suspected of increasing the system’s overall TAN value because some of these compounds (e.g., vanillic acid) act as polyprotic acids and have a stronger influence on the TAN value than monoprotic acids (e.g., acetic acid). The amount of phenolics in separated bio-oil phases, however, did not change significantly after pH neutralization. Process intensification devices provided sufficient mixing and separation of the organic and aqueous phases, suggesting a scale-up route for the bio-oil pH neutralization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aacetic acid 3aacid value 3aacidity 3abatch systems 3abiofuels 3acalcium hydroxide 3achemical composition 3aheat 3amixing 3aneutralization 3apH 3apotassium hydroxide 3apyrolysis 3asodium hydroxide 3asolubility 3avanillic acid1 aRen, Shoujie1 aYiacoumi, Sotira1 aYe, X.

The results demonstrated that amandin immunoreactivity is stable in variously processed almond seeds. Using the ELISA, amandin immunoreactivity could be detected in commercial whole raw and processed (blanched, sliced, dry roasted, and indicated combinations thereof) almond seeds stored for eleven years and eight months, defatted almond seed flours from several almond varieties/hybrids and their borate saline buffer-solubilized protein extracts stored for ten years and seven months, and several almond varieties grown in different California counties (full fat flours and their defatted flour counterparts). Roasting Nonpareil whole full fat almond seeds, full fat flour, and defatted flour at 170°C for 20min each with 2, 5, 10, and 20% w/w corn syrup or sucrose did not prevent amandin detection by ELISA.

Usually the pegylation prolongs the protein stability in the organism due to reduced renal clearance and provides superior water solubility to hydrophobic molecules. The mono-pegylated form of protein is usually prefered for medical applications. Different conditions with different PEG reagents have to be tested to find optimal pegylation procedure with specific protein.The goal of this study was to prepare screening method for separation of random mono-pegylated protein. Cytochrome C and beta lactoglobulin were pegylated with four reagents and a complete screening of several chromatographic monoliths in ion exchange mode with different buffers was performed to optimaly separate each mono-pegylated protein.The screening method was developed that produces optimal separation of target pegylated protein on CIM monoliths. Because of short chromatographic run time, CIM monoliths are perfect candidates to test alot of parameters.The results obtained show that each protein has its own unique separation parameters (pH, ionexchange ligand, buffer type). Two biopharmaceuticals were isolated using protocol: super human leptin antagonist (SHLA) was purified from inclusion bodies and mono-pegylated super mouse leptin antagonist (SMLA) from pegylated mixture. During study it was observed that the convective interaction media (CIM) monoliths additionally discriminate between protein isoforms pegylated on different sites in 3D structure of the protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abuffers 3achemical bonding 3achromatography 3acytochrome c 3ahumans 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmune system 3ainclusion bodies 3aion exchange 3aleptin 3aligands 3amice 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprotein isoforms 3aprotein tertiary structure 3arecombinant proteins 3arenal clearance 3ascreening 3awater solubility 0aPEG 0aSHLA 0aSMLA 0aCIM 0aQA 0aSO4 0aCM 0aEDA 0aDEAE 0aSEC 0aSDS PAGE 0aMonolith 0aIon exchange 0aPegylating 0aPurification1 aPodgornik, Aleš1 aKramberger, Petra1 aJarc, Marko1 aJančar, Janez1 aŽorž, Mirjan1 aKrajnc, Nika Lendero0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 1033-1034 p.91-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015300174300001600327520178500343592002802128506003702156650001402193650001102207650002802218650003102246650001702277650001102294650001702305650001302322773013302335856008502468852000902553655001202562IND60774728020221207134036.0220422e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077472802DNAL7 a10.1177/026119299001800133.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurchase, Iain F.H.13aAn International Reference Chemical Data Bank would Accelerate the Development, Validation and Regulatory Acceptance of Alternative Toxicology Tests  ap. 345-348.  aToxicologists involved in safety evaluation have a primary responsibility for ensuring that their results are the best possible for predicting human health effects. Currently, the scientific and regulatory consensus is that animal-based studies provide the best possible evidence. Thus, toxicologists are faced with ethical questions about the use of animals for experimental research. In vitro tests which equal or supersede animal studies, in terms of provision of data for human health assessment, are thus a high priority for toxicologists. There is no shortage of ideas for alternative methods and this emphasises the importance of adequate validation. One critical component of validation studies is the selection, evaluation and provision of appropriate chemicals for assessing the performance of alternative tests. Problems are encountered with poor published toxicology data, the difficulty of ensuring the selection of chemicals to represent a sufficiently wide range of chemical classes, disagreement as to the toxicological classification of chemicals and many other issues in the selection and supply of validation chemicals. Validation studies will be much easier to carry out and will be better received by those involved in human hazard assessment if this aspect of the studies is well planned and controlled. It is proposed, therefore, that an international reference collection of chemicals is assembled which is carefully selected for validation of specific toxicological endpoints, carefully reviewed and classified as to toxicity and made available to research workers interested in validating alternative methods. Additionally, the usefulness of the database could be enhanced if the results of validation studies were to be recorded in a central repository.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adatabases 3aethics 3ahazard characterization 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alaboratories 3atoxicity0 tATLA.

Quartz, clay minerals, and carbonates were the main mineral constituents of the studied samples. With increasing weight percentage of clay minerals, the solvent bitumen extraction (by the Dean–Stark procedure using toluene) decreased. Fine grained illite and illite-smectite had more detrimental effect on solvent bitumen extraction than coarse grained kaolinite. The pore structure data revealed that the extractability of bitumen from the oil sands depends on accessibility, more specifically on the size of bitumen-filled pores, by the solvent. The relative abundance and size of pores in the oil sands were controlled by mineral composition and particle size. Fine size fractions were typically enriched in kaolinite and 2:1 clay minerals (illite and illite-smectite) and contained small pores, with diameters of ∼100 and ∼10 nm, respectively. Coarse size fractions were usually rich in quartz and contained large pores with diameters greater than 200 nm. The efficiency of nonaqueous bitumen extraction was significantly higher for coarse grained, quartz-rich oil sands in which the organic matter was distributed mainly at a scale of greater than 200 nm compared with fine grained, clay-rich oil sands where organic matter occurred as meso-macropore filling material within clay mineral aggregates. Overall, the finest (<0.2 μm) fraction of oil sands composed mainly of illite and illite-smectite had the most detrimental effect on solvent bitumen extraction. This was related to the contrasting properties of the finest fraction (mainly high specific surface area, high cation exchange capacity, and the presence of small-sized pores) compared with the other studied fractions of oil sands.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acarbonates 3acation exchange capacity 3adiameter 3aillite 3akaolinite 3amineral content 3aoil sands 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size 3aquartz 3asolvents 3asurface area 3atoluene 3aAlberta1 aGeramian, Mirjavad1 aUhlík, Peter1 aČaplovičová, Mária1 aDaňková, Zuzana,1 aPálková, Helena1 aVítková, Martina,1 aKováčová, Milota1 aIvey, Douglas G.1 aLiu, Qi1 aEtsell, Thomas H.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Sept. 21, v. 31, no. 9 p.8910-8924dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b008553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014600173506011700319506007600436520150200512592002802014506003702042650001302079650002502092650001802117650002302135650001802158650001902176650001302195650002002208650002102228650001402249650001302263650002202276650001902298653001802317653001802335653002702353653003102380700006802411700003202479700005802511700007702569773011002646856008202756852000902838655001202847IND60779948420221207125601.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077994842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hnm.2022.2001562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Fernanda Santos10aCan capsaicinoids and their analogs affect energy expenditure and substrate oxidation during exercise?

An increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation at rest, along with appetite and energy intake reduction has been reported. CAP supplementation has also been indicated to increase exercise performance. Another potential effect of CAP during exercise is to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, the present systematic review aimed to compare the energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation during exercise with CAP administration, or placebo (no CAP administration), in acute studies. Ten studies met our inclusion criteria for EE, including one with mice. Only one study reported higher EE during exercise compared to non-CAP conditions. We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria for substrate oxidation measurement during exercise. One study reported lower fat oxidation during CAP conditions, while two reported higher fat oxidation with CAP supplementation. From studies retrieved, some reported increased EE and fat oxidation at rest, which means that the effect of CAP at rest was not carried over into exercise. In conclusion, CAP seems not to be a potential ergogenic aid to affect EE considering the studies retrieved in this current review; however, inconsistent results have been reported regarding to substrate oxidation. Further research should clarify the effect of CAP on substrate oxidation during exercise.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aappetite 3aathletic performance 3acapsaicinoids 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy intake 3aergogenic aids 3aexercise 3ahuman nutrition 3alipid metabolism 3aoxidation 3aplacebos 3asystematic review 3aweight control 0aOxygen uptake 0aFat oxidation 0aCarbohydrate oxidation 0aRespiratory exchange ratio1 aRossi, Fabrício Eduardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0594-25291 aGonçalves, Daniela Caetano1 aClark, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0019-28961 aGonçalves Panissa, Valéria Leme1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7102-74520 tHuman nutrition & metabolism.g2022 Sept., v. 29 p.200156-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27681x2666-14977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hnm.2022.2001563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011700167300001600284520127100300592002801571650001501599650001101614650001401625650002201639650001401661650002101675650001701696651001001713653001401723653001701737653001301754653001601767653002101783700001901804700002301823700002401846773010701870856008601977852000902063655001202072IND60539690120221116232040.0190318e20140506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053969012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.02.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Xin-An12aA reservoir operating method for riverine ecosystem protection, reservoir sedimentation control and water supply  ap. 379-387.  aRiverine ecosystem protection requires the maintenance of natural flow and sediment regimes downstream from dams. In reservoir management schedules this requirement should be integrated with sedimentation control and human water supply. However, traditional eco-friendly reservoir operating methods have usually only considered the natural flow regime. This paper seeks to develop a reservoir operating method that accounts for both the natural flow and sediment regimes as well as optimizing the water supply allocations. Herein, reservoir water level (RWL), sediment-occupied ratio of reservoir volume (SOR) and rate of change of SOR (RCSOR) are adopted as three triggers of a drawdown-flushing-based sediment management policy. Two different groups of reservoir operating rule curves (RORCs) are designed for sediment-flushing and non-sediment-flushing years, and the three triggers, RWL, SOR and RCSOR, are used to change the “static” RORCs to “dynamic” ones. The approach is applied to the Wangkuai Reservoir, China to test its effectiveness. This shows that the approach can improve the flexibility of reservoir operators to balance the reservoir management, water supply management and the flow and sediment needs of the downstream riverine ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3aissues and policy 3asediments 3awater reservoirs 3awater supply 3aChina 0aReservoir 0aWater supply 0aSediment 0aFlow regime 0aRiver protection1 aYang, Zhi-Feng1 aPetts, Geoffrey E.1 aKondolf, G.

In this study, we found that FaTUA2 was dispensable for vegetative growth and sporulation in F. asiaticum. The deletion of FaTUA1 however led to dramatically reduced mycelial growth, twisted hyphae and abnormal nuclei in apical cells of hyphae. The FaTUA1 deletion mutant (ΔFaTuA1-5) also showed a significant decrease in conidiation, and produced abnormal conidia. Pathogenicity assays showed that ΔFaTuA1-5 exhibited decreased virulence on wheat head. Unexpectedly, the deletion of FaTUA1 led to resistance to high temperatures. In addition, ΔFaTuA2 showed increased sensitivity to carbendazim. Furthermore, increased FaTUA2 expression in ΔFaTuA1-5 partially restored the defects of the mutant in mycelial growth, conidial production and virulence, vice versa, increased FaTUA1 expression in the FaTUA2 deletion mutant also partially relieved the defect of the mutant in the delay of conidial germination. Taken together, these results indicate that FaTuA1 plays crucial roles in vegetative growth and development, and the functions of FaTuA1 and FaTuA2 are partially interchangeable in F. asiaticum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium asiaticum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aantifungal properties 3acarbendazim 3aconidia 3aconidiation 3agenes 3agermination 3ahyphae 3amutants 3amycelium 3atemperature 3atubulin 3avegetative growth 3avirulence 3awheat 0aAlpha-tubulin 0aConidiation 0aFusarium asiaticum 0aFusarium head blight 0aVegetative growth1 aZhang, Xiaoping1 aChen, Xiang1 aZheng, Jingwu1 aYin, Yanni1 aMa, Zhonghua0 tResearch in microbiology.g2015 Apr., v. 166, no. 3 p.132-142dElsevier Masson SASaInstitut PasteurwJournal:11932x0923-25087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2015.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01191naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008300158300001600241520017400257592002800431650001400459650002000473650002600493650001200519650002200531650001400553650001100567700001500578700001500593700001600608700001200624773012200636856007400758852000900832655001200841IND60662602620221116141800.0190906e20110308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066260262DNAL7 a10.1039/c0gc00837k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Zhongtian10aOxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to maleic anhydride with molecular oxygen  ap. 554-557.  a5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was converted to maleic anhydride in 52% yield via selective oxidation with molecular oxygen using VO(acac)₂ as catalyst in liquid phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aliquids 3amaleic anhydrides 3aoxidation 3aoxygen1 aMa, Jiping1 aWang, Feng1 aLiu, Junxia1 aXu, Jie0 tGreen chemistry.g2011 Mar. 8, v. 13, no. 3 p.554-557dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0gc00837k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011200167300001400279520046800293592002800761506003700789650001500826650002200841650001100863650001700874650001300891650002600904700002100930700001900951700001800970773012400988856008301112852000901195655001201204IND60774728120221207133407.0220422e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077472812DNAL7 a10.1177/0261192991019001062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerraro, Paola10aChanges in the Concentrations of Deoxynucleotides in Human Lymphocytes TreatedIn Vitrowith Genotoxic Agents  ap. 26-29.  aWe studied the toxic and genotoxic effects of UV light and an alkylating agent (methyl methanesulphonate; MMS) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in Goand after PHA stimulation.

The interaction between Lyz and 5-FU was reflected in terms of intrinsic fluorescence quenching and change in secondary structure of Lyz. The mode of quenching mechanism involved was evaluated by the steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements. Synchronous and Circular Dichroism (CD) results revealed the conformational changes induced in Lyz upon complexation with 5-FU. Additionally, the effect of temperature and chemical denaturant on the stability of Lyz-5FU complex was carried out. As well as the activity of Lyz in the absence and presence of 5-FU were measured using Micrococcus luteus strain. To support our experimental findings, in vitro interaction between Lyz and 5-FU was done by theoretical studies. The current study will provide a better understanding on the nature of the interactions possible between proteins and drug molecules, which might create a bench mark in medical science in terms of the toxic effect or biological benefits of drug molecules on protein structure and conformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrococcus luteus 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3afluorouracil 3alysozyme 3aprotein structure 3aproteins 3atemperature 3atoxicity 0aLysozyme 0aAnticancer drug 0aSpectroscopic measurements 0aDenaturation studies 0aSimulation1 aSatish, Lakkoji1 aBera, Krishnendu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9966-59071 aKonar, Monidipa1 aSahoo, Harekrushna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2655-11960 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2018 Feb., v. 179 p.23-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010600208300001400314506011700328506007600445520143500521592002801956506003701984650002002021650001102041650002302052650001402075650001802089650000902107650001802116650001002134650001102144650001202155650001402167650001102181651001002192653002302202653002202225653003202247653002702279653003102306700001702337700001802354700001902372700002102391700002002412700001602432773011102448856008502559852000902644655001202653IND60783567720221207060208.0220829e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078356772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.repbre.2022.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhongduo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0835-446310aAndrogen receptor α peak expression in retina rather than gonad of Hainan medaka, Oryzias curvinotus  ap. 89-94.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAndrogen is a member of the sex steroid hormones family which plays an important role in the development and maturation of the vertebrate reproductive system. The physiological function of androgens is mainly mediated by the androgen receptor (AR). Oryzias curvinotus is a small oviparous fish and a potential model like its sister specie, Oryzias latipes. In this study, two subtypes (α and β) of androgen receptors (ar) genes of O. curvinotus were successfully cloned. Phylogenetic analysis with amino acids showed that arα originates later and differentiates more than arβ. The result of RT-qPCR showed that there were significant differences in the different development stages and different tissues in the expression of two subtypes of ar. Arα remained highly expressed from the eyed stage to the hatching stage, while arβ was lowly expressed. Also, arα was highly expressed in the eyes, liver, and gonads of adults, while arβ remained highly expressed only in adult ovaries. And the result of in situ hybridization confirmed the high expression of arα on the inner nuclear layer of the retina of adult O. curvinotus. Conclusively, the expression and the localization of arα indicated that it plays an important role in both early embryonic development and the eyes of adult O. curvinotus. Further research to enhance the understanding of the new function and mechanism of androgen receptors in medaka is needed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryzias latipes 3aadults 3aandrogen receptors 3aandrogens 3aembryogenesis 3afish 3ahybridization 3aliver 3amodels 3aovipary 3aphylogeny 3aretina 3aChina 0aOryzias curvinotus 0aAndrogen receptor 0aTemporal-spatial expression 0aIn situ hybridizations 0aFunctional differentiation1 aDeng, Aiping1 aHuang, Jiahui1 aHuang, Shunkai1 aAfriyie, Gyamfua1 aDong, Zhongdian1 aGuo, Yusong0 tReproduction and breeding.g2022 Sept., v. 2, no. 3 p.89-94dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27959x2667-07127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repbre.2022.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009100164300001600255520110900271592002801380650001701408650001301425650001301438650002901451653001201480653001001492653001201502653001101514653001701525700001601542700001501558700001401573700001301587700001701600700001401617773013901631856008301770852000901853655001201862IND60775919820221121001825.0220531e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077591982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.04.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Weimin10aMiR-144 regulates adipogenesis by mediating formation of C/EBPα-FOXO1 protein complex  ap. 126-133.  aCeRNA effect was an important regulation mode of miRNA mediated bio-activities, however, most of the researches of ceRNA were on ncRNAs synergetic with mRNAs, the exploration of ceRNA effect regulated mRNA interaction was still lack of. Besides, C/EBPα was one of the most crucial adipogenic regulators, which has been demonstrated to form a protein complex with FOXO1 to mediate AdipoQ expression. So that, we try to explore whether the ceRNA effect mediated the interaction of C/EBPα and FOXO1, and identified the key miRNAs of their ceRNA effect. In this paper, we found the ceRNA effect of C/EBPα and FOXO1 mediated their protein complex formation, furthermore regulated its transcriptional role for AdipoQ, thereby influencing pre-adipocytes adipogenesis. More importantly, we demonstrated that the miR-144 was the decisive factor that mediated the ceRNA effect of C/EBPα and FOXO1 to influence AdipoQ, thus regulated pre-adipocytes adipogenesis. This research will provide a new supplementary idea of the miRNA role in mediating coding RNA interaction that regulates pre-adipocyte adipogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3amicroRNA 3aresearch 3atranscription (genetics) 0aC/EBPα 0aFOXO1 0amiR-144 0aAdipoQ 0aAdipogenesis1 aWen, Xianyu1 aLi, Xuexin1 aChen, Lei1 aWei, Wei1 aZhang, Lifan1 aChen, Jie0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 July 05, v. 612 p.126-133dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.04.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011000170300001400280520160600294592002801900650004801928650002201976650002101998650002202019650002502041650001702066650002102083650001502104650001302119650001202132650001802144650001602162650001002178650001502188650002102203650001602224650002302240650002102263650001502284650002002299650001502319650001702334650001802351650001002369650001102379650001902390650001702409653001802426653002702444653001602471653002502487653002402512700002302536700001702559700002002576700002202596700001902618700002202637700001702659773011302676856008202789852000902871655001202880IND60530178320221120120942.0180830e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053017832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejbt.2016.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Abdul Latif10aIndole acetic acid and ACC deaminase from endophytic bacteria improves the growth of Solanum lycopersicum  ap. 58-64.  aEndophytic bacteria are ubiquitous in all plant species contributing in host plant's nutrient uptake and helping the host to improve its growth. Moringa peregrina which is a medicinal plant, growing in arid region of Arabia, was assessed for the presence of endophytic bacterial strains.PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rRNA of bacterial endophytes revealed the 5 endophytic bacteria, in which 2 strains were from Sphingomonas sp.; 2 strains from Bacillus sp. and 1 from Methylobacterium genus. Among the endophytic bacterial strains, a strain of Bacillus subtilis LK14 has shown significant prospects in phosphate solubilization (clearing zone of 56.71mm after 5d), ACC deaminase (448.3±2.91nMα-ketobutyratemg⁻¹h⁻¹) and acid phosphatase activity (8.4±1.2nMmg⁻¹min⁻¹). The endophytic bacteria were also assessed for their potential to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Among isolated strains, the initial spectrophotometry analysis showed significantly higher IAA production by Bacillus subtilis LK14. The diurnal production of IAA was quantified using multiple reactions monitoring method in UPLC/MS–MS. The analysis showed that LK14 produced the highest (8.7μM) IAA on 14th d of growth. Looking at LK14 potentials, it was applied to Solanum lycopersicum, where it significantly increased the shoot and root biomass and chlorophyll (a and b) contents as compared to control plants.The study concludes that using endophytic bacterial strains can be bio-prospective for plant growth promotion, which might be an ideal strategy for improving growth of crops in marginal lands.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase 3aBacillus subtilis 3aMethylobacterium 3aMoringa peregrina 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSphingomonas 3aacid phosphatase 3aarid zones 3abacteria 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3aendophytes 3agrowth promotion 3ahost plants 3aindole acetic acid 3amedicinal plants 3amonitoring 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3aribosomal RNA 3aroots 3ashoots 3asolubilization 3aspectroscopy 0aACC deaminase 0aBacillus subtilis LK14 0aEndophytism 0aIndole 3-acetic acid 0aTomato plant growth1 aHalo, Boshra Ahmed1 aElyassi, Ali1 aʻAlī, Sājid,1 aAl-Hosni, Khadija1 aHussain, Javid1 aAl-Harrasi, Ahmed1 aLee, In-Jung0 tElectronic Journal of Biotechnology.g2016 May, v. 21 p.58-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:17874x0717-34587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejbt.2016.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002400150245011900174300001600293520122600309592002801535650001701563650002201580650002101602650002301623650002401646650001801670650001901688700002501707700002101732700002401753700002301777773007801800856008601878852000901964655001201973IND4475700320221117022056.0141111e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447570032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Valdinar B.10aSoil microbial biomass and organic matter fractions during transition from conventional to organic farming systems  ap. 227-231.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the response of soil microbial biomass and organic matter fractions during the transition from conventional to organic farming in a tropical soil. Soil samples were collected from three different plots planted with Malpighia glaba: conventional plot with 10years (CON); transitional plot with 2years under organic farming system (TRA); organic plot with 5years under organic farming system (ORG). A plot under native vegetation (NV) was used as a reference. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N (TN), soil organic matter fractioning and microbial indices were evaluated in soil samples collected at 0–5, 5–10, 10–20 and 20–40cm depth. SOC and fulvic acids fraction contents were higher in the ORG system at 0–5cm and 5–10cm depths. Soil MBC was highest in the ORG, in all depths, than in others plots. Soil MBN was similar between ORG, TRA and NV in the surface layer. The lowest values for soil MBC and MBN were observed in CON plot. Soil microbial biomass increased gradually from conventional to organic farming, leading to consistent and distinct differences from the conventional control by the end of the second year.  aPublisher supplied data 3afulvic acids 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen content 3aorganic production 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil sampling 3atropical soils1 aAraújo, Ademir S.F.1 aLeite, Luiz F.C.1 aNunes, Luís A.P.L.1 aMelo, Wanderley J.0 tGeoderma.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 170 p.227-231dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010800169300001100277520168100288592002801969650001601997650002402013650001602037650001902053650001902072650001602091650001302107650000902120650001102129650001302140650002002153650001002173650001502183650002402198700006102222700002002283773014102303856008202444852000902526655001202535IND60590167220221121132952.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059016722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-018-1171-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGentsch, ReginaP.10aCortisol response of wild ungulates to trauma situations: hunting is not necessarily the worst stressor  ap. 11.  aAnimal welfare concerns are becoming a central issue in wildlife management and conservation. Thus, we investigated stress response of wild ungulates to potentially traumatic situations (shooting injuries, vehicle collisions, entanglement, injuries or diseases) and hunting methods (stalking, battues and hunts with dogs) by means of serum cortisol concentrations from blood collected from killed animals. Cortisol levels in roe deer ranged below and in wild boar above levels for moose, red deer and fallow deer (hence, pooled as a group “deer”). Apart from species, cortisol concentration in trauma situations was mainly explained by trauma type and presence of disturbance after the trauma event. Effect of trauma type differed significantly for “deer”, with animals caught in fences and suffering vehicle collisions experiencing higher cortisol levels than animals injured by shooting. Differences between hunting methods were observed in the cervids (“deer” and roe deer), with stalking leading to lower cortisol levels than hunts with dogs (both groups) and battues (roe deer). Events both before and after the shot, such as duration of pursuit prior to shooting, location of injury, trauma length and presence of disturbance after the shot were relevant for cortisol levels in hunted cervids. Our results indicate that search teams tracking and euthanising wounded animals should behave in a calm way to minimise disturbance. Still, it is important to acknowledge that many situations described in the literature, i.e. reindeer handling, roe deer captures and red deer yarding, seem even more stressful, beside vehicle collisions, than most hunting methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aCervus dama 3aCervus elaphus 3aanimal welfare 3ablood serum 3acortisol 3adogs 3afences 3areindeer 3astress response 3ateams 3awild boars 3awildlife management1 aKjellander, Petter1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4272-67371 aRöken, BengtO.0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2018 Feb., v. 64, no. 1 p.11-11dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-018-1171-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03857naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100003100170245015800201300001400359520196200373592002802335650001702363650002402380650002202404650001202426650001302438650001302451650002202464650001702486650001202503650002502515650001502540650001002555650000902565650001302574650004702587650002902634650002002663650002002683650001102703650002202714650001102736650002502747650002502772650000902797650001602806650001402822650001002836650001602846651001102862651001102873653001502884653003002899653002802929653003402957700002002991773010203011856008503113852000903198655001203207IND60113335420221118015412.0160903e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011333542DNAL7 a237221742pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.04.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Piñeros, Sandra10aAnalysis and deliberation as a mechanism to assess changes in preferences for indicators of sustainable forest management: A case study in Puebla, Mexico  ap. 52-61.  aThe purpose of this study was to assess changes in forest owners' preferences regarding indicators of sustainable forest management. The analysis and deliberation framework served as a platform upon which to explore these changes in a rural community in Puebla, Mexico. Sixty-two indicators were selected from existing sets to design a five-point Likert survey instrument. The instrument was administered three times: early in the study to capture the forest owners' preferences before intervention (baseline); following an educational meeting in which the participants learned of three alternative forest management plans (analysis); and following a community meeting in which the forest owners deliberated to choose one of the alternatives (deliberation).As forest owners were exposed to knowledge (analysis) and deliberation, their preferences for the indicators changed significantly. An examination of the instrument demonstrated how the indicators increased or decreased in importance. Social and economic indicators tended to be ranked differently following analysis and again following deliberation because of the commitment to pursue a forest management plan that would benefit the community without jeopardizing stakeholder values. The ecological indicators directly associated with forest structure gained relevance following the analysis meeting. The deliberation process elucidated the importance of forest administration and professional help.Forest owners' preferences were reflected by the selection of the management plan that included good science and accommodated community values. The forest owners changed their preferences in response to new knowledge, management objectives, and their commitment to safeguarding the future condition of the forest. Analysis and deliberation is a participatory forum that facilities communication and learning and allows stakeholders to share values; thus, it serves as a mechanism for forest planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeconomic indicators 3aforest management 3aforests 3alearning 3aplanning 3arural communities 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainable forestry 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAttitude 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aCommunity Participation. 2aData Collection 2aDecision Making 2aFemale 2aForestryxmethods 2aHumans 2aKnowledge Management 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOwnership 2aTrees 2aYoung Adult 3aMexico 0aMexico 0aIndicators 0aAnalysis and deliberation 0aCommunity participation 0aSustainable forest management1 aLewis, David K.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 128 p.52-61dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.04.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245018400169300001600353520084600369592002801215650001201243650001301255650001401268650002601282650001801308650001901326650001101345650001301356650000701369650001401376650002501390650001901415653000801434653001901442653002301461653000901484653001801493700002101511700001501532700001601547773010101563856008601664852000901750655001201759IND60591762420221121232219.0190516e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059176242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavindran, S.10aUnderstanding how the properties of whey protein stabilized emulsions depend on pH, ionic strength and calcium concentration, by mapping environmental conditions to zeta potential  ap. 572-578.  aSurface properties play a key role in determining how colloidal particles interact. In the case of emulsion droplets stabilized with whey protein isolate (WPI) the repulsive interactions are thought to be mostly electrostatic and governed by the environment-modulated zeta potential of the droplet surfaces. By coupling a Gouy-Chapman model of the electrical double layer with the chemical equilibria of both the ionizable moieties on the protein and of the binding of calcium by charged groups, the zeta potential of emulsion droplets as a function of pH, ionic strength and calcium concentration is predicted. Experimental data is shown to fit well to this model. In addition the zeta potential alone is shown to be a good predictor of the macroscopic behavior of the emulsion, as characterized by measurements of the low-stress viscosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aenvironmental factors 3ahydrocolloids 3aionic strength 3amodels 3amoieties 3apH 3aviscosity 3awhey protein isolate 3azeta potential 0aWPI 0aZeta potential 0aGouy-Chapman model 0aDLVO 0aTwo-pKa model1 aWilliams, M.A.K.1 aWard, R.L.1 aGillies, G.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2018 June, v. 79 p.572-578dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245012900200300001800329520143700347592002801784650004401812650002101856650001901877650001201896650001701908650002201925650003801947650001201985650000901997650001802006650001202024650001102036650001302047650001702060650001502077650001902092650002002111650001902131650001502150650002502165650002302190650001802213700002002231700001502251700005602266700005502322773017002377856008002547852000902627655001202636IND60632280320221118174623.0190314e20190125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063228032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b050272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFam, Winny1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8470-266410aEffect of Inorganic Salt Blending on the CO₂ Separation Performance and Morphology of Pebax1657/Ionic Liquid Gel Membranes  ap. 3304-3313.  aGel membranes comprising inorganic salt, molten salt or ionic liquid (IL), and Pebax1657 were prepared by blending the three components in ethanol/water mixture, and their carbon dioxide separation properties were evaluated. To probe the effects of inorganic salt types and concentrations, a small amount of common inorganic salts, such as sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium chloride (CaCl₂), and sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) were first doped into neat Pebax membranes. The thermal properties, surface chemistry, and gas separation performance of the free-standing membranes were evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas permeation tests. CaCl₂-doped membranes gave the best performance due to the high water content and cross-linking between the salt cation and polyamide segments, which resulted in lower polymer crystallinity. Further incorporation of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate IL into Pebax1657/inorganic salt mixture to form thin film composite gel membranes improved the inorganic salt solubility and enhanced CO₂ permeance up to 899 GPU at the expense of CO₂/N₂ selectivity and mechanical strength. Cyclic permeation tests using humidified feed containing a trace amount of contaminant showed stable performance although no improvement in gas pair selectivity was observed, confirming solution-diffusion mechanism through the gel membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acalcium chloride 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3acrosslinking 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethanol 3agels 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3amixing 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3apolyamides 3aprocess design 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3asolubility 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal properties 3awater content1 aMansouri, Jaleh1 aLi, Hongyu1 aHou, Jingwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9139-98351 aChen, Vicki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6604-61970 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Jan. 25, v. 58, no. 8 p.3304-3313dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b050273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011500160300001800275520164600293592002801939650002001967650001301987650001502000650001602015650001702031650001902048650001202067650002102079650001202100650001302112650001102125650002402136650001602160650001602176650001402192650001602206650000902222650001402231650001302245650001102258650001502269650001602284650001402300650002202314650000902336650001302345650001202358650002402370650001302394650000902407700001302416700001302429700001702442700001402459700001302473700001702486773012202503856007402625852000902699655001202708IND60641454520221118010412.0190505e20170123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064145452DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26614b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Runxiang10aSelenium supplementation can protect from enhanced risk of keel bone damage in laying hens exposed to cadmium  ap. 7170-7178.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate whether selenium (Se) supplementation can provide protection from an enhanced risk of keel bone damage (KBD) in laying hens due to the cadmium (Cd) toxicity associated with sub-chronic exposure. In this trial, based on the model of laying hens fed a diet supplemented with Se, Cd or Se + Cd in combination, the keel bone fractures and deviations, the bone mineral density (BMD), the serum biomarkers and the levels of twenty-eight elements were investigated. Consumption of feed added 150 mg kg⁻¹ CdCl₂ had a significant adverse effect on the keel bone, as determined by an increase in the percentage of keel bone damage, and a decrease in the BMD and the serum osteocalcin (OC). Supplementation with Cd led to disorders of mineral element metabolisms, including reduced concentrations of Si, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn and Mo, and increased concentrations of Cd, and Pb (P < 0.05). Supplementation with 2 mg kg⁻¹ Na₂SeO₃ reduced keel bone damage, as well as the concentrations of toxic microelements Al and Pb. Se supplementation during 13 weeks of exposure to Cd partially prevented Cd-induced increase rates of the keel bone fracture and decrease concentrations of OC. Moreover, the Se + Cd co-treatment alleviated the degree of changes in K, Ca, Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb concentrations which in contrast were induced by Cd (P < 0.05). These results support the conclusion that enhanced Se supplementation during sub-chronic Cd exposure can, at least partially, reduce keel bone damage. This protective effect may result from maintenance of homeostasis of the elements in bones of laying hens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aaluminum 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone fractures 3acadmium 3acadmium chloride 3acalcium 3achromium 3acopper 3adietary supplements 3ahen feeding 3ahomeostasis 3akeel bone 3alaying hens 3alead 3amanganese 3aminerals 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3aosteocalcin 3apotassium 3aprotective effect 3arisk 3aselenium 3asilicon 3asubchronic exposure 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aXing, Lu1 aBao, Jun1 aSun, Hanqing1 aBi, Yanju1 aLiu, Huo1 aLi, Jianhong0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 23, v. 7, no. 12 p.7170-7178dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26614b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245007000182300001600252520192200268592002802190650002902218650002002247650001702267650001102284650001502295650003702310650003302347650000902380650002002389650000902409650001302418650004002431650005202471650003702523650003902560650001102599650004802610650003302658650002902691650003102720650003102751651001902782651001802801700001902819773011202838856004802950852000902998655001203007IND50061643620221121145808.0130319e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006164362DNAL7 a226613312pmid7 a10.1007/s10653-012-9462-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBull, Sarah10aPromoting the use of BaP as a marker for PAH exposure in UK soils  ap. 101-109.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that frequently accumulate in soils. There is therefore a requirement to determine their levels in contaminated environments for the purposes of determining impacts on human health. PAHs are a suite of individual chemicals, and there is an ongoing debate as to the most appropriate method for assessing the risk to humans from them. Two methods predominate: the surrogate marker approach and the toxic equivalency factor. The former assumes that all chemicals in a mixture have an equivalent toxicity. The toxic equivalency approach estimates the potency of individual chemicals relative to the usually most toxic Benzo(a)pyrene. The surrogate marker approach is believed to overestimate risk and the toxic equivalency factor to underestimate risk. When analysing the risks from soils, the surrogate marker approach is preferred due to its simplicity, but there are concerns because of the potential diversity of the PAH profile across the range of impacted soils. Using two independent data sets containing soils from 274 sites across a diverse range of locations, statistical analysis was undertaken to determine the differences in the composition of carcinogenic PAH between site locations, for example, rural versus industrial. Following principal components analysis, distinct population differences were not seen between site locations in spite of large differences in the total PAH burden between individual sites. Using all data, highly significant correlations were seen between BaP and other carcinogenic PAH with the majority of r ² values > 0.8. Correlations with the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA) summed groups, that is, EFSA2, EFSA4 and EFSA8 had even higher correlations (r ² > 0.95). We therefore conclude that BaP is a suitable surrogate marker to represent mixtures of PAH in soil during risk assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3adata collection 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3atoxicity 2aBenzo(a)pyrenexanalysisxtoxicity. 2aCarcinogens, Environmentalxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysis 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aHumans 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysis. 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aSoilxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistry 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain1 aCollins, Chris0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2013 Feb., v. 35, no. 1 p.101-109dSpringer-Verlagx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-012-9462-2  aDNAL 7aarticle01672naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245019800171300001800369520060700387592002800994650001201022650003501034650002001069650001101089650000901100650001301109650002401122773013301146856008201279852000901361655001201370IND60590237120221116160721.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059023712DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348171400272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherviakouski, K.I.12aA New Method of Mathematical Correction of the Results of Analysis, Obtained by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, Ensuring the Elimination of the Interference of Doubly Charged Ions  ap. 1434-1440.  aA new method of mathematical correction of the results of analysis, obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, for the elimination of the interference of doubly charged ion was proposed.

Juvenile limpets (≤10 mm maximum shell length) were counted in CCA-present and CCA-absent habitats, on three shores in SW Portugal during summer 2007 and winter 2009. Furthermore, the settling response of laboratory-reared larvae of P. ulyssiponensis to CCA-covered substratum, and bare-rock, was examined. Across the intertidal zone, we found a clear association between the distribution and abundance of juveniles and the presence of CCA. Although the presence of CCA was not an absolute requisite for juvenile occurrence, null juvenile densities were mostly recorded in CCA-absent areas. The highest juvenile densities (maximum of 64 individuals in 15 × 15 cm) were consistently found in CCA-dominated habitats, namely steep wave-exposed areas at low-shore and rock-pools. The hypothesis of CCA-enhanced settlement was not supported, as settlement intensities of laboratory-reared larvae were similar between chips of rock encrusted by CCA and chips of bare-rock. From the overall number of settlers onto CCA-encrusted rock chips, 51% were found in tiny pits lacking CCA. This was the first study of the settlement patterns of larvae of the genus Patella using naturally occurring rocky substrata. These results are preliminary and should be confirmed with choice-experiments and improved monitoring of the position of settlers. We suggest that CCA plays a role in the recruitment of P. ulyssiponensis, potentially promoting survivorship of early benthic stages, but possibly not enhancing settlement.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCoralline crusts 0alimpet recruitment 0apatellid larvae 0aPatellogastropoda 0arocky-shore habitats 0asettlement cues 0aSW Portugal1 aCruz, T.1 aFernandes, J.

In our recent work on four heme proteins, we showed that when a protein unfolds from the native state to an early unfolded state, the degree of departure is characterized by a ratio f ∼1.6, where f is a measure of the elongation of n-residue segments of the polypeptide chain. Our analysis, which accounts for this apparent similarity in calculated signatures, is based on a logistic-map model of unfolding. We offer an important take home for the de novo protein synthesis community: in order to increase the probability of obtaining good quality crystals, nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions between adjacent residues (or sequences of residues) in the polypeptide chain must be propagated correctly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheme 3amodels 3apolypeptides 3aprobability 3aprotein synthesis1 aGray, Harry B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7937-78760 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Nov. 24, v. 124, no. 49 p.11067-11071dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c056693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245009400201300001800295520103900313592002801352650001901380650001301399650001301412650000901425650001501434650001901449650002201468700005601490700001701546700001801563773017001581856008001751852000901831655001201840IND60632280520221118174559.0190314e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063228052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b050492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dexiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6937-572X10aLeakage Mitigation During CO₂ Geological Storage Process Using CO₂ Triggered Gelation  ap. 3395-3406.  aCO₂ leakage is a fatal issue for the successful application of CO₂ geological storage. In this paper, a method using CO₂ triggered gelation is proposed to control the CO₂ leakage during CO₂ geological storage process. The mechanisms of CO₂ triggered gelation was illustrated schematically. The effectiveness of this method for blocking CO₂ leakage was evaluated by experimental works using sand-pack model. Reactive flow simulations were conducted to reproduce the experimental results and investigate field-scale feasibility of this method. The results show that this method can control the assumed leakage and the blocking performance was reproduced well by the lab-scale reactive flow simulation model. The results of simulation indicate that gel can be formed and absorbed more easily near the injection point. Feasibility of this method in field-scale were demonstrated with different scenarios of preplaced gel system. Infill drilling and monitoring method with high accuracy are recommended to assist this method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adrilling 3agelation 3agels 3amonitoring 3aprocess design 3asimulation models1 aZhang, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2289-61731 aRen, Shaoran1 aRui, Hongxing0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 58, no. 8 p.3395-3406dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b050493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01698naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245006100166300001600227520078200243592002801025650002101053650002201074650001301096650001001109650002001119650001401139650001401153700001801167773010901185856008101294852000901375655001201384IND60591511820221119192409.0180905e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059151182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2016.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeppälä, Otto10aDo Coinfections Maintain Genetic Variation in Parasites?  ap. 930-938.  aHost individuals are often infected with multiple, potentially interacting parasite species and genotypes. Such coinfections have consequences for epidemiology, disease severity, and evolution of parasite virulence. As fitness effects of coinfection can be specific to interacting parasite genotypes, coinfections may induce high fitness variation among parasite genotypes. We argue that such interactions can be an important mechanism maintaining genetic variation in parasite traits such as infectivity and virulence. We also argue that such interactions may slow coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and parasites. This is because, instead of depending only on host genotype, parasite fitness may be determined by average infection success across all coinfection scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease severity 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahosts 3amixed infection 3aparasites 3avirulence1 aJokela, Jukka0 tTrends in parasitology.g2016 Dec., v. 32, no. 12 p.930-938dElsevier LtdwJournal:6336x1471-49227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2016.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009100172500001400263520085300277592002801130650001101158650002201169650001601191650002501207650001501232650001501247650001201262650001301274651001501287653002301302653002301325653001801348700002501366700002301391700002901414700001901443700001801462700002101480700001801501773010201519856008701621852000901708655001201717IND60717115220221118170234.0210108e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071711522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.1068872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaquié, Sandra10aMigration, assets, and forest degradation in a tropical deciduous forest of South Asia  aNAL-light  aIndian internal migration is among the highest in the world, with 30% of the population migrating, often for work. Such population movement can alleviate poverty and reduce forest degradation. However, estimates of this double dividend are scarce. We estimate the potential of internal migration to alleviate poverty by exploring migrant characteristics and their investments. We then evaluate whether there are short-term benefits for Central Indian forests by assessing the relationship between migration and changes in forest use over a 5-year timespan. Finally, we study the village-level association between forest degradation and the proportion of migrating households in the village. We show that internal migration has the potential to alleviate poverty. On the other hand, migration does not reduce forest degradation in such a short term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3adeciduous forests 3adegradation 3aecological economics 3ahouseholds 3apopulation 3apoverty 3avillages 3aSouth Asia 0aSeasonal Migration 0aForest Degradation 0aCentral India1 aUrpelainen, Johannes1 aKhanwilkar, Sarika1 aGalletti, Christopher S.1 aVelho, Nandini1 aMondal, Pinki1 aNagendra, Harini1 aDeFries, Ruth0 tEcological economics.g2021 Mar., v. 181 p.106887-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.1068873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245012100203300001100324520147100335592002801806650002401834650001101858650002201869650001101891650001001902650000901912650001001921650001401931650001401945650002101959650002501980650001102005650001102016650001102027650001102038651001902049700002002068700002702088700002302115700002502138700002502163773014102188856008202329852000902411655001202420IND60590167620221121132913.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059016762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-018-1174-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSage, RufusB.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5653-858810aPredation of released pheasants Phasianus colchicus on lowland farmland in the UK and the effect of predator control  ap. 14.  aWe present data accumulated over the last 25 years on predation of radio-tracked released pheasants. In studies of birds during the autumn/winter at six pheasant shoots with high-density releases managed by full-time gamekeepers, predation of released pheasants by foxes before the shooting season began (July–September) averaged 19.2 ± 4.0% per site, and during the shooting season (October 1st–February 1st), a further 15.9 ± 1.9% were predated. The range in 3-year average predation rates between sites before shooting began was 8.6 to 42.4%. At seven different sites during the spring and summer, between 20 and 71% of released or wild hens that survived the shooting season were predated, mainly by foxes, between mid-March and mid-July. Predation was significantly higher at sites with low-level predator control (59 ± 4.7%) compared to those with high-level control (30 ± 5.3%). At three of the four sites with low predator control between 5 and 22% of nest failures were caused by incubating hens being predated by foxes. Our data quantify for the first time highly variable predation rates of released pheasants before and during the winter shooting season which we suggest was influenced by a range of site and management factors. During the spring and summer, our data provide evidence that predation of adult hen pheasants as well as nest predation can suppress breeding success and that predator control can reduce these losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhasianus colchicus 3aadults 3aagricultural land 3aautumn 3afoxes 3ahens 3anests 3apheasants 3apredation 3apredator control 3areproductive success 3ashoots 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aUnited Kingdom1 aTurner, ClareV.1 aWoodburn, MaureenI.

A supercharged environment due to the presence of free anions make these PCPs suitable templates for the growth of nanoparticles (NPs) in high yields. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images provided insight into the size, shape and distribution of the NPs within the frameworks. Different shapes and sizes of the NPs are attributed to the differences in the levels of supramolecular interactions within these isostructural series and the ionic radii which is related to the charge density of metal nodes. From an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study it is evidenced that synthesis of Au NPs in Ni-PCP is completely through redox reaction via strong charge transfer between coordinated metal and the metal precursor, and the others are via acid formation through anions present in the cavities of PCPs. Au NPs integrated frameworks display different soft ferromagnetic properties when placed in a magnetic field at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanions 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3agold 3amagnetic fields 3amanganese 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aredox reactions 3areducing agents 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aGupta, Neeraj K.0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 16, v. 7, no. 7 p.3870-3878dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26642h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008100164300001600245520170900261592002801970650001901998650001402017650000802031650001502039650002402054650005002078650001502128650001902143650001502162650000902177650001302186650001102199651001002210653001802220653001502238653001502253653002802268653001002296700001902306700001902325700001602344700001702360700001302377773009902390856008102489852000902570655001202579IND60545014220221118051950.0160901e20140305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054501422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2013.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Juntao10aMonitoring snow cover using Chinese meteorological satellite data over China  ap. 192-203.  aSnow cover plays an important role in hydrological processes and global climate change research. Geostationary satellites with high temporal resolution provide multiple observations in one day, which highlights their potential for monitoring real-time snow-cover information. In this paper, data from the Chinese meteorological satellites Fengyun-2D (FY-2D), Fengyun-2E (FY-2E) and Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) was used for snow-cover mapping over China. A new method of detecting snow-cover information is proposed, that combines the Visible and Infrared Spin Scan-Radiometer (VISSR) on board the geostationary satellites FY-2D and FY-2E and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on board the polar orbiting satellite FY-3B. The snow cover estimated from Fengyun satellites was compared by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-cover products (MOD10A1 and MYD10A1), and Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow-cover products. The Fengyun satellite snow-cover images and IMS snow-cover products were validated with meteorological station observations for the 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 winter seasons. The influence of elevation and land-cover types on the accuracy of snow retrievals was also analyzed. The results showed that the combined use of FY-2D and FY-2E VISSR data reduced cloud obscuration by 30.47% compared to the MODIS products. The validation demonstrated that the accuracy of the final multi-sensor snow-cover images was 91.28%, which is similar to that for IMS snow-cover products. This work indicates that combined data from geostationary satellites and passive microwave remote sensing monitored snow cover over China to a high level of accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3ahydrology 3aice 3aland cover 3amicrowave radiation 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asnow 3asnowpack 3awinter 3aChina 0aFY-2D/E VISSR 0aFY-3B MWRI 0aSnow cover 0aGeostationary satellite 0aChina1 aJiang, Lingmei1 aShi, Jiancheng1 aWu, Shengli1 aSun, Ruijing1 aYang, Hu0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Mar. 05, v. 143 p.192-203dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003500134024001200169040001800181100002200199245009000221300001600311500000900327506017300336520162100509592002802130650001702158650002602175650002202201650002002223650001802243650001302261650001502274650002102289650001902310650002002329650001502349650001102364650001702375651001102392700002202403773015802425856011402583856008202697956020102779961001702980852000902997655001203006IND60592785020221214223824.0191125e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059278502DNAL7 a2990712aris7 a10113/59278502hdl7 a10.2136/sssaj2013.09.04142doi8 ans14229  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, John D.10aSoil Water Dynamics in Continuous Winter Wheat in the Semiarid Pacific Northwest, USA  ap. 571-578.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aIn semiarid climates, efficient precipitation capture and storage are necessary for successful small grain production. This is especially true in Mediterranean climates dependent on winter precipitation occurring before the most active growth and grain development stages of winter wheat (WW, Triticum aestivum L.). The effects of residue cover and tillage on soil water under annual WW were investigated at Pendleton, OR, on a Walla Walla silt loam soil, (coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haploxerolls). These effects were investigated using three treatments in annually cropped WW, (i.e., no fallow year), consisting of no-till (NT), crop residue incorporated with tillage (TI), and crop residue removed before tillage and then returned to the soil surface after tillage (RR). Field data showed that ground cover from crop residue resulted in more soil water from December 24 through May 20 in the driest crop year, 2005, of the 3-yr experiment, but no differences in the two relatively wet crop years 2004 and 2006. The mean soil water in a 105-cm profile when treatment differences occurred were as follows; NT = 187 mm, RR = 168 mm, and TI = 155 mm. The differences were relatively small, however, with NT 31.7 mm more than TI and 19.2 mm more than RR, and RR 12.5 mm more than TI. During normal years these differences could be expected to diminish. This research indicates that tillage practices in the Pacific Northwest have small effect where the land surface is essentially level, but ground cover can play an important role during exceptionally dry years on precipitation capture and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaploxerolls 3aMediterranean climate 3aTriticum aestivum 3acrop production 3acrop residues 3ahardpans 3ano-tillage 3aseed development 3asemiarid zones 3asilt loam soils 3asoil water 3awinter 3awinter wheat 3aOregon1 aWuest, Stewart B.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2014 Mar., v. 78, no. 2 p.571-578dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/59278503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2013.09.04143Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Soil%20water%20dynamics%20in%20continuous%20winter%20wheat%20grown%20in%20the%20semiarid%20Pacific%20Northwest%2C%20U.S.A..pdf  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01183naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008900159300002000248520027800268592002800546650001300574650001800587650001400605700002000619700002200639700002500661773012400686856007400810852000900884655001200893IND60664515820221118042815.0190912e20130617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066451582DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra41509k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jin Young10aSeeded solution growth of nanoparticles into ordered three-dimensional supracrystals  ap. 10628-10631.  aWe report on a novel synthetic method for ordered three-dimensional nanoparticle supracrystals, which is based on seeded solution growth of nanoparticles.

To investigate the differential effect of HER2 in breast cell lines, HER2 was overexpressed in MCF-10A, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. HER2 overexpression promoted proliferation, survival and migration in MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells. No significant differences were seen in proliferation, survival or migration between MDA-MB-231 vec and HER2 cells. The activity of downstream HER2 proteins increased in MCF-10A HER2 and MCF-7 HER2 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 HER2 cells.

Firstly, A. vera fractions (pulp and liquid) were extracted from leaves and evaluated in terms of antifungal and antioxidant capacities. The choice of the most adequate chitosan and A. vera fraction concentrations to be incorporated in coating formulation was made based on the wettability of the corresponding coating solutions. Coatings with 0.5% (w/v) chitosan+0.5% (w/v) glycerol+0.1% (w/v) Tween 80+0.5% (v/v) A. vera liquid fraction presented the best characteristics to uniformly coat blueberry surface. Physico-chemical (i.e., titratable acidity, pH, weight loss) and microbiological analyses of coated blueberries (non-inoculated or artificially inoculated with Botrytis cinerea) were performed during 25 d. Microbiological growth and water loss levels were approximately reduced by 50% and 42%, respectively, in coated blueberries after 25 d compared to uncoated blueberries. After 15 d, weight loss values were 6.2% and 3.7% for uncoated and chitosan–A. vera coated blueberries, respectively. Uncoated fruits presented mold contamination after 2 d of storage (2.0±0.32 log CFU g−1), whilst fruits with chitosan-based coatings with A. vera presented mold contamination only after 9 d of storage (1.3±0.35 log CFU g−1). Overall, coatings developed in this study extend blueberries’ shelf-life for about 5 d, demonstrating for the first time that the combination of chitosan and A. vera liquid fraction as edible coating materials has great potential in expanding the shelf-life of fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe vera 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aantioxidant activity 3ablueberries 3achitosan 3acoatings 3aedible films 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aleaves 3apH 3apulp 3ashelf life 3atitratable acidity 3aweight loss 3awettability 0aEdible coatings 0aChitosan 0aAloe vera 0aAntifungal 0aAntioxidant 0aBlueberries1 aFlores-López, María L.1 ade Rodríguez, Diana Jasso1 aSousa, Maria C.1 aVicente, António A.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3593-88781 aMartins, Joana T.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2016 June, v. 116 p.88-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2016.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245021100176500002200387520195300409592002802362650002302390650001302413650001802426650001302444650001002457650001602467650001302483650002202496650001202518650001602530650001802546650001502564650002102579650001502600650001502615650001202630651001102642653001602653653001802669653002602687700002202713700002002735700002802755700002002783700002202803700002402825773007802849856008702927852000903014655001203023IND60565728620221117070456.0170626s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056572862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.1742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Coadou, Laurine10aQuality survey of natural mineral water and spring water sold in France: Monitoring of hormones, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, perfluoroalkyl substances, phthalates, and alkylphenols at the ultra-trace level  aPre-press version  aThe aim of the present study, one of the most complete ever performed in France, was to carry out an extensive survey on the potential presence of a large amount of emerging contaminants in 40 French bottled waters, including parent compounds and metabolites. The studied samples represented 70% of the French bottled water market in volume. Six classes of compounds were investigated, most of them being unregulated in bottled waters: pesticides and their transformation products (118), pharmaceutical substances (172), hormones (11), alkylphenols (APs) (8), phthalates (11) and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (10). One of the objectives of this work was to achieve low and reliable limits of quantification (LOQs) (87% of the LOQs were below 10ng/L) using advanced analytical technologies and reliable sample preparation methodologies, including stringent quality controls. Among the 14,000 analyses performed, 99.7% of the results were below the LOQs. None of the hormones, pharmaceutical substances and phthalates were quantified. Nineteen compounds out of the 330 investigated were quantified in 11 samples. Eleven were pesticides including 7 metabolites, 6 were PFAS and 2 were APs. As regards pesticides, their sum was at least twice lower than the quality standards applicable for bottled waters in France. The presence of a majority of pesticide metabolites suggested a former use in the recharge areas of the exploited aquifers. The quantification of a few unregulated emerging compounds at the nano-trace level, such as PFAS, raised the issue of their potential sources, including long-range atmospheric transport and deposition. This study confirmed that the groundwater aquifers exploited for bottling were well-preserved from chemicals, as compared to less geologically protected groundwaters, and also underlined the need to pursue the protection policies implemented in recharge areas in order to limit the anthropogenic pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aaquifers 3abottled water 3abottling 3adrugs 3agroundwater 3ahormones 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3ametabolites 3amineral water 3amonitoring 3aperfluorocarbons 3apesticides 3aphthalates 3asurveys 3aFrance 0aGroundwater 0aBottled water 0aEmerging contaminants1 aLe Ménach, Karyn1 aLabadie, Pierre1 aDévier, Marie-Hélène1 aPardon, Patrick1 aAugagneur, Sylvie1 aBudzinski, Hélène0 tScience of the total environment.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.1743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011000174300001600284520182900300592002802129650002502157650001802182650001302200650001902213650002202232650001302254650001902267650002302286650001402309650001402323650001102337650001802348650001502366650002002381650002202401653001602423653004302439653002402482653001802506700002102524700001902545700001802564773010602582856008702688852000902775655001202784IND60545664820221117232100.0160902e20150215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054566482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHillebrand, Olav10aMultitracer experiment to evaluate the attenuation of selected organic micropollutants in a karst aquifer  ap. 338-343.  aThe increasing pressure on drinking water resources necessitates an efficient management of potential and actual drinking water resources. Karst aquifers play a key role in the supply of the world's population with drinking water. Around one quarter of all drinking water is produced from these types of aquifers. Unfortunately due to the aquifer characteristics with extremely high hydraulic conductivities and short residence times, these systems are vulnerable to contamination. For successful management, a fundamental understanding of mass transport and attenuation processes with respect to potential contaminants is vital. In this study, a multitracer experiment was performed in a karst aquifer in SW-Germany for determining the attenuation capacity of a karst environment by assessing the environmental fate of selected relevant micropollutants. Uranine, acesulfame and carbamazepine were injected into a sinkhole as reference tracers together with the reactive compounds atenolol, caffeine, cyclamate, ibuprofen and paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen). The breakthrough of the tracers was monitored at a karst spring at a distance of ca. 3km. The breakthrough curves of the reactive compounds were interpreted relative to the reference substances. No significant retardation was found for any of the investigated micropollutants. The determined half-lives of the reactive compounds range from 38 to 1400h (i.e. persistent within the investigation period) in the following order (from high to no observed attenuation): paracetamol>atenolol≈ibuprofen>caffeine≫cyclamate. The attenuation rates are generally in agreement with studies from other environmental compartments. The occurrence of the biotransformation product atenolol acid served as evidence for in-situ biodegradation within the aquifer system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacesulfame potassium 3aacetaminophen 3aaquifers 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3acaffeine 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental fate 3ahalf life 3aibuprofen 3akarsts 3amass transfer 3apollutants 3asprings (water) 3atracer techniques 0aTracer test 0aIn-situ transport parameter estimation 0aFast flowing system 0aVulnerability1 aNödler, Karsten1 aSauter, Martin1 aLicha, Tobias0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 506-507 p.338-343dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245009500170300001600265520126900281592002801550650001401578650001701592650002501609650001601634650002101650650001701671650001001688650001301698650001601711650002301727650003201750650002101782650001501803650001701818650002501835650002501860650002601885650001601911653001601927653002901943653002101972653002301993700001902016700001202035700001702047700001402064773011902078856009002197852000902287655001202296IND60526444220221122042800.0190405e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052644422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2016.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Fangxu10aEffects of combined aqueous chlorine dioxide and UV-C on shelf-life quality of blueberries  ap. 125-131.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the effects of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) combined with UV-C irradiation on shelf-life quality of blueberries (Vaccinium spp. Berkeley) during cold storage. Respiration rate, weight loss, firmness, decay incidence, color change, total anthocyanin content (TAC), lipid peroxidation, soluble solids content (SSC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) of treated blueberries were examined. The results showed that treatment with 2mgL−1 aqueous ClO2 combined with 4kJm−2 UV-C irradiation inhibited increase of respiration rate, weight loss, decay incidence and MDA content, delayed decline of firmness, color and SSC, and improved total anthocyanin content of blueberries at 4±1°C compared with the control treatment. The efficiency was better than that of 2mgL−1 aqueous ClO2 or 4kJm−2 UV-C irradiation treatments alone. Furthermore, combination of ClO2 and UV-C irradiation enhanced the activities of SOD, APX and PAL during the storage time. Our study suggests that 2mgL−1 aqueous ClO2 combined with 4kJm−2 UV-C irradiation treatments may be a promising method of improving shelf-life quality and extending the postharvest life of blueberries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium 3aanthocyanins 3aascorbate peroxidase 3ablueberries 3achlorine dioxide 3acold storage 3acolor 3afirmness 3airradiation 3alipid peroxidation 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3arespiratory rate 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atotal soluble solids 3aultraviolet radiation 3aweight loss 0aBlueberries 0aAqueous chlorine dioxide 0aUV-C irradiation 0aShelf-life quality1 aWang, Shenghou1 aXu, Jie1 aLiu, Shiyang1 aLi, Guode0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2016 July, v. 117 p.125-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2016.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006600166300001400232520126800246592002801514650002101542650001601563650001201579650002801591650000701619650002201626653003301648653002001681653002401701653001001725653001401735700002301749700001901772773012201791856008101913852000901994655001202003IND60602176620221122230623.0180709e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060217662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2015.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorkmaz, Filiz10aIR-spectroscopic characterization of an elongated OmpG mutant  ap. 73-79.  aOmpG is a nonselective, pH dependent outer membrane protein from Escherichia coli. It consists of 281 residues, forming a 14-stranded β-sheet structure. In this study, OmpG is extended by 38 amino acids to produce a 16-stranded β-barrel (OmpG-16S). The resulting protein is investigated by IR-spectroscopy. The secondary structure, pH-dependent opening/closing mechanism, buffer accessibility and thermal stability of OmpG-16S are compared to OmpG-WT. The results show that OmpG-16S is responsive to pH change as indicated by the Amide I band shift upon a switch from acidic to neutral pH. This spectral shift is consistent with that observed in OmpG-WT, which confirms the existence of structural differences consistent with the presence of the open or closed state. Secondary structure analysis after curve-fitting of Amide I band revealed that the additional residues do not fold into β-sheet; rather they are in the form of turns and unordered structure. In thermal stability experiments, OmpG-16S is found to be as stable as OmpG-WT. Additionally, H/D exchange experiments showed no difference in the exchange rate of OmpG-16S between the acidic and alkaline pH, suggesting that the loop L6 is no longer sufficient to block the pore entrance at acidic pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3amutants 3aouter membrane proteins 3apH 3athermal stability 0aOuter membrane protein (OMP) 0aIR spectroscopy 0aProtein engineering 0aPorin 0aβ-Barrel1 avan Pee, Katharina1 aYildiz, Özkan0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2015 June 15, v. 576 p.73-79dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005200153245009500205300001600300520163600316592002801952650002401980650001602004650001702020650000902037650001502046650001502061650001402076650001602090650003602106650001502142650001902157650001202176650002102188650001502209650001402224650001702238650001002255653002702265653001202292653000902304653001502313653001302328653003302341700001602374700001402390700002502404700002502429700001402454700002202468773010202490856008702592852000902679655001202688IND60565728720221117070612.0170628e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056572872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Kang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3049-055210aSources and fate of antimicrobials in integrated fish-pig and non-integrated tilapia farms  ap. 393-399.  aAntimicrobial contamination in aquaculture products constitutes a food safety hazard, but little is known about the introduction and accumulation of antimicrobials in integrated fish-pig aquaculture. This study, conducted in 2013, aimed to determine the residues of 11 types of antimicrobials by UPLC-MS/MS analysis in fish feed (n=37), pig feed (n=9), pig manure (n=9), pond sediment (n=20), fish skin (n=20) and muscle tissue (n=20) sampled from integrated tilapia-pig farms, non-integrated tilapia farms and fish feed supply shops. There was a higher occurrence of antimicrobial residues in fish skin from both integrated and non-integrated farms, and in pig manure. Enrofloxacin (3.9–129.3μg/kg) and sulfadiazine (0.7–7.8μg/kg) were commonly detected in fish skin and muscle, pig manure and pond sediment from integrated farms, with different types of antimicrobials found in pig manure and tilapia samples. In non-integrated farms, sulfadiazine (2.5–89.9μg/kg) was the predominant antimicrobial detected in fish skin and muscle, fish feed and pond sediment. In general, antimicrobials seemed not to be commonly transmitted from pig to fish in tilapia-pig integrated farms, and fish feed, pig feed and pond sediment did not seem as important sources of the antimicrobials found in fish from both systems. The frequent findings of antimicrobial residues in fish skin compared with fish muscle was probably due to different pharmacokinetics in different tissue types, which have practical food safety implications since antimicrobial residues monitoring is usually performed analyzing mixed skin and fish muscle samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic residues 3aaquaculture 3aenrofloxacin 3afish 3afish farms 3afish feeds 3afish skin 3afood safety 3aintegrated agricultural systems 3amonitoring 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3apharmacokinetics 3apig manure 3asediments 3asulfadiazine 3aswine 0aAntimicrobial residues 0aTilapia 0aFeed 0aPig manure 0aSediment 0aIntegrated production system1 aLiu, Liping1 aZhan, Jia1 aScippo, Marie-Louise1 aHvidtfeldt, Kristian1 aLiu, Yuan1 aDalsgaard, Anders0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 595 p.393-399dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009900163300001400262520176000276592002802036650002102064650001202085650001202097650001602109650001502125650001202140650001602152650001402168650001502182650001802197650001302215650002002228650001102248650001302259650001902272650002202291650001002313650001102323700002102334700001802355700002102373773009202394856008102486852000902567655001202576IND4467925820221119160430.0141110e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446792582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2012.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRipoche, Aude10aModeling spatial partitioning of light and nitrogen resources in banana cover-cropping systems  ap. 81-91.  aIn banana cropping systems, cover crops are introduced mainly to manage weeds and mitigate the use of herbicides. But this introduction modifies the structure of the field, its biophysical functioning and then farmers’ practices. We designed the SIMBA-IC model to simulate nitrogen and light partitioning and crop management, which can differ across the different zones of the field (banana row, small and large inter-rows), and to assess agronomic and environmental performances of banana cover cropping systems under scenarios of different spatial arrangement. We calibrated and validated the model using independent data sets from a fertilizer and an intercropping experiment, respectively. Results showed that SIMBA-IC realistically simulated the differences between treatments in terms of crop cycle duration (for flowering date, RMSE=2.3 weeks in the calibration and validation steps) and biomass produced (RMSE=0.67 and 0.94kgDMha⁻¹ at flowering in calibration and validation steps, respectively). We simulated different management options related to the four field zones to optimize fertilization and cover crop management and ensure a tradeoff between agronomic (banana yield) and environmental (N leaching mitigation) performances. Simulations showed that yield was maximal and N leaching was reduced when fertilization was applied in the banana row. When cover crops were mowed according to the banana N stress, agronomic and environmental performances were higher than when mowing was based on the cover crop leaf area index, but the former approach led to very frequent mowing. Future studies should consider the impacts of these cropping systems from a socio-economic point of view to assess their feasibility and ability to be adopted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomic traits 3abananas 3abiomass 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3aflowering 3aherbicides 3aintercropping 3aleaching 3aleaf area index 3amowing 3anitrogen 3arisk reduction 3asimulation models 3aweeds 3azoning1 aAchard, Raphaël1 aLaurens, Aude1 aTixier, Philippe0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2012 Aug., v. 41 p.81-91dElsevier B.V.x1161-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2012.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010000165300001800265520125000283592002801533650001301561650001501574650001901589650001401608650002401622650001801646650002001664650001001684650002401694650000901718653000801727653001201735653003601747653002301783700001401806700001501820773016701835856008602002852000902088655001202097IND60544319620221117165551.0190416e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054431962DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(13)60378-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ben,10aEffect of Swim-Up and Percoll Treatment on Sperm Quality and In vitro Embryo Development in Yak  ap. 2235-2242.  aThis study was designed to determine the effect of different sperm preparation treatments on yak sperm quality and in vitro embryo development. Frozen-thawed semen samples were treated using swim-up or percoll gradient centrifugation methods. Sperm concentration, progressive motility, recovery of motile sperm, membrane integrity, acrosome and chromatin integrity were scored and compared in recovered samples and controls. In addition, the effects of two sperm separation treatments on embryos capable of cleavage and in vitro development to the blastocyst stage were evaluated. Swim-up separated sperm showed a higher motility, while the concentration of spermatozoa recovered and percent recovery of motile sperm were higher with percoll gradient centrifugation separation. According to the optical and electron microscopies, swim-up produced higher percentage of sperm with intact plasma membrane and acrosome than percoll gradient centrifugation separation. However, there was no difference in the percentage of sperm with intact chromatin between two treatment groups. Cell numbers in the blastocysts of two groups were not different. The blastocyst rate was similar in both groups, whereas cleavage rate was higher when swim-up was used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3ablastocyst 3acentrifugation 3achromatin 3aelectron microscopy 3aembryogenesis 3aplasma membrane 3asemen 3asperm concentration 3ayaks 0ayak 0aswim-up 0apercoll gradient centrifugation 0aembryo development1 aCui, Yan,1 aYU, Si-jiu0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2013 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.2235-2242dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(13)60378-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010300168300001600271520100200287592002801289650002101317650001301338650001101351650002101362650001601383650002501399650001701424650002101441650001801462650002901480650001601509650001601525650001701541650001401558650003201572653000901604653001301613653002501626653002101651700001501672700001701687700001701704700003401721773012801755856008301883852000901966655001201975IND60533743820221118221429.0190312e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053374382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2015.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, F.,10aImmunohistochemical Labelling of Cytokines in Calves Infected Experimentally with Mycoplasma bovis  ap. 243-247.  aTo gain further insight into the pathogenesis of Mycoplasma bovis-associated pneumonia, cytokine expression in different pulmonary compartments was examined. The expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-γ was examined immunohistochemically in the lung of 10 calves infected experimentally with M. bovis. M. bovis antigen was located in respiratory epithelial cells and within inflammatory cells in the airway lumina. Immunolabelling for TNF-α, IL-4 and IFN-γ was usually associated with inflammation, particularly in macrophages and lymphocytes in hyperplastic bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), in thickened alveolar septa and in the bronchoalveolar exudate of infected animals. In M. bovis infection, macrophage and lymphocyte activation results in expression of a number of cytokines capable of inducing lung lesions and hyperplasia of the BALT. The cytokines examined likely play a role in pulmonary defence against M. bovis infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycoplasma bovis 3aantigens 3acalves 3aepithelial cells 3ahyperplasia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-4 3alymphocyte proliferation 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3apathogenesis 3apneumonia 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0acalf 0acytokine 0aimmunohistochemistry 0aMycoplasma bovis1 aCastro, P.1 aPoveda, J.B.1 aAfonso, A.M.1 aMartínez Fernández, Ángel,0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2015 Feb.,  Apr., v. 152, no. 2-3 p.243-247dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2015.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002000136245004300156300001400199520137800213592002801591650001701619650002201636650001601658650001101674650001201685650001101697650001301708650001101721650001101732650001101743650001101754651002101765651001501786773010001801856007201901852000901973655001201982IND60474869520221118020408.0151223e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047486952DNAL7 a10.2984/70.1.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Kyung-Fun10aCetacean Strandings in Korean Waters 1  ap. 35-44.  aThe spatial and temporal distribution pattern of stranded cetaceans in Korean waters was investigated for the conservation and management of cetaceans in this area. A total of 154 cetacean stranding events consisting of 12 species were recorded in Korean waters from 1997 to 2004 by the Korea Coast Guard. A total of 4 species, the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) (n = 43), Unless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis) (n = 43), Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri) (n= 15), and common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) (n= 11), accounted for 73% of the stranded cetaceans. The majority of stranding events took place in the East Sea (n = 99; 64%) followed by the Korea Strait (n = 48; 31%) and the Yellow Sea (n = 7; 5%). The hot spots of stranding events in Korean waters were Pohang (18%), Busan (9%), and Goseong (8%). The number of stranding events increased following the establishment of the bycatch/stranding reporting system in 1997, with a steep increase in the number of stranding events after 2000. There were more stranding events in spring and summer (66%) than in fall and winter (34%), with a peak from March to July (51%). This is the first report on the spatial and temporal distribution pattern of stranded cetaceans in Korean waters. Future work on strandings in Korean waters should strive to investigate the causes of these strandings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalaenoptera 3aDelphinus delphis 3aNeophocaena 3aautumn 3abycatch 3acoasts 3adolphins 3aspring 3asummer 3awhales 3awinter 3aKorean Peninsula 3aYellow Sea0 tPacific science.g2016 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.35-44dUniversity of Hawai'i Pressx1534-61887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2984%2F70.1.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01404naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024002900099040001800128100002100146245008600167300001300253520037100266592002800637650001000665650002300675650001200698650002000710650001000730650001300740650001400753650001900767650000900786650000900795651002800804651001100832773011400843852000900957856007600966655001201042991587393930742620221119092411.0190513e20141121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7690258812DNAL7 a10.5586/am.1974.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisiewska, Maria10aMacromycetes of beech forests within the eastern part of the Fagus area in Europe  ap. 3-72.  aThis work presents the author's view on the habitat if individual forest communities based on the fungi she has collected and gives a comparison of the mycoflora of beech forest in Poland and in south and central Europe.

Previously, lectin KSA-2 from this alga has been isolated and evaluated for the strictly high-mannose N-glycan binding specificity. In this study, we have determined the antibacterial activities and cDNA cloning encoding lectin KSA-2. Complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning based on the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) elucidated the full-length sequence of KSA-2, which encoded a polypeptide of 269 amino acids including initiating methionine, with four tandemly repeated domains of about 67 amino acids, and sharing 45% sequence identity. The calculated molecular mass from the deduced sequence was consistent with that of natural KSA-2 (28,021.5Da), which was determined by electron spray ionization–mass spectrometry. The primary structure of KSA-2 is highly similar to those of the high-mannose N-glycan specific lectins in lower organisms including Burkholderia oklahomensis EO147 (BOA), Myxococcus xanthus (MBHA) and Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 (PFL) from proteobacteria, Oscillatoria agardhii NIES-240 (OAA) from cyanobacterium, Eucheuma serra (ESA-2) and Eucheuma denticulatum (EDA-2) from macro red algae, indicating that they were closely related to each other. The active fraction KSA-2 inhibited the growth of human and shrimp pathogenic bacteria Enterobacter cloacae and Vibrio alginolyticus, respectively, although it did not affect the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio harveyi, suggesting that KSA-2 caused the activity through binding to the target receptor(s) on the cell surface of E. cloacae and V. alginolyticus. These results indicate that the cultivated K. striatum is a good source of a lectin that may be useful as an antibacterial agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aEscherichia coli 3aEucheuma 3aKappaphycus 3aMyxococcus xanthus 3aOscillatoria agardhii 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aVibrio harveyi 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aalgae 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3acomplementary DNA 3agrowth retardation 3ahuman growth 3aindustry 3alectins 3amethionine 3amolecular weight 3apolypeptides 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3asequence analysis 3ashrimp 3aspectroscopy 0acDNA cloning 0aKappaphucus striatum 0aLectin 0aAntibacterial activity 0aPrimary structure1 aHirayama, Makoto1 aLy, Bui Minh1 aHori, Kanji0 tPhytochemistry letters.g2015 Dec., v. 14 p.99-105dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000131x1874-39007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytol.2015.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04395naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010100171500001900272520290700291592002803198650001103226650001403237650001903251650001403270650001503284650001803299650001103317651001003328653002603338653002503364653002903389653001903418653003203437700001703469700001903486700001903505700001603524700001503540700001703555700001603572700002103588700001703609700001903626700001803645700001403663773010303677856008803780852000903868655001203877IND60724115820221120060910.0210305e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072411582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1035242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Shihua10aPorphyry copper and skarn fertility of the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau collisional granitoids  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe recent discovery of numerous large porphyry Cu deposits in the southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau shows that porphyry Cu deposits can be hosted in magmatic suites in collisional settings. However, in contrast, only a few small porphyry Cu deposits have so far been discovered in association with collision-related granitoids in the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This raises questions about the origin of collision-related magmas and their mineralization potential. In this contribution, we comprehensively synthesize whole-rock geochemical and isotopic data on collision-related intrusions from the Qimantagh Metallogenic Belt in the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which hosts many skarn polymetallic deposits but only a few, small porphyry Cu-Mo deposits. This, combined with newly obtained zircon trace element data, provides a high-quality database that can yield insights on the nature and origin of the magmatic suites as well as their fertility in terms of Cu mineralization. Two volumetrically dominant intrusive suites are identified in the Qimantagh Metallogenic Belt: 435-370 Ma granitoids (Suite I) and 245-196 Ma granitoids (Suite II). They formed during syn- to post-collisional stages of the Caledonian and Hercynian-Indosinian Orogenies, respectively. In contrast, arc magmatic rocks are relatively scarce. Both Suites I and II are characterized by low zircon Ce/Ce* and Eu/Eu* values, low whole-rock Sr/Y and Eu/Eu* values with arc-like features (e.g., depletion of Nb and Ta). Furthermore, both suites display some evolved Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic values (e.g., εNdi = -8.1 to 0.1), with the majority of samples characterized by Paleo- to Meso-Proterozoic two-stage Nd and Hf model ages. These features suggest that the parental magmas of the two suites were probably derived from subduction fluid-modified mantle sources which underwent significant crustal AFC processes during magma ascent. The relative scarcity of arc magmatic rocks and the prevalence of collisional magmatism during the Caledonian and Hercynian-Indosinian Orogenies in the Qimantagh Metallogenic Belt can be explained by pre-collisional, flat-slab subduction and subsequent slab breakoff during collision, the later triggering asthenosphere upwelling and extensive magmatism in collisional settings. Compared to fertile plutons in some large porphyry Cu deposits worldwide, especially those in the Gangdese Metallogenic Belt, the two suites in the Qimantagh Metallogenic Belt have low magmatic oxidation states and low water content which inhibited the formation of large porphyry Cu deposits. Thus, skarn polymetallic deposits (probably as well as small porphyry Cu-Mo deposits) rather than large porphyry Cu deposits should be targeted during future mineral exploration in the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since such deposits do not necessarily need a parental magma with high oxidation state and water content.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3adatabases 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3asubduction 3awater content 3azircon 3aChina 0aCollisional tectonics 0aFlat slab subduction 0aPorphyry copper deposits 0aSkarn deposits 0aQinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP)1 aLi, Sanzhong1 aFeng, Chengyou1 aLiu, Yongjiang1 aSantosh, M.1 aHe, Shuyue1 aQu, Hongying1 aLiu, Guoyan1 aSeltmann, Reimar1 aLai, Zhiqing1 aWang, Xiaohong1 aSong, Yingxin1 aZhou, Jie0 tEarth-science reviews.g2021 Mar., v. 214 p.103524-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1035243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245014000173300001600313520149200329592002801821650001301849650001601862650001901878650001601897650001701913650001201930650001601942650000801958650002201966650002101988650001302009650002302022650001302045650002002058650001002078650000902088650001802097650001102115651001102126653002902137653001702166653001502183653001102198653001802209700006102227700001902288700003102307700001902338700002302357773010202380856008702482852000902569655001202578IND60565728820221117070022.0170711e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056572882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.1462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammed, Gihan10aCombination of a crop model and a geochemical model as a new approach to evaluate the sustainability of an intensive agriculture system  ap. 119-131.  aBy combining a crop model (STICS) and a geochemical model (PHREEQC), a new approach to assess the sustainability of agrosystems is proposed. It is based upon aqueous geochemistry and the stepwise modifications of soil solution during its transfer from the surface till aquifer. Meadows of Crau (SE France), irrigated since the 16th century, were field monitored (2012–2015) and modelled. Except for N, the mineral requirements of hay are largely covered by dissolved elements brought by irrigation water with only slight deficits in K and P, which are compensated by P-K fertilizers and the winter pasture by sheep. N cycle results in a very small nitrate leakage. The main determinants of the chemical composition changes of water are: concentration by evaporation, equilibration with soil pCO2, mineral nutrition of plants, input of fertilizers, sheep grazing, mineral-solution interactions in superficial formations till the aquifer, including ion exchange. Inverse modelling with PHREEQC allows for quantifying these processes. For groundwater, measured composition fit statistically very well with those computed, validating thus this approach. This long-term established agrosystem protects both soil and water resources: soil nutritional status remains constant with even some P and (minor) K fixation in soils; long-term decarbonatation occurs but it is greatly slowed by saturation of irrigation water by carbonate; P fixation in soil protects groundwater from eutrophication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acrop models 3aeutrophication 3afertilizers 3ageochemistry 3agrazing 3agroundwater 3ahay 3aintensive farming 3airrigation water 3anitrates 3anutritional status 3apastures 3aplant nutrition 3asheep 3asoil 3asoil solution 3awinter 3aFrance 0aBiogeochemical modelling 0aMineral flux 0aIrrigation 0aMeadow 0aWater quality1 aTrolard, Fabienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5475-99581 aGillon, Marina1 aCognard-Plancq, Anne-Laure1 aChanzy, André1 aBourrié, Guilhem,0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 595 p.119-131dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03944naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245013100165300001600296520230100312592002802613650001702641650003002658650001502688650001202703650002802715650001202743650001602755650001502771650001602786650003002802650001702832650001502849650001402864650001302878650001302891650002502904650001802929650001302947650001102960650002102971650002002992650001803012650001803030650002003048651001003068651001803078700001803096700001903114700002103133700002003154700002003174773010303194856004803297852000903345655001203354IND4483395420221121052211.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448339542DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-012-1534-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeevanandam, M.10aHydrogeochemistry and microbial contamination of groundwater from Lower Ponnaiyar Basin, Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu, India  ap. 867-887.  aGroundwater is the major source of fresh water in regions where there is inadequate surface water resources. Forty-seven groundwater samples were collected from Lower Ponnaiyar basin, Cuddalore District, south India, during the premonsoon (PRM) and postmonsoon (POM) seasons of 2005. Out of 47 groundwater samples, 15 samples showing higher nitrate concentration were those collected during PRM 2005. Microbial analysis of these samples was carried out by employing 16S rRNA gene sequence tool. Detailed analysis was conducted to determine the hydrogeochemical processes and microbial contamination responsible for deterioration of quality. The abundance of the ions during PRM and POM are in the following order: NaÂ >Â CaÂ >Â MgÂ >Â KÂ =Â ClÂ >Â HCO3Â >Â SO4Â >Â CO3. The dominant water types in PRM are in the order of NaClÂ >Â CaMgClÂ >Â mixed CaNaHCO3, whereas during POM NaClÂ >Â CaMgClÂ >Â mixed CaNaHCO3, and CaHCO3. However, NaCl and CaMgCl are major water types in the study area. The quality of groundwater in the study area is mainly impaired by surface contamination sources, mineral dissolution, ion exchange and evaporation. Groundwater chemistry was used to assess quality to ensure its suitability for drinking and irrigation, based on BIS and WHO standards. Suitability for irrigation was determined on the basis of the diagram of US Salinity Laboratory (USSL), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), and Na%. According to SAR and USSL classification, 27.66% (PRM) and 40.43% (POM) of samples fall under C3S2 category, indicating high salinity and medium sodium hazard, which restrict its suitability for irrigation. Microbiological analysis and its effects on the water quality were also addressed. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of 11 bacterial contaminants exhibited five groups with 11 operational taxonomic units with aerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms. The presence of aerobic organisms in the groundwater samples reflects the active conversion of ammonia to nitrite by Nitrosomonas sp. which is further converted to nitrates by other organisms. Further the presence of nitrate reducers could also play a role in the process of conversion of nitrate to ammonia and nitrate to molecular nitrogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aWorld Health Organization 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3abacterial contamination 3acalcium 3aevaporation 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aion exchange 3airrigation 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA 3asalinity 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3asodium chloride 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awater resources 3aIndia 3aUnited States1 aNagarajan, R.1 aManikandan, M.1 aSenthilkumar, M.1 aSrinivasalu, S.1 aPrasanna, M.

Limno-reservoirs aim to preserve a constant water level in the riverine zone of large reservoirs to mitigate the impacts arising from their construction. Groundwater flow contribution (mean 60 %) was derived by recharge estimation. In situ measurements (spring discharge, electrical conductivity and sulfate) were undertaken and spring discharge was compared with a drought index. Twenty-eight springs were monitored and three hydrogeological units (HGUs) were defined: a carbonate plateau (HGU1), the underlying aquitard (HGU2), and the gypsum-enriched HGU3. HGU1 is the main aquifer and may play a role in the preservation of the limno-reservoir water level. Hydrogeochemical sampling was conducted and the code PHREEQC used to describe the main geochemical processes. Weathering and dissolution of calcite and gypsum seem to control the hydrogeochemical processes in the basin. Water progresses from Ca²⁺–HCO₃–in the upper basin to Ca²⁺–SO₄²–in the lower basin, where HGU3 outcrops. A clear temporal pattern was observed in the limno-reservoir, with salinity decreasing in winter and increasing in summer. This variation was wider at the river outlet, but the mixing of the river discharge with limno-reservoir water buffered it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acalcite 3adrought 3aelectrical conductivity 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3agypsum 3aplateaus 3arivers 3asalinity 3aspring 3asprings (water) 3asummer 3awatersheds 3aweathering 3awinter 3aSpain1 aSastre-Merlín, Antonio1 aVicente, Rosa1 aMartínez-Pérez, Silvia0 tHydrogeology journal.g2014 Aug., v. 22, no. 5 p.1115-1129dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-014-1113-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003500153245020900188300001800397520164800415592002802063650001802091650001302109650001102122650001502133650001902148650001502167650001902182650002702201650000902228650002102237650001402258650002102272653001002293653002002303653002602323653002102349653001602370700002102386700001902407700001802426700002502444773010402469856008702573852000902660655001202669IND60545665020221117232013.0160902e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054566502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Hernández, Virtudes10aCorrigendum to “Sorption/desorption of non-hydrophobic and ionisable pharmaceutical and personal care products from reclaimed water onto/from a natural sediment” Sci Total Environ 472 (2014) 273–281  ap. 1232-1233.  aIn the present work, the sorption of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) (acetaminophen, atenolol, carbamazepine, caffeine, naproxen and sulphamethoxazole) onto the natural organic matter (NOM) and the inorganic surfaces of a natural sandy loam sediment was quantified separately. The quantification was based on the PPCP charge, their degree of ionisation, their octanol-water partitioning coefficient (KOW) and the sediment organic carbon fraction (ƒOC). PPCP desorption from the sediment was examined under conditions of infiltrating water containing a high concentration of inorganic ions (mimicking infiltrating reclaimed water), and a low concentration (and smaller diversity) of inorganic ions (mimicking rainwater infiltration). Batch tests were performed using a sediment/water ratio of 1:4 and a PPCP initial concentration ranging from 1 to 100μgL−1. The results showed the type and degree of PPCP ionisation to strongly influence the sorption of these compounds onto the sediment. The sorption of cationic species onto the sediment was higher than that of anionic species and mostly reversible; the sorption of neutral species was negligible with the exception of caffeine. The anionic species sorbed less onto the sediment, but also desorbed less easily. Most of the compounds showed a sorption that was highly influenced by interaction with mineral surfaces. The presence of inorganic ions had no impact on the desorption of the PPCPs from the sediment. According to the calculated percentages of removal, the mobility followed the order: carbamazepine>acetaminophen>naproxen>atenolol>sulphamethoxazole>caffeine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3acaffeine 3acarbon 3adesorption 3ainorganic ions 3aionization 3aorganic matter 3apersonal care products 3arain 3asandy loam soils 3asediments 3asulfamethoxazole 0aPPCPs 0aReclaimed water 0aSorption–desorption 0aUnsaturated zone 0aGroundwater1 aMeffe, Raffaella1 aHerrera, Sonia1 aArranz, Elena1 ade Bustamante, Irene0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 505 p.1232-1233dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245005500201300001800256500002000274520140200294592002801696650001201724650001201736650001101748650001001759650001301769650001101782650001601793650001001809650001501819651001401834700002301848700002101871773012601892856007702018852000902095655001202104IND60788018820221120203732.0220811e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078801882DNAL7 a10.1002/2017WR0208972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntico, Andrés1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2985-962010aHydrometric Data Rescue in the Paraná River Basin  ap. 1368-1381.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Paraná River streamflow is the third largest in South America and the sixth largest in the world. Thus, preserving historical Paraná hydrometric data is relevant for understanding South American and global hydroclimate changes. In this work, we rescued paper format data of daily Paraná water level observations taken uninterruptedly at Rosario City, Argentina, from January 1875 to present. The rescue consisted of the following activities: (i) imaging and digitization of paper format data, (ii) application of quality checks and homogeneity tests to the digitized water levels, and (iii) consideration of errors caused by gauge sinkings that may have occurred from 1875 to 1908. In addition, a rating curve was obtained for Rosario and it was used to convert water levels into discharges. The rescued water level observations and their associated discharge data provide the longest (last 143 years) continuous hydrometric records of the Paraná basin. The usefulness of these records was demonstrated by showing that the Paraná‐Pacific Ocean links observed after 1900 in previous studies are also evidenced in our nineteenth‐century discharge data. That is, high Paraná discharges coincided with El Niño events and with El Niño‐like states of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), whereas low discharges coincided with La Niña events and with La Niña‐like IPO states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3abasins 3apaper 3aresearch 3arivers 3astream flow 3awater 3awatersheds 3aArgentina1 aAguiar, Ricardo O.1 aAmsler, Mario L.0 tWater resources research.g2018 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.1368-1381dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR0208973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245014200165520102600307592002801333650001001361650003501371650001601406650001401422650001501436650002101451650001501472650000901487650001801496650001801514650001001532650001101542651001401553700002101567700001701588700001701605700002601622773012101648856007901769852000901848655001201857IND60654543920221117225032.0190725e20190702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065454392DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy90703512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, M.K.N. 10aClassification of Groundwater Suitability for Irrigation in the Ulagalla Tank Cascade Landscape by GIS and the Analytic Hierarchy Process  aThe tank cascade system (TCS) has been used for over 2000 years for water management in Sri Lanka. Since surface water is limited in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, agricultural production, especially of upland crops, relies on groundwater for irrigation. We sampled 29 wells in the Ulagalla cascade, a prominent TCS near Anuradhapura city in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, in Yala (dry) and Maha (wet) seasons, the two main cropping seasons in Sri Lanka. We evaluated the suitability of groundwater for irrigation using the analytic hierarchy process and geographical information system. Water quality did not vary notably between seasons. However, it deteriorated with the onset of high intensity heavy rain, especially during the Maha season. A water quality zoning map indicated that groundwater in 4% and 96% of the study area is suitable and moderately suitable for irrigation, respectively. Irrigation water quality in tank cascade landscapes and similar environments can be assessed using this methodology and our results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3ahighlands 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3alandscapes 3arain 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awells 3azoning 3aSri Lanka1 aSakai, Kazuhito 1 aKimura, Sho 1 aYuge, Kozue 1 aGunarathna, M.H.J.P. 0 tAgronomy.g2019 July 02, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy90703513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245011700211300001600328520145500344592002801799650001901827650001601846650002301862650001301885650001701898650001401915650002501929650001501954650002601969650001801995650002002013650001802033650001902051650002202070700005902092700005702151700005602208700006202264700006002326700005802386700005702444773011202501856008002613852000902693655001202702IND60700426120221120112726.0200630e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070042612DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217209132752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLitchman, Michelle L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8928-574810aIn-Person and Technology-Mediated Peer Support in Diabetes Care: A Systematic Review of Reviews and Gap Analysis  ap. 230-241.  aThe purpose of this study is to report a systematic review of reviews of evidence and gaps focused on in-person and technology-mediated diabetes peer support and its impact on clinical, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of reviews in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Reviews published in English from December 1978 through December 2018 examining clinical, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes were included. The search yielded 167 reviews that were examined for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Nine systematic reviews and meta-analyses meeting criteria were included. Findings suggest peer support interventions can have a positive impact on clinical (A1C, blood pressure, cholesterol, weight), behavioral (diabetes knowledge, being active, healthy eating, medication management, self-management, self-efficacy, empowerment), and psychosocial (social support, health and diabetes distress, depression, quality of life) outcomes. Research gaps exist related to understanding the effects of emerging technology-mediated peer support modalities and the effects of peer support on gestational diabetes. Many clinical, behavioral, and psychosocial benefits related to in-person and technology-mediated peer support exist. Diabetes care and education specialists should incorporate and recommend peer support resources for people with diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3acholesterol 3adiabetes educators 3adistress 3adrug therapy 3aeducation 3agestational diabetes 3aguidelines 3ahealthy eating habits 3ameta-analysis 3aquality of life 3aself-efficacy 3asocial support 3asystematic review1 aOser, Tamara K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0405-34201 aHodgson, Lisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0189-71181 aHeyman, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9666-12141 aWalker, Heather R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1134-57791 aDeroze, Phyllisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4025-44701 aRinker, Joanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7381-95761 aWarshaw, Hope1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0299-44350 tDiabetes educator.g2020 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.230-241dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217209132753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013900167500002200306500002200328520162900350592002801979650000802007650002002015650001002035650001102045650001202056650002202068650004402090650001302134653002802147653002002175653002602195653002802221653002102249700001202270700001602282700001502298700001302313700001402326700001402340700001502354700001502369700001902384773009002403856008502493852000902578655001202587IND60612291520221119031215.0180911s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061229152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2018.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shuangli10aCharacterization of the interaction interface and conformational dynamics of human TGIF1 homeodomain upon the binding of consensus DNA  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aThe TG interacting factor-1 homeodomain (TGIF1-HD) binds with the consensus DNA motif 5’-TGTCA-3′ in gene promoters through its three-amino acid loop extension (TALE) type homeodomain, and then recruits co-regulators to regulate gene expression. Although the solution NMR structure of human TGIF1-HD has been reported previously, little is known about its DNA binding mechanism. NMR titrations have been extensively used to study mechanisms of ligand binding to target proteins; however, an intermediate exchange occurred predominantly between TGIF1-HD in the free and bound states when titrated with the consensus DNA, which resulted in poor-quality NMR spectra and precluded further exploration of its interaction interface and conformational dynamics. Here, the helix α3 of TGIF1-HD was speculated as the specific DNA binding interface by hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments, and subsequently confirmed by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) spectroscopy. In addition, simultaneous conformational changes in other regions, including α1 and α2, were induced by DNA binding, explaining the observation of chemical shift perturbations from extensive residues besides those located in α3. Further, low-populated DNA-bound TGIF1-HD undergoing a slow exchange at a rate of 130.2 ± 3.6 s⁻¹ was derived from the analysis of the CEST data, and two residues, R220 and R221, located in the middle of α3 were identified to be crucial for DNA binding. Our study provides structural and dynamic insights into the mechanisms of TGIF1-HD recognition of extensive promoter DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteins 0aTG interacting factor-1 0aDNA recognition 0aInteraction interface 0aConformational dynamics 0aNMR spectroscopy1 aHu, Rui1 aYao, Haijie1 aLong, Dong1 aLuo, Fan1 aZhou, Xin1 aZhang, Xu1 aLiu, Maili1 aZhu, Jiang1 aYang, Yunhuang0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2018.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016900168520177900337592002802116650001602144650001902160650001202179650001102191650001202202650001002214650002102224650003402245650002702279650001502306651001002321653001402331653001002345653001602355653001602371653000802387700001302395700001302408700001902421700001202440700001702452700001602469773010402485856008502589852000902674655001202683IND60686511420221118045954.0200405e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068651142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1056512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Hangbiao10aExposure sources of perfluoroalkyl acids and influence of age and gender on concentrations of chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonates in human serum from China  aThe presence of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates (Cl-PFAESs) in humans has attracted great attention in recent decades. However, information on their exposure sources and the influence of age and gender on Cl-PFAES concentrations in human serum is still limited. In this study, eighty-five serum samples were collected from the general population in Anji, China, and analyzed for perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs), perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs), and Cl-PFAESs. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; mean, 5.9 ng/mL) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA; 3.3 ng/mL) were the predominant PFAAs in human serum. The serum concentrations of C₈–C₁₂ PFCAs, perfluorohexane sulfonate, and PFOS were significantly (rₛ = 0.40–0.98, p < 0.01) correlated with one another. In human serum, the mean percentages of branched isomers for PFOA, perfluorohexane sulfonate, and PFOS were 97.3%, 92.6%, and 66%, respectively. These results suggest that the major source of PFCAs and PFSAs in human serum was direct exposure. The mean 6:2Cl-PFAES (6.0 ng/mL) serum concentration was higher than PFOA (p < 0.01). The mean 6:2Cl-PFAES concentrations in male and female serum were 6.5 ng/mL and 5.6 ng/mL, respectively. A significant increase in 6:2Cl-PFAES concentrations with age was found in males (rₛ = 0.50, p = 0.001). The 6:2Cl-PFAES concentration was positively correlated with C₈–C₁₂ PFCAs and PFOS in human serum (rₛ = 0.44–0.91, p < 0.01), indicating that they may have common exposure sources. Overall, this study first investigated the roles of age and gender on human serum concentrations of Cl-PFAESs and provided baseline information on the occurrence of Cl-PFAESs in the general Chinese population.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3adirect contact 3afemales 3ahumans 3aisomers 3amales 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asulfonates 3aChina 0aCl-PFAESs 0aPFAAs 0aHuman serum 0aPFOS isomer 0aAge1 aLin, Shu1 aDai, Wei1 aFeng, Lingfang1 aLi, Tao1 aLou, Jianlin1 aZhang, Quan0 tEnvironment international.g2020 May, v. 138 p.105651-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1056513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245018500212300001600397500001900413520172700432592002802159650001802187650001702205650001602222650002002238650001102258650000902269650002102278650001202299650002302311650004002334650001002374650000902384650001702393650003102410653001602441653001202457653002102469653001602490653001702506700002602523700002102549700002402570700002502594700002202619773013602641856008102777852000902858655001202867IND60720747920221121132646.0201217e20210128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072074792DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145200025242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoelho, Mariana O.

We investigated the impact of incorporating mycoprotein into the diet on insulin sensitivity (IS), glycaemic control and plasma lipoprotein composition. Twenty healthy adults participated in a randomised, parallel-group trial in which they consumed a 7 d fully controlled diet where lunch and dinner contained either meat/fish (control group, CON) or mycoprotein (MYC) as the primary source of dietary protein. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed pre- and post-intervention, and 24 h continuous blood glucose monitoring was applied throughout. Fasting plasma samples were obtained pre- and post-intervention and were analysed using quantitative, targeted NMR-based metabonomics. There were no changes within or between groups in blood glucose or serum insulin responses, nor in IS or 24 h glycaemic profiles. No differences between groups were found for 171 of the 224 metabonomic targets. Forty-five lipid concentrations of different lipoprotein fractions (VLDL, LDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein and HDL) remained unchanged in CON but showed a coordinated decrease (7–27 %; all P < 0·05) in MYC. Total plasma cholesterol, free cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL2-cholesterol, DHA and n-3 fatty acids decreased to a larger degree in MYC (14–19 %) compared with CON (3–11 %; P < 0·05). Substituting meat/fish for mycoprotein twice daily for 1 week did not modulate whole-body IS or glycaemic control but resulted in changes to plasma lipid composition, the latter primarily consisting of a coordinated reduction in circulating cholesterol-containing lipoproteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3adietary protein 3adinner 3afish 3aglycemic control 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alunch 3ameat 3ametabolomics 3arandomized clinical trials 0aMycoprotein 0aProtein 0aMetabolic health 0aCholesterol 0aLipoproteins1 aMonteyne, Alistair J.1 aDirks, Marlou L.1 aFinnigan, Tim J.

A number of factors are believed to contribute to the ability of C. jejuni to cause disease within the human host including the secretion of non-flagellar proteins via the flagellar type III secretion system (FT3SS). Here for the first time we have utilised quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), and label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS), to compare supernatant samples from C. jejuni M1 wild type and flagella-deficient (flgG mutant) strains to identify putative novel proteins secreted via the FT3SS. Genes encoding proteins that were candidates for flagellar secretion, derived from the LC/MS and SILAC datasets, were deleted. Infection of human CACO-2 tissue culture cells using these mutants resulted in the identification of novel genes required for interactions with these cells. This work has shown for the first time that both CJM1_0791 and CJM1_0395 are dependent on the flagellum for their presence in supernatants from C. jejuni stains M1 and 81–176.This study provides the most complete description of the Campylobac er jejuni secretome to date. SILAC and label-free proteomics comparing mutants with or without flagella have resulted in the identification of two C. jejuni proteins that are dependent on flagella for their export from the bacterial cell.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3acell culture 3adata collection 3aflagellum 3agastroenteritis 3agenes 3ahumans 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amutants 3aproteomics 3asecretion 3astable isotopes 3atissue culture 3atype III secretion system 0aCampylobacter jejuni 0aSecretome 0aType III secretion system 0aFlagella 0aSILAC 0aMass spec1 aYu, Lu1 aMaskell, Duncan1 aChoudhary, Jyoti1 aGrant, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9746-29890 tJournal of proteomics.g2017 Jan. 30, v. 152 p.181-187dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01543naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015000156300002000306520031300326592002800639650001600667650001500683650001900698650001900717650001700736650001600753650002100769650002600790700001800816700001800834700001700852700001600869700001700885700001600902700001900918773012500937856007401062852000901136655001201145IND60642134520221122085159.0190506e20170925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064213452DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08381e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Yulan10aPreparation of porous TiO₂ photocatalyts with different crystal phases and high catalytic activity by simple calcination of titanate nanofibers  ap. 45742-45745.  aA simple method has been developed to prepare porous TiO₂ photocatalysts with different crystal phases and large surface area by calcining titanate nanofibers under different temperatures.

Although not lethal, the dermal leishmaniases cause chronic and disfiguring skin lesions, which are an important cause of morbidity and stigma.Microscopy remains the reference test for diagnosis of dermal leishmaniasis; however, it has low and variable sensitivity and requires well trained personnel. The technical complexity and cost of the more sensitive molecular techniques (e.g. PCR) limits their application in routine diagnosis in endemic areas. Point-of-care (POC) tests for early diagnosis are much needed in order to benefit both patients and communities, by reducing the risk of both sequelae and Leishmania transmission. To this end we developed a Target Product Profile (TPP) for a POC test for dermal leishmaniases.The TPP was defined through several rounds of discussions and by consensus with stakeholders and experts in dermal leishmaniases from different type of organizations and endemic regions.A rapid, simple and robust test that can be implemented in resource-limited settings, enabling decentralized diagnosis and treatment of dermal leishmaniasis should be developed. Ideally it should enable the diagnosis of all forms of dermal leishmaniasis, but the minimally accepted target would be localized cutaneous leishmaniasis. A minimum sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% would be required. The consensus was that the POC test should target Leishmania antigens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania 3aantigens 3acomplications (disease) 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3aearly diagnosis 3aepidemiology 3aexperts 3ahuman resources 3amorbidity 3aparasites 3apatients 3apoint-of-care systems 3apolymerase chain reaction 3askin lesions 3astakeholders 3avisceral leishmaniasis 0aLeishmaniasis 0aDermal leishmaniasis 0aPoint-of-care diagnostics 0aTarget Product Profile1 aAlbertini, Audrey1 aBarbeitas, Mady1 aArana, Byron1 aPicado, Albert1 aRuiz-Postigo, Jose A.1 aNdung'u, Joseph M.0 tParasite epidemiology and control.g2019 Mar. 06,  p.e00103-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23217x2405-67317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parepi.2019.e001033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04139naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245012300161520209000284592002802374650001402402650002202416650001602438650001902454650001702473650001602490650001402506650001102520650001302531650000902544650001502553650001202568650001002580650001002590650003302600650002602633650001502659650002702674650001902701650004302720650001802763650002202781651001302803653002402816653002202840653001302862653001902875653001602894653002602910653001602936653001202952653002302964700001902987700001903006700001603025700001603041700002503057700002003082700001703102700001703119700001603136700002703152700001603179700001203195773010403207856008503311852000903396655001203405IND60686511520221118045810.0200405e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068651152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1056642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Xi10aIndoor microbiome, environmental characteristics and asthma among junior high school students in Johor Bahru, Malaysia  aIndoor microbial diversity and composition are suggested to affect the prevalence and severity of asthma by previous home microbiome studies, but no microbiome-health association study has been conducted in a school environment, especially in tropical countries. In this study, we collected floor dust and environmental characteristics from 21 classrooms, and health data related to asthma symptoms from 309 students, in junior high schools in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The bacterial and fungal composition was characterized by sequencing 16s rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and the absolute microbial concentration was quantified by qPCR. In total, 326 bacterial and 255 fungal genera were characterized. Five bacterial (Sphingobium, Rhodomicrobium, Shimwellia, Solirubrobacter, Pleurocapsa) and two fungal (Torulaspora and Leptosphaeriaceae) taxa were protective for asthma severity. Two bacterial taxa, Izhakiella and Robinsoniella, were positively associated with asthma severity. Several protective bacterial taxa including Rhodomicrobium, Shimwellia and Sphingobium have been reported as protective microbes in previous studies, whereas other taxa were first time reported. Environmental characteristics, such as age of building, size of textile curtain per room volume, occurrence of cockroaches, concentration of house dust mite allergens transferred from homes by the occupants, were involved in shaping the overall microbial community but not asthma-associated taxa; whereas visible dampness and mold, which did not change the overall microbial community for floor dust, was negatively associated with the concentration of protective bacteria Rhodomicrobium (β = −2.86, p = 0.021) of asthma. The result indicates complex interactions between microbes, environmental characteristics and asthma symptoms. Overall, this is the first indoor microbiome study to characterize the asthma-associated microbes and their environmental determinant in the tropical area, promoting the understanding of microbial exposure and respiratory health in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlattodea 3aLeptosphaeriaceae 3aPleurocapsa 3aRhodomicrobium 3aSphingomonas 3aTorulaspora 3aallergens 3aasthma 3abacteria 3adust 3adust mites 3afabrics 3afungi 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amiddle school students 3amiddle schools 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aMalaysia 0aMicrobial community 0aAbsolute quantity 0aWheezing 0aBreathlessness 0aAdolescence 0aDampness/visible mold 0aJohor Bahru 0aTropics 0aJunior high school1 aNorbäck, Dan,1 aYuan, Qianqian1 aLi, Yanling1 aZhu, Xunhua1 aJamal Hisham Hashim,1 aHashim, Zailina1 aFaridah Ali,1 aZheng, Yi-Wu1 aLai, Xu-Xin1 aSpangfort, Michael Dho1 aDeng, Yiqun1 aSun, Yu0 tEnvironment international.g2020 May, v. 138 p.105664-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1056643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006500167300001600232520136500248592002801613650004401641650001501685650001301700650001701713650001901730650002801749650001401777650000901791650000901800650000701809650001701816650001301833650000901846650000901855700001901864700002001883700002001903700001501923700001701938700002101955700001701976773012101993856008102114852000902195655001202204IND60520699020221118074752.0160522e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052069902DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-013-0122-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChidambaram, S.12aA study on the defluoridation in water by using natural soil  ap. 741-751.  aRemoval of excess fluoride (F⁻) from the water has been attempted by several authors by using different materials both natural and artificial. The main aim of this paper was to attempt the fluoride removal by using the locally available red soil adopting column method. The red soil was mixed in different proportion with sand in order to increase the porosity and permeability property of the medium. It was optimized for 4:1 ratio of red soil to sand and it was used for the following experiment. The experiment was conducted in 11 batches for a period of about 9,213 min. Fresh standard solution of F was used in each batch, prepared from Orion 1,000 ppm solution. The samples were collected and analyzed for pH, EC (Electrical Conductivity) and HCO₃. Rate of flow of water and efficiency of adsorption were calculated and compared with the fluoride removal capacities of the medium. The medium used for the fluoride removal was subjected to FTIR analysis before and after the experiment. The variation of IR spectrum before and after treatment signifies the changes in the OH bonding between Al and Fe ions present in the soil. The variation in pH decreased during the course of defluoridation. Higher F removal was noted when flow rate was lesser. An attempt on the regeneration of the fluoride adsorbed soil was also made and found to be effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3abicarbonates 3adefluoridation 3aelectrical conductivity 3afluorides 3aions 3airon 3apH 3apermeability 3aporosity 3asand 3asoil1 aManikandan, S.1 aRamanathan, AL.1 aPrasanna, M.

The overall aim of this review is to set the basis to model GWIs using deterministic approaches in contrast to empirical ones. If a better picture of chemicals and pollutant input and an improved understanding of hydrological and biogeochemical processes affecting these pollutants were known, GWIs could be designed to efficiently retain these pollutants for site-specific meteorological patterns and pollutant load. To this end, we surveyed the existing literature to retrieve a comprehensive dataset of anions and cations, and alkaline and transition metal pollutants incoming to urban environments. Based on this survey, we assessed the pollution load and ecological risk indexes for metals. The existing literature was then surveyed to review the metal retention efficiency of GWIs, and possible biogeochemical processes related to inorganic metal compounds were proposed that could be integrated in biogeochemical models of GWIs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3adata collection 3ahydrology 3ainfrastructure 3ametal ions 3ametals 3amodels 3apollutants 3apollution load 3arisk 3asurveys 3aurban areas 0aStormwater 0aStormwater control measures 0aWater sensitive urban design 0aMicropollutants 0aMetal cycle1 aDaly, Edoardo1 aMaggi, Federico0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 470-471 p.695-706dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245008500172300001800257520101300275592002801288650002701316650001401343650001101357650001101368650001901379650001001398650001401408650001701422650002401439650001501463650001101478651001001489700003101499700002701530700002201557700002301579773009201602856008601694852000901780655001201789IND4443121720221116185355.0141111e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444312172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoguerol-Pato, R.10aInfluence of tebuconazole residues on the aroma composition of Mencía red wines  ap. 1525-1532.  aTebuconazole is a triazole fungicide used in the treatment of diseases of vinification grapes. In this work, Mencía red grapes harvested in Valdeorras (Ourense, NW Spain) were used in three vinification experiments performed in an experimental cellar. Experiment A was conducted on uncontaminated crushed, destemmed grapes and involved inoculation with commercially available yeasts at the beginning of alcoholic fermentation. In experiments B and C, crushed, destemmed grapes were spiked with a pure standard of tebuconazole and inoculated with commercial yeasts (experiment B) or endogenous yeasts (experiment C). The main volatile compounds responsible for the aroma composition of the resulting wines were determined in order to evaluate the influence of tebuconazole residues on the outcome of the winemaking process. Terpene and higher-alcohol concentrations were essentially similar in the three wines; by contrast, C₆-alcohol, ester and aldehyde concentrations differed significantly between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcoholic fermentation 3aaldehydes 3aesters 3agrapes 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3ared wines 3atebuconazole 3atriazole fungicides 3awinemaking 3ayeasts 3aSpain1 aGonzález-Rodríguez, R.M.1 aGonzález-Barreiro, C.1 aCancho-Grande, B.1 aSimal-Gándara, J.0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 124, no. 4 p.1525-1532dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01621naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245009900207300001800306506007600324520036100400592002800761506003700789650002600826650001200852650001900864650002300883650001000906650002500916651001100941700002300952700001700975700002700992773012701019856008001146852000901226655001201235IND60117630320221207080411.0141126e20130228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011763032DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00219-122doi7 aPMC35879412pmcid7 a234693472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmarillas, Luis10aComplete Genome Sequence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 Bacteriophage phiJLA23 Isolated in Mexico  ap. e00219-12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe bacteriophage phiJLA23 was isolated from an animal feces sample and lytic activity was demonstrated against the Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain.

Added to this is the problem of leachates from the large number of industrial waste and overburden dumps that are in abundance in mining areas, reaching the ground water and adversely affecting its quality. Enhancement of heavy metals contamination of the ground water is one eventuality. In the present work, concentrations of 7 heavy metals have been evaluated at 20 important ground water sampling stations at Dhanbad township situated very near to Jharia coalfields. The concentration of heavy metals in general was found to be below the permissible levels although concentration of iron and manganese was found above the permissible limits at a few stations. These data have been used for the calculation of heavy metal pollution index (HPI). The HPI of ground water in total was found to be 6.8860 which is far below the critical index limit of 100 pointing to the fact that the ground water is not polluted with respect to heavy metals in spite of the prolific growth of mining and allied industrial activities near the town.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3agroundwater 3aheavy metals 3aindustrial wastes 3airon 3aleachates 3amanganese 3amining 3apollution 3awater quality 3awater table1 aKumari, Puja1 aBano, Shamima1 aKumari, Shweta0 tApplied water science.g2014 Mar., v. 4, no. 1 p.11-17dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-013-0126-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013800155300002000293520118100313592002801494650001101522650001101533650002501544650000901569650000901578650002201587650001301609650001401622650001801636650001901654650001401673650001801687650001801705650001601723700001201739700001501751700001801766700001501784773012501799856007401924852000901998655001202007IND60642134920221122061013.0190506e20170906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064213492DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08390d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ning10aFabrication of nanoporous copper with tunable ligaments and promising sonocatalytic performance by dealloying Cu–Y metallic glasses  ap. 43255-43265.  aNanoporous copper (NPC) with tunable ligaments was prepared by dealloying Cu–Y binary amorphous ribbons in sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) solution. The ligament size of the NPC sample synthesized by dealloying Cu₅₈Y₄₂ metallic glasses (237 nm) is much smaller than the one by dealloying Cu₇₂Y₂₈ (406 nm). This result reveals that the microstructure of NPC can be strongly influenced by the alloy composition of precursor alloys. Then, NPC with different microstructures were applied in the sono-catalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye. NPC produced by dealloying Cu₅₈Y₄₂ metallic glasses displayed superior sonocatalytic activity compared to commercial copper foil and the sample by dealloying Cu₇₂Y₂₈. The mechanism of the sono-Fenton-like process of NPC can be explained by being due to a combination of Cu ligament, H₂O₂ and ultrasound. In addition, the influence of the dealloying conditions (acid concentration, temperature and leaching time) on the ligament size of NPC was evaluated comprehensively, which could provide meaningful insight for further fabricating NPC with more desirable morphology and higher catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3adyes 3afoil 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaching 3aligaments 3amethyl orange 3amicrostructure 3ananopores 3asonocatalysis 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature1 aPan, Ye1 aWu, Shikai1 aZhang, Enming1 aDai, Weiji0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 06, v. 7, no. 68 p.43255-43265dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra08390d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245014100169300001600310520131300326592002801639650001201667650001301679650002601692650002401718650002801742650002901770650001501799650001701814650001001831650001301841650002101854650001801875650001301893650001301906650002301919650004301942650004501985650002402030650001702054650001202071650001902083653003102102653003002133653001402163653002602177653002302203653001802226700002002244700001602264700001702280773010602297856008702403852000902490655001202499IND60545499520221118224843.0160902e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054549952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Xi-En10aShifts in the abundance and community structure of soil ammonia oxidizers in a wet sclerophyll forest under long-term prescribed burning  ap. 578-586.  aFire shapes global biome distribution and promotes the terrestrial biogeochemical cycles. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) play a vital role in the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (N). However, behaviors of AOB and AOA under long-term prescribed burning remain unclear. This study was to examine how fire affected the abundances and communities of soil AOB and AOA. A long-term repeated forest fire experiment with three burning treatments (never burnt, B0; biennially burnt, B2; and quadrennially burnt, B4) was used in this study. The abundances and community structure of soil AOB and AOA were determined using quantitative PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism and clone library. More frequent fires (B2) increased the abundance of bacterium amoA gene, but tended to decrease archaeal amoA genes. Fire also modified the composition of AOA and AOB communities. Canonical correspondence analysis showed soil pH and dissolved organic C (DOC) strongly affected AOB genotypes, while nitrate-N and DOC shaped the AOA distribution. The increased abundance of bacterium amoA gene by fires may imply an important role of AOB in nitrification in fire-affected soils. The fire-induced shift in the community composition of AOB and AOA demonstrates that fire can disturb nutrient cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acommunity structure 3acorrespondence analysis 3adissolved organic carbon 3aecosystems 3aforest fires 3agenes 3agenotype 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aoxidants 3aprescribed burning 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asclerophyll forests 3asoil ecology 3asoil pH 3asoil structure 0aAmmonia-oxidizing bacteria 0aAmmonia-oxidizing archaea 0aAbundance 0aCommunity composition 0aPrescribed burning 0aNitrification1 aChen, Chengrong1 aXu, Zhihong1 aHe, Ji-zheng0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 470-471 p.578-586dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245011500207300001600322520113100338592002801469650001301497650002301510650002101533650001301554650000901567650002801576650001301604650002501617650001601642650001101658650002001669650000901689653001501698653001201713653001301725653002401738653003001762700001501792700001701807700001701824700005701841700002101898700001601919700001601935773011301951856008602064852000902150655001202159IND60607362920221119181636.0180831e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060736292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lehua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8865-380110aChemically activated graphite enhanced oxygen reduction and power output in catalyst-free microbial fuel cells  ap. 332-336.  aIn search of a cost effective cathode material for microbial fuel cells (MFCs), graphite was chemically treated with H3PO4, HNO3, ZnCl2, urea or melamine, and the effect of chemical activations on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was examined. The performance of MFCs with activated graphite as the catalyst-free cathodes was then compared to those with untreated graphite. Results suggested that H3PO4 and HNO3 activations could improved ORR, showing the highest ORR activity in graphite treated with 14.62 M H3PO4 for 12 h at 30–50 °C. MFCs with H3PO4 and HNO3 activated graphite cathodes generated maximum power densities (7.9 W/m³ and 6.5 W/m³, respectively) 2.4 and 1.8 times higher than that of the untreated control. The chemical activation process involves just a simple immersion step, and it does not require heating, electrochemical process or expensive chemicals. Therefore, it is a highly cost-effective approach to improve the performance of MFCs. We recommend an in-situ modification of graphite cathodes in scale-up MFCs with either H3PO4 or HNO3 to optimize MFCs' various industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3aheat 3aindustrial applications 3amelamine 3amicrobial fuel cells 3anitric acid 3aoxygen 3aphosphoric acid 3aurea 0aActivation 0aCathode 0aGraphite 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aOxygen reduction reaction1 aLu, Zhihao1 aLi, Dongmei,1 aMa, Jingxing1 aSong, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0639-12871 aHuang, Guangtuan1 aLiu, Yongdi1 aCai, Lankun0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 115 p.332-336dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245013400172300001600306520138400322536047801706592002802184650001502212650001302227650002302240650002002263650001502283650001502298650002502313650000902338650001602347650001002363700003502373700001802408700002602426700001802452700006302470700006402533773011202597856008002709852000902789655001202798IND60700426620221120122900.0200630e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070042662DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217209202522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Caroline R.10aBarriers and Facilitators of National Diabetes Prevention Program Engagement Among Women of Childbearing Age: A Qualitative Study  ap. 279-288.  aThe purpose of this study was to understand barriers and facilitators to engagement in a diabetes prevention program for young women at an urban safety-net health care system. Individual semistructured interviews (N = 29) explored motivations, challenges, and successes regarding participation and suggestions for improvement among women aged 18 to 39 years who enrolled in the National Diabetes Prevention Program in the past 2 years. Participants were classified as nonattendees (n = 10), early-withdrawers (n = 9), or completers (n = 10). Interview transcriptions were analyzed using a grounded hermeneutic editing approach. Qualitative analysis revealed 4 main themes (enrollment, attendance, experience, and suggestions) with multiple subthemes. Most women were motivated to enroll for health and family concerns. Early-withdrawers and nonattendees reported confusion about the program’s aim and relevancy, logistical barriers, and lack of connection with fellow participants/coaches. Highly engaged women noted persistent motivation, perceived weight loss, and supportive program relationships. Multiple barriers/facilitators for young women appear addressable in future adaptations. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings in other settings and explore implementation and effectiveness of adaptations, with a goal of reducing risks prior to conception.  aFunding: This work was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: State Public Health Actions to Prevent and Control Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity and Associated Risk Factors and Promote School Health (DP13-1305) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

High climate vulnerability and rapid socioeconomic change often characterize developing country contexts, making DMUU approaches relevant. We develop an iterative multi‐method DMUU approach, including scenario generation, coproduction with stakeholders and water resources modeling. We apply this approach to explore the robustness of adaptation options and pathways against future climate and socioeconomic uncertainties in the Cauvery River Basin in Karnataka, India. A water resources model is calibrated and validated satisfactorily using observed streamflow. Plausible future changes in Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) precipitation and water demand are used to drive simulations of water resources from 2021 to 2055. Two stakeholder‐identified decision‐critical metrics are examined: a basin‐wide metric comprising legal instream flow requirements for the downstream state of Tamil Nadu, and a local metric comprising water supply reliability to Bangalore city. In model simulations, the ability to satisfy these performance metrics without adaptation is reduced under almost all scenarios. Implementing adaptation options can partially offset the negative impacts of change. Sequencing of options according to stakeholder priorities into Adaptation Pathways affects metric satisfaction. Early focus on agricultural demand management improves the robustness of pathways but trade‐offs emerge between intrabasin and basin‐wide water availability. We demonstrate that the fine balance between water availability and demand is vulnerable to future changes and uncertainty. Despite current and long‐term planning challenges, stakeholders in developing countries may engage meaningfully in coproduction approaches for adaptation decision‐making under deep uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data  aES/K006576/1cUK Economic and Social Research Council  cCentre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP) 3aclimate 3adecision making 3amonsoon season 3aresearch 3astakeholders 3astream flow 3auncertainty 3awater 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aConway, Declan1 aDessai, Suraje1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7879-93641 aStainforth, David A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6476-733X0 tWater resources research.g2018 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.708-728dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR0209703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245015200207300001600359520144200375592002801817650001801845650002001863650001901883650002301902650001401925650002601939650001701965650002501982650001402007650004302021650001702064650001802081650002502099650001902124650001002143700001802153700002502171700002102196700006002217700002002277773011202297856008002409852000902489655001202498IND60700426720221120123012.0200630e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070042672DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217209202552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngol, Taniqua T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4106-215510aPerceived Barriers to Type 2 Diabetes Prevention for Low-Income Women With a History of Gestational Diabetes: A Qualitative Secondary Data Analysis  ap. 271-278.  aThe purpose of this qualitative study was to examine perceived barriers to adoption of lifestyle changes for type 2 diabetes prevention among a diverse group of low-income women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A secondary data analysis of 10 semistructured focus group discussions was conducted. Participants were low-income African American, Hispanic, and Appalachian women ages 18 to 45 years who were diagnosed with GDM in the past 10 years. A qualitative content analysis was conducted to identify key themes that emerged within and between groups. Four key themes emerged on the role of knowledge, affordability, accessibility, and social support in type 2 diabetes prevention. Women discussed a lack of awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding and type 2 diabetes prevention, inaccessibility of resources in their local communities to help them engage in lifestyle change, and the desire for more culturally relevant education on healthful food options and proper portion sizes. Study findings suggests that to improve effectiveness of type 2 diabetes prevention efforts among low-income women with GDM history, health care providers and public health practitioners should avoid using “one-size-fits-all” approaches to lifestyle change and instead use tailored interventions that address the cultural and environmental factors that impact women’s ability to engage in recommended behavior change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3abehavior change 3abreast feeding 3adiabetes educators 3aeducation 3aenvironmental factors 3afocus groups 3agestational diabetes 3alifestyle 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aportion size 3apublic health 3aqualitative analysis 3asocial support 3awomen1 aKue, Jennifer1 aConrey, Elizabeth J.1 aOza-Frank, Reena1 aWeber, Mary Beth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2804-39481 aBower, Julie K.0 tDiabetes educator.g2020 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.271-278dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217209202553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04781naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003800135040001800173100003400191245012000225506007600345520234400421592002802765506003702793650003202830650002002862650001602882650001902898650002702917650001602944650001702960650001902977650001702996650002003013650001903033650002203052650002203074650001203096650001603108650001703124650001203141650001203153650001603165650002403181650001703205650001703222650000903239650001103248650001303259650002003272650001403292650001503306650001403321650001203335650001303347650002103360650001603381653000703397653001003404653000803414653000803422653000803430653000803438653000903446653000903455653003203464653001903496653001703515653001603532653001503548653002303563700005703586700002003643700002403663700002103687773011303708856008503821852000903906655001203915IND60634316420221207084405.0210124e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063431642DNAL7 aPMC70340162pmcid7 a320956132pmid7 a10.1016/j.fawpar.2019.e000402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLundström-Stadelmann, Britta14aThe importance of being parasiticidal… an update on drug development for the treatment of alveolar echinococcosis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe lethal disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by the metacestode stage of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Current chemotherapeutical treatment of AE relies on albendazole and mebendazole, with the caveat that these compounds are not parasiticidal. Drugs have to be taken for a prolonged period of time, often life-long, which can cause adverse effects and reduces the patients' quality of life. In some individuals, benzimidazoles are inactive or cause toxicity, leading to treatment discontinuation. Alternatives to benzimidazoles are urgently needed. Over the recent years, in vivo and in vitro models for low-to-medium throughput drug discovery against AE have been set in place. In vitro drug tests include the phosphoglucose-isomerase (PGI) assay to measure physical damage induced to metacestodes, and viability assays to assess parasiticidal activity against metacestodes and stem cells. In vitro models are also employed for studies on mechanisms of action. In vivo models are thus far based on rodents, mainly mice, and benefits could be gained in future by comparative approaches in naturally infected dogs or captive monkeys.For the identification of novel drugs against AE, a rare disease with a low expected market return, drug-repurposing is the most promising strategy. A variety of chemically synthesized compounds as well as natural products have been analyzed with respect to in vitro and/or in vivo activities against AE. We here review and discuss the most active of these compounds including anti-infective compounds (benzimidazoles, nitazoxanide, amphotericin B, itraconazole, clarithromycin, DB1127, and buparvaquone), the anti-infective anti-malarials (artemisinin, ozonids, mefloquine, and MMV665807) and anti-cancer drugs (isoflavones, 2-methoxyestradiol, methotrexate, navelbine, vincristine, kinase inhibitors, metallo-organic ruthenium complexes, bortezomib, and taxanes). Taking into account the efficacy as well as the potential availability for patients, the most promising candidates are new formulations of benzimidazoles and mefloquine. Future drug-repurposing approaches should also target the energy metabolism of E. multilocularis, in particular the understudied malate dismutation pathway, as this offers an essential target in the parasite, which is not present in mammals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aadverse effects 3aalbendazole 3aamphotericin B 3aanimal use replacement 3aartemisinin 3abuparvaquone 3aclarithromycin 3adog diseases 3adrug evaluation 3aechinococcosis 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzymes 3aisoflavones 3aitraconazole 3amalates 3amarkets 3amebendazole 3amechanism of action 3ametacestodes 3amethotrexate 3amice 3amodels 3apatients 3aquality of life 3aruthenium 3astem cells 3atapeworms 3ataxanes 3atoxicity 3aviability assays 3avincristine 0aAE 0aSPEMs 0aABZ 0aMBZ 0aPGI 0aMMV 0a2-ME 0aMAPK 0aEchinococcus multilocularis 0aDrug treatment 0aChemotherapy 0aAlbendazole 0aMefloquine 0aMalate dismutation1 aRufener, Reto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5952-75851 aRitler, Dominic1 aZurbriggen, Raphael1 aHemphill, Andrew0 tFood and Waterborne Parasitology.g2019 June, v. 15 p.e00040-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23307x2405-67667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fawpar.2019.e000403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245016300174300001600337520204600353592002802399650002102427650001202448650001902460650001102479650001802490650001302508650001102521700002402532700002102556773009402577856005502671852000902726655001202735IND4478353120221121160147.0120824e199804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447835312DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-313X.1998.00102.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaughlin, Mary J.10aNâ and Câterminal peptide sequences are essential for enzyme assembly, allosteric, and/or catalytic properties of ADPâglucose pyrophosphorylase  ap. 159-168.  aADPâglucose pyrophosphorylase is a key regulatory enzyme in starch synthesis in most plant tissues. Unlike the allosteric regulatory dependent properties of the leaf enzyme, the enzymes from nonâphotosynthetic tissues exhibit varying levels of sensitivity to allosteric regulation, a behavior which may be an inherent property of the enzyme or a product of postâtranslational modification. As partial proteolysis of the holoenzyme may account for the wide variation of allosteric regulatory behavior exhibited by enzymes from nonâphotosynthetic tissues, small Nâ and Câterminal peptide deletions were made on either the potato large and small subunit and coâexpressed with the counterpart wildâtype subunit in Escherichia coli. Removal of the putative carboxyâterminal allosteric binding region from either subunit type results in an abolishment of enzyme formation indicating that the carboxy terminus of each subunit type is essential for proper subunit folding and/or enzyme assembly as well as its suggested role in allosteric regulation. Removal of a small 10 amino acid peptide from the Nâterminus of the small subunit increased its resistance to the allosteric inhibitor Pi as well as its sensitivity to heat treatment. Likewise, removal of the corresponding peptide (17 residues) at the Nâterminus of the large subunit also increased its resistance towards Pi inhibition but, in addition, increased its sensitivity to 3âPGA activation. Deletion of an additional 11 residues reversed these changes in allosteric properties but at the expense of a reduced catalytic turnover rate. Combined, these results indicate that the Nâ and Câterminal regions are essential for the proper catalytic and allosteric regulatory properties of the potato ADPâglucose pyrophosphorylase. The possible significance of these results on the observed insensitivity to effector molecules by ADPâglucose pyrophosphorylases from other nonâphotosynthetic tissues is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aenzymes 3aheat treatment 3aleaves 3aplant tissues 3apotatoes 3astarch1 aChantler, Sue Ellen1 aOkita, Thomas W.0 tplant journal.g1998 Apr., v. 14, no. 2 p.159-168dBlackwell Science Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1998.00102.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245012200162300001600284500002000300520145100320592002801771650001701799650001001816650001601826650001501842650001901857650001001876650001101886650001401897650001301911650001501924650002501939650002701964650001901991700002002010700002202030700002702052700002102079700002102100700002102121773008902142856007202231852000902303655001202312IND60571244020221118051701.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057124402DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.16542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerren, Cristina M.10aPositive feedback between chironomids and algae creates net mutualism between benthic primary consumers and producers  ap. 447-455.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe chironomids of Lake Mývatn show extreme population fluctuations that affect most aspects of the lake ecosystem. During periods of high chironomid densities, chironomid larvae comprise over 90% of aquatic secondary production. Here, we show that chironomid larvae substantially stimulate benthic gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP), despite consuming benthic algae. Benthic GPP in experimental mesocosms with 140,000 larvae/m² was 71% higher than in mesocosms with no larvae. Similarly, chlorophyll a concentrations in mesocosms increased significantly over the range of larval densities. Furthermore, larvae showed increased growth rates at higher densities, possibly due to greater benthic algal availability in these treatments. We investigated the hypothesis that larvae promote benthic algal growth by alleviating nutrient limitation, and found that (1) larvae have the potential to cycle the entire yearly external loadings of nitrogen and phosphorus during the growing season, and (2) chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly greater in close proximity to larvae (on larval tubes). The positive feedback between chironomid larvae and benthic algae generated a net mutualism between the primary consumer and primary producer trophic levels in the benthic ecosystem. Thus, our results give an example in which unexpected positive feedbacks can lead to both high primary and high secondary production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aalgae 3achlorophyll 3aecosystems 3agrowing season 3alakes 3alarvae 3amutualism 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aprimary productivity 3asecondary productivity 3atrophic levels1 aWebert, Kyle C.1 aDrake, Michael D.1 aJake Vander Zanden, M.1 aEinarsson, Árni1 aIves, Anthony R.1 aGratton, Claudio0 tEcology.g2017 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.447-455dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.16543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245008800211300001400299520096000313592002801273650000801301650000801309650001901317650001101336650002501347650001301372650001701385650001301402650001301415650001501428653003301443653002201476653001001498653001501508700002001523700001901543700001901562773010401581856008401685852000901769655001201778IND60561555520221117104424.0180905e20170223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056155552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2017.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThurgood, Lauren A1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6183-279710aFrom genome to proteome: Looking beyond DNA and RNA in chronic lymphocytic leukemia  ap. 73-84.  aChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains the most common leukemia in the Western world. Whilst its disease course is extremely heterogeneous (ranging from indolent to aggressive), current methods are unable to accurately predict the clinical journey of each patient. There is clearly a pressing need for both improved prognostication and treatment options for patients with this disease. Whilst molecular studies have analyzed both genetic mutations and gene expression profiles of these malignant B-cells, and as a result have shed light on the pathogenesis of CLL, proteomic studies have been largely overlooked to date. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the proteomics of CLL, and discusses some of the issues in CLL proteomic research, such as reproducibility and data interpretation. In addition, we look ahead to how proteomics may significantly help in the development of a successful treatment for this currently incurable disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3adisease course 3agenome 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amutation 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aproteome 3aproteomics 0aChronic lymphocytic leukemia 0aMass spectrometry 0aMEC-1 0aProteomics1 aChataway, Tim K1 aLower, Karen M1 aKuss, Bryone J0 tJournal of proteomics.g2017 Feb. 23, v. 155 p.73-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006700146245021200213300001600425520177400441536020802215592002802423650002002451650002802471650003002499650001202529650001802541650001702559650001402576650001502590650001302605650002002618650002002638650003102658650001202689650001602701653003502717653003002752653001702782700002102799700002102820700001702841700001402858773011502872856008002987852000903067655001203076IND60700426920221120133132.0200630e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070042692DNAL7 a10.1177/02601060209090472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLærum-Onsager, Ellisiv1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9097-610010aAssociations between health-related quality of life, body mass index, health status and sociodemographic variables in geriatric patients and non-hospitalized older people: A comparative cross-sectional study  ap. 141-150.  aData on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in geriatric patients and non-hospitalized older people are lacking, and the associations among HRQoL, body mass index (BMI) and health status are not sufficiently investigated in these groups. This study aims to describe and compare HRQoL in a sample of geriatric patients and non-hospitalized people >70 years. It further aims to investigate the associations between HRQoL, BMI, health status and sociodemographic variables in geriatric patients and non-hospitalized people >70 years. This cross-sectional study included 107 geriatric patients and 328 non-hospitalized older people. HRQoL was measured with the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and BMI was divided into three classes: underweight (<22 kg/m²), normal weight (22–27 kg/m²) and overweight (>27 kg/m²). All SF-36 scores were lower for the geriatric patients than for the non-hospitalized people (p < .001). Underweight (BMI <22 kg/m²) was registered for 43.9% of the geriatric patients and for 13.7% of the non-hospitalized people. No significant associations were found between the SF-36 subscale scores and underweight, but overweight was associated with lower scores on physical functioning (B: –8.7) and vitality (B: –6.8) compared to those with normal BMI (p < .05). The participants with rheumatic diseases, pulmonary diseases, hypertension and digestive diseases had significantly lower scores on most SF-36 scales reflecting physical health. HRQoL is substantially lower in geriatric patients than in non-hospitalized older people. The negative effects of both overweight and morbidity on HRQoL indicate that it is important to monitor weight and disease symptoms to promote HRQoL in older people, whether hospitalized or non-hospitalized.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was fully supported by Oslo Metropolitan University.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adigestive system diseases 3aelderly 3ahealth status 3ahypertension 3amorbidity 3aoverweight 3apatients 3aphysical health 3aquality of life 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asurveys 3aunderweight 0aHealth-related quality of life 0a36-Item Short Form Survey 0aolder adults1 aBrovold, Therese1 aBergland, Astrid1 aPripp, Are H1 aBye, Asta0 tNutrition and health.g2020 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.141-150dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x2047-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02601060209090473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014700162300002000309520131700329592002801646650002601674650001701700650002201717650001601739650002401755650000901779650001601788650001501804650001601819650001501835650004301850650001201893650001901905650002401924650002701948650001701975650001801992650002902010650001602039650001702055650002102072700002602093700002102119700002102140773012502161856007402286852000902360655001202369IND60642135320221122061025.0190506e20170928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064213532DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08398j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMostafa, Aziza E.10aSimultaneous determination of selected veterinary antibiotics in Nile tilapia (Orechromis niloticus) and water samples by HPLC/UV and LC-MS/MS  ap. 46171-46182.  aA method was optimized and validated for simultaneous estimation of some antibiotics such as chlortetracycline (CTC), doxycycline (DOX), florfenicol (FF), flumequine (FLU), nalidixic acid (NAL), sulfadiazine (SDI), sulfathiazole (STZ) and trimethoprim (TMP) in fish muscle and water samples. The method is based on solid phase extraction (SPE) and simple extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The HPLC method was optimized using experimental design. The optimum conditions for separation determined with the aid of central composite design were: (1) initial mobile phase concentration: 0.1% formic acid in water/acetonitrile (90/10, v/v), (2) column temperature 25 °C and (3) mobile phase flow rate (1.2 ml min⁻¹). The optimized method was validated according to ICH guidelines. The detection and quantification limits were between 0.2–0.4 and 0.3–0.6 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, for fish and between 0.005–0.02 and 0.01–0.08 μg ml⁻¹, respectively, for water. The procedure was also applied to the analysis of spiked Nile tilapia samples. Three antibiotics (SDI, CTC and FF) were orally administered and the residue was analyzed using liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization-mass spectrometry with positive ion mode (LC-ESI/MS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aacetonitrile 3achlortetracycline 3adoxycycline 3aexperimental design 3afish 3aflorfenicol 3aflumequine 3aformic acid 3aguidelines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amuscles 3analidixic acid 3aoral administration 3asolid phase extraction 3asulfadiazine 3asulfathiazole 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 3atrimethoprim 3aveterinary drugs1 aAbdel Salam, Randa A.1 aHadad, Ghada M.1 aEissa, Ismail A.0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 28, v. 7, no. 73 p.46171-46182dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra08398j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245010400172300001600276520175000292536012102042592002802163650002402191650002802215650002302243650002302266650002602289650001702315650002402332650002402356650002302380650001502403650001502418650002202433650001902455650002402474650002002498650001902518651001302537653002802550653001602578700006502594773011502659856008002774852000902854655001202863IND60700427020221119075043.0200630e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070042702DNAL7 a10.1177/02601060209106252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuderedzwa, Tavonga M10aNutritional status, physical activity and associated nutrition knowledge of primary school learners  ap. 115-125.  aNutrition education has the potential to improve eating habits, physical activity and nutritional status of schoolchildren. This study aimed to determine the nutritional status, physical activity levels and the associated nutrition knowledge of primary school learners aged 9–14 years in Harare, Zimbabwe. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among learners (n = 368) from eight primary schools. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic, nutrition knowledge and physical activity data. The weights and heights were measured using World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Pearson chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used to assess association between categorical variables. Binary logistic regression was used to explore the determinants of wasting and overweight. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Overweight, wasting and stunting affected 25.8%, 6.3% and 3% of the learners, respectively. Only 52.7% of the learners achieved the WHO recommended 60 minutes of physical activity. The mean±standard deviation nutrition knowledge score of the learners was 70.3±10.9%. Stunted children were more likely to be wasted (odds ratio (OR) = 4.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–17.8; p = 0.039). Inadequate dietary diversity score (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.22–0.87; p = 0.018) and using non-active forms of transportation (OR = 2.69; 95% CI 1.52–4.76; p = 0.001) were a significant predictor of overweight among the learners. Overweight was the leading form of malnutrition, coexisting with undernutrition, reflecting the presence of a ‘double burden of malnutrition’. Therefore, comprehensive and multi-sectoral interventions to improve healthy eating and physical activity are warranted.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aelementary schools 3agrowth retardation 3ahealthy eating habits 3amalnutrition 3anutrition education 3anutrition knowledge 3anutritional status 3aodds ratio 3aoverweight 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3aschool children 3atransportation 3aZimbabwe 0aPrimary school learners 0aperceptions1 aMatsungo, Tonderayi M1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9836-77800 tNutrition and health.g2020 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.115-125dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x2047-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02601060209106253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015600153300002000309520094000329592002801269650004401297650002201341650003701363650002401400650001401424650002001438650002101458650001701479650003901496650002101535650002401556650000901580650000901589650001301598650003701611650003701648700001201685700001401697700001601711700001701727773012501744856007401869852000901943655001201952IND60642135420221122085216.0190506e20170912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064213542DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08400e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Peng10aHydrothermal synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots from microcrystalline cellulose for the detection of Fe³⁺ ions in an acidic environment  ap. 44144-44153.  aNitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) have been synthesized by the hydrothermal method with microcrystalline cellulose as carbon source and ethylenediamine as nitrogen dopant. The synthesized NCQDs were characterized by FT-IR, TEM, XPS, UV-vis, XRD and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. It was found that nitrogen species were efficiently doped into the carbon framework of the CQDs. The obtained NCQDs were spherical particles with an average diameter of 3.2 nm. Furthermore, the NCQDs showed better fluorescence emission properties and higher quantum yield in acidic solution than CQDs. When used as a fluorescent probe for Fe³⁺ detection via fluorescent quenching, high selectivity and sensitivity were achieved, and the limit of detection of Fe³⁺ was as low as 0.21 nM in the acidic environment. The quenching process of NCQDs by Fe³⁺ was proved to be a dynamic quenching by using fluorescence decay times analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon quantum dots 3acellulose 3adetection limit 3aethylenediamines 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3ahot water treatment 3aions 3airon 3anitrogen 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aLi, Wei1 aWu, Qiong1 aLiu, Yushan1 aLiu, Shouxin0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 12, v. 7, no. 70 p.44144-44153dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra08400e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010200157300002000259520132900279592002801608650001601636650001101652650002301663650002501686650002101711650001901732650001501751650001701766650002401783650001801807650002101825650001101846650001701857650002401874650002101898700001801919700001801937700001701955773012501972856007402097852000902171655001202180IND60642135520221122061018.0190506e20170929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064213552DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08402a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Guixiang10aFacile fabrication of hierarchical porous carbon for a high-performance electrochemical capacitor  ap. 46329-46335.  aThe template method is often used to synthesize porous materials. However, removing the template during post-processing is difficult and harsh reagents are frequently used, which is unfavorable for the carbon structure. In this paper, a facile and green synthesis route is developed for the synthesis of a 3D honeycomb-like hierarchical porous carbon based on rapid thermal decomposition of the mixture of a low-cost carbon precursor (typically starch) and Na₂CO₃ followed by KOH activation, in which Na₂CO₃ particles are employed as the water-soluble renewable macroporous template. Benefiting from the high specific surface area (1171 m² g⁻¹) and the interconnected micro-, meso-, and macropores, the porous carbon exhibits superior capacitive performance, including high specific capacitance, good rate capability and excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the porous carbon-based symmetric supercapacitor delivers a maximum energy density of 33 W h kg⁻¹ at 100 W kg⁻¹ and presents excellent long-term cycling stability. Considering the easy-availability of the raw materials and the facile synthesis process, this environmentally friendly and cost-effective method can be expected to be widely applied, and we estimate that the obtained porous carbon could find additional applications in other fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy density 3amacropores 3aporous media 3apotassium hydroxide 3araw materials 3asodium carbonate 3astarch 3asurface area 3athermal degradation 3awater solubility1 aBian, Qiuxiao1 aZhang, Jingbo1 aYang, Xinhui0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 29, v. 7, no. 73 p.46329-46335dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra08402a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245009100163300001600254500002000270520160400290592002801894650001401922650001201936650001301948650001901961650002101980650001502001650001502016650002502031650001902056650001102075650001402086650001502100650000902115650001302124650002202137650001602159650002302175700002302198700002102221700001902242773008902261856007202350852000902422655001202431IND60571244320221118051601.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057124432DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.16582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeldhuis, Michiel P.10aTermites promote resistance of decomposition to spatiotemporal variability in rainfall  ap. 467-477.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe ecological impact of rapid environmental change will depend on the resistance of key ecosystems processes, which may be promoted by species that exert strong control over local environmental conditions. Recent theoretical work suggests that macrodetritivores increase the resistance of African savanna ecosystems to changing climatic conditions, but experimental evidence is lacking. We examined the effect of large fungus‐growing termites and other non‐fungus‐growing macrodetritivores on decomposition rates empirically with strong spatiotemporal variability in rainfall and temperature. Non‐fungus‐growing larger macrodetritivores (earthworms, woodlice, millipedes) promoted decomposition rates relative to microbes and small soil fauna (+34%) but both groups reduced their activities with decreasing rainfall. However, fungus‐growing termites increased decomposition rates strongest (+123%) under the most water‐limited conditions, making overall decomposition rates mostly independent from rainfall. We conclude that fungus‐growing termites are of special importance in decoupling decomposition rates from spatiotemporal variability in rainfall due to the buffered environment they create within their extended phenotype (mounds), that allows decomposition to continue when abiotic conditions outside are less favorable. This points at a wider class of possibly important ecological processes, where soil‐plant‐animal interactions decouple ecosystem processes from large‐scale climatic gradients. This may strongly alter predictions from current climate change models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplopoda 3aIsopoda 3aIsoptera 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aearthworms 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3arain 3asavannas 3aspatial variation 3atemperature 3atemporal variation1 aLaso, Francisco J.1 aOlff, H.q(Han),1 aBerg, Matty P.0 tEcology.g2017 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.467-477dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.16583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245008200210300001400292520156500306592002801871650002401899650002901923650002401952650002301976650002501999650001702024650001902041650001902060650001302079650001502092650002002107650001402127650001502141650002402156653002502180653001902205653001102224653002302235653000802258700005502266700001902321700002102340700006202361700006402423773010102487856008502588852000902673655001202682IND60612292820221119031522.0190415e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061229282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPechanec, Vilém1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6728-664610aModelling of the carbon sequestration and its prediction under climate change  ap. 50-54.  aThe aim of the presented study is to quantify the total carbon stock of habitats in addition the estimation of aboveground and belowground biomass, necromass, and soil organic carbon. Prediction of carbon storage under climate change is based on future land-use changes, identification of new land-use distribution, and evaluation of changes in human impacts on biomass production and carbon storage. Widely used InVEST model was applied to determine the existing carbon stocks and the amount of carbon captured over time. Changes in the carbon storage were calculated from aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, necromass, and soil organic carbon pools. The original model was modified to vector space to better identify land heterogeneity. The values of the four carbon pools for individual land-use categories were derived from literature and experimental investigation. Land Change Modeller was then used to model future land use by applying business-as-usual scenario on data derived from 1990, 2000, 2006, and 2012 Corine Land Cover data. In this contribution, land cover predictions are calculated using three CORDEX climate models and two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Results describe current carbon stock by basic carbon pools and prediction of the total amount of carbon stored in four reservoirs in three time period. Results show that the difference in predictions between specific scenarios in each period is increasing and in all predictions, roughly the same proportional carbon ratio is maintained between the individual stocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aanthropogenic activities 3abelowground biomass 3abiomass production 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3aland use change 3anecromass 3aprediction 3asoil organic carbon 0aCarbon sequestration 0aClimate change 0aInVEST 0aLand use modelling 0aGIS1 aPurkyt, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2805-99901 aBenc, Antonín1 aNwaogu, Chukwudi1 aŠtěrbová, Lenka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1181-56731 aCudlin, P.q(Pavel),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1464-51600 tEcological informatics.g2018 Sept., v. 47 p.50-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245004400207300001400251520100900265592002801274650002501302650001501327650002201342650001601364650001301380650001301393653000701406653000701413653001001420653000801430653000701438653001501445653001101460653000901471653000901480653000901489653000901498653000901507653001101516653000901527653000801536653001001544653000801554653000801562653000901570653003901579653001801618653002201636653002801658653002901686653001401715700002001729773007201749856008201821852000901903655001201912IND60552423620221117191611.0161021e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055242362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2014.07.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBukvić, Nenad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1119-144210aGenetics in the art and art in genetics  ap. 14-22.  a“Healing is best accomplished when art and science are conjoined, when body and spirit are probed together”, says Bernard Lown, in his book “The Lost Art of Healing”.Art has long been a witness to disease either through diseases which affected artists or diseases afflicting objects of their art. In particular, artists have often portrayed genetic disorders and malformations in their work. Sometimes genetic disorders have mystical significance; other times simply have intrinsic interest.Recognizing genetic disorders is also an art form. From the very beginning of my work as a Medical Geneticist I have composed personal “algorithms” to piece together evidence of genetics syndromes and diseases from the observable signs and symptoms.In this paper we apply some ‘gestalt’ Genetic Syndrome Diagnostic algorithms to virtual patients found in some art masterpieces. In some the diagnosis is clear and in others the artists' depiction only supports a speculative differential diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aalgorithms 3agenetic disorders 3ageneticists 3agenetics 3apatients 0aAS 0aDS 0aUBE3A 0aPWS 0aNS 0aRAS–MAPK 0aPTPN11 0aSOS1 0aRAF1 0aKRAS 0aNRAS 0aBRAF 0aSHOCK2 0aMEK1 0aCBL 0aFGFR3 0aGly 0aArg 0aCOMP 0aGenetics and painting masterpieces 0aDown syndrome 0aAngelman syndrome 0aPrader–Willi syndrome 0aNoonan syndrome dwarfism 0aAkhenaten1 aElling, John W.0 tGene.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 555 p.14-22dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.07.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014400159300002000303520059200323592002800915650001100943650001400954650002100968650002100989650001701010650001801027650001101045650001401056650001301070650002001083650002301103700001501126700001401141700001901155700001901174700002001193700001601213700001801229700001901247773012401266856007401390852000901464655001201473IND60642135720221122085215.0190506e20171205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064213572DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08405f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kuan-Wen10aRapid crystal growth of bimetallic PdPt nanocrystals with surface atomic Pt cluster decoration provides promising oxygen reduction activity  ap. 55110-55120.  aCarbon nanotube-supported bimetallic Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with atomic Pt cluster surface decoration (the mole ratio of Pt/Pd is 0.1) are synthesized by a wet chemical method with sodium borohydride as the reducing agent.

Results of resistivity survey validated with borehole lithology gave us a clear picture of the geological signature of the aquifers, which support the reducing nature of the aquifer where concentration of arsenic was high. Reducing nature of the aquifer environment was shown by water samples having relatively negative Eh value. From XRD study of the soil samples, it was found that goethite, dolomite, calcite, quartz and feldspar are the major minerals for most of the samples. Output of this work concludes that resistivity survey is an economically feasible tool which can be successfully used to target arsenic-safe aquifers on wide scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3acalcite 3adolomite 3aeconomic feasibility 3afeldspar 3ageochemistry 3ageophysics 3agoethite 3aquartz 3asoil sampling 3asurveys 3aIndia1 aRam Avtar,1 aKumar, Alok1 aSingh, Chander Kumar1 aTripathi, Parijat1 aSenthil Kumar, G.1 aRamanathan, A.

The most recent version of the model includes the partitioning of all components between a solvent-rich phase and an asphaltene-rich phase, where the solvents are pure components with known properties and the crude oil is represented as pseudo-components defined on the basis of a saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene (SARA) assay. The molecular weight, density, and solubility parameter of each pseudo-component are determined from correlations. This model is sensitive to uncertainties in the SARA assay composition and is not compatible with the standard phase behavior modeling methodology based on pseudo-components defined from a distillation assay. In this contribution, the model was extended to crude oil pseudo-components based on boiling cuts (TBP). The n-pentane-insoluble asphaltene fraction was characterized in the same way as the SARA-based model. The molecular weight and density of the TBP-based pseudo-components were predicted from well-established correlations. New correlations were proposed for the maltene pseudo-component solubility parameters as a function of the temperature and pressure. The TBP-based model was tested on two data sets: (1) onsets, yields, and phase compositions for a Western Canada bitumen mixed with n-alkanes from propane to n-heptane at temperatures and pressures up to 250 °C and 13.8 MPa, respectively, and (2) yields from eight oils from different geographical regions mixed with n-alkanes from n-pentane to n-octane at temperatures and pressures up to 100 °C and 6.8 MPa, respectively. The overall absolute deviation was 2 wt % for both data sets, similar to the deviations found for the SARA-based model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasphaltenes 3abitumen 3adistillation 3aenergy 3aheptane 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aoctane 3apentane 3apetroleum 3apropane 3asolubility 3atemperature 3aCanada1 aSantos, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5444-80951 aYarranton, H.

The results showed that the biosorption ratio decreased approximately 10%, 60%, and 70% for ester group, carboxyl group, and amino group modified yeast cells, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and surface functional group potentiometric titration results revealed that –NH₂, –COOH, and –OH were the major binding groups. The amino group displayed the greatest contribution to biosorption of strontium ions, followed by the carboxyl group and, finally, the ester group. Electrostatic interaction was the initial role and establishment of a coordination complex was the most common mechanism of interface interaction between strontium ions and the yeast cell surface. Mesoscopic analysis suggested that strontium ions may be first adsorbed on the cell surface and then transported into the cytoplasm. Transmembrane transport and the bioaccumulation model revealed that yeast cells may regulate the distribution of strontium ions through a transportation mechanism. A detailed interface interaction was discussed for S. cerevisiae biosorption of low concentration strontium ions under culture conditions. The results suggested that optimal biosorption for a microorganism relies upon enrichment of proteins and polysaccharides on the cell surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abioaccumulation 3abiosorption 3acoordination compounds 3acytoplasm 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aions 3amodels 3amoieties 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3astrontium 3atitration 3ayeasts1 aDong, Faqin1 aZhang, Wei1 aNie, Xiaoqin1 aWei, Hongfu1 aSun, Shiyong1 aZhong, Xiaomei1 aLiu, Yuqi1 aWang, Danni0 tRSC advances.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 7, no. 80 p.50880-50888dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra08416a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245005200172300001600224520219100240592002802431650002502459650002202484650002102506650002502527650001102552650001302563650002602576650002702602650001102629650000702640650001802647650001402665650000902679650002802688650000902716653001102725653002702736653001602763653002702779700001902806700002502825773011302850856008602963852000903049655001203058IND60607364020221119181750.0180831e20160310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060736402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocchetti, Laura10aRecovery of indium from liquid crystal displays  ap. 299-305.  aIndium is a critical raw material with economic importance and high supply risk.

Almost all the indium present in the leaching solution passed to the solid phase when cementation was performed with a low (2–5 g/L), a medium (15–20 g/L) and a high (100 g/L) concentration of zinc, at pH 3. At pH 2, a complete cementation was obtained only with the highest concentration of zinc. Moreover, the highest purity of the indium product (62% indium percentage in the solid product, calculated in the 4-metal system indium-aluminum-calcium-iron) was achieved after a cementation of 10 min, whereas the presence of impurities increased with time. An empirical model successfully fitted the experimental data and suggested that the highest purity of the cemented product was expected at pH 2. A quantification of the environmental impact of the process for indium recovery from end-of-life liquid crystal display panels was also carried out through a life cycle analysis approach, and it outlined that relevant benefits to the environment were obtained thanks to the recovery of indium from waste electric and electronic equipment. The results obtained in the present study are promising since this is the first time that cementation was applied to a leaching solution of waste liquid crystal display panels. In this paper we found that indium cementation took place also with low concentrations of zinc at pH 3, allowing important reagent saving. Investigations in progress are aimed at increasing the purity of indium and at improving the environmental sustainability of the process. The approach presented here is considered extremely useful in the frame of urban mining strategies. It can help ensure progress towards sustainable societies, encourage industrial innovation of the recycling companies and the implementation of cleaner processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aelectronic wastes 3aempirical models 3aenvironmental impact 3aindium 3aleaching 3alife cycle assessment 3aliquid crystal display 3amining 3apH 3araw materials 3arecycling 3arisk 3asustainable communities 3azinc 0aIndium 0aCritical raw materials 0aCementation 0aLiquid crystal display1 aAmato, Alessia1 aBeolchini, Francesca0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Mar. 10, v. 116 p.299-305dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245016000159300001600319520124900335592002801584650001701612650001301629650002601642650001801668650000701686650002101693650001501714650000901729650001601738700001501754700001101769700001801780700001701798700001701815773009801832856007801930852000902008655001202017IND60480304320221120231944.0160126e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048030432DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015008172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhao10aApplication and optimization of organic–inorganic hybrid monolithic capillary electrochromatography for in vivo cefdinir determination with microdialysis  ap. 440-449.  aIn this study, an organic–inorganic hybrid monolithic capillary column was applied and optimized for the determination of cefdinir in plasma, and the electro‐osmotic flow that usually hinders migration in reverse polarity became a driving force. The Sample used for pharmacokinetic research was collected by microdialysis using phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) as perfusate, and a volume of 60 μL fluid was mixed with 140 μL of acetonitrile. By using a silica‐allyldimethyldodecylammonium monolithic column (100 μm inner diameter, 21 cm effective length and 31.2 cm total length), and a mobile phase consisting of phosphate and acetonitrile (pH 4.5, 50:50, v/v), at a voltage of 20 kV, the analytes were successfully separated with the background within 2.5 min. The detection wavelength was 214 nm. The calibration curve showed a good linearity (r² = 0.9994) over the concentration range of 0.2–50 μg/mL. The proposed method showed good specificity, linearity, sensitivity, precision and recovery, and the introduction of field amplified sample stacking helped to improve the low recovery caused by microdialysis. This method was successfully applied to quantify cefdinir in rat plasma to support a pre‐clinical pharmacokinetic trial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3acefdinir 3aelectrochromatography 3amicrodialysis 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 3aphosphates 3arats 3awavelengths1 aBi, Xiaoli1 aLi, Ji1 aTang, Yuanjun1 aFan, Guorong1 aSun, Dongmei0 tJournal of separation science.g2016 Jan., v. 39, no. 2 p.440-449dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015008173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245014300191300001600334500002000350520087400370592002801244650001601272650001201288650002201300650001501322650000901337650002701346650001401373650001201387650001201399650001001411700002401421700002401445700002001469700001801489700002401507773012601531852000901657856008901666655001201755IND4431169920221119121834.0210101e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443116992DNAL7 a215649992pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02673.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPILLAY, KERUSHA10aTwenty‐two polymorphic microsatellite loci aimed at detecting illegal trade in the Cape parrot, Poicephalus robustus (Psittacidae, AVES)  ap. 142-149.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTwenty‐two polymorphic microsatellite loci were characterized in the Cape parrot, Poicephalus robustus. Nineteen loci were newly isolated from two Cape parrot genomic libraries, and three loci isolated from other parrot species. Loci were characterized in 40 unrelated captive Cape parrots held by aviculturalists. The loci displayed between two and 24 alleles, with the observed heterozygosities ranging between 0.10 and 0.94. This locus set is suitable for identifying clarifying parentage (parentage exclusion probabilities of PE₁ = 0.0004 and PE₂ = 0.000001). Candidate parents for any Cape parrot individual can now be genotyped to distinguish between individuals, which are truly captive bred and those suspected of being wild‐caught birds. Cross‐species analysis found up to 31 loci to be polymorphic across 24 additional parrot species tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoicephalus 3aalleles 3agenomic libraries 3agenotyping 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3aparents 3aparrots 3atrade1 aDawson, Deborah A.,1 aHORSBURGH, GAVIN J.1 aPERRIN, MIKE R.1 aBurke, Terry,1 aTAYLOR, TIAWANNA D.0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2010 Jan., v. 10, no. 1 p.142-149dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02673.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03196naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001500293520147800308592002801786650002301814650002301837650001301860650001301873650001501886650001801901650001301919650002101932650002201953650000901975650000901984650001201993650001202005650001402017650001402031650001502045650002002060650003002080650001702110653003302127653002302160653003002183653001302213653001702226653002102243700002002264700002302284700002102307700002102328700002202349700002302371773012202394856008102516852000902597655001202606IND60602174020221118170745.0180709e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060217402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2015.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendes, Sónia13aAn integrated view of redox and catalytic properties of B-type PpDyP from Pseudomonas putida MET94 and its distal variants  ap. 99-107.  aPpDyP from Pseudomonas putida MET94 is an extremely versatile B-type dye-decolourising peroxidase (DyP) capable of efficient oxidation of a wide range of anthraquinonic and azo dyes, phenolic substrates, the non-phenolic veratryl alcohol and even manganese and ferrous ions. In reaction with H2O2 it forms a stable Compound I at a rate of (1.4±0.3)×10⁶M⁻¹s⁻¹, comparable to those of classical peroxidases and other DyPs. We provide the first report of standard redox potential (E⁰′) of the Compound I/Native redox couple in a DyP-type peroxidase. The value of E⁰′Cpd I/N=1.10±0.04 (V) is similar to those found in peroxidases from the mammalian superfamily but higher than in peroxidases from the plant superfamily. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to investigate the role of conserved distal residues, i.e. to replace aspartate 132 by asparagine, and arginine 214 and asparagine 136 by leucine. The structural, redox and catalytic properties of variants are addressed by spectroscopic, electrochemical and kinetic measurements. Our data point to the importance of the distal arginine in the catalytic mechanism of PpDyP, as also observed in DyPB from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 but not in DyPs from the A and D subfamilies. This work reinforces the idea of existence of mechanistic variations among members of the different sub-families of DyPs with direct implications for their enzymatic properties and potential for biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3aRhodococcus jostii 3aalcohols 3aarginine 3aasparagine 3aaspartic acid 3aazo dyes 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aions 3airon 3aleucine 3amammals 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3aredox potential 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aspectroscopy 0aDye decolourising peroxidase 0aPseudomonas putida 0aSite directed mutagenesis 0aKinetics 0aSpectroscopy 0aRedox properties1 aBrissos, Vânia1 aGabriel, Antonieta1 aCatarino, Teresa1 aTurner, David L.1 aTodorovic, Smilja1 aMartins, Lígia O.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2015 May 15, v. 574 p.99-107dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245015900163300001600322520121500338536017301553592002801726596007501754596006301829650002001892650001801912650001401930650001801944650001301962650002701975650002702002650002102029650002302050650002402073650001102097650001802108650001502126650003302141650001202174650001102186650000902197653001902206653002302225653003302248653002502281653002102306700001402327700001702341700001902358700001602377773014002393856008602533852000902619655001202628IND60592781320221120145533.0200511e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059278132DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2017.13649802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Lu10aOptimisation of a highly efficient shoot regeneration system using leaf explants of Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) by response surface methodology  ap. 289-295.  aChinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) is a major fruit crop in Asia. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) was successfully employed to establish a highly efficient in vitro propagation and regeneration system for the ‘Teapot’ jujube via shoot organogenesis. Among the tested factors, gibberellic acid (GA₃) concentration showed the most significant positive effect. The pre-culture darkness timing and medium were also important factors for highly efficient shoot regeneration of the ‘Teapot’ jujube. The highest regeneration (> 75%) was achieved by 1 week in darkness and culture on wood plant medium (WPM) containing 0.25 mg·L⁻¹ GA₃, 0.5 mg·L⁻¹ 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0.1 mg·L⁻¹ 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA). In vitro-derived shoots rooted very well in the modified ¹/₂ Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.4 mg·L⁻¹ 3-indolebutyric acid (IBA), resulting in a 100% rooting rate. These findings suggest that the RSM can be employed to optimise the protocols needed for successful in vitro plant regeneration of jujube cultivars, with potential applications in plant genetic transformation practices, polyploidy induction and germplasm preservation.  aThis study was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [No. 2016ZCQ05] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31400578].  aPublisher supplied data  a2016ZCQ05cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a31400578cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aZiziphus jujuba 3abenzyladenine 3acultivars 3aculture media 3aexplants 3agenetic transformation 3agermplasm conservation 3agibberellic acid 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3aleaves 3aorganogenesis 3apolyploidy 3aresponse surface methodology 3arooting 3ashoots 3awood 0aChinese jujube 0ashoot regeneration 0aresponse surface methodology 0ain vitro propagation 0arooting efficacy1 aWang, Yan1 aCui, Yanhong1 aPang, Xiaoming1 aLi, Yingyue0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2018 May 4, v. 93, no. 3 p.289-295dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2017.13649803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010700168300001600275520069700291592002800988650001401016650001201030650002101042650002201063650001901085650000901104650001701113651001101130700002101141700002101162700002401183773012701207856008201334852000901416655001201425IND60081828420221121055127.0181120e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008182842DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954140901302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShigapov, Z.

However, the methods and tools used to assess their conservation status are varied. In this context, we reviewed and summarized the scientific literature related to the coastal Natura 2000 habitats to list and sort parameters used to assess and map their conservation status. We found 225 papers that specifically focused on the assessment of conservation status of coastal habitats. An analysis of the papers was conducted based on the four parameters (“Range”, “Area”, “structure and functions”, “Future prospects”) specified in the guidelines. Results highlight knowledge gaps regarding the availability of data and methods that measure the “Range”, “Area”, “Structure and functions” and “Future prospects”. Most of the papers focused on coastal dunes and were located in the Mediterranean biogeographic region. Therefore, the process of assessing the conservation status of coastal habitats remains complicated to implement because methodological approaches are mainly dominated by expert statements. Moreover, all the procedures of the HD are carried out within each member country and the final assessments are often the synthesis of these partial assessments. However, the multiscalar approach and the use of innovative technologies (databases, remote sensing) can be particularly relevant to develop replicable approaches and facilitate monitoring and the implementation of management measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aconservation status 3ageographical distribution 0aConservation status 0aCoastal habitats 0aHabitats Directive 0aNatura 2000 0aEuropean review1 aLagrange, Ilse1 aRozo, Clémence1 aBensettiti, Farid1 aBouzillé, Jan-Bernard1 aEvans, Douglas1 aLalanne, Arnault1 aRapinel, Sébastien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4250-53601 aBioret, Frédéric,0 tBiological conservation.g2021 Feb., v. 254 p.108935-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.1089353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04114naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015900166300001600325520205700341536012602398592002802524596009802552650002502650650001202675650001902687650001802706650001602724650001302740650001602753650002002769650001402789650002102803650001302824650002302837650001602860650001102876650002002887650002202907650001502929650001902944650002802963650002502991650002503016650001303041650001103054653000803065653003003073653003003103653001103133700001903144700001303163700001603176700001603192700001403208700001903222773014003241856008603381852000903467655001203476IND60592781520221120170947.0200511e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059278152DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2017.13691712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Fang10aEffects of day and night temperature on photosynthesis, antioxidant enzyme activities, and endogenous hormones in tomato leaves during the flowering stage  ap. 306-315.  aTo study the effects of day and night temperature difference (DIF) on tomato growth, a controlled experiment using Solanum lycopersicum L., cv. Jinguan 5 was conducted. The daily mean temperature (Tₘ) was maintained at 18°C and 25°C, and the DIF was set at 0°C, 6°C, and 12°C. The results indicated that chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b (Chl b) gradually increased as DIF rose. At 18°C Tₘ, the carotenoid content reached a maximum at 12°C DIF. The Chl a/Chl b, net photosynthetic rate (PN), photosynthetic rate at irradiation saturation (Pₘₐₓ), stomatal conductance (gₛ), intercellular CO₂ concentration (Cᵢ), stomatal limitation value, the maximum assimilation rate (Aₘₐₓ), apparent quantum efficiency (Aq), carboxylation efficiency (Cₑ), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), gibberellin A₃ (GA₃), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were highest, while malondialdehyde (MDA) was lowest at 6°C DIF. At 25°C Tₘ, PN, Pₘₐₓ, Aₘₐₓ, Aq, Cₑ, gₛ, Cᵢ, CAT, POD, GA₃, IAA, and zeatin reached the maximum under 6°C DIF, while SOD and MDA reached the maximum under 12°C DIF. Furthermore, the morphological index peaked at 6°C DIF under 18°C and 25°C Tₘ. The results suggested that 6°C DIF improved the growth and development of tomato during the flowering stage.

A study was conducted on Bromopsis inermis populations that have been growing for a long time in the EURT area. Using RAPD primers, we studied the genetic spectra of plants. In analysing the UPGMA algorithm, we identified two well-distinguishable clusters with a high level of bootstrap support (> 85%): background samples hit the first, and impact samples hit the second. Our data indicate a decrease in diversity in the most polluted population, as well as the appearance of new alleles in chronically irradiated samples of the B. inermis. Smooth brome seedlings were characterised by the content of anthocyanins, comparable with other types of cereals. In the gradient of chronic irradiation, the relative content of anthocyanins was not significantly changed. For the first time, the partial nucleotide sequences of the key genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis (Chi and F3h) in the brome were determined, these sequences were found to be 191 and 356 bp in length, respectively, and were cloned and sequenced. Three copies of the Chi gene were identified in the B. inermis genome. One copy (BiChi-1) clustered with the sequences of the Aegilops tauschii gene (D genome), and the other two copies (BiChi-2 and BiChi-3) formed a separate cluster in the Pooideae subfamily adjacent to Hordeum vulgare. In the copy of BiChi-1, a complete deletion of intron 1 was detected. For the F3h gene, one copy of the B. inermis gene was obtained, which forms a separate branch in the subfamily Pooideae.  aPublisher supplied data  a11-04-01260cRussian Foundation for Basic Research  a0400-2019-0006cInstitute of Plant and Animal Ecology, UB RAS  a0324-2019-0039cInstitute of Cytology and Genetics, SB RAS 3aAegilops tauschii 3aBromus inermis subsp. inermis 3aHordeum vulgare 3aalgorithms 3aalleles 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3agenetic polymorphism 3agrains 3aintrons 3airradiation 3amolecular cloning 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseedlings 3asequence analysis1 aShoeva, Olesya Yu.1 aKhlestkina, Elena K.0 tPlanta.g2019 June, v. 249, no. 6 p.1977-1985dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-019-03144-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015600169300001600325500001500341520109300356592002801449650002801477650001001505650002001515650002301535650001401558650001301572650001801585653002101603653002201624653002701646653002201673653001001695700001901705700001301724700001501737700001901752700001801771700001801789700001701807773016401824856008601988852000902074655001202083IND60544316320221121034927.0190416e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054431632DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(13)60359-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHAO, Ren-hui10aDevelopment of EST-PCR Markers for the Chromosome 4V of Haynaldia villosa and Their Application in Identification of 4V Chromosome Structural Aberrants  ap. 282-289.  a2019-12-06  aEST-PCR based molecular markers specific for alien chromosomes are not only useful for the detection of the introgressed alien chromatin in the wheat background, but also provide evidence of the syntenic relationship between homoeologous chromosomes. In the present study, in order to develop high density and evenly distributed molecular markers on chromosome 4V of Haynaldia villosa, a total of 607 primer pairs were designed according to the EST sequences, which were previously located in 23 different bins of wheat chromosomes 4A, 4B and 4D. By using the Triticum durum-H. villosa amphiploid and T. aestivum-H. villosa alien chromosome lines involving chromosome 4V, it was found that 9.23% of the tested primers could amplify specific bands for chromosome 4V. Thirty and twenty-six specific markers could be assigned to chromosome arms 4VS and 4VL, respectively. These 4V specific markers provided efficient tools for the characterization of structural variation involving the chromosome 4V as well as for the selection of useful genes located on chromosome 4V in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexpressed sequence tags 3awheat 3agenetic markers 3aDasypyrum villosum 3achromatin 3aTriticum 3aintrogression 0amolecular marker 0aHaynaldia villosa 0achromosome engineering 0aTriticum aestivum 0agenes1 aWang, Hai-yan,1 aJia, Qi,1 aXiao, Jin,1 aYUAN, Chun-xia1 aZHANG, Ya-jun1 aHU, Qing-shan1 aWang, Xiu'e,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2014 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.282-289dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(13)60359-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011000160300001800270500001500288520185900303592002802162650001902190650000902209650001602218650002402234650002202258650002202280650001402302650001202316650002702328650001002355650002902365650002402394650001602418650002302434650001502457650001402472650002002486650001102506653001102517700001702528700001602545700001802561773010802579856008102687852000902768655001202777IND60081828720221121055103.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008182872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-014-0899-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei10aCarbon flux from decomposing ¹³C-labeled transgenic and nontransgenic parental rice straw in paddy soil  ap. 1659-1668.  a2019-12-06  aPURPOSE: Genetic modification of Bt rice may affect straw decomposition and soil carbon pool under flood conditions. This study aims to assess the effects of cry gene transformation in rice on the residue decomposition and fate of C from residues under flooded conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decomposition experiment was set up using ¹³C-enriched rice straws from transgenic and nontransgenic Bt rice to evaluate the soil C dynamics and CH₄ or CO₂ emission rates in the root and non-root zones. The concentrations and stable carbon isotope compositions of the soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), CH₄, and CO₂ of the root and non-root zones were determined from 7 to 110 days after rice straw incorporation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Rice straw incorporation into soil significantly increased the SOC, DOC, and MBC concentrations and the CH₄ and CO₂ emission rates. The percentage of ¹³C-SOC remaining in the root zone was significantly lower than that in the non-root zone with rice straw decomposition. The DOC and MBC concentrations significantly increased in both the root and non-root zones between 0 and 80 days after rice straw incorporation. However, no significant differences were found after Bts (Bt rice straw added into soil) and Cks (nontransgenic Bt rice straw added into soil) incorporation in the root and non-root zones. This result may be attributed to the priming effects of sufficient oxygen and nutrients on straw degradation in the root zone. CONCLUSIONS: Bt gene insertion did not affect the SOC, DOC, and MBC concentrations and the CH₄ and CO₂ emission rates in both the root and non-root zones. However, rice straw incorporation and root exudation significantly increased the SOC, DOC, and MBC concentrations and the CH₄ and CO₂ emission rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3arice 3arhizosphere 3asoil organic carbon 3atransgenic plants 3amicrobial biomass 3aexudation 3amethane 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3agenes 3adissolved organic carbon 3agenetic engineering 3apaddy soils 3aflooded conditions 3arice straw 3anutrients 3astable isotopes 3aoxygen 0acarbon1 aWu, Weixiang1 aLu, Hao Hao1 aChen, Ying Xu0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2014 Oct., v. 14, no. 10 p.1659-1668dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-014-0899-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245015700160300001600317500001900333520137900352592002801731650001201759650001101771650003001782650002701812650001501839650001101854650001301865650001101878650001901889650002101908650001801929650002201947651001001969700001901979700001601998700001802014700001702032773013302049856004802182852000902230655001202239IND6036762320221117233916.0210804e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603676232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-011-0615-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xinlu13aAn approach to analyzing spatial patterns of protozoan communities for assessing water quality in the Hangzhou section of Jing-Hang Grand Canal in China  ap. 739-747.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aINTRODUCTION: In order to evaluate water quality of a canal system, the spatial pattern of protozoan communities in response to physicochemical variables was studied in the Hangzhou section of the Grand Canal, northern China during a 1-year cycle (February 2008–January 2009). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Protozoan samples were monthly collected at six sampling stations with a spatial gradient of environmental status. Physicochemical parameters, e.g., water temperature, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), were measured synchronously for comparison with biotic parameters. RESULTS: The protozoan community structures represented significant differences among the six sampling stations. The spatial patterns of protozoan communities were significantly correlated with the changes of chemical variables, especially COD, either alone or in combination with TP and/or TN. Of 88 protozoan taxa recorded over the study period, ten species (e.g., Carchesium polypinum, Colpidium campylum, Prorodon teres, Vorticella putrina, Zoothamnium arbuscula, Euglena spp., and Phacus spp.) were significantly related to COD, either alone or in combination with TP and/or TN. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that protozoa can be used as a robust bioindicator of water quality in freshwater river systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuglena 3aPhacus 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3afreshwater 3aoxygen 3aresearch 3arivers 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awater quality 3awater temperature 3aChina1 aLiu, Xiaojiang1 aLiu, Guijie1 aSun, Zhiqiang1 aXu, Henglong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2012 Mar., v. 19, no. 3 p.739-747dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-011-0615-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245018200174300001600356500001900372520100500391592002801396650001501424650001201439650001401451650002101465650001601486650001601502650001801518650001301536651001101549653002901560653001401589653002601603653001201629653003001641653002001671653001401691653001201705653002901717700001801746700002701764700002301791700002201814700002001836700002401856773017101880856008202051852000902133655001202142IND60724112920210419000000.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072411292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cnd.2020.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndreeva, Valentina A.13aLe comportement alimentaire, ses déterminants et son lien avec la santé bucco-dentaire : résultats épidémiologiques chez les seniors inscrits à la cohorte NutriNet-Santé  ap. 111-116.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVery few studies have explored dietary patterns in the course of aging. Here we summarize 3 cross-sectional analyses carried out among seniors enrolled in the French NutriNet-Santé cohort. The results confirm the diversity of eating habits among the elderly in France. The analysis of dietary patterns showed that the “healthy” pattern explained most of the variance in food intake among seniors. Modest and age-dependent associations were observed between oral health and adherence to the PNNS dietary guidelines. Finally, it is possible that certain results reflect an evolution in food consumption in favor of better compliance with nutritional guidelines in the course of aging. These epidemiological results provide updated information about the characteristics and determinants of the eating behaviors of French seniors. In the future, longitudinal research with representative samples would be necessary in order to extend this work and guide the development of public health strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3aelderly 3aevolution 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3aoral health 3apublic health 3avariance 3aFrance 0aComportement alimentaire 0aNutrition 0aSanté bucco-dentaire 0aSeniors 0aAnalyse épidémiologique 0aEating behavior 0aNutrition 0aSeniors 0aEpidemiological analysis1 aFeron, Gilles1 aSulmont-Rossé, Claire1 aHennequin, Martine1 aTouvier, Mathilde1 aHercberg, Serge1 aGalan, P.q(Pilar),0 tCahiers de nutrition et de diététique.g2021 Apr., v. 56, no. 2 p.111-116dElsevier Masson SASaSociété française de nutritionwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnd.2020.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011600170300001600286520090400302592002801206650002601234650002201260650002301282650001301305650002101318650001801339650002601357650004301383650001401426653003401440653003201474653001401506653002901520700001801549700001801567700001901585700001901604773016401623856008601787852000901873655001201882IND60544316520221121042947.0190416e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054431652DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(13)60360-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHUO, Jing-qian10aIsolation and Structural Identification of Herbicidal Active Substance from Root of Flaveria bident (L.)

Kuntze, the isolation and structural identification were researched in this paper. The crude extract from the root of F. bidentis (L.) Kuntze was extracted by petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and water saturation of n-butyl alcohol, respectively, and the extraction fluid was separated by using the method of TLC, then the main fraction was separated by HPLC, and the structure of the herbicidal active substance was analyzed by LC-MS, elemental analysis and 1H-NMR. The results showed that the petroleum extraction had the strongest herbicidal activity, and the purple blue stripe separated by TLC had the strongest effect on Digitaria sanguinalis. The herbicidal active substance was identified as α-terthienyl according to the data of LC-MS, elemental analysis and 1H-NMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDigitaria sanguinalis 3aFlaveria bidentis 3aactive ingredients 3aalcohols 3aalpha-terthienyl 3aethyl acetate 3aherbicidal properties 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apetroleum 0aFlaveria bidentis (L.)

It can be readily produced in rural community settings using low-cost technology and is most economically feasible if produced from local biomass or waste residues. Biochar was produced from Leucaena biomass using low-cost pyrolysis and sequential pot experiments were then conducted in Malaysia on three degraded soils. We first evaluated the effect of Leucaena biochar on yields of Amaranthus, a leafy vegetable crop and measured changes to soil pH and nutrient availability over two growth cycles. We then tested whether any yield response to biochar was dependent upon the rate of biochar or fertilizer application. We found that biochar application at 30 t ha⁻¹ with maximal fertilizer increased yields between 17 and 53% on very strongly acidic soil. Biochar added at 15 t ha⁻¹ with maximal fertilizer increased yield by 54% on strongly acidic soil whilst there was no significant yield response on fertilized, slightly acidic soil. Unfertilized biochar treatments showed small yield responses across all soils over 2 growth cycles (9–11%), but yields were much lower than in fertilized treatments. Biochar also decreased short-term N availability when applied with fertilizers, which may improve nitrogen retention and substantially increased soil pH. This may reduce mobility of Fe, Mn and Al ions, which were negatively associated with yield. Our results suggest that Leucaena biochar can elicit a positive crop yield response but only when combined with fertilizer additions on very strongly to strongly acidic tropical soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus 3aLeucaena 3aacid soils 3abiochar 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acrop yield 3aeconomic feasibility 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3anitrogen retention 3anutrient availability 3apyrolysis 3arural communities 3asoil pH 3avegetable crops 3aMalaysia 0aYield 0aDegraded tropical soils 0aFood security1 aOoi, Gin Teng1 aAhmad Razi, Mohammad Fadhil1 aRobinson, Samuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0011-74071 aWhitaker, Jeanette1 aMcNamara, Niall P.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Nov., v. 142 p.105710-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1057103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012700158300001600285520133600301592002801637650001601665650001101681650002101692650001401713650001601727650001601743650001601759650002701775650002001802650001201822650001101834700001201845700002101857700002201878773011001900856007402010852000902084655001202093IND60480304920221120232008.0160126e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048030492DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.123742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ya‐Nan10aFloral nectary, nectar production dynamics, and floral reproductive isolation among closely related species of Pedicularis  ap. 178-187.  aFloral nectar is thought to be one of the most important rewards that attract pollinators in Pedicularis; however, few studies have examined variation of nectary structure and/or nectar secretion in the genus, particularly among closely related species. Here we investigated nectary morphology, nectar quality, and nectar production dynamics in flowers of Pedicularis section Cyathophora. We found a conical floral nectary at the base of the ovary in species of the rex‐thamnophila clade. Stomata were found on the surface of the nectary, and copious starch grains were detected in the nectary tissues. In contrast, a semi‐annular nectary was found in flowers of the species of the superba clade. Only a few starch grains were observed in tissues of the semi‐annular nectary, and the nectar sugar concentration in these flowers was much lower than that in the flowers of the rex‐thamnophila clade. Our results indicate that the floral nectary has experienced considerable morphological, structural, and functional differentiation among closely related species of Pedicularis. This could have affected nectar production, leading to a shift of the pollination mode. Our results also imply that variation of the nectary morphology and nectar production may have played an important role in the speciation of sect. Cyathophora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPedicularis 3anectar 3anectar secretion 3anectaries 3aplant ovary 3apollination 3apollinators 3areproductive isolation 3astarch granules 3astomata 3asugars1 aLi, Yan1 aYang, Fu‐Sheng1 aWang, Xiao‐Quan0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2016 Feb., v. 58, no. 2 p.178-187dBlackwell Pub.x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.123743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010400170300001400274520060000288592002800888650001400916650002200930650001700952650001500969650001100984650001900995650003201014650001901046650001901065650002101084650001701105653002101122653002801143653003901171700001901210773010601229856008501335852000901420655001201429IND60544316620221121042926.0190415e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054431662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2015.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wen-qiong10aNew acyclic sesquiterpenoid derivatives and a monoterpene disaccharide from Dichondra repens Forst.  ap. 23-26.  aA new highly oxygenated acyclic sesquiterpenoid (2E, 6E)-8,10,11-trihydroxyl-7,11-dimethyl-3-hydroxymethyl-2,6-dodecadienoic acid (1) and its glucoside (2), together with a new pinane monoterpene disaccharide glucoside 6,6-dimethyl-2-methlenebicyclo [3.1.1]hept-3-O-(6-O-apiofuranosyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside (3) were isolated from hydrophilic extract of Dichondra repens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 42 sediment samples affected by mining activities were studied, including 39 sediment samples from the Sierra Minera, Spain, an area affected by old extraction procedures, and three sediments from an area affected by opencast mining. These three samples were then mixed with limestone filler at 10, 20 and 30 %, providing nine stabilised samples. The total and soluble metal(loid) content (As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn) was determined in all samples, and the Phytotoxkit® bioassay was applied to determine the ecotoxicological effect of this procedure. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The stabilised material had a neutral pH and low soluble metal(loid) concentration, similar to that of samples in which a natural attenuation process had taken place because of mixing with surrounding carbonate-rich materials. An ecotoxicological survey identified the low toxicity levels of the stabilised samples. CONCLUSIONS: The applied bioassay is a good tool for screening metal(loid) contamination in areas affected by mining activities, since it provides information on both natural and simulated attenuation processes. The mixing of sediments with limestone filler could be applied to the remediation of zones affected by mining activities, because the toxicological effect on the tested organisms in the stabilised sediments was reduced significantly and the metal(loid) content was diminished.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abioassays 3acadmium 3acopper 3aecotoxicology 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3alimestone 3amining 3amixing 3apH 3aremediation 3arisk 3ascreening 3asediments 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aSpain1 aMartínez Sánchez, María José,1 aPérez-Sirvent, Carmen0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2014 Oct., v. 14, no. 10 p.1753-1765dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-014-0942-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011800175500001900293520143500312592002801747650001401775650001201789650001801801650001101819650001401830650002301844650001701867650001301884650002401897650001101921650001001932653002501942653002601967653002101993700001602014700001502030700001402045700001802059700001802077773010702095856008702202852000902289655001202298IND60710858820221116210942.0201111e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071085882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1057122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoomro, Ahsanullah10aPromoting effect of ZrO2/CeO2 addition on Fe/CaO catalyst for hydrogen gas production in the gasification process  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn order to enhance the biomass conversion and hydrogen production, the additive effects of ZrO₂ and CeO₂ to Fe/CaO catalysts prepared by the impregnation methods were investigated in the steam gasification of lignin. Firstly, the effect of Fe/ZrO₂ and Fe/CeO₂ loading contents on the catalytic performance was examined; then, the optimum ratios of Zr–Fe/CaO and Ce–Fe/CaO catalysts were compared with Fe/CaO catalyst. Regarding the lignin conversion and hydrogen gas production, the performance of these three catalyst follows the sequence of Zr–Fe/CaO> 5Fe/CaO > Ce–Fe/CaO. Results revealed that the addition of ZrO₂ on Fe/CaO improved the gasification products, carbon conversion, and the cyclic stability of the catalyst which displayed considerably higher H₂ yield with less residual char compared with other catalysts. Nevertheless, the CeO₂ modified Fe/CaO catalyst exhibited relatively poor catalytic performance. The used catalysts were characterized using XRD, SEM, EDX, and TGA. Results showed that the coke formation over the Fe/CaO was more significant than that of ZrO₂ modified Fe/CaO catalyst. Furthermore, the latter catalyst showed higher resistance to sintering. In stability test, ZrO₂ modified Fe/CaO catalyst showed obvious catalytic activities and gave a nearly constant rate of hydrogen generation in all ten cycles, suggesting an excellent catalytic stability of this catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3alignin 3asteam 0aBiomass gasification 0aCatalytic performance 0aCyclic stability1 aChen, Shiyi1 aMa, Shiwei1 aSun, Zhao1 aXu, Changchun1 aXiang, Wenguo0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Nov., v. 142 p.105712-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1057123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245007100206300001400277506007600291520071900367592002801086506003701114650001701151650003001168650002801198650001601226650002301242650001401265650002201279650002201301653001901323653001901342653001001361653002301371653002101394653001801415653001901433700001601452700001601468700001601484773012301500856008101623852000901704655001201713IND60602174620221207144920.0180709e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060217462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2015.03.0132doi7 aPMC45548252pmcid7 a257974382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚwiderek, K.10aComputational strategies for the design of new enzymatic functions  ap. 68-79.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this contribution, recent developments in the design of biocatalysts are reviewed with particular emphasis in the de novo strategy.

As a general conclusion, the interplay between new and more sophisticated engineering protocols and computational methods, based on molecular dynamics simulations with Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics potentials and fully flexible models, seems to constitute the bed rock for present and future successful design strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiocatalysts 3acomputational methodology 3acycloaddition reactions 3aengineering 3amolecular dynamics 3aprotocols 3aquantum mechanics 3asimulation models 0aProtein design 0aDe novo design 0aQM/MM 0aMolecular dynamics 0aKemp elimination 0aDiels–Alder 0aRetro-Aldolase1 aTuñón, I.1 aMoliner, V.1 aBertran, J.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 582 p.68-79dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245008400174300001400258500001900272520137600291592002801667650002601695650001301721650001401734650001401748653002001762653002201782653001401804653001301818653002501831653002301856653001301879653001501892653001501907700002501922773013401947856008202081852000902163655001202172IND60724113120210419000000.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072411312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cnd.2020.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarburton, Darren E.R.10aCardiovascular health benefits of physical activity: Time to focus on strengths  ap. 40-50.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe health benefits of regular physical activity and/or exercise participation are clear. There is overwhelming evidence from large population-based and randomized controlled trials demonstrating the positive role that routine physical activity/exercise plays in the primary and secondary prevention of at least 25 chronic medical conditions and premature mortality. In this article, we discuss how diseases of the cardiovascular system appear to be particularly affected by physical activity and exercise levels. We also discuss the relatively poor uptake of various national and international guidelines that adopt threshold- and deficits-based messaging highlighting the need to meet specific physical activity targets and the perils of engaging in too little physical activity or exercise. We argue that threshold- and deficits-based messaging misses a great opportunity for health and wellness change. We also emphasize how this form of messaging may actually increase the barriers for those seeking to become healthier through routine physical activity. We highlight the importance of taking a strengths-based approach to health and wellness that builds upon the innate strengths of individuals, families, and communities. We argue that a strengths-based approach provides a greater opportunity for enhancing health and wellness that is more inclusive for everyone.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular system 3aexercise 3amortality 3anutrition 0aStrengths-based 0aPhysical activity 0aWholistic 0aWellness 0aBasé sur les forces 0aActivité physique 0aExercice 0aHolistique 0aBien-être1 aBredin, Shannon S.D.0 tCahiers de nutrition et de diététique.g2021 Feb., v. 56, no. 1 p.40-50dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnd.2020.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007100156300002000227520113400247592002801381650002401409650001401433650001101447650002501458650002301483650001301506650001601519650001501535650001301550650001401563650003701577700001801614700001701632700001801649700001901667700001801686700001601704773012401720856007401844852000901918655001201927IND60664513820221118042337.0190912e20130812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066451382DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra41480a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Inhyuk10aSynthesis of oxidation-resistant core–shell copper nanoparticles  ap. 15169-15177.  aWe present a simple method to synthesize non-oxidizable copper nanoparticles surrounded by copper formate. The formation of the core–shell nanoparticles was achieved via surface reaction induced by the injection of formic acid on the preformed core particles. High resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that copper particles with a diameter of 77 nm are conformally surrounded by a 5 nm thick layer of copper formate, which prevents oxidation of the copper. This non-metallic shell was readily reduced to Cu during low temperature annealing without leaving behind organic residues, resulting in highly conductive films with a resistivity of 13.5 μΩ cm after annealing at 250 °C for 1 h in nitrogen. Time- and temperature-dependent sheet resistance measurements demonstrated that the resistivity of the core–shell nanoparticle films will double after exposure to an ambient atmosphere at room temperature for 27 years. Our core–shell Cu nanoparticles are a promising and cost-effective alternative to silver nanoparticles for the efficient production of printed conductors with enhanced chemical stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aannealing 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3acost effectiveness 3aformates 3aformic acid 3ananosilver 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKim, Youngwoo1 aWoo, Kyoohee1 aRyu, Eui-Hyun1 aYon, Kyung-Yol1 aCao, Guozhong1 aMoon, Jooho0 tRSC advances.g2013 Aug. 12, v. 3, no. 35 p.15169-15177dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra41480a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245008200178500001900260520109000279592002801369650000801397650001201405650001301417650001101430650001101441650001301452650001701465653001501482653002601497653001801523653001401541700006201555700002601617700002301643773010701666856008701773852000901860655001201869IND60710858920221116210740.0201111e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071085892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1057312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisberger, Joshua M.13aAn emissions-based fuel mass loss measurement for wood-fired hydronic heaters  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRegulations that standardize the evaluation of wood-fired hydronic heaters (WHH) use mass loss as an important variable to compute energy input. Generally, mass loss is measured by placing the entire appliance on a scale and measuring the system mass change. This method suffers from resolution problems since the change in mass of the fuel during a run is much smaller than the total mass of the empty appliance. This experimental study provides a higher-resolution measurement of mass loss by measuring the concentration of flue gas emissions in addition to the flow rate of air into the WHH. Three fuels (red oak, cherry, and pine) are independently tested, and measurements of the emissions are made using both a Testo gas analyzer and tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. A simultaneous direct measurement of the mass loss is performed using a hanging basket inside the WHH, and the average percent difference between the two methods are 5.4% for red oak, 5.4% for cherry, and 8% for pine, indicating that the emissions-based method is suitable for mass loss measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass 3acherries 3adiodes 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3aspectroscopy 0aCombustion 0aFuel mass measurement 0aNon-intrusive 0aEmissions1 aRichter, Joseph P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4805-89361 aMollendorf, Joseph C.1 aDesJardin, Paul E.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Nov., v. 142 p.105731-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1057313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245006000195300001600255520105300271592002801324650001501352650001901367650002801386650001401414650002001428650001301448650001401461650001601475650002401491650003601515650003701551650001101588650002601599650002401625650003601649650003001685651001101715700002401726700002901750700002401779700002601803700002901829773011501858856004801973852000902021655001202030IND4476319020221122231816.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447631902DNAL7 a209674682pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-010-0380-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPagourelias, Efstathios D.10aCarbon dioxide balneotherapy and cardiovascular disease  ap. 657-663.  aCarbon dioxide (CO2) balneotherapy is a kind of remedy with a wide spectrum of applications which have been used since the Middle Ages. However, its potential use as an adjuvant therapeutic option in patients with cardiovascular disease is not yet fully clarified. We performed a thorough review of MEDLINE Database, EMBASE, ISI WEB of Knowledge, COCHRANE database and sites funded by balneotherapy centers across Europe in order to recognize relevant studies and aggregate evidence supporting the use of CO2 baths in various cardiovascular diseases. The three main effects of CO2 hydrotherapy during whole body or partial immersion, including decline in core temperature, an increase in cutaneous blood flow, and an elevation of the score on thermal sensation, are analyzed on a pathophysiology basis. Additionally, the indications and contra-indications of the method are presented in an evidence-based way, while the need for new methodologically sufficient studies examining the use of CO2 baths in other cardiovascular substrates is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3acarbon dioxide 3acardiovascular diseases 3adatabases 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3asensation 3atemperature 2aBalneologyxmethods 2aCarbon Dioxidextherapeutic use 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxtherapy 2aHumans 2aHydrotherapyxmethods 2aRegional Blood Flow 2aSkinxblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aThermosensingxphysiology 3aEurope1 aZorou, Paraskevi G.1 aTsaligopoulos, Miltiadis1 aAthyros, Vasilis G.1 aKaragiannis, Asterios1 aEfthimiadis, Georgios K.0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2011 Sept., v. 55, no. 5 p.657-663dSpringer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-010-0380-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013100159300002000290520157200310592002801882650001801910650001201928650001401940650002101954650001101975650001201986650001701998700002102015700001702036700001602053700001802069700001302087700001602100773012402116856007402240852000902314655001202323IND60664513920221118042400.0190912e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066451392DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra41482e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPazhanivel, T.10aSystematic investigation of the structure and photophysical properties of CdSe, CdSe/ZnS QDs and their hybrid with β-carotene  ap. 26116-26126.  aA systematic investigation was conducted to determine the excitation energy dependent emission characteristics of CdSe quantum dot–β-carotene and CdSe/ZnS core–shell quantum dot–β-carotene hybrid samples. The emission intensity was recorded at different excitation energies by continuously varying the excitation energy from the band edge value of the QDs to a maximum value. In both the hybrids, the emission intensity increased with an increase of the excitation energy and then a sudden quenching occurred, which is in contrast with the results from bare samples, where the emission intensity showed a decreasing trend at all excitation energies. The quantum yields corresponding to the maximum emission are 47.12% and 69%, for CdSe QD–βC and CdSe/ZnS core–shell QD–βC hybrids, respectively. At higher excitation energy, electrons were transferred to the molecule's LUMO level, leaving behind holes in the valance band of the QD, and thus the produced charge separated state became responsible for the PL quenching in the hybrid sample. We have confirmed this charge separated state by lifetime measurements. It is because of this PL quenching behaviour of the hybrids that the nature of the interface band structure was deduced as type I. Furthermore, because of the involvement of higher energy photons in the quenching process, the transferred electrons in the LUMO level of the molecule were known as hot electrons. The present paper discusses the excited state electron dynamics across the interface between the two hybrid materials in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-carotene 3acadmium 3aelectrons 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3aphotons 3azinc sulfide1 aDevarajan, V.

The Bering Sea, west of Alaska, is ice-free in summer, but each winter, an extensive sea ice cover is established, reaching its maximum normally in March. We found a slight increase in ice area over the time period, which is in stark contrast to the significant retreat observed in the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean as a whole. Possible explanation might be found in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which went from dominantly positive values to more negative values in the last decade. The PDO is related to the sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Pacific, negative values indicated cooler temperatures and cooler SST weakening the semipermanent Aleutian Low. When comparing the circulation pattern obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalyzed data set for years of heavy ice against light ice years, an additional vectorial northerly wind component could be deduced from the pressure data. Hence, less relatively warm air is advected into the Bering Sea, which becomes of special importance in winter, when solar radiation is at its minimum. Surface observations confirmed these findings. Atmospheric pressure increased in Cold Bay, located close to the center of the semi-permanent Aleutian Low, the N–S pressure gradient (Nome–Cold Bay) in the Bering Sea decreased, wind speeds of the coastal stations became weakened, and the temperature of coastal stations decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric pressure 3acold 3adata collection 3aice 3aicebergs 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3awind direction 3awind speed 3awinter 3aAlaska 3aArctic region 3aBeaufort Sea 3aBering Sea1 aChen, L.1 aMoore, B.0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2014 Aug., v. 117, no. 3-4 p.393-398dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1014-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003300134024001200167040001800179100001900197245011000216300001600326500002000342500000900362506017300371520124000544592002801784650001701812650001101829650001901840650002701859650001301886650002701899650001901926650000901945650002401954650000901978650001801987651001402005700002202019700002202041700002202063700002402085700002202109773021702131856011402348856008002462956008502542961001302627852000902640655001202649IND60592783120221214225029.0220811e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059278312DNAL7 a3283322aris7 a10113/59278312hdl7 a10.2134/jeq2016.11.04342doi8 ans13728  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Kevin W.10aPhosphorus Availability in Western Lake Erie Basin Drainage Waters: Legacy Evidence across Spatial Scales  ap. 466-469.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) was inundated with precipitation during June and July 2015 (two to three times greater than historical averages), which led to significant nutrient loading and the largest in‐lake algal bloom on record. Using discharge and concentration data from three spatial scales (0.18–16,000 km²), we contrast the patterns in nitrate (NO₃–N) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentration dynamics and discuss potential management implications. Across all scales, NO₃–N concentration steadily declined with each subsequent rainfall event as it was flushed from the system. In contrast, DRP concentration persisted, even on soils at or below agronomic P levels, suggesting that legacy P significantly contributes to nutrient loads in the WLEB. These findings highlight the need to revisit current P fertility recommendations and soil testing procedures to increase P fertilizer use efficiency and to more holistically account for legacy P. CORE IDEAS: Persistent P concentrations were measured from edge‐of‐field to basin scale. Persistent P concentrations after successive rainfall events are indicative of legacy P. Evidence of legacy P beckons for more comprehensive soil test metrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3abasins 3adrainage water 3afertilizer application 3anitrates 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apollution load 3arain 3areactive phosphorus 3asoil 3asoil analysis 3aLake Erie1 aWilliams, Mark R.1 aJohnson, Laura T.1 aSmith, Douglas R.1 aLaBarge, Gregory A.1 aFausey, Norman R.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2017 Mar., v. 46, no. 2 p.466-469dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/59278313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2016.11.04343Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/328332.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245010400205300001800309520183800327592002802165596005502193650002102248650001202269650001502281650001402296650001102310650002602321650003702347650000902384650001402393650001402407650001602421650001702437650002202454650001302476650002102489650001502510650001302525650001402538650001702552650001402569650003702583650000902620700002302629700002102652773011302673856008202786852000902868655001202877IND60642815520221120034514.0190508e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064281552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-019-03117-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMucha, Joanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1290-963914aThe effects of structurally different siderophores on the organelles of Pinus sylvestris root cells  ap. 1747-1760.  aMAIN CONCLUSION: Siderophores are a driver of Pinus sylvestris root responses to metabolites secreted by pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi. Structurally different siderophores regulate the uptake of Fe by microorganisms and may play a key role in the colonization of plants by beneficial or pathogenic fungi. Siderophore action, however, may be dependent on the distribution of Fe within cells. Here, the involvement of siderophores in determining the changes of organelle morphology and element composition of some cellular fractions of root cells in Pinus sylvestris to trophically diverse fungi was investigated. Changes in the morphology and concentrations of different elements within organelles of root cells in response to three structurally different siderophores were examined by transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Weak development of mitochondrial cristae and the deposition of backup materials in plastids occurred in the absence of Fe in the structures of triacetylfusarinine C and ferricrocin. In response to metabolites of both pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi, Fe accumulated mainly in the cell walls and cytoplasm. Fe counts increased in all of the analyzed organelles in response to applications of ferricrocin and triacetylfusarinine C. Chelation of Fe within the structure of siderophores prevents the binding of exogenous Fe, decreasing the abundance of Fe in the cell wall and cytoplasm. The concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mn, Cu, Mg, and Zn also increased in cells after applications of ferricrocin and triacetylfusarinine C, while the levels of these elements decreased in the cell wall and cytoplasm when Fe was present within the structure of the siderophores. These results provide insight into the siderophore-driven response of plants to various symbionts.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEC - 2013/09/B/NZ9/01746cNarodowym Centrum Nauki 3aPinus sylvestris 3acalcium 3acell walls 3achelation 3acopper 3aelemental composition 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3aplastids 3apotassium 3asiderophores 3asymbionts 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc1 aGabała, Elżbieta1 aZadworny, Marcin0 tPlanta.g2019 June, v. 249, no. 6 p.1747-1760dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-019-03117-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005300167300001600220500001100236520116700247592002801414650001501442650001201457650003201469650001501501650001301516650001101529650001301540773010201553856008101655852000901736655001201745IND60555733020221120032024.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055573302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-015-9417-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, Maike10aHydroxycinnamoyltransferases in plant metabolism  ap. 699-727.  aReview  aHydroxycinnamoyltransferases are enzymes transferring hydroxycinnamoyl units like cinnamoyl, 4-coumaroyl, caffeoyl, feruloyl and sinapoyl moieties from an activating residue such as coenzyme A or glucose or activated as hydroxycinnamoyl ester (e.g. chlorogenate) to an acceptor molecule, most commonly to an OH or NH₂ group as ester or amide. The hydroxycinnamoyl groups play either a “decorating” role or are building blocks of more complex structures. Proteins catalysing hydroxycinnamoyl transfer have been known for many decades and are nowadays investigated on molecular and structural levels. At least four different protein families give rise to enzymes with hydroxycinnamoyltransferase activity: serine carboxypeptidase-like proteins, tyramine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase-like enzymes, BAHD acyltransferases and GDSL-lipase/esterase-like enzymes. Interestingly, the same or very similar products can be formed by enzymes from different enzyme classes and using differently activated hydroxycinnamoyl units. This review will summarise the current literature data on the features of hydroxycinnamoyltransferases from the four different enzyme groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoenzyme A 3aglucose 3ahydroxycinnamoyltransferase 3ametabolism 3aproteins 3aserine 3atyramine0 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2016 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.699-727dSpringer Netherlandsx1568-77677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-015-9417-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007900162300001600241520119700257592002801454650001001482650001001492650000901502650001101511650002301522650001801545650001601563650001601579651001001595700001701605773011301622856008101735852000901816655001201825IND60080169720221121135624.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008016972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-013-1015-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubash, N.10aTrend analysis of rainfall and temperature and its relationship over India  ap. 449-462.  aThis study investigated the trends in rainfall and temperature and the possibility of any rational relationship between the trends over the homogeneous regions over India. Annual maximum temperature shows an increasing trend in all the homogeneous temperature regions and corresponding annual rainfall also follow the same pattern in all the regions, except North East. As far as monthly analysis is concerned, no definite pattern has been observed between trends in maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall, except during October. Increasing trends of maximum and minimum temperature during October accelerate the water vapor demand and most of the lakes, rivers, ponds and other water bodies with no limitation of water availability during this time fulfills the water vapor demand and shows an increasing trend of rainfall activity. This study shows there exists no direct relationship between increasing rainfall and increasing maximum temperature when monthly or seasonal pattern is concerned over meteorological subdivisions of India, however we can make a conclusion that the relation between the trends of rainfall and temperature have large scale spatial and temporal dependence.  aPublisher supplied data 3alakes 3aponds 3arain 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awater vapor 3aIndia1 aSikka, A.

The subjects included in this study belonged to various socio-demographic backgrounds, and were diagnosed with cancer (i.e. lung, head and neck or digestive tract cancer). In general, we observed high concentration of urinary 1-OHP among digestive tract cancer patients, compared with the controls (CN) (mean 1.06, median 1.03 and mean 0.62, median 0.63 μmol/mol-Cr in digestive tract cancer patients and controls respectively). The concentrations of urinary 1-OHP were higher than the background level of PAHs; therefore, these groups could have been exposed to PAHs. Highest urinary 1-OHP concentration was observed in digestive tract cancer patients (median 1.25 μmol/mol-Cr) with GSTM-1 genotype. The results of PCA were consistent with qualitative and quantitative data analysis. The contribution of urinary 1-OHP eigenvector revealed a relatively high PAH-exposure among cancer patients compared with CN, while diet and age were influential parameters among cancer patients, which could have a strong link in cancer etiology in the selected exposure groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbed dose 3abiomarkers 3adiet 3adigestive tract 3aetiology 3agenotype 3ahead 3alungs 3aneck 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aPakistan 0aBiomarker 0a1-OHP 0aPAH-tracer 0aCancer 0aGSTM 0aPakistan 0aGSTM-1 0aPAHs 0a1-OHP 0aHPLC 0aPCA 0aPCR 0aCYP-4501 aKamal, Atif1 aTaqi, Malik Mumtaz1 aMalik, Riffat Naseem0 tChemosphere.g2017 July, v. 178 p.384-390dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010800166300001500274520091500289592002801204650002201232650001801254650001301272650001601285650001401301650001601315650001001331650001101341650001001352650001601362650001601378650001501394650001001409650001401419650003701433650001301470651001901483653001001502653002401512653001001536653001901546700001501565700001401580773012701594856008301721852000901804655001201813IND60533741620221118220658.0190312e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053374162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2014.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDezfuli, B.S.10aUltrastructural Assessment of Granulomas in the Liver of Perch (Perca fluviatilis) Infected by Tapeworm  ap. 97-102.  aGranulomas caused by migration of larvae of a helminth parasite, Triaenophorus nodulosus, within the liver of perch (Perca fluviatilis) from Rimov Dam Lake (Czech Republic) were assessed by transmission electron microscopy.

Pathological changes were more severe in livers containing more granulomas. Within the granulomas, there were three concentric regions: an outer layer of fibrous connective tissue, a middle clear epithelioid layer and a central dark spindle cell layer. The outer layer contained mast cells, fibroblasts, thick collagen bundles and epithelioid cells. The granulomas contained few lymphocytes and macrophages.

The plant communities growing on heavy metal-polluted areas have attracted considerable attention due to their unique ability to tolerate enormous amounts of toxic ions. Three ecotypes of Silene vulgaris representing calamine (CAL), serpentine (SER) and non-metallicolous (NM) populations were evaluated to reveal specific adaptation traits to harsh environment. CAL leaves presented a distinct anatomical pattern compared to leaves of SER and NM plants, pointing to their xeromorphic adaptation. These differences were accompanied by divergent accumulation and composition of photosynthetic pigments as well as antioxidant enzyme activity. In CAL ecotype, the mechanism of reactive oxygen species scavenging is based on the joint action of superoxide dismutase and catalase, but in SER ecotype on superoxide dismutase and guaiacol-type peroxidase. On the contrary, the concentration of phenylpropanoids and flavonols in the ecotypes was unchanged, implying the existence of similar pathways of their synthesis/degradation functioning in CAL and SER populations. The tested specimens showed genetic variation (atpA/MspI marker). Based on diversification of S. vulgaris populations, we focused on the elaboration of similar in vitro conditions for synchronous cultivation of various ecotypes. The most balanced shoot culture growth was obtained on MS medium containing 0.1 mg l⁻¹ NAA and 0.25 mg l⁻¹ BA, while the most abundant callogenesis was observed on MS medium enriched with 0.5 mg l⁻¹ NAA and 5.0 mg l⁻¹ BA. For the first time, unified in vitro protocols were described for metallophytes providing the opportunity to conduct basic and applied research on stress biology and tolerance mechanisms under freely controlled conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEC-2017/01/X/NZ8/00382cNarodowe Centrum Nauki 3aSilene vulgaris 3aantioxidant activity 3aapplied research 3acallus formation 3acatalase 3aecotypes 3aenzyme activity 3aflavonols 3agenetic variation 3ahyperaccumulators 3ain vitro culture 3aions 3aleaves 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aperoxidase 3aphenylpropanoids 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant communities 3aserpentine 3asmithsonite 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity1 aLabudda, Mateusz1 aRóżańska, Elżbieta,1 aHanus-Fajerska, Ewa1 aKoszelnik-Leszek, Anna0 tPlanta.g2019 June, v. 249, no. 6 p.1761-1778dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-019-03123-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006100170300001400231520063500245592002800880650001800908650002200926650002500948650001100973650004400984650002101028653001001049653000801059653002101067653003101088653002201119653002501141700001601166700001201182700001701194700001301211700001901224700001501243700001901258773010601277856008501383852000901468655001201477IND60544317120221121012204.0190415e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054431712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2015.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Zheng-Zheng10aTwo new eudesmane sesquiterpenoids from Daucus carota L.  ap. 35-38.  aTwo new eudesmane sesquiterpenoids were isolated from the fruits of Daucus carota L.

In spite of the accumulated knowledge on the systematics of this freshwater ichthyofauna, recent results suggested that we are far from having a complete picture of the Cuban freshwater fish diversity. It is estimated that 40% of freshwater Cuban fish are endemic; however, this number may be even higher. Partial sequences (652 bp) of the mitochondrial gene COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) were used to barcode 126 individuals, representing 27 taxonomically recognized species in 17 genera and 10 families. Analysis was based on Kimura 2‐parameter genetic distances, and for four genera a character‐based analysis (population aggregation analysis) was also used. The mean conspecific, congeneric and confamiliar genetic distances were 0.6%, 9.1% and 20.2% respectively. Molecular species identification was in concordance with current taxonomical classification in 96.4% of cases, and based on the neighbour‐joining trees, in all but one instance, members of a given genera clustered within the same clade. Within the genus Gambusia, genetic divergence analysis suggests that there may be at least four cryptic species. In contrast, low genetic divergence and a lack of diagnostic sites suggest that Rivulus insulaepinorum may be conspecific with Rivulus cylindraceus. Distance and character‐based analysis were completely concordant, suggesting that they complement species identification. Overall, the results evidenced the usefulness of the DNA barcodes for cataloguing Cuban freshwater fish species and for identifying those groups that deserve further taxonomic attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aGambusia 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aspecies identification 3aCuba1 aPONCE de LEÓN, JOSÉ LUIS1 aRODRÍGUEZ, RODET1 aCASANE, DIDIER1 aCôté, Guillaume,1 aBERNATCHEZ, LOUIS1 aGARCÍA‐MACHADO, ERIK0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2010 May, v. 10, no. 3 p.421-430dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02785.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02307naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245005200207300001600259520125200275592002801527650001101555650003001566650002401596650002201620650002101642653002601663653002301689653002301712700002101735700002901756773009001785856008501875852000901960655001201969IND60724113520221123045304.0220207e20210430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072411352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2020.12.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolladay, Mat1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2990-215810aInteratomic forces breaking carbon-carbon bonds  ap. 420-428.  aWe compare computational methods for determining the force between carbon atoms as a function of bond length, in order to establish which ones are capable of accurately simulating carbon-carbon bonds breaking due to applied mechanical strain in nanomaterials. Results from Tight-binding, density-functional theory and molecular mechanics potentials are compared to Møller-Plesset perturbation theory and complete-active-space self-consistent-field method through application to bond breaking in small molecules. Of the two molecular mechanics and three tight-binding parameter sets chosen only DFTB3 gives results which are broadly similar to those from the first-principles methods; the others fail to give physically meaningful variation of the forces with internuclear separation. This method and the molecular mechanics potentials are then applied to a periodic carbon nanoribbon under tensile strain. The molecular mechanics methods fail even qualitatively to reproduce the single catastrophic failure shortly after the peak stress indicated by DFTB3. This shows the importance of the electronic behaviour for the carbon-carbon interatomic forces relevant to the determination of the mechanical strength of materials at atomic-length scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adensity functional theory 3amathematical theory 3amechanical stress 3atensile strength 0aMechanical properties 0aCarbon nanoribbons 0aMaterial modelling1 aScarpa, Fabrizio1 aAllan, N.

SB was the most effective compound and it was further tested in trials simulating postharvest industrial applications. Dip treatments for 60s with 3% (w/v) SB heated above 50°C resulted in about 90% reduction of green and blue mold incidence on ‘Valencia’ oranges inoculated, treated, and incubated at 20°C and 90% RH for 7 days. This treatment was also effective on ‘Lanelate’ oranges, ‘Fino’ lemons and ‘Ortanique’ mandarins, but not on ‘Clemenules’ mandarins. Heated solutions combining SB with low doses (25 or 50μLL−1) of the fungicide imazalil (IMZ) were synergistic and greatly improved the efficacy of stand-alone treatments. On ‘Valencia’ oranges stored for 8 weeks at 5°C followed by 7 days of shelf-life at 20°C, this combination reduced the incidence of green and blue molds almost by 100%. It was found in additional trials to test the preventive activity that 3% SB dips at 50°C for 60s did not reduce green mold on ‘Valencia’ oranges treated, inoculated with P. digitatum 24h later, and incubated at 20°C for 7 days. It can be concluded from this work that heated SB aqueous solutions might be in the future an interesting nonpolluting disease control alternative for the commercialization of citrus in markets with zero tolerance to fungicide residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aPenicillium digitatum 3aPenicillium italicum 3aaqueous solutions 3acommercialization 3adehydroacetic acid 3adisease control 3aethylene 3afood additives 3afungicide residues 3aimazalil 3ain vivo studies 3aindustrial applications 3alemons 3amandarins 3amarkets 3aoranges 3ashelf life 3asodium acetate 3asodium benzoate 3azero tolerance 0aPenicillium digitatum 0aP. italicum 0aSodium benzoate 0aDehydroacetic acid 0aDimethyl dicarbonate 0aEthylene diamine tetracetic acid 0aSodium acetate1 aMoscoso-Ramírez, Pedro A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3056-80621 aPalou, Lluís,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9385-68140 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2016 May, v. 115 p.72-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2015.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006100163300001800224520156700242592002801809650001301837650001301850650001901863650001301882650001001895650001201905650001001917650001601927650001901943650001401962650002201976650002001998700001802018773010802036856008102144852000902225655001202234IND60081829320221121044906.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008182932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-014-0921-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Xuxiao10aBioremediation of atrazine: recent advances and promises  ap. 1727-1737.  aPURPOSE: Atrazine is one of the most widely used herbicides to control broadleaf and grassy weeds for many crops in the world. Its contamination has become a growing public concern because atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide in soil and groundwater. Studies have indicated that atrazine may cause damages to the central nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system. The aim of this review was to update our understanding of recent development of atrazine bioremediation for its improved application. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioremediation, an economical and eco-friendly approach, has emerged as the most advantageous technique for cleaning up atrazine contamination in soil and water. A large number of atrazine-degrading bacteria and fungi have been isolated. The genetic pathways for atrazine remediation/detoxification have been well characterized in bacteria, fungi, and plants. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: To enhance bioremediation, transgenic microbes and plants expressing atrazine-degrading enzymes have been developed. Co-application of transgenic microbes and transgenic plants has been proposed to get synergistic effect for bioremediation of atrazine. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, although effective bioremediation methods of atrazine removal have been successfully employed, it should be noted that there has been a series of disappointing failures, along with tremendous successes in the laboratory. Overall, future research should be geared toward narrowing the gaps between bioremediation in laboratory and environmental applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrazine 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3acleaning 3acrops 3aenzymes 3afungi 3agrass weeds 3asoil pollution 3asynergism 3atransgenic plants 3awater pollution1 aSong, Fuqiang0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2014 Oct., v. 14, no. 10 p.1727-1737dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-014-0921-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245008200194300001600276500002000292520101300312592002801325650002201353650002201375650002001397650002001417650001301437650001301450650001201463650001801475700002101493773012601514852000901640856008901649655001201738IND4432333920221119122106.0210101e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443233392DNAL7 a215650332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02733.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGOMPERT, ZACHARIAH10aintrogress: a software package for mapping components of isolation in hybrids  ap. 378-384.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA new software package (introgress) provides functions for analysing introgression of genotypes between divergent, hybridizing lineages, including estimating genomic clines from multi‐locus genotype data and testing for deviations from neutral expectations. The software works with co‐dominant, dominant and haploid marker data, and does not require fixed allelic differences between parental populations for the sampled genetic markers. Permutation and parametric procedures generate neutral expectations for introgression and provide a basis for significance tests of observed genomic clines.

Moreover, most do not target the different groups of microorganisms involved in respiratory diseases (fungi, bacteria, dust mites).In our study, ten specific qPCR targets (6 fungal species, 1 family and 2 genera of bacteria, 1 house dust mite) were used to analyze the microorganism composition of electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC) from 3193 dwellings of the Elfe French cohort study.Multivariate analyses allowed us to show that the microbial composition of dwellings, assessed with simultaneous analysis of 10 microorganisms, can be characterized by four entities: three bacteria, house dust mite Dermatophagoïdes pteronyssinus, fungi Alternaria alternata, and five other molds.Some dwellings' intrinsic characteristics (occupational ratio, type of dwelling and presence of pets) clearly influence microorganism distribution, and six different profiles of dwellings, characterized by their composition in microorganisms, have been described across France.The use of these clusters seems promising in the evaluation of allergic risk. Allergic respiratory diseases will develop in the near future in some children of the Elfe cohort and will indicate to what extent our approach can be predictive of respiratory disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3abacteria 3achildren 3adust 3adust mites 3afungi 3ahypersensitivity 3amicrobiological quality 3apets 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk 0aElfe cohort 0aElectrostatic dust fall collector (EDC) 0aDwelling qPCR profiles 0aMicroorganism geographical location 0aRespiratory disorders1 aReboux, G.1 aFrossard, V.1 aScherer, E.1 aValot, B.1 aLaboissière, A.1 aZaros, C.1 aVacheyrou, M.1 aGillet, F.1 aRoussel, S.1 aRaherison, C.1 aMillon, L.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 505 p.1026-1035dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03844naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013200165300001800297520227700315592002802592650002202620650002902642650001202671650002002683650002302703650001602726650001302742650001702755650001702772650002202789650001102811650002502822650001002847650001002857650002002867650001802887650001502905650001102920650002402931650000902955650000902964650001702973651001002990700002103000700001303021700002203034700001603056700002003072773010803092856008103200852000903281655001203290IND60081829520221121044902.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008182952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-014-0928-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Xing-Yue10aRare earth elements: a potential proxy for identifying the lacustrine sediment source and soil erosion intensity in karst areas  ap. 1693-1702.  aPURPOSE: The geochemistry of rare earth elements (REEs) taken from the sediments of a karst lake was analyzed to track the provenance of the sediments and the history of soil erosion in the Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve (JNR) in Sichuan Province in southwest China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The REE concentrations of 177 samples including 150 lake sediments, 13 soils, 8 loess, 3 carbonate rocks, and 3 water were determined using a quadruple inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Q-ICP-MS). The grain size distributions of 139 sediment samples were measured using a Malvern Master Size 2000 laser particle size analyzer. The carbonate contents of 159 sediment samples were determined using a gasometric method. The dried remains after reaction with HCl were defined as acid-insoluble residues. The mineral composition of the sediments was measured using a Philips X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The lake sediments in the JNR exhibit features similar to those of the neighboring soils, i.e., enriched REE content, a greater ratio of light REEs to heavy REEs, greater δCe values, and lower δEu values relative to those in the carbonate rocks. The REE signatures in the silt and sand fractions of the sediments are similar to those in the soils and carbonate rocks, respectively. The REE content, LREE/HREE, and δCe values in the sediments strongly negatively correlate with the carbonate content, indicating an intense carbonate effect on the REE geochemistry. The content of acid-insoluble residues is obviously positively correlated with ∑REEs in the sediments, and a negative relationship is observed between ∑REEs and the ratio of calcite to quartz in the sediments. CONCLUSIONS: The sediments in the JNR originate from eroded soils and authigenic travertine deposits in the lakes. It is proposed that the increased ∑REEs in the sediments resulted from the elevated proportion of soil particles in lacustrine deposits was due to increasing soil erosion intensity. This hypothesis is evidenced by the coupling of ∑REEs with the intensity of soil erosion and anthropogenic activities in the JNR. In karst drainage, the total REE concentration might be a potentially powerful indicator for reconstructing the history of soil erosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanthropogenic activities 3acalcite 3acarbonate rocks 3aconservation areas 3acorrelation 3adrainage 3aeroded soils 3ageochemistry 3ahydrochloric acid 3akarsts 3alacustrine sediments 3alakes 3aloess 3amineral content 3aparticle size 3aprovenance 3aquartz 3arare earth elements 3asand 3asilt 3asoil erosion 3aChina1 aHuang, Zhengmin,1 aTang, Ya1 aGong-Bo, Suo-Lang1 aHu, Xin-Xin1 aWang, Zhang-Wen0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2014 Oct., v. 14, no. 10 p.1693-1702dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-014-0928-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009500168300001600263520090800279592002801187650001201215650001401227650001401241650001401255650001401269650001801283650002501301650001401326651001601340653002501356653002101381653000901402653001501411653002501426653001701451653003201468700002401500700002201524700001701546700002201563773011601585856008001701852000901781655001201790IND60624155420221116154735.0181201e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062415542DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336083211322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Juergen M.14aThe Mini Nutritional Assessment®—Its History, Today's Practice, and Future Perspectives  ap. 388-396.  aIn the early 1990s, the Mini Nutritional Assessment® (MNA; Nestle Nutrition, Vevey, Switzerland) was developed for nutrition screening in the elderly. Since then, it became the most established and widespread screening tool for older persons and has been translated into many different languages. The MNA shows prognostic relevance with regard to functionality, morbidity, and mortality of the elderly in different settings. This article recalls the development of the MNA with its short form (MNA-SF) and reviews the literature, focusing on the most recent publications. Specific features of the application of the MNA in different settings (community, nursing home, hospital) are considered. Minor shortcomings of the tool, such as the resources and the cooperation necessary for completion of the MNA, are discussed. Future options for the adaptation of this valuable tool are briefly characterized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelderly 3ahospitals 3alanguages 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anursing homes 3anutrition assessment 3ascreening 3aSwitzerland 0anutrition assessment 0anutrition status 0aaged 0ageriatrics 0ageriatric assessment 0amalnutrition 0aprotein-energy malnutrition1 aKaiser, Matthias J.1 aAnthony, Patricia1 aGuigoz, Yves1 aSieber, Cornel C.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 23, no. 4 p.388-396dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336083211323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245012600171506002800297520165100325592002801976506003702004650002102041650001002062650001402072650002702086650002102113650001602134650001902150650001502169650001102184650001202195650002102207650001702228650001802245650001302263650001302276651001402289653002102303653002902324653001102353653001002364653001802374700001902392773009202411856008002503852000902583655001202592IND60764518520221207082600.0170329e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076451852DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1801342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSYAHID, SITTI FATIMAH10aShort Communication: Morpho-agronomic characteristics of twelve accessions of white turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria) germplasm  aResource is Open Access  aSyahid SF, Heryanto R.2017. Short Communication: Morpho-agronomic characteristics of twelve accessions of white turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria) germplasm. Biodiversitas 18: 269-274.White turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria Rosc.) is a potential medicinal plant belong to the family Zingiberaceae. This plant has a good market because of its high demand as raw material for herbal medicine, such as to cure cancer. A germplasm collection of white turmeric collected from different areas of Indonesia is available at Cicurug Research Station of Sukabumi, West Java, Indonesia. Information on characteristics of the accessions, however, are not available yet. This study aimed to determine morphological characters, growth, and yield of 12 accessions of white turmeric. The research was conducted at the Cicurug Research Station from January 2014 to March 2015. Rhizome section of each accession was grown in a 2.5 m x 3.5 m plot at 50 cm x 50 cm plant spacing. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Parameters observed were morphological characters (type of stem, leaf tip, leaf base, leaf shape, stem color, blade color), growth (number of tillers, plant height, number of leaf/stem, leaf length, leaf width, leaf thickness) and yield (rhizome weight, rhizome length, rhizome width, and rhizome thickness) respectively. The results showed that morphological characters, growth, and yields of the 12 accessions observed were varied. All of the characters observed could be evaluated further to determine the important traits.

Recently, we demonstrated that CaMKKβ is feedback phosphorylated at Thr144 by the downstream AMPK, resulting in the conversion of CaMKKβ into Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme. However, the regulatory phosphorylation of CaMKKβ at Thr144 in intact cells and in vivo remains unclear.Anti-phosphoThr144 antibody was used to characterize the site-specific phosphorylation of CaMKKβ in immunoprecipitated samples from mouse cerebellum and in transfected mammalian cells that were treated with various agonists and protein kinase inhibitors. CaMKK activity assay and LC-MS/MS analysis were used for biochemical characterization of phosphorylated CaMKKβ.Our data suggest that the phosphorylation of Thr144 in CaMKKβ is rapidly induced by cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling in CaMKKβ-transfected HeLa cells, that is physiologically relevant in mouse cerebellum. We confirmed that the catalytic subunit of PKA was capable of directly phosphorylating CaMKKβ at Thr144 in vitro and in transfected cells. In addition, the basal phosphorylation of CaMKKβ at Thr144 in transfected HeLa cells was suppressed by AMPK inhibitor (compound C). PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation reduced the autonomous activity of CaMKKβ in vitro without significant effect on the Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity, resulting in the conversion of CaMKKβ into Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme.cAMP/PKA signaling may confer Ca2+-dependency to the CaMKKβ-mediated signaling pathway through direct phosphorylation of Thr144 in intact cells.Our results suggest a novel cross-talk between cAMP/PKA and Ca2+/CaM/CaMKKβ signaling through regulatory phosphorylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantibodies 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3acerebellum 3acyclic AMP 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ahuman cell lines 3aliquid chromatography 3amice 3aneurons 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein subunits 3asignal transduction 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aCaMKKβ 0aAID 0aCaM 0aCaMK 0aAMPK 0aPKA 0aCDK5 0aGSK3 0aDAPK 0aCaMKK 0aPKA 0aPhosphorylation 0aIntracellular Ca2+ 0aCalmodulin 0aSignal transduction1 aOhtsuka, Satomi1 aSugawara, Takeyuki1 aHatano, Naoya1 aKanayama, Naoki1 aMagari, Masaki1 aSakagami, Hiroyuki1 aTokumitsu, Hiroshi0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Apr., v. 1863, no. 4 p.672-680dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009800158300001800256520023700274592002800511650002700539650002300566650002300589650001700612650002200629650001100651650001200662650001300674650003300687650001300720700001800733700002100751700002300772700002200795700002600817700001700843700002400860700001900884700002500903700003000928773013200958856007501090852000901165655001201174IND60658843720221119094645.0190826e20110207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065884372DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc04457a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRotili, Dante10aPhotoactivable peptides for identifying enzyme–substrate and protein–protein interactions  ap. 1488-1490.  aPhotoactivated cross-linking of peptides to proteins is a useful strategy for identifying enzyme–substrate and protein–protein interactions in cell lysates as demonstrated by studies on the human hypoxia inducible factor system.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme substrates 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3apeptides 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins1 aAltun, Mikael1 aHamed, Refaat B.1 aLoenarz, Christoph1 aThalhammer, Armin1 aHopkinson, Richard J.1 aTian, Ya-Min1 aRatcliffe, Peter J.1 aMai, Antonello1 aKessler, Benedikt M.1 aSchofield, Christopher J.0 tChemical communications.g2011 Feb. 7, v. 47, no. 5 p.1488-1490dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc04457a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03808naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012200161300002000283520216000303592002802463650001602491650001902507650001702526650001002543650000902553650002302562650002102585650001602606650001802622650001902640650001402659650001902673650001702692650001402709650001202723653002002735653002802755653002102783653002502804653002302829700001902852700002002871700001202891700001902903700001702922700001702939700001302956700001602969700001502985700001503000773012603015856008003141852000903221655001203230IND60555364620221119224339.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b101322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ningning10aEnhanced Radiosensitization of Gold Nanospikes via Hyperthermia in Combined Cancer Radiation and Photothermal Therapy  ap. 28480-28494.  aMetallic nanostructures as excellent candidates for nanosensitizers have shown enormous potentials in cancer radiotherapy and photothermal therapy. Clinically, a relatively low and safe radiation dose is highly desired to avoid damage to normal tissues. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the low-dosed X-ray radiation and other therapeutic approaches (or so-called “combined therapeutic strategy”) is needed. Herein, we have synthesized hollow and spike-like gold nanostructures by a facile galvanic replacement reaction. Such gold nanospikes (GNSs) with low cytotoxicity exhibited high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 50.3%) and had excellent photostability under cyclic near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiations. We have demonstrated that these GNSs can be successfully used for in vitro and in vivo X-ray radiation therapy and NIR photothermal therapy. For the in vitro study, colony formation assay clearly demonstrated that GNS-mediated photothermal therapy and X-ray radiotherapy reduced the cell survival fraction to 89% and 51%, respectively. In contrast, the cell survival fraction of the combined radio- and photothermal treatment decreased to 33%. The synergistic cancer treatment performance was attributable to the effect of hyperthermia, which efficiently enhanced the radiosensitizing effect of hypoxic cancer cells that were resistant to ionizing radiation. The sensitization enhancement ratio (SER) of GNSs alone was calculated to be about 1.38, which increased to 1.63 when the GNS treatment was combined with the NIR irradiation, confirming that GNSs are effective radiation sensitizers to enhance X-ray radiation effect through hyperpyrexia. In vivo tumor growth study indicated that the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in the synergistically treated group reached 92.2%, which was much higher than that of the group treated with the GNS-enhanced X-ray radiation (TGI = 29.8%) or the group treated with the GNS-mediated photothermal therapy (TGI = 70.5%). This research provides a new method to employ GNSs as multifunctional nanosensitizers for synergistic NIR photothermal and X-ray radiation therapy in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afever 3agold 3agrowth retardation 3ain vitro studies 3airradiation 3ananomaterials 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphotostability 3aradiotherapy 3asynergism 3atissues 0agold nanospikes 0aX-ray radiation therapy 0aradiosensitizing 0aphotothermal therapy 0asynergistic effect1 aJiang, Yao-Wen1 aZhang, Xiaodong1 aWu, Hao1 aMyers, John N.1 aLiu, Peidang1 aJin, Haizhen1 aGu, Ning1 aHe, Nongyue1 aWu, Fu-Gen1 aChen, Zhan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.28480-28494dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b101323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008300164300001800247520069900265592002800964650001300992650001801005650001401023650002201037650001601059650000901075650002901084650003601113700001501149700001501164700001501179700002001194773009001214856008501304852000901389655001201398IND60098367620221119223354.0141104e20120405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009836762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2012.02.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Yu10aTLR-induced NF-κB activation regulates NLRP3 expression in murine macrophages  ap. 1022-1026.  aNLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in the activation of caspase-1 and maturation of IL-1β. However, the specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements that determine the extent of NLRP3 expression are not well defined. In this study, we found NLRP3 expression was induced by TLR agonists in murine macrophages in a NF-κB dependent manner. Furthermore, the corresponding NF-κB binding sites (nt −1303 to −1292 and −1238 to −1228) were identified in the NLRP3 promoter. Finally, EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrated LPS-induced NF-κB binding to the NLRP3 promoter. Therefore, out results delineated the molecular mechanisms involved in TLR-induced transcriptional regulation of NLRP3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3abinding sites 3acaspase-1 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amacrophages 3amice 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aWang, Peng1 aQi, Jianni1 aZhang, Lei1 aGao, Chengjiang0 tFEBS letters.g2012 Apr. 5, v. 586, no. 7 p.1022-1026dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.02.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010500171300001600276520166500292536021301957592002802170596006202198650004402260650002502304650001502329650001202344650001302356653001702369653002602386653001802412653002102430700001902451700001602470700002902486700002002515700002602535773012402561856008502685852000902770655001202779IND60702339120221120061520.0200717e20200807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070233912DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2020.17730372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiłek, Michał14aThe use of infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis for the quick detection of adulterated beeswax  ap. 677-684.  aBeeswax samples of different origins were evaluated for their authenticity by infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) method was used for the genuineness assessment and the melting process was examined using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method. Eight suspicious beeswax samples delivered by local beekeepers were examined. As reference standards, pure authentic beeswax standards, pure paraffin, and wax-paraffin blends were used. The comparison of the infrared spectra of tested wax samples and references allowed the identification of adulterated wax samples based on the differences in the spectra fingerprint region (700 to 1800 cm⁻¹), especially 1170 and 1735 cm⁻¹ bands. Moreover, the ratio of the 1735 and 2850 cm⁻¹ band area (lower than 0.5) was used as an indicator of wax adulteration. Among the 8 samples studied, 3 were found to have been falsified with paraffin. The thermal analysis confirmed the adulteration of the same wax samples. The melting temperatures determined in these cases were lower (52.3 to 57.7) as compared to other samples (63.1 to 65.9), identified as real beeswax by comparison to standards (63.8 to 64.7). A similar tendency during the re-heating of cooled wax samples was observed, which suggested the addition of paraffin or another substance with a lower melting point to adulterated waxes. The methods used in this research (FT-IR and DSC) allowed for a relatively quick, easy, and inexpensive verification of the authenticity of the beeswax. Such a method can be used as a screening step before a comprehensive GC analysis of beeswax.  aThis work was supported by the project financed under the program of the Minister of Science and Higher Education entitled “Regional Initiative of Excellence” in 2019–2022 (project no. 026/RID/2018/19).  aPublisher supplied data  a026/RID/2018/19cMinister of Science and Higher Education 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadulterated products 3aapiculture 3abeeswax 3aresearch 0aadulteration 0ainfrared spectroscopy 0amelting point 0athermal analysis1 aDrogoń, Agata1 aPyda, Marek1 aCzerniecka-Kubicka, Anna1 aTomczyk, Monika1 aDżugan, Małgorzata,0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2020 Aug. 7, v. 59, no. 4 p.677-684dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2020.17730373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01271naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245005900154300001600213520040300229592002800632650002100660650001900681650001200700650001500712650001000727650001400737651001200751700001800763773009600781856007100877852000900948655001200957IND60518520620221120060742.0160418e197003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051852062DNAL7 a10.2307/19336722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOphel, I.

This is a template-free and facile method easy for scale-up production of hierarchical 3D micro-/nano-structured V2O5 spheres beneficial for high performance LIBs applications. Such a facile method resulted hierarchical 3D micro-/nano-V2O5 possess many unique features good for LIBs: (1) 2D V2O5 nanosheets facilitate the Li+ diffusions and electron transports; (2) hierarchical 3D micro-/nano-cathode structure built up by V2O5 nanosheet spheres will lead to the close and sufficient contact between electrolytes and activate materials and at the same time will create buffer volume to accommodate the volume change during discharging/charging process; and (3) micro-scale V2O5 spheres are easy to result in high cell packing density beneficial for high power battery. As revealed by the experimental results, the micro-/nano-V2O5 electrode demonstrates high initial discharge and charge capacities with no irreversible loss, high rate capacities at different currents and long-lasting lifespan. The high-energy and high-power performances of the micro-/nano-V2O5 electrode is ascribed to the unique hierarchical micro-/nano-structure merits of V2O5 spheres as abovementioned. In view of the advantages of facile fabrication method and unique features of 3D micro-/nano-V2O5 spheres for high power and high energy LIB battery, it is of great significance to beneficially broaden the applications of high-energy and high-power LIBs with creating novel hierarchical micro-/nano-structured V2O5 cathode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3ahot water treatment 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3alongevity 3amicroparticles 3ananosheets 3atemperature 3avanadium 0aHierarchical 0aHigh energy 0aHigh power 0aLithium ion batteries 0aMicro-/nano-vanadium pentoxide1 aLiu, Zhaoyang1 aSun, D.

Soybean-fat emulsions provided as part of standard parenteral nutrition may contribute to its pathophysiology. Methods: The authors compared safety and efficacy outcomes of a fish-oil-based fat emulsion in 18 infants with short-bowel syndrome who developed cholestasis (serum direct bilirubin level of >2 mg/dL) while receiving soybean emulsions with those from a historical cohort of 21 infants with short-bowel syndrome who also developed cholestasis while receiving soybean emulsions. The primary end point was time to reversal of cholestasis (3 consecutive measurements of serum direct bilirubin level of >2 mg/dL). Results: Among survivors, the median time to reversal of cholestasis was 9.4 and 44.1 weeks in the fish-oil and historical cohorts, respectively. Subjects who received fish-oil-based emulsion experienced reversal of cholestasis 4.8 times faster than those who received soybean emulsions and 6.8 times faster in analysis adjusted for baseline bilirubin concentration, gestational age, and the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. A total of 2 deaths and 0 liver transplantations were recorded in the fish-oil cohort and 7 deaths and 2 transplantations in the historical cohort. The provision of fish-oil-based fat emulsion was not associated with essential fatty acid deficiency, hypertriglyceridemia, coagulopathy, infections, or growth delay. Conclusions: Parenteral fish-oil-based fat emulsions are safe and may be effective in the treatment of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3achildren 3acholestasis 3aemulsions 3aenterocolitis 3aessential fatty acids 3agestational age 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3ainfants 3aliver diseases 3aparenteral feeding 3apathophysiology 3asoybeans0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 23, no. 4 p.445-446dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336083211353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01633naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009000170300001800260520063000278592002800908650001700936650002400953650001700977650002600994650002501020650001101045700002601056700002001082700002101102773009001123856008501213852000901298655001201307IND60098367820221119223159.0141104e20120405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009836782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2012.02.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Sook-San14aThe dengue virus M protein localises to the endoplasmic reticulum and forms oligomers  ap. 1032-1037.  aThe dengue virus membrane (M) protein is a key component of the mature virion.

Graphene films were directly deposited on quartz substrates by assisted catalysis of Cu nanoparticles in ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition. Growth conditions, including the concentration of Cu nanoparticles as catalyst, flow rate of CH₄, temperature and growth time, were systematically investigated to optimize the quality and performance of graphene TCFs. With the optimized growth conditions, the obtained graphene TCFs exhibit good performance with sheet resistance of 2.48 kΩ sq⁻¹ at transmittance of 82.83%. With this method, graphene TCFs with good performance were obtained without the need of a complex transfer process of graphene, opening a considerable route toward fabricating graphene TCFs on dielectric substrates.  aPublisher supplied data  a61205177cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aambient pressure 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper nanoparticles 3agraphene 3aindium tin oxide 3amethane 3aquartz 3atemperature 3atransmittance 3avapors1 aLiu, Liyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1832-02751 aZhang, Xiaoling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4620-22171 aCheng, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4448-49781 aHuang, Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4568-34451 aShan, Yongkui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2119-656X1 aZhao, Qingbiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0739-72611 aZhang, Ganghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3603-68791 aLi, Dezeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7727-55770 tJournal of materials science.g2019 July, v. 54, no. 14 p.10312-10324dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-019-03621-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006300172300001400235520129500249592002801544596003801572650001401610650001001624650001501634650001201649650002301661650001701684650001501701650001301716650001001729650001101739653002101750653001001771653001201781653001401793653001501807700002301822773010601845856008601951852000902037655001202046IND60596411320221118021545.0200430e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059641132DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2016.12768562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZungu, Manqoba M10aEffects of ethanol on fruit selection by frugivorous birds  ap. 69-72.  aEthanol is a natural by-product of the fermentation process of fruit sugars. Its production started with the advent of fleshy fruits, which suggests a long-term association between ethanol and frugivores. Consequently, one suggestion is that because frugivores could use its odour to locate fruiting plants, they should show a preference for fruit with high ethanol concentrations. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by determining whether frugivorous birds show a preference for fruit laden with alcohol at levels equivalent to those of overripe fruits. Three species of frugivorous bird species were used for this study: the Cape White-eye (Zosterops virens), Speckled Mousebird (Colius striatus) and Red-winged Starling (Onychognathus morio). Birds were provided with two artificial fruit diets in pairwise choice tests: an experimental diet containing 1% ethanol and a control diet with no ethanol. For all species, no significant differences were observed in the amount of artificial fruit consumed between the food types. Given that the concentration of ethanol used in the study is assumed to represent that of overripe fruit, these results, in conjunction with previous studies, suggest that birds do not show a preference for fruits with high ethanol concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Research Foundation (ZA) 3aZosterops 3abirds 3abyproducts 3aethanol 3aexperimental diets 3afermentation 3afrugivores 3afruiting 3aodors 3asugars 0aartificial fruit 0abirds 0aethanol 0afrugivore 0apreference1 aDowns, Colleen T.,0 tAfrican zoology.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 52, no. 1 p.69-72dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2016.12768563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245012800170300001600298520169200314592002802006650001102034650001702045650001602062650001602078650002702094650003002121650001402151650001202165650002302177650002602200650002602226650001002252650001902262650001302281650002302294650001402317650001102331650002302342650001302365650001602378650001602394650001702410653002902427653001502456653001602471653001702487653002502504653002502529653001602554700001802570700001802588700002102606700002002627700002002647700002002667773011602687856008002803852000902883655001202892IND60624155920221116154703.0181201e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062415592DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336083211382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHallikainen, Maarit10aEffect of Parenteral Serum Plant Sterols on Liver Enzymes and Cholesterol Metabolism in a Patient With Short Bowel Syndrome  ap. 429-435.  aHepatobiliary complications are common during parenteral nutrition. Lipid moiety in commercially available solutions contains plant sterols. It is not known whether plant sterols in parenteral nutrition interfere with hepatic function in adults. We detected how different amounts of plant sterols in parenteral nutrition solution affected serum plant sterol concentrations and liver enzymes during a 1.5-year follow-up in a patient with short bowel syndrome. Serum lipid, plant sterol, and liver enzyme levels were measured regularly during the transition from Intralipid (100% soy-based intravenous fat emulsion) to ClinOleic (an olive oil–based intravenous fat emulsion with 80% olive oil, 20% soy oil and lower plant sterols); the lipid supply was also gradually increased from 20 to 35 g/d. Plant sterols in parenteral nutrition solution and serum were measured with gas-liquid chromatography. During infusion of soy-based intravenous fat emulsion (30 g/d, total plant sterols 87 mg/d), the concentrations of sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol were 4361, 1387, and 378 μg/dL, respectively, and serum liver enzyme values were ≥ 2.5 times above upper limit of normal. After changing to olive oil–based intravenous fat emulsion (20-35 g/d, plant sterols 37-65 mg/d), concentrations decreased to 2148 to 2251 μg/dL for sitosterol, 569-297 μg/dL for campesterol, and 95-55 μg/dL for stigmasterol. Concomitantly, liver enzyme values decreased to 1.4 to 1.8 times above upper limit of normal at the end of follow-up. The nutrition status of the patient improved. The amount of plant sterols in lipid emulsion affects serum liver enzyme levels more than the amount of lipid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acampesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3adigestive system diseases 3aemulsions 3aenzymes 3agas chromatography 3aintravenous injection 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3aliver function 3amoieties 3anutritional status 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 3asitosterols 3asoybean oil 3astigmasterol 0aintravenous fat emulsion 0asitosterol 0acampesterol 0astigmasterol 0ashort bowel syndrome 0aparenteral nutrition 0acholestasis1 aHuikko, Laura1 aKontra, Kirsi1 aNissinen, Markku1 aPiironen, Vieno1 aMiettinen, Tatu1 aGylling, Helena0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 23, no. 4 p.429-435dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336083211383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245009100168300002000259520113400279592002801413650001201441650001701453650002501470650002601495650002101521650001301542650001301555650002101568650002001589650001201609650001701621653001201638653001401650653001501664653001701679653001501696653001601711700002001727700002001747700002401767700002001791773012601811856008001937852000902017655001202026IND60555365020221119224311.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536502DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b102482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeador, Mary Ann B.10aMoisture-Resistant Polyimide Aerogels Containing Propylene Oxide Links in the Backbone  ap. 29073-29079.  aPolyimide aerogels made using anhydride-capped oligomers from 4,4′-oxydianiline (ODA) and 3,3′,4,4′-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) cross-linked with 1,3,5-tri(aminophenoxy)benzene (TAB) have been reported with very good mechanical properties but poor resistance to moisture. Replacing 50 mol % of the ODA with poly(propylene glycol)bis(2-aminopropyl ether) (PPG) with an average molecular weight of 230 g/mol in the oligomer backbone gives aerogels with water contact angles of 80°. The aerogels also absorb very little moisture on soaking in water. The aerogels also shrink less with increasing PPG concentration and therefore have significantly lower density and higher porosity than those made without PPG. Mechanical properties of the aerogels increased with increasing density, regardless of the polymer backbone. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the aerogels studied ranged from 300 to 400 m²/g, depending mainly on PPG concentration. The high moisture resistance makes them promising materials for substrates for lightweight antennas as well as insulation for a variety of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acrosslinking 3ainsulating materials 3amechanical properties 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3aporosity 3apropylene glycol 3apropylene oxide 3asoaking 3asurface area 0aaerogel 0apolyimide 0amesoporous 0across-linked 0ainsulation 0ahydrophobic1 aAgnello, Marika1 aMcCorkle, Linda1 aVivod, Stephanie

The paradigms for success in the treatment of childhood leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease, Burkett’s lymphoma, and testicular carcinoma with cytotoxic chemotherapy did not translate to success in solid tumors—the majority of cancers that kill. In contrast, significant success has accrued for patients with breast cancer with antihormone treatments (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) that are proved to enhance survivorship, and remarkably, there are now two approved prevention strategies using either tamoxifen or raloxifene. This was considered impossible 40 years ago. We describe the major clinical advances with nonsteroidal antiestrogens that evolved into selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) which successfully exploited the ER target selectively inside a woman’s body. The standard paradigm that estrogen stimulates breast cancer growth has been successfully exploited for over 4 decades with therapeutic strategies that block (tamoxifen, raloxifene) or reduce (aromatase inhibitors) circulating estrogens in patients to stop breast tumor growth. But this did not explain why high-dose estrogen treatment that was the standard of care to treat postmenopausal breast cancer for 3 decades before tamoxifen caused tumor regression. This paradox was resolved with the discovery that breast cancer resistance to long-term estrogen deprivation causes tumor regression with physiologic estrogen through apoptosis. The new biology of estrogen action has been utilized to explain the findings in the Women’s Health Initiative that conjugated equine estrogen alone given to postmenopausal women, average age 68, will produce a reduction of breast cancer incidence and mortality compared to no treatment. Estrogen is killing nascent breast cancer cells in the ducts of healthy postmenopausal women. The modulation of the ER using multifunctional medicines called SERMs has provided not only significant improvements in women’s health and survivorship not anticipated 40 years ago but also has been the catalyst to enhance our knowledge of estrogen’s apoptotic action that can be further exploited in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aaromatase 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinoma 3acatalysts 3achildhood 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogens 3ahorses 3aleukemia 3alymphoma 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3apostmenopause 3aremission 3asurvival rate 3atamoxifen 3awomen1 aMaximov, Philipp Y.1 aJordan, V.

Here, we analysed, for the first time, NUMTs in the ovine genome. We obtained 760 alignment matches covering 513.8 kbp of the sheep nuclear genome. After a merging step, we identified 390 NUMT regions with a total length of ~720 kbp, representing 0.02% of the nuclear genome. We discovered copies of all mitochondrial regions and found that most NUMT regions are intergenic or intronic. Ovine NUMTs are mostly not transcribed. However, we identified within some of the NUMTs, potential new genes encoding nuclear humanin isoforms. To rule out the possibility that the identified NUMTs could be artifacts of the Oar Rambouillet v1.0 genome assembly, we validated experimentally nine NUMT regions by PCR amplification. As we found several NUMT regions showing high similarity to the mitochondrial genome that potentially could pose a risk to ovine DNA mitochondrial studies, special care must be taken for the selection of primers for PCR amplification of mitochondrial DNA sequences.  aPublisher supplied data  cINRAE 3aRambouillet 3aanimal genetics 3agenome assembly 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3anuclear genome 3arisk 3asheep1 aCharles,cM.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6491-19281 aBoulling, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7747-78761 aRocha, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4998-96410 tAnimal genetics.g2021 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.556-559dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl38565x0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.130963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002200169245010300191300001600294520106700310592002801377650001401405650001401419650002401433650002201457650001401479650001401493650001501507650002001522650002901542650003301571650002401604650004201628650002801670650003601698650002901734650002901763650003201792650001301824650002701837650003801864650005301902650001301955650001601968650001701984700002102001700002002022773008802042856008602130852000902216655001202225IND4467042320221122012658.0141110e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446704232DNAL7 a227218782pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.05.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalihan, Lenny B.10aBrown algae hydrolysis in 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride with mineral acid catalyst system  ap. 545-552.  aThe amenability of three brown algal species, Sargassum fulvellum, Laminaria japonica and Undaria pinnatifida, to hydrolysis were investigated using the ionic liquid (IL), 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl). Compositional analyses of the brown algae reveal that sufficient amounts of sugars (15.5–29.4wt.%) can be recovered. Results from hydrolysis experiments show that careful selection of the type of mineral acid as catalyst and control of acid loading could maximize the recovery of sugars. Optimal reaction time and temperature were determined from the kinetic studies on the sequential reducing sugar (TRS) formation and degradation. Optimal reaction times were determined based on the extent of furfurals formation as TRS degradation products. X-ray diffraction and environmental scanning electron microscopy confirmed the suitability of [BMIM]Cl as solvent for the hydrolysis of the three brown algae. Overall results show the potential of brown algae as renewable energy resources for the production of valuable chemicals and biofuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaminaria 3aSargassum 3aUndaria pinnatifida 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3ahydrolysis 3areducing sugars 3arenewable energy sources 3ascanning electron microscopy 2aAcidsxpharmacology 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxdrug effects 2aCatalysisxdrug effects 2aHydrochloric Acidxpharmacology 2aHydrolysisxdrug effects 2aImidazolesxpharmacology 2aIonic Liquidsxpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aMineralsxpharmacology 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effects 2aPhaeophytaxchemistryxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPressure 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors1 aNisola, Grace M.1 aChung, Wook-Jin0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Aug., v. 118 p.545-552dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.05.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01741naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008300158300001800241520091400259592002801173650000901201650001401210650001001224700002001234700002101254773010401275856007501379852000901454655001201463IND60534094320221122034841.0160802e20130718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053409432DNAL7 a10.1021/ef400396e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFossen, Martin10aEffect of the Pipe Diameter on the Restart Pressure of a Gelled Waxy Crude Oil  ap. 3685-3691.  aRestart pressures for a gelled crude oil were determined experimentally for three pipes with a length of 5.8 m and diameters of 28 mm (1 in.), 55 mm (2 in.), and 82 mm (3 in.). A comparison of extrapolated restart pressure values based on data from a 4.3 mm (0.17 in.) pipe using the same oil was performed. The objective was to investigate the relation between the restart pressure of a gelled crude oil and the pipe diameter used to determine the yield stress used for extrapolation to larger pipe diameters. It was shown that the restart pressure was not proportional to the pipe diameter and that yield stress values obtained from small pipe diameters will overpredict the restart pressure compared to experimental values for larger pipe diameters. As a consequence, extrapolation of restart pressures based on small diameter pipe experiments may lead to very conservative estimations of restart pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apipes1 aØyangen, Terje1 aVelle, Ole Jacob0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 July 18, v. 27, no. 7 p.3685-3691dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef400396e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009000161300001600251520141900267592002801686650001301714650001701727650001201744650002601756650001601782650002301798650002601821650001101847650001201858650001801870650001601888651001001904700002101914773010201935856008102037852000902118655001202127IND60121689720221119084838.0150318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012168972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-014-0416-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhao10aDrought early warning in irrigation area by integrating surface water and groundwater  ap. 145-157.  aThe purpose of this paper is to build a drought early warning system for Jinghuiqu Irrigation Area in China. In former research, the authors (Huang and Yuan Water Resour Res 40(6):W064011–W0640113, 2004, Huang and Chou, Water Resour Res 41:2004W, 2005; Adv Water Resour 31(4):649–660, 2008) have developed the drought early warning system by taking multiple hydrological factors into account the practicality and applicability of the model have been verified by series of case study. As far as irrigation area is concerned, precipitation and groundwater should be considered as important factors. The storage and distribution of groundwater is generally more complicated in a region; groundwater table and aquifer condition could change intensively in different areas; it is difficult to assess the level of drought directly. To deal with this problem, different fuzzy membership functions were put forward in this paper according to fluctuation of the groundwater level in a year, that is, the uprising period and descending period. Precipitation was also discussed in this paper for assessing its effects on current drought situation and future water consumption situation. By taking two typical dry years for examples, it was proved that the drought early warning model can be applied very well for drought early warning and drought management on irrigation area by integrated surface water and groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3adrought 3aearly warning systems 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic factors 3airrigation management 3amodels 3apaddies 3asurface water 3awater table 3aChina1 aHuang, Wen-Cheng0 tPaddy and water environment.g2015 Apr., v. 13, no. 2 p.145-157dSpringer-Verlagx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-014-0416-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001600295520089200311592002801203650001701231650001101248650002401259650001201283650001101295650001401306650002501320650001501345650001501360650001501375651001001390653002201400653000901422653001001431653003201441700002001473773007401493856008401567852000901651655001201660IND60585436520221120121413.0171109e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058543652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.08.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianzhou12aA hybrid forecasting model based on outlier detection and fuzzy time series – A case study on Hainan wind farm of China  ap. 526-541.  aWind energy is regarded as a worldwide renewable and alternative energy that can relieve the energy shortage, reduce environmental pollution, and provide a significant potential economic benefit. In this paper, a hybrid method is developed to properly and efficiently forecast the daily wind speed in Hainan Province, China. The proposed hybrid forecasting model consists of outlier detection and a bivariate fuzzy time series, which provides a more powerful forecasting capacity of daily wind speed than that of traditional single forecasting models. To verify the developed approach, daily wind speed data from January 2008 to December 2012 in Hainan Province, China, are used for model construction and testing. The results show that the developed hybrid forecasting model achieves high forecasting accuracy and is suitable for forecasting the wind energy of China's large wind farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy 3afinancial economics 3ahybrids 3amodels 3apollution 3atime series analysis 3awind farms 3awind power 3awind speed 3aChina 0aOutlier detection 0aARMA 0aBPANN 0aBivariate fuzzy time series1 aXiong, Shenghua0 tEnergy.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 76 p.526-541dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.08.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01323naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245010800154300001600262520051800278592002800796650001200824650002000836650001300856650001200869773009600881856007100977852000901048655001201057IND60518521020221120051757.0160418e197003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051852102DNAL7 a10.2307/19336732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenke, A.

CSN is proposed to widely participate in many physiological processes, including protein degradation, DNA damage response and signal transduction. Among those subunits, only CSN5 and CSN6 belong to JAMM family. CSN5 possesses isopeptidase activity, but CSN6 lacks this ability. Here we report the 2.5Å crystal structure of MPN domain from Drosophila melanogaster CSN6. Structural comparison with other MPN domains, along with bioinformation analysis, suggests that MPN domain from CSN6 may serve as a scaffold instead of a metalloprotease.

A total of 280 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were randomly allocated into 1 of the following 7 experimental treatments (5 replicates per treatment with 8 broilers per pen). Five diets were formulated to contain 0 (control), 3, 4, 5 and 6 g BPC/kg of diet in comparison with control + 50 U excessive dietary vitamin E and control + 2 mg lincomycin. At 40 d the BW tended to improve in broilers supplemented with an antibiotic, 3, 5 and 6 g BPC/kg groups (p > .05).

In the whole trial broilers fed diets supplemented with 6 g BPC/kg had a significantly better FCR value (p < .001). Supplementation of 3 g BPC/kg increased antibody titres against Newcastle disease virus and sheep red blood cell (p < .01). Dietary supplementation of vitamin E, antibiotic, 3, 4 and 5 g BPC/kg significantly (p < .001) increased total antioxidant activity of serum compared with those fed the basal diet. In conclusion, the results indicated that supplementation of 6 g BPC/kg in broiler diets could induce favourable influences on growth performance, immune responses and total antioxidant activity of serum and it could be used in broiler diets as an alternative to antibiotics.HIGHLIGHTSBroilers fed diets supplemented with 6 g bioactive peptides (BPC)/kg had better FCR. Supplementation of BPC increased humoral immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aantibodies 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acottonseed 3adietary supplements 3aerythrocytes 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aintestines 3alincomycin 3amales 3apeptides 3asheep 3avitamin E 0aAntibiotic 0abioactive peptides 0abroiler 0aimmunity 0alincomycin1 aKheiri, Farshid1 aFaghani, Mostafa0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2020 Dec. 14, v. 19, no. 1 p.1375-1386dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2020.18440853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010600164506002800270520154700298592002801845506003701873650001101910650001701921650001001938650001501948650001201963650001701975650001201992650001702004651001402021653002102035653002202056653001002078653001902088700002402107700001202131700002002143700001102163700001702174773009202191856008002283852000902363655001202372IND60764519520221215143048.0211122e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076451952DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2103292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPALUPI, TANTRI10aMorphological and agronomical characters of four black rice varieties from West Kalimantan, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aPalupi T, Pangaribuan F, Hearnes, Riyanto F, Wasian, Zulfita D. 2020. Morphological and agronomical characters of four black rice varieties from West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 1065-1073. The black rice paddy is a variety of rice known to have anthocyanin content which is beneficial to human health. Yet, the black rice paddy is relatively rare to find as not all rice-growing areas develop and plant black rice. West Kalimantan has several potential black rice varieties which are potentials as genetic resources to create a new black rice variety in plant breeding programs. This research was aimed to describe the morphological and agronomical characteristics of four black rice varieties from West Kalimantan, namely Nanga Taman, Mukok, Senakin, and Ensalang. The study was conducted at the experimental garden of Agriculture Faculty, University of Tanjungpura, Pontianak using Completely Randomized Design. Each variety consisted of six replications, and each replication consisted of 3 samples. We observed 12 characters of the vegetative phase and 21 characters of the generative period. The four varieties had similarities in 13 characters and differences in 20 characters. The results showed that the four black rice had superior properties such as the stem angle and the angle of the leaves is upright so that it reduces interference from bird pests. Among them, the Senakin variety had an advantage over the three other varieties in terms of plant height, age, the number of productive tillers, and weight of grains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aanthocyanins 3abirds 3ablack rice 3agardens 3ahuman health 3apaddies 3aplant height 3aIndonesia 0acharacterization 0agenetic resources 0apaddy 0aplant breeding1 aPANGARIBUAN, FRANKY1 aHEARNES1 aRIYANTO, FADJAR1 aWASIAN1 aZULFITA, DWI0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Feb., v. 21, no. 3dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2103293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245006500172300001600237520073100253592002800984650002001012650001401032650002101046650001301067650001401080650001701094700001901111773009801130856009001228990002301318852000901341655001201350IND60113546320221120191639.0141111s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011354632DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-416673-8.00003-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, Julia10aAdherence Rates and Correlates in Long-term Hormonal Therapy  ap. 353-375.  aBreast cancer outcomes have improved markedly in the past few decades, due in part to the use of adjuvant hormonal therapy. To receive the optimal benefits of adjuvant therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), patients need to take these agents orally each day for 5 years. Current evidence indicates that nonadherence is considerable and increases over time and the side effect profiles for tamoxifen and AIs present considerable barriers to optimal adherence. Interventions, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, hold potential to treat adjuvant hormonal treatment side effects and improve adherence. More research and approaches to intervention to enhance the adherence need to be developed and tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aaromatase 3abreast neoplasms 3apatients 3atamoxifen 3atherapeutics1 aGotay, Carolyn0 tVitamins and Hormones.g2013, v. 93 p.353-375dElsevier Science & Technologyx0083-67297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-416673-8.00003-43Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01985naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245010500163520118100268592002801449650001101477650001901488650001301507650001001520773011701530856007501647852000901722655001201731IND60649767620221118033343.0190706e20181207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064976762DNAL7 a10.3390/land70401532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRagkou, Katerina 14aThe Economic Centrality of Urban Centers in the Medieval Peloponnese: Late 11th–Mid-14th Centuries  aThe Peloponnese, a province of the Byzantine Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries, was divided into three distinct political entities after 1204: the Frankish Principality of Achaia, the Venetian colonies of Modon and Coron, and the Byzantine lands in the southeast. The number and size of cities in the Peloponnese during the 11th and 12th centuries expanded, and the establishment of the new political entities of the 13th century did not hinder the development of its urban centers. New urban centers appeared, and the dynamics of the old urban centers witnessed a major shift. The focus of this paper is on port towns, since the majority of the available data derive from them, and aims to investigate the economic centrality of the port towns in the Peloponnese in the context of their environs, economic activities, and their position in the eastern Mediterranean exchange system. The theoretical framework is based on concepts of network theory, centrality, and economic complexity, as well as on a thorough evaluation of the material and textual evidence. In doing so, the economic profile of each central place is reconstructed, as well as a comparison between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3anetwork theory 3apolitics 3atowns0 tLand.g2018 Dec. 07, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land70401533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245006200174300001600236520099200252592002801244650002901272650001401301650001501315650002401330650001601354650002301370650002001393650002101413650002901434650000801463650002001471650000901491650001701500650001301517650001401530650001701544650001001561653002901571653002201600653002301622700002301645773012501668856008001793852000901873655001201882IND60624154520221116154859.0181201e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062415452DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336083186722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeitkemper, Margaret M.10aUpdate on Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Gender Differences  ap. 275-283.  aIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional GI disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated with alterations in defecation or stool frequency and consistency. In Western industrialized countries, women seek health care services for their symptoms more frequently than men. The cause of IBS is likely multifactorial involving altered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Many patients note that their symptoms are exacerbated by diet and stress, and women frequently report menstrual cycle fluctuations in symptoms. Current approaches to IBS management include behavioral management therapies such as dietary intake changes and stress reduction cognitive restructuring. Drug therapies are targeted at altering pain sensitivity, motility, and secretion. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis of IBS, factors that contribute to gender differences, and current therapeutic approaches for symptom management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautonomic nervous system 3acognition 3adefecation 3adeveloped countries 3afood intake 3agender differences 3ahealth services 3ahypersensitivity 3airritable bowel syndrome 3amen 3amenstrual cycle 3apain 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 3awomen 0airritable bowel syndrome 0anutrition therapy 0avisceral afferents1 aJarrett, Monica E.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2008 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.275-283dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336083186723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009000163300001600253500001900269500002000288520124300308592002801551596001401579596004501593596006101638596003001699650002401729650002501753650001401778650001801792650001301810650003001823650002401853650001601877650001001893700001901903700003201922700001901954700001901973773011601992856007302108852000902181655001202190IND60734389820221117160158.0210417e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073438982DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.121132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlano, José Miguel10aNew star on the stage: amount of ray parenchyma in tree rings shows a link to climate  ap. 486-495.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTree‐ring anatomy reflects the year‐by‐year impact of environmental factors on tree growth. Up to now, research in this field has mainly focused on the hydraulic architecture, with ray parenchyma neglected despite the growing recognition of its relevance for xylem function. Our aim was to address this gap by exploring the potential of the annual patterns of xylem parenchyma as a climate proxy. We constructed ring‐width and ray‐parenchyma chronologies from 1965 to 2004 for 20 Juniperus thurifera trees growing in a Mediterranean continental climate. Chronologies were related to climate records by means of correlation, multiple regression and partial correlation analyses. Ray parenchyma responded to climatic conditions at critical stages during the xylogenetic process; namely, at the end of the previous year's xylogenesis (October) and at the onset of earlywood (May) and latewood formation (August). Ray parenchyma‐based chronologies have potential to complement ring‐width chronologies as a tool for climate reconstructions. Furthermore, medium‐ and low‐frequency signals in the variation of ray parenchyma may improve our understanding of how trees respond to environmental fluctuations and to global change.  aPublisher supplied data  cFPI‐EHU  aCGL2009‐13190‐C03‐03cFPI‐MICINN  aVA006A10‐2cSpanish Ministry of Science and Innovation  cJunta de Castilla y León 3aJuniperus thurifera 3acontinental climates 3aearlywood 3aglobal change 3alatewood 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3aregression analysis 3atree growth 3atrees1 aArzac, Alberto1 aGarcía‐Cervigón, Ana I.1 avon Arx, Georg1 aRozas, Vicente0 tnew phytologist.g2013 Apr., v. 198, no. 2 p.486-495dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.121133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010600168300001600274520112200290592002801412650002001440650002201460650002001482650002901502650001001531650002301541650002201564650002001586650002501606650001301631650002401644650001701668651001801685653002601703653002601729653000801755653003101763653002001794700001801814700002601832773011201858856008601970852000902056655001202065IND60628448520221121053621.0190606e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062844852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsakov, Leah10aIs the FDA too conservative or too aggressive?: A Bayesian decision analysis of clinical trial design  ap. 117-136.  aImplicit in the drug-approval process is a host of decisions—target patient population, control group, primary endpoint, sample size, follow-up period, etc.—all of which determine the trade-off between Type I and Type II error. We explore the application of Bayesian decision analysis (BDA) to minimize the expected cost of drug approval, where the relative costs of the two types of errors are calibrated using U.S. Burden of Disease Study 2010 data. The results for conventional fixed-sample randomized clinical-trial designs suggest that for terminal illnesses with no existing therapies such as pancreatic cancer, the standard threshold of 2.5% is substantially more conservative than the BDA-optimal threshold of 23.9% to 27.8%. For relatively less deadly conditions such as prostate cancer, 2.5% is more risk-tolerant or aggressive than the BDA-optimal threshold of 1.2% to 1.5%. We compute BDA-optimal sizes for 25 of the most lethal diseases and show how a BDA-informed approval process can incorporate all stakeholders’ views in a systematic, transparent, internally consistent, and repeatable manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aburden of disease 3aclinical trials 3adecision support systems 3adrugs 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apatients 3aprostatic neoplasms 3astakeholders 3aUnited States 0aClinical trial design 0aDrug-approval process 0aFDA 0aBayesian decision analysis 0aAdaptive design1 aLo, Andrew W.1 aMontazerhodjat, Vahid0 tJournal of econometrics.g2019 July, v. 211, no. 1 p.117-136dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245013900184300001600323520106200339536034201401592002801743650002701771650001501798650002001813650001001833650002001843650001101863650001501874650001301889651001101902653002401913653002601937653002601963653001101989700003002000700003802030700003302068700002802101700002202129773012402151856008502275852000902360655001202369IND60702338120221120204629.0200717e20200807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070233812DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2020.17305782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtaide de Oliveira, Fernanda10aMineral content in honey and pollen from native stingless bees Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille, 1811) in the Iron Quadrangle, Brazil  ap. 378-389.  aThe objective of this work was to determine the mineral content of honey and pollen of the Brazilian native Jataí bee (Tetragonisca angustula) sampled at nine sites in the so-called Iron Quadrangle region of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Twenty chemical elements were determined in the honey and pollen samples: Al, Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Ga, In, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, S, Sr, V, and Zn. Analysis of the data using ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p = .05) revealed statistically significant differences between the mineral contents of honey and pollen, as well as between the samples from different locations. The score plot and loading plot diagrams from factor analysis with Varimax rotation were able to classify the honey and pollen samples according to their geographical origin. The factor analysis separated the sites according to the similarities of the chemical concentrations. These results were related to the geogenic and anthropic contributions of the sites. Therefore, honey and pollen of Jataí bees could also serve as bioindicators.  aThe authors are grateful for the concession of a doctoral grant by CAPES – Brazilian Agency, grant number 32007019004P4; and for financial support provided by CNPq – Brazil, project number 303810/2010-6.

However, conventional wastewater treatment processes do not effectively remove low concentrations of these pollutants. Herein, the P‐Bi₄O₅Br₂/AgI (PBA) heterojunction was synthesized via a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)‐assisted solvothermal and precipitation method in this work. RESULTS: The photocatalytic efficiency of the PBA heterojunction was evaluated by degrading rhodamine B (RhB) with the irradiation of simulated sunlight. P‐Bi₄O₅Br₂/AgI‐50 (PBA‐50, the mass fraction of AgI in the composite was 50%) composite could degrade 98% RhB under 90 min irradiation of 500 W Xenon lamp, and its pseudo first‐order reaction rate constant was 0.04265 min⁻¹, which was 17.1, 2.16, and 2.94 times higher than that of Bi₄O₅Br₂, P‐Bi₄O₅Br₂, and AgI, respectively. Besides, the effects of the dosage of photocatalyst and the anion on the photocatalytic degradation of RhB over PBA‐50 were analyzed. CONCLUSION: The enhanced photocatalytic activity of PBA was attributed to its better visible light capture ability, larger specific surface area, and faster photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, all of which were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), UV‐Vis diffues reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoelectrochemical analysis. In addition, the free radical trapping experiments confirmed that ·O₂⁻ and h⁺ were the main active species for degradation of RhB. Additionally, the smaller bandgap and the more negative conduction band position of Bi₄O₅Br₂ were reached after the introduction of PVP. Accordingly, a possible type‐II heterojunction photocatalytic mechanism of P‐Bi₄O₅Br₂/AgI was proposed. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  a21878115cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21376099cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiotechnology 3acarcinogens 3adyes 3afree radicals 3ahuman health 3airradiation 3alight 3alighting 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3areflectance spectroscopy 3arhodamines 3asurface area 3awastewater treatment 3axenon1 aXiao, Xinyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9790-70921 aWang, Yi1 aLu, Mingli0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.2298-2309dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.67563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01091naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245007500159300001600234520028500250592002800535650001900563650002800582650002200610700001700632773009600649856007100745852000900816655001200825IND60518519720221121221625.0160418e197001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051851972DNAL7 a10.2307/19336102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWollum, A.

Elevation-related decrease in growing season temperatures is a highly important factor in limiting tree growth in cold environments such as alpine treeline ecotones. In this study, we aimed to identify radial growth timing differences in Picea abies (L.) Karst. between the lower (timberline) and upper (treeline) parts of an alpine treeline ecotone. Over three growing seasons, soil and air temperatures were measured and phenology of wood formation was analyzed at two sites separated by 140 m of elevation in the Giant Mountains, Czech Republic. The results showed that there were two periods with significant differences in wood phenology between timberline and treeline. In the early part of the growing season, higher ambient temperatures at timberline led to higher number of cambial and enlarging cells here than at treeline. In the second part of the growing season, the bigger and/or more numerous tracheids at timberline than at treeline required more time for maturation. Significant delay in the beginning of wood formation at treeline in comparison to timberline was observed only in 2011, when soil was frozen markedly longer at treeline. We found that cambial activity significantly increased when soil temperature increased from near zero to a threshold temperature of 4–5 °C. We therefore suggest that for P. abies both the above- and belowground parts of the tree must be sufficiently warm for full resumption of cambial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3acambium 3acold zones 3aecotones 3afrozen soils 3agrowing season 3amountains 3aphenology 3asoil air 3asoil temperature 3atracheids 3atree growth 3atreeline 3atrees 3aunderground parts 3awood 3aCzech Republic1 aKašpar, Jakub1 aKuzelova, Hana,1 aGryc, Vladimír0 tTrees.g2015 Apr., v. 29, no. 2 p.515-526dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-014-1129-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245014500175300001600320520138500336592002801721650001801749650001801767650002501785650003201810650001301842650001101855650001901866650001201885650001901897650004101916650001601957650002501973650002301998650002102021650001002042650002302052650001302075650001202088650001402100650001702114650002002131650002102151650002502172773009802197856009002295990002302385852000902408655001202417IND60113544420221120170825.0141111s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011354442DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-407766-9.00011-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Dominic S.10aLecithin Cholesterol Acyltransferase Deficiency Protects from Diet-Induced Insulin Resistance and Obesity—Novel Insights from Mouse Models  ap. 259-270.  aReduced plasma level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic heart disease and is also a major diagnostic feature for the metabolic syndrome. Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), an enzyme mediating the esterification of cholesterol in circulating lipoproteins, is one of the major modulators of high-density lipoprotein levels and composition. Loss-of-function mutations of LCAT invariably results in profound HDL deficiency and also modest hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). While intense effort has been devoted to investigate the role of LCAT in atherogenesis, which remains controversial, much less is known about whether LCAT also modulates glucose and energy homeostasis. In recent years, findings from studying the LCAT knockout mice began to suggest that LCAT deficiency, in spite of its unfavorable high triglyceride/low HDL lipid phenotypes, may confer protection from the development of insulin resistance and obesity. To date, alterations in specific metabolic pathways in liver, white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle have been implicated. A better mechanistic understanding in the metabolic linkage between the primary biochemical action of LCAT and the downstream protective phenotypes will greatly facilitate the identification of potential novel pathways and targets in the treatment of obesity and diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aatherogenesis 3abiochemical pathways 3acholesterol acyltransferase 3adiabetes 3aenergy 3aesterification 3aglucose 3aheart diseases 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahomeostasis 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3ainsulin resistance 3aknockout mutants 3aliver 3ametabolic syndrome 3amutation 3aobesity 3aphenotype 3arisk factors 3askeletal muscle 3atriacylglycerols 3awhite adipose tissue0 tVitamins and Hormones.g2013, v. 91 p.259-270dElsevier Science & Technologyx0083-67297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-407766-9.00011-03Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014500168300001800313520111900331592002801450650001401478650002301492650002301515653003501538653003601573653007501609653007101684700002901755700005801784773008201842856008101924852000902005655001202014IND60551398420221120114201.0161018e20140902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055139842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvula, Sreenivas10aApplication of N,3-diaryl-3-oxo-propanethioamide in synthesis: an efficient and mild domino approach to highly substituted fused chromenones  ap. 5768-5775.  aA convenient and rapid synthesis of hitherto unknown 3-aroyl-4-aryl-2-phenylamino-4H-benzo[g]chromene-5,10-diones in high yield from β-aroyl-thioacetanilide, aromatic aldehyde, and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone via InCl3 catalyzed one-pot three-component tandem Knoevenagel condensation–Michael addition–intramolecular cyclization–elimination reaction sequence is disclosed for the first time.

While there was some controversy regarding the quantitative importance of intramyocellular triglyceride (IMTG) as a metabolic substrate, recent advances in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and confocal microscopy support earlier tracer and biopsy studies demonstrating a substantial contribution of IMTG to energy production, particularly during moderate-intensity endurance exercise. This review provides an update on the understanding of IMTG utilization during exercise, with a focus on describing the key regulatory proteins that control IMTG breakdown and how these proteins respond to acute exercise and in the adaptation to exercise training.

Perhaps one of the most important studies evaluating the role of nutrition therapy and bowel rest in the management of CD was performed by Greenberg and colleagues in 1988. This pivotal study attempted to define the role of bowel rest as an independent variable in the management of hospitalized patients with active CD unresponsive to the traditional medical therapy that was available at the time. As the first randomized controlled trial evaluating nutrition intervention in CD, it showed that bowel rest was not a major factor in achieving remission during nutrition support and did not affect outcome during 1-year follow-up. Although these discouraging findings would be subsequently replicated, the role of enteral and parenteral nutrition therapy would evolve during the following years as a result of insight into CD pathogenesis, the emergence of more effective medical therapies, and improved understanding of the role of nutrition in the care of patients with CD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3anutritional intervention 3aparenteral feeding 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3aremission 0anutrition 0anutrition therapy 0aenteral nutrition 0aparenteral nutrition 0ainflammatory bowel diseases 0aCrohn's disease1 aBinion, David G.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2008 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.299-308dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336083186753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245012800165300002000293520139000313592002801703650002501731650002401756650002301780650001201803650001701815650004101832650004401873650003101917650001501948650001501963650002001978653002401998653002002022653002302042653001502065653001902080700001602099700002002115773012602135856008002261852000902341655001202350IND60555363920221119224157.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536392DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b099832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Amanpreet10aBenzimidazolium-Based Self-Assembled Fluorescent Aggregates for Sensing and Catalytic Degradation of Diethylchlorophosphate  ap. 28641-28651.  aThe unregulated use of chemical weapons has aroused researchers to develop sensors for chemical warfare agents (CWA) and likewise to abolish their harmful effects, the degradation through catalysis has great advantage. Chemically, the CWAs are versatile; however, mostly they contain organophosphates that act on inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase. In this work, we have designed and synthesized some novel benzimidazolium based fluorescent cations and their fluorescent aggregates were fabricated using anionic surfactants (SDS and SDBS) in aqueous medium. The prepared fluorescent aggregates have shown aggregation induced emission enhancement, which was further used as detection of chemical warfare agent in aqueous medium. The aggregates (Benz-2/SDBS and Benz-3/SDBS) have shown significant changes in emission profile upon interaction with diethylchlorophosphate. Contrarily, the pure dipodal receptor Benz-4 has not shown any response in emission after interaction with organophosphate, and consequently, it was concluded that benzimidazolium cation plays a decisive role in sensing. The mechanism of sensing was fully validated using ³¹P NMR spectroscopy as well as GC-MS, which highlights the transformation of diethylchlorophosphate into diethylhydrogen phosphate. The aggregates selectively interact with diethylchlorophosphate over other biological important phosphates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aanionic surfactants 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3afluorescence 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3astable isotopes 0afluorescent cations 0abenzimidazolium 0aanionic surfactant 0aaggregates 0awarfare agents1 aRaj, Pushap1 aSingh, Narinder0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.28641-28651dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b099833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001500148245012500163300001600288520109000304592002801394650001501422650001601437650001801453650001901471650001701490650001701507650001901524650001901543650001001562650001401572700001601586700001801602700002301620700001401643700001601657700001701673700001501690773010601705856008401811852000901895655001201904IND4472299720221121214839.0150808e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447229972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhadra, A.10aAssessment of the genotoxicity of quinolone and fluoroquinolones contaminated soil with the Vicia faba micronucleus test  ap. 187-192.  aThe genotoxicity of quinolone and fluroquinolones was assessed using the micronucleus (MN) test on Vicia faba roots by direct contact exposure to a solid matrix. Plants were exposed to quinolones (nalidixic acid) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin) alone or mixed with artificially contaminated soils. Four different concentrations of each of these antibiotics were tested (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10mg/Kg) for nalidixic acid and (0.005, 0.05, 0.5 and 5mg/Kg) for ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin. These antibiotics were also used in mixture. Exposure of Vicia faba plants to each antibiotic at the highest two concentrations showed significant MN induction. The lowest two concentrations had no significant genotoxic effect. The mixture of the three compounds induced a significant MN induction whatever the mixture tested, from 0.02 to 20mg/Kg. The results indicated that a similar genotoxic effect was obtained with the mixture at 0.2mg/Kg in comparison with each molecule alone at 5–10mg/Kg. Data revealed a clear synergism of these molecules on Vicia faba genotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia faba 3aantibiotics 3aciprofloxacin 3adirect contact 3aenrofloxacin 3agenotoxicity 3analidixic acid 3apolluted soils 3aroots 3asynergism1 aPinelli, E.1 aLacroix, M.Z.1 aBousquet-Melou, A.1 aHamdi, H.1 aMerlina, G.1 aGuiresse, M.1 aHafidi, M.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 76 p.187-192dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008300206300002000289520072400309592002801033596004001061650002101101650000701122650001101129650002201140650001101162650002001173650001001193700006201203700006101265700006401326700006201390700006001452700005801512700005601570773012401626856008301750852000901833655001201842IND60638869620221117232440.0190816e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063886962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-019-03600-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLister, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3568-916510aDesign of a smart sensor mesh for the measurement of pH in ostomy applications  ap. 10410-10419.  aA carbon-loaded polyethylene film was modified through a combination of laser ablation and electrochemical anodisation to yield a mechanically flexible yet electroanalytically sensitive mesh. A custom flavin derivative bearing a pendant phenol substituent was electropolymerised onto the substrate, and its electrochemical properties were investigated. The reversible flavin electrochemistry was retained (Ep = −0.374 V vs. Ag/AgCl, pH 7), and the peak position was found to shift by 60 mV/pH over a range covering pH 2.55 to pH 8.12. The stability of the resulting composite has been evaluated, and the analytical applicability towards the voltammetric measurement of pH in human urine was critically assessed.  aPublisher supplied data  aDST 65/2017cBritish Council UKIERI 3aelectrochemistry 3apH 3aphenol 3apolyethylene film 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3aurine1 aCasimero, Charnete1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4686-24421 aMcConville, Aaron1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9644-90291 aTaylor, Charlotte M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7873-94171 aLawrence, Clare L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0170-00791 aSmith, Robert B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2829-53601 aMathur, Ashish1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5365-58071 aDavis, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4284-44310 tJournal of materials science.g2019 July, v. 54, no. 14 p.10410-10419dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-019-03600-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04015naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018700168300001800355520210600373536027202479592002802751596001602779650002502795650001702820650001602837650002602853650001602879650001002895650002402905650001502929650001902944650001402963650002402977650002003001650002003021650002003041650001803061650002103079653002603100653002503126653001903151653003103170700003603201700001803237700001803255773012903273856008603402852000903488655001203497IND60722393320221118044736.0210515e20201214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072239332DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2020.18279912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qianqian10aEffects of chitooligosaccharide supplementation on laying performance, egg quality, blood biochemistry, antioxidant capacity and immunity of laying hens during the late laying period  ap. 1180-1187.  aThe effects of chitooligosaccharide (COS) supplementation in laying hen diets on egg production, egg quality, blood biochemistry, antioxidant capacity and immunity during the late laying period were investigated in this 10-week trial. A total of 3000 Fengda No.1 laying hens, 52 weeks of age, were randomly allocated to three treatment groups, each of which included five replicates of 200 hens. Treatments consisted of the basal diet only or the basal diet supplemented with COS at 75 or 125 mg/kg. Hens fed with both COS supplemented diets had improved hen-day egg production, egg mass and feed conversion ratio than control birds. The higher level of COS supplementation exerted positive effects on eggshell strength and eggshell thickness, but significantly decreased yolk colour. Addition of 125 mg/kg COS was also found to significantly increase serum albumin content and significantly decrease serum cholesterol level. Dietary supplementation with COS significantly decreased serum triglyceride level compared with birds fed the control diet. Moreover, COS significantly increased total antioxidative capacity and significantly decreased malondialdehyde level in serum, but had no significance on the activities of antioxidant enzymes. The only change in blood immune response compounds observed in this study was a significantly increased concentration of C3 when laying hens were fed COS supplemented diets. In conclusion, COS could improve laying performance and egg quality in hens during the late laying period. Inclusion of COS in the diet might be beneficial to hens’ health by lowering serum lipids, enhancing antioxidant activity and slightly enhancing immune ability.HIGHLIGHTSCOS improved laying performance and egg quality in hens during the late laying period. Inclusion of COS in the diet might be beneficial to hens’ health by lowering serum lipids, enhancing the antioxidant activity and slightly enhancing immune ability. The optimum concentration of COS is 75 mg/kg in the basal diet in order to achieve an increased egg production, egg quality and health condition.  aThe study was supported by Zhejiang Provincial Key Research and Development Program [2019C02051], the Agricultural Technology Extension Funds of Zhejiang University and the earmarked fund for the modern agro-industry technology research system of China [CARS-40-K10].  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-40-K10 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3achitooligosaccharides 3acholesterol 3acolor 3adietary supplements 3aegg masses 3aegg production 3aegg shell 3aegg shell thickness 3afeed conversion 3aimmune response 3amalondialdehyde 3aserum albumin 3atriacylglycerols 0aBlood characteristics 0achitooligosaccharide 0aegg production 0aegg quality’ laying hens1 aAzzam, Mahmoud Mostafa Mohammed1 aZou, Xiaoting1 aDong, Xinyang0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2020 Dec. 14, v. 19, no. 1 p.1180-1187dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2020.18279913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008300169300001800252520068000270592002800950650002300978650002301001650002201024650002001046650002201066700001301088700001901101700002101120700002001141700001501161700002001176700006101196700005901257773012101316856008301437852000901520655001201529IND60649694120221120041453.0190705e20190621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064969412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b018842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tong-Tong10aDesign and Synthesis of Donor−σ–π–σ–Acceptor-Type Dispiro Molecules  ap. 5281-5284.  aTwo novel donor−σ–π–σ–acceptor-type dispiro molecules—10-phenyl-10H-dispiro-acridine-9,9′-anthracene-10′,9′′-fluorene-2′′,7′′-dicarbo-nitrile (DiSAAF) and dispiro-fluorene-9,9′-anthracene-10′,9′′-quinolino[3,2,1-kl]phenoxazine-2,7-dicarbonitrile (DiSFAQ)—with excellent thermal stability are designed and synthesized.

A previously reported X-ray structure of BtuCD in complex with the periplasmic vitamin B₁₂-binding protein BtuF revealed asymmetry of the transmembrane BtuC subunits. The functional relevance of this asymmetry has remained uncertain. Here we report the X-ray structure of a catalytically impaired BtuCD mutant in complex with BtuF, where the BtuC subunits adopt a distinct asymmetric conformation. The structure suggests that BtuF does not discriminate between, or impose, asymmetric conformations of BtuCD. It also explains the conformational disorder observed in BtuCDF crystals.

The aromaticity indexes Bird I6, HOMA, NICS(1) and aromatic stabilisation energy (ASE) have been calculated and compared. In agreement with an earlier study employing connectivity-matrix analysis, the previously unrecognised and little known semi-conjugated HMBs (Class 3) have calculated properties that are quite distinct from the isomeric conjugated HMBs (Class 1) and cross-conjugated HMBs (Class 2). In particular semi-conjugated systems have a higher degree of both classical and magnetic aromaticity than the isomers. In agreement with the calculated vertical ionisation potentials and electron affinities, the six-membered semi-conjugated species have high energy HOMOs and low energy LUMOs and these observations are consistent with the limited experimental data available. The results support the view that semi-conjugated rings should be recognised as a discrete class of dipolar heterocycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aionization 3aisomers 3aorganic compounds 0aMesomeric betaine 0aCross-conjugated 0aSemi-conjugated 0aAromaticity 0aHomodesmotic1 aOziminski, Wojciech P.0 tTetrahedron.g2014 Oct. 07, v. 70 p.7158-7165dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2014.06.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011100207300001400318520169500332592002802027650001202055650001702067650002602084650002002110650001802130650002402148650002102172650002202193650001202215650002502227650001302252651001902265653002802284653002302312653002702335653003702362700005602399700005802455773010902513856008502622852000902707655001202716IND60570801820221118052824.0190411e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057080182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2017.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnoke, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0535-594612aA critical view on benefit-cost analyses of silvicultural management options with declining discount rates  ap. 58-69.  aThe long planning perspective is one of the unique features of forestry. How to value money flows expected in the far distant future is therefore a crucial question. Applying time declining discount rates (DDR) may offer an appropriate alternative to conventional discounting, but few studies have applied DDRs in forest economics. We expect that theoretical assumptions behind welfare analyses based on DDR will be important. Using a dataset from the UK (Davies and Kerr (2015) [Forests 6: 2424–2449]) we investigate the effects of 1) more than marginal contributions from forestry to consumption, 2) the role of the assumed scenarios for return on capital, and 3) ignoring optimization (i.e. adopting predefined management scenarios) on the ranking of different silvicultural strategies. These include various clearfelling options (with replanting, natural regeneration or underplanting) and the transition to continuous cover forestry. Our analysis reveals that changes in these aspects affect the ranking of forest management options more strongly than a pure change in the coefficients of a benefit cost analysis. Decreasing marginality, cautious assumptions about the worst-case return on capital and optimization of silvicultural operations all increase the relative attractiveness of continuous cover forestry. We conclude that applying DDR makes valuation in forestry more demanding and should be applied with appropriate care. In addition, the precise assumptions behind the particular schedule of DDRs should be explicit. Finally, theoretical considerations support the importance of combining optimization of silvicultural management strategies with their economic evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aclearcutting 3acost benefit analysis 3adata collection 3adiscount rate 3aeconomic evaluation 3aforest economics 3aforest management 3aforests 3anatural regeneration 3aplanning 3aUnited Kingdom 0aDeclining discount rate 0aDiscounted utility 0aMarginality assumption 0aTerm structure of discount rates1 aPaul, Carola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6257-20261 aHärtl, Fabian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4966-47860 tForest policy and economics.g2017 Oct., v. 83 p.58-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2017.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004700151245009800198300001600296520150200312536012601814592002801940596003101968650001401999650001902013650001402032650002802046650001102074650002802085650001502113650002202128650001502150650001302165650001502178650001002193650001102203650001502214650001102229650001302240651001102253653001602264653001402280653000802294653001602302653002202318700003002340700003002370700003602400700001902436700004402455773012402499856008502623852000902708655001202717IND60702338620221120204638.0200717e20200807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070233862DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2020.17494502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilveira-Júnior, Cristiano Eduardo Amaral10aEvaluation of honey quality of Northeast of Brazil: botanical origin and heavy metals content  ap. 362-377.  aA chemical and palynological study was performed on honey of Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) produced and marketed in the nine states that comprise the Northeast Region of Brazil. A total of 58 samples were obtained from markets between the years 2015 and 2017. The pollen spectra of the samples encompassed 232 pollen types of defined botanical origin, with 31 samples possessing predominant pollen in their spectra, which represent species with beekeeping potential: Angelonia, Borreria verticillata, Copaifera, Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, M. pudica, M. tenuiflora, Myrcia 1, Schinus terebinthifolia, Tapirira guianensis, Tarenaya, and Ziziphus joazeiro. Leguminosae was the most represented botanical family in all the studied honey samples, with Mimosa L. being the most diverse and frequent genus. The richness of different pollen types varied among states, but similarities in pollen spectra were minimally related to geographical proximity to the municipalities of origin. Thus, some pollen types, alone or in combination, can be considered good indicators of honey produced in Northeast Brazil. The levels of the main metallic contaminants of honey (i.e., As, Cd, Cr, Hg, and Pb) were found to be below their respective limits, suggesting that honey samples from the Northeast are safe for human consumption. The studied samples presented heterogeneous botanical constitutions that reflect the diversity of plant species of the Caatinga biome and the generalist habit of A. mellifera.  aThis work was supported by the FACEPE-PRONEM under Grant 0741106/2014; CNPq under Grants 302594/2016-7 and 404417/2013-7.  aPublisher supplied data  a.1.06/14a94/a-7a17/a-7 3aAngelonia 3aApis mellifera 3aCopaifera 3aMimosa caesalpiniifolia 3aMyrcia 3aSchinus terebinthifolia 3aSpermacoce 3aZiziphus joazeiro 3aapiculture 3acaatinga 3aecosystems 3ahoney 3ahumans 3apalynology 3apollen 3aresearch 3aBrazil 0aLeguminosae 0aMimosa L. 0aAAS 0ametal trace 0amelissopalynology1 aRegina da Silva, Girliane1 aPereira Gomes, Ayala Nara1 aSilva, Tânia Maria Sarmento da1 aArruda, Rafael1 aSantos, Francisco de Assis Ribeiro dos,0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2020 Aug. 7, v. 59, no. 4 p.362-377dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2020.17494503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245011000163300001600273506002800289520132000317592002801637506003701665650002201702650001201724650001501736650001701751650002301768650001201791650001501803650001801818650001501836651001401851653001601865653003501881653001401916653002501930653001901955653002501974700001701999700002902016773010202045856008002147852000902227655001202236IND60764518020221207095122.0211116e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076451802DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1902492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWASIS, BASUKI10aImpact of land and forest fire on soil fauna diversity in several land cover in Jambi Province, Indonesia  ap. 690-696.  aResource is Open Access  aWasis B, Winata B, Marpaung DR. 2018. Impact of land and forest fire on soil fauna diversity in several land cover in Jambi Province, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 19: 740-746. Forest fire is one of the primary disturbances that damage forest and disturb forest sustainability. Land and forest fire may lead to die-offs, declines and in general influence the development of abundant of soil fauna on the ground. This research aims to identify and assess the diversity, wealth, evenness, and the pattern and spread of land fauna in various ecosystems, both burnt and unburnt by the fire. Research was conducted in some districts in Jambi Province, Indonesia. Sampling methods for soil diversity were done by hand-sorting methods in three burnt and unburnt ecosystems. Those ecosystems were primary forest, industrial plantation forest, and oil palm plantation. Generally, we found 519 individual species included in 46 genera, 33 families, 20 orders of 8 classes, and 3 phyla in whole ecosystem observed. The highest soil fauna diversity was primary forest with value of DMg = 4.243, H'=2.664, E=0.862. Meanwhile, the lowest soil fauna diversity was found in burnt palm plantation with value of DMg=2.102, H'=1.520, and E=0.692. Environmental factors like abiotic and biotic affected to the diversity level of soil fauna.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aElaeis guineensis 3adie-off 3aecosystems 3aforest fires 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3aland cover 3apedodiversity 3asoil fauna 3aIndonesia 0aforest fire 0aindustrial plantation industry 0aland fire 0aoil palm plantations 0aprimary forest 0asoil fauna diversity1 aWINATA, BAYU1 aMARPAUNG, DANIEL RICARDO0 tBiodiversitas.g2018 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.690-696dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d1902493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245003900164300001600203520199300219592002802212650001402240650002102254650002802275700001302303700001502316773012802331856008002459852000902539655001202548IND60765244420220422000000.0220422e20120217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076524442DNAL7 a10.17221/5065-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHavlíček, J.10aKnowledge based case studies&nbsp;  ap. 545-551.  aIn the present development of a knowledge society and with the increasing impact of knowledge on economic growth, case studies have become vehicles of knowledge which can both store and transfer it. Knowledge based case studies describe the best practices as well as solutions of complex problems. Knowledge in case studies is described in both written and symbolic form. The content and form of knowledge based case studies should be in mutual equilibrium. Knowledge based case studies are both descriptions of methods and algorithms as well as narratives. As narratives, they should have a relevant literary quality. Case studies can involve mass media into their structure and use simulation techniques as well as techniques of entrepreneurial games. Case studies can thus be both dynamic and flexible. Users can personally influence the behaviour and evolution of the process. They can choose their role in the process and can also change it whilst performing the solution. Social, cultural and traditional values are respected during all steps leading to solutions of problems. Ecological aspects and conditions of sustainable development are taken into account when solutions are analysed, recommended and accepted. Case studies present the best practices which enable users to provide benchmarking examples of their own solutions. Data bases of case studies should provide more dimensions containing descriptors which characterize the studies. In the following article, six descriptors will be recommended: domains, objectives, critical success factors, indicators, the best practices explanations and case characteristics. These enable to sort out, categorize, classify and stratify studies in a data base and are helpful in assessing their quality. A vertical structure of the data base facilitates classification and ordering of studies according to subject areas. A horizontal structure of the database enables classification of case studies from the user point of view. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aentrepreneurship 3asustainable development1 aHron, J.1 aTichá, I.0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 52, no. 12 p.545-551dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/5065-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015100164300002000315520080100335592002801136650001401164650001301178650002101191650002201212650001301234650001801247650001101265650002101276653002701297653002101324653002701345653002101372653002601393653003101419700001701450700001901467700002001486700001801506700001801524700001801542773012601560856008001686852000901766655001201775IND60555364220221119224511.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536422DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b100322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jian-Qiu10aThree-Dimensional Porous Graphene Aerogel Cathode with High Sulfur Loading and Embedded TiO2 Nanoparticles for Advanced Lithium–Sulfur Batteries  ap. 28663-28670.  aThree-dimensional graphene aerogel/TiO₂/sulfur (GA/TiO₂/S) composites are synthesized through a facile, one-pot hydrothermal route as the cathode for lithium–sulfur batteries. With a high sulfur content of 75.1 wt %, the conductive, highly porous composite electrode delivers a high discharge capacity of 512 mA h/g after 250 cycles at a current rate of 1 C with a low capacity decay of 0.128% per cycle. The excellent capacities and cyclic stability arise from several unique functional features of the cathode. (i) The conductive graphene aerogel framework ameliorates ion/electron transfer while accommodating the volume expansion induced during discharge, and (ii) TiO₂ nanoparticles play an important role in restricting the dissolution of polysulfides by chemical bonds with sulfur.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acathodes 3achemical bonding 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3ananoparticles 3asulfur 3atitanium dioxide 0ahydrothermal synthesis 0agraphene aerogel 0apolysulfide adsorption 0atitanium dioxide 0achemical interactions 0alithium−sulfur batteries1 aWang, Zhenyu1 aXu, Zheng-Long1 aChong, Woon Gie1 aQin, Xianying1 aWang, Xiangyu1 aKim, Jang-Kyo0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.28663-28670dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b100323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008400166300001600250520097300266592002801239650002301267650002201290650002001312650002601332650002901358653000801387653000801395653000801403653003401411653002001445653002601465653002801491653003401519700001401553700001801567773011201585856008601697852000901783655001201792IND60628449120221121053835.0201023e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062844912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2019.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Nian12aA new delta expansion for multivariate diffusions via the Itô-Taylor expansion  ap. 256-288.  aIn this paper we develop a new delta expansion approach to deriving analytical approximation to the transition densities of multivariate diffusions using the Itô-Taylor expansion of the conditional expectation of the Dirac delta function. Our approach yields an explicit recursive formulas for the expansion coefficients and is universally applicable for a wide spectrum of models, particularly the time-inhomogeneous non-affine irreducible multivariate diffusions. We show that this new approach can be viewed as an extension of Aït-Sahalia (2002) and Lee et al. (2014) to the case of multivariate models. The derived expansions are proved to converge to the true probability density as the observational time interval shrinks. The obtained approximations can thereby be used to carry out the maximum likelihood estimation for the diffusions with discretely observed data. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3amultivariate analysis 3aprobability distribution 0aC13 0aC32 0aC63 0aClosed-form density expansion 0aDelta expansion 0aItô-Taylor expansion 0aMultivariate diffusions 0aMaximum likelihood estimation1 aChen, Nan1 aWan, Xiangwei0 tJournal of econometrics.g2019 Apr., v. 209, no. 2 p.256-288dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2019.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01415naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245011000161300001800271520023400289592002800523650001200551650002300563650001100586650002800597650000900625650001400634650001400648700001900662700002400681700002300705700002200728700002700750700002000777700002100797773012900818856007300947852000901020655001201029IND60658374820221120234447.0190817e20090321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065837482DNAL7 a10.1039/b819894b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButcher, Robert T.10aStrong through-space two-halide magnetic exchange of −234 K in (2,5-dimethylpyrazine)copper(ii) bromide  ap. 1359-1361.  aAn unprecedented antiferromagnetic exchange of −234 K in Cu(2,5-dimethylpyrazine)Br₂ is shown experimentally and theoretically to propagate via through-space interactions between Br ions rather than through-bond interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aions 3amagnetism 3apyrazines1 aNovoa, Juan J.1 aRibas-Ariño, Jordi1 aSandvik, Anders W.1 aTurnbull, Mark M.1 aLandee, Christopher P.1 aWells, Brian M.1 aAwwadi, Firas F.0 tChemical communications.g2009 Mar. 21, , no. 11 p.1359-1361dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b819894b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013100195300001600326500002000342520164000362592002802002596004502030596003102075596006802106650002702174650002902201650002002230650001802250650001002268650002302278650002202301650001002323650002302333650001902356650001402375650001402389650002402403650001002427650001402437700005402451700005402505700005402559700005402613700005902667710010502726773011502831856007302946852000903019655001203028IND60743163620221119104254.0210707e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074316362DNAL7 a10.1111/age.130702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuichard, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7614-677610aIdentification of quantitative trait loci associated with calmness and gentleness in honey bees using whole‐genome sequences  ap. 472-481.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) through genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) is a powerful method for unravelling the genetic background of selected traits and improving early‐stage predictions. In honey bees (Apis mellifera), past genetic analyses have particularly focused on individual queens and workers. In this study, we used pooled whole‐genome sequences to ascertain the genetic variation of the entire colony. In total, we sampled 216 Apis mellifera mellifera and 28 Apis mellifera carnica colonies. Different experts subjectively assessed the gentleness and calmness of the colonies using a standardised protocol. Conducting a GWAS for calmness on 211 purebred A. m. mellifera colonies, we identified three QTL, on chromosomes 8, 6, and 12. The two first QTL correspond to LOC409692 gene, coding for a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain‐containing protein 10, and to Abscam gene, coding for a Dscam family member Abscam protein, respectively. The last gene has been reported to be involved in the domestication of A. mellifera. The third QTL is located 13 kb upstream of LOC102655631, coding for a trehalose transporter. For gentleness, two QTL were identified on chromosomes 4 and 3. They are located within gene LOC413669, coding for a lap4 protein, and gene LOC413416, coding for a bicaudal C homolog 1‐B protein, respectively. The identified positional candidate genes of both traits mainly affect the olfaction and nervous system of honey bees. Further research is needed to confirm the results and to better understand the genetic and phenotypic basis of calmness and gentleness.  aPublisher supplied data  a627000708cBundesamt für Landwirtschaft  cLabogena and FranceAgriMer  aANR‐10‐INBS‐0009cCommissariat aux Grands Investissements 3aApis mellifera carnica 3aApis mellifera mellifera 3aanimal genetics 3adomestication 3agenes 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3ahoney 3ametalloproteinases 3anervous system 3aphenotype 3apurebreds 3aquantitative traits 3asmell 3atrehalose1 aDainat, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1740-71361 aEynard, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8609-58691 aVignal, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6797-21251 aServin, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5141-09131 aNeuditschko, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7824-701X2 athe Beestrong ConsortiumDomaine de Vilvert, Bat 224, CS80009, Jouy‐en‐Josas CEDEX, 78353, France0 tAnimal genetics.g2021 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.472-481dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl38565x0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.130703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245010500179300001600284500000900300500001500309520180600324592002802130650001902158650001602177650002302193650001002216650001202226650001302238650001602251650001502267650002502282650002102307650002302328650001902351650001502370653001002385700001702395773012102412852000902533856009802542655001202640IND2056296020221122061141.0191122e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205629602DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500020020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanter, D.

Choosing Parents  ap. 397-405.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aIn serf-pollinated crops, choosing parents typically is accomplished by calculating parental performance from historical data and then calculating the midparent value (MPV) for potential crosses. When limited or no data exist for parents of interest, precise predictions are difficult or impossible to obtain. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), has been used to determine paired matings in dairy cattle under conditions described above. The objectives of this study were to compare the elficiencies of two methods of parental selection, MPV and BLUP, for identifying superior soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cross combinations when (i) equal and unequal amounts of yield data on all potential parents were available, and (ii) unequal amounts of yield data were available for some parents and no data were available for others. F₄–F₆ bulks and F₅:₆ lines from 24 soybean crosses were evaluated to estimate the mean yield performance of each cross. Historical yield records on the parents of each cross were used to predict the performance of the 24 crosses. Numbers of records on the parents were restricted to provide simulated situations of balanced and unbalanced parent data availability. The performance of each cross was predicted with MPV and BLUP for each situation. Standard errors of the predicted differences (SE) and rank correlations between the actual and the predicted performances were calculated to determine the relative efficiencies of MPV and BLUP. In every case, predictions from BLUP provided higher rank correlations, lower SE, and identified higher percentages of the superior crosses than MPV. Contribution from the Agric. Exp.

A.14aThe Full‐Glacial Vegetation of Northwestern Georgia  ap. 17-33.  aTwo small ponds in Bartow County, Georgia, northwest of Atlanta, originated by subsidence of unconsolidated surface deposits into solution hollows in the underlying lower Paleozoic Knox Dolomite. The pond sediments consist of copropelic clays 250—400 cm thick with well—preserved plant remains, covered by as much as 150 cm of colluvial deposits with moderately to poorly preserved plant fossils. The clays yield radiocarbon dates of 20,100 and 22,900 BP near their base, contemporaneous with the main Wisconsin glaciation. The full—glacial sediments are rich in pollen and plant macrofossils. The pollen assemblage is dominated by Pinus (pine), with small amounts of Picea (spruce), Quercus (oak), Ostrya type (hophornbeam), and herbaceous types. It closely resembles published full—glacial pollen assemblages from southeastern North Carolina. Pinus banksiana (jack—pine) and Picea sp. are represented by fossil needles at many levels, and the rich macroflora of aquatics shows a marked phytogeographical relationship with the modern flora of northern New England. A floristic displacement of about 1,100 km would be needed to account for the presence of this flora in Georgia. Deciduous trees, primarily Quercus and Ostrya type, may have had a minor role in the full—glacial vegetation. In the postglacial an early Quercus—dominated phase is followed by a Pinus—dominated phase, which lasts to the present. Familiar southern tree genera such as Liquidambar (sweet gum) and Nyssa (black gum) appear to have migrated into the region in postglacial time. Species that occur primarily on the Coastal Plain but have disjunct occurrences at the two ponds and farther into the central United States, such as Itea virginica (Virginia willow) and Psilocarya nitens (sedge), first appear in the fossil record in the postglacial. It is supposed that they and perhaps other "Coastal Plain disjuncts" migrated into their present localities during the postglacial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aItea virginica 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aNyssa sylvatica 3aOstrya 3aPicea 3aPinus banksiana 3aQuercus 3aRhynchospora 3acoastal plains 3acolluvium 3adolomite 3aflora 3afossils 3aglaciation 3aphytogeography 3apollen 3aponds 3asubsidence 3atrees 3avegetation 3aGeorgia 3aNew England region 3aNorth Carolina 3aVirginia 3aWisconsin0 tEcology.g1970 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.17-33dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19335973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01598naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100012900138245021200267300001800479520031600497592002800813650002400841650001200865650001900877650001500896650001400911650002300925650002300948650001200971650001400983650002000997700002101017773012801038856007301166852000901239655001201248IND60658374920221120234315.0190817e20090218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065837492DNAL7 a10.1039/b819911f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYinPresent address: College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, PR China., Shuang-Feng10aSynthesis and structure of bismuth compounds bearing a sulfur-bridged bis(phenolato) ligand and their catalytic application to the solvent-free synthesis of propylene carbonate from CO₂ and propylene oxide  ap. 1136-1138.  aTwo bismuth compounds bearing a sulfur-bridged bis(phenolato) ligand were synthesized and found to show high catalytic activity and selectivity for solvent-free synthesis of propylene carbonate from CO₂ and propylene oxide in the presence of iodide salts as co-catalysts at room temperature under 1 atm CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abismuth 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3aligands 3apropylene 3apropylene oxide1 aShimada, Shigeru0 tChemical communications.g2009 Feb. 18, , no. 9 p.1136-1138dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b819911f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04017naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245017700167300001400344520228800358592002802646650001202674650001902686650004302705650002302748650001402771650001402785650002302799650001502822650001402837650002202851650001302873650002302886650001502909650001102924650001202935650001502947651001202962653002902974653002603003653002603029653002403055653002203079700002403101700002303125700002103148700002103169700002403190700001603214773014003230856008403370852000903454655001203463IND60570802020221118052723.0190411e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057080202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ppees.2017.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeydel, Felix10aAdaptation to tidal flooding and rapid genetic divergence between a narrow endemic grass species and its widespread congener lead to an early stage of ecological speciation  ap. 57-67.  aDivergent selection on ecological traits is thought to be the main driver of ecological speciation, leading directly or indirectly to the evolution of reproductive barriers between populations in different environments without geographic isolation. Low competition in stressful habitats as well as habitat heterogeneity occurring between biotic regimes are factors, which actively promote speciation in higher plants. The relatively young landscape of the Elbe estuary (Northern Germany) provides an excellent opportunity for studying ecological differentiation in species colonizing the newly developing marshes during the postglacial period.Deschampsia wibeliana (Poaceae) is a perennial grass endemic to the Elbe estuary growing in tidal freshwater and oligohaline marshes. Its putative ancestor, D. cespitosa, is a holarctic distributed species, which is common and widespread in Northern Germany and found in moist (non-tidal) habitats. The high morphological similarity between the taxa is accompanied by strict habitat differentiation.Using a combined approach of molecular analyses (AFLP) and a mesocosm experiment with different hydrological regimes (waterlogging, short-term & long-term tidal flooding), we assessed the genetic and ecological differentiation between the taxa. We asked whether the adaptation of D. wibeliana to tidal flooding might be the result of natural divergent selection on ecological traits.Deschampsia wibeliana and D. cespitosa showed a distinct genetic differentiation in the AFLP analysis. Moreover, differences in the genetic structure among populations between both taxa indicated distinct landscape patterns in gene flow. Moreover, the taxa showed contrasting responses in terms of leaf traits and biomass production towards long-term tidal flooding and waterlogging, indicating adaptation to their respective habitats.There is substantial evidence for an early stage of ecological speciation in the endemic taxon D. wibeliana growing sympatrically with the widely distributed D. cespitosa. The endemism of D. wibeliana is very likely due to an adaptation to high abiotic stress in its habitat (tidal flooding). Our study may present one of the few cases of ecologically driven divergence of a locally adapted narrow neoendemic plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoaceae 3aabiotic stress 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abiomass production 3aestuaries 3aevolution 3aflooded conditions 3afreshwater 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3amarshes 3aperennials 3aGermany 0aAdaptive differentiation 0aDeschampsia cespitosa 0aDeschampsia wibeliana 0aDivergent selection 0aEstuarine marshes1 aEngels, Jana Gesina1 aFeigs, Jannis Till1 aVásquez, Evelyn1 aRudolph, Barbara1 aRohwer, Jens Gunter1 aJensen, Kai0 tPerspectives in plant ecology, evolution and systematics.g2017 Aug., v. 27 p.57-67dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000130x1433-83197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2017.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100007000149245014700219300001800366520063700384592002801021650002301049650002301072650001901095650002301114650003001137650001501167650001901182650002001201650001201221650001101233700002201244700006201266700005801328773012101386856008301507852000901590655001201599IND60649694420190814000000.0190705e20190618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064969442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b019112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido-Castro, Alberto F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7262-798610aIntramolecular Homolytic Substitution Enabled by Photoredox Catalysis: Sulfur, Phosphorus, and Silicon Heterocycle Synthesis from Aryl Halides  ap. 5295-5300.  aAryl radical generation and manipulation constitutes a long-standing challenge in organic synthesis.

Ignition delays of methane, natural gas, and mixtures of natural gas with hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water were measured for temperatures ranging from 870 to 1000 K and pressures from 18 to 24 bar, at equivalence ratios of 1 and 0.7. The results show an accelerating effect of H₂ blending. The experimental measurements are compared with results from numerical simulations using detailed chemical mechanisms from the literature. Natural gas ignition delays can be reproduced satisfactorily, but improvements need to be made to give an accurate, quantitative account of the effect of the inclusion of hydrogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3ahydrogen 3amathematical models 3anatural gas 3asynthesis gas1 aVanhove, G.1 aGriffiths, J.

We investigated tree diversity, endemism and community composition in 13 plots of 0.24ha between 700 and 2400m in the TMF of Central Sulawesi’s (Indonesia) highlands and related the patterns to gradients in elevation, climate and soil properties. Special attention was paid to understorey trees with stem diameters as low as 2cm, not exceeding 2/3 of stand canopy height. Based on extensive taxonomic work on the plots, we found that Sulawesi’s TMF flora is with 27–78 species per 0.24ha not species-poorer than that of other Malesian islands, and vascular plant endemism is higher (22% of the species endemic to Sulawesi) than previously thought. Alpha diversity was mainly dependent on elevation and not soil factors (7 parameters tested). The alpha diversity of tree species, genera and families declined linearly with elevation, as did the number of species and genera per family, revealing higher phylogenetic clustering at lower elevations. Indicator Species Analysis and cluster analysis identified three main forest belts (sub-montane at c. 700–1400m, lower montane at c. 1400–2000m, upper montane at >c. 2000m), deviating from earlier zonation concepts by separating sub-montane (rich in taxa related to the lowlands) and lower montane communities (rich in Fagaceae and Myrtaceae). With 27–51% of all tree species in a plot never found in the upper canopy, our data suggest that the guild of true understorey tree species is species-rich (estimated at c. 130 species in our region), contradicting the hypothesis that Southeast Asian tropical forests with mass-flowering trees (here: Fagaceae) are particularly poor in understorey tree species. We conclude that the mountains of Sulawesi harbour remarkably species-rich, but still understudied, TMF with a unique tree flora rich in understorey trees, which are of high conservation priority.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagaceae 3aMyrtaceae 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3acanopy 3aclimate 3acluster analysis 3acommunity structure 3aflora 3aforest communities 3ahighlands 3aindicator species 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3alowlands 3amontane forests 3amountains 3aphylogeny 3asoil properties 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aunderstory 3aIndonesia 0aLLNP 0aTMF 0aAlpha diversity 0aElevational gradient 0aEndemism 0aMalesia 0aTropical mountain forest 0aUnderstorey trees1 aLeuschner, Christoph1 aTjoa, Aiyen1 aCulmsee, Heike0 tPerspectives in plant ecology, evolution and systematics.g2017 Aug., v. 27 p.68-79dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000130x1433-83197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2017.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245012700159520109000286592002801376650002201404650001401426650001401440650003501454650001901489650002201508650001401530650001501544650001201559650002301571650001001594650002201604650002101626650001701647651001701664700004201681773011701723856007501840852000901915655001201924IND60649766820221118033325.0190706e20181126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064976682DNAL7 a10.3390/land70401462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, Sky 10aTemporal Dynamics and Motivations for Urban Community Food Gardens in Medium-Sized Towns of the Eastern Cape, South Africa  aUrban agriculture is said to be increasing with global urbanization. However, there is little examination of the temporal or spatial dynamics of urban agriculture. We investigated the benefits and challenges experienced by community gardeners in four towns in South Africa, along with GIS analysis of the number, area, and location of urban food community gardens over the last three decades. Common reasons for practicing community gardening were cash poverty (37%) and the need to grow food (34%). The most common benefits reported by respondents were a healthy lifestyle (58%) and consumption of the food produced (54%). Theft of garden infrastructure or produce was a noteworthy challenge to continued motivation and engagement in urban community gardening. There were declines in the number and area of urban community gardens, and more central location over the last three decades. Only 16% of the gardens present in the 1980s were still operating in the 2000s. Clearly community gardening is temporally and spatially dynamic, which requires context-sensitive policy initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity gardens 3agardeners 3agardening 3ageographic information systems 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3alifestyle 3amotivation 3apoverty 3atemporal variation 3atowns 3aurban agriculture 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3aSouth Africa1 aShackleton, C.

In particular, it considers cross relationships between product design dimensions. For example, when products are designed to be more durable, this may add production steps and increase pollutant emissions during production. More generally, changes applied to one dimension can affect the cost or environmental performance of other dimensions. In this theoretical model, a firm interacts with consumers and a regulator. Before the production stage, the firm must choose the levels of three design dimensions: (1) energy performance during production, (2) energy performance during use, and (3) durability. Depending on the assumptions, the dimensions are said to be complementary, neutral, or competitive. The regulator can promote greener designs by applying targeted environmental taxes on emissions during production or consumption. The main results shed light on the consequences of modifying public policies. When some design dimensions are competitive, a targeted emission tax can result in environmental burden shifting, with an overall increase in pollution. This paper also explores the social optimum and the development of second-best policies when some policy instruments are imperfect. When the social planner ignores the possibility for firms to adjust the level of durability, firms may use planned obsolescence to mitigate the cost of too stringent environmental policies. Also, under particular conditions, a government would want to regulate and constrain the level of durability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adurability 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental performance 3aenvironmental policy 3apollutants 3apollution 3apublic policy 3ataxes 3atheoretical models0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2019 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.1183-1202dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-018-0243-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01457naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009000167300001400257520053400271592002800805653001500833653003200848653000800880700002000888700002000908700001700928700001600945700002000961773007100981856008201052852000901134655001201143IND60547632520221119001533.0161027s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054763252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ieri.2014.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yun-hwan,10aCrop Pests Prediction Method Using Regression and Machine Learning Technology: Survey  ap. 52-56.  aThis paper describes current trends in the prediction of crop pests using machine learning technology.

This study revealed common and distinctive signs of morphological and anatomical parameters of C. canescens leaves in the phase of vegetative growth. Among the common features were the shape and size of the leaf laminas, hypostomatic type of the leaf, isolateral structure of the parenchyma, the thick-walled epidermis, and the bilayered hypodermis. Among the distinctive features were the signs of the destruction of cells in the photosynthetic parenchyma, change in their shape with the formation of protuberances at the cells’ poles, and almost doubling area of the aerenchyma in C. canescens leaves under flooding conditions. Scanning electron microscopy showed the similarity of ultrastructure and density of trichomes on the adaxial surface, excepting the formation of cuticular wax structures on the epidermal surface of the leaves in flooded plants. The subcellular localization of silicon inclusions was studied for the first time. The presence of amorphous and small crystalline silicon inclusions in the periclinal walls of the main epidermal cells and amorphous silicon inclusions in leaf trichomes was established. An increase in the relative silicon content along the trichomes in the leaves’ epidermis after flooding was revealed. It was assumed that the phenotypic plasticity of C. canescens, is realized through the increasing area of aerenchyma in leaves and increasing silicon content in trichomes. Such plasticity helps to optimize both the oxygen balance of plants and water balance in flooded plants, thus increasing the species’ resistance to prolonged flooding.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCorynephorus 3aaerenchyma 3aconfocal microscopy 3aepicuticular wax 3aleaves 3alight microscopy 3aoxygen 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphotosynthesis 3asilicon 3atrichomes 3aultrastructure 3avegetative growth 0aCorynephorus canescens 0aleaf epidermis 0aflooding 0aaerenchyma0 tÌntrodukcìâ roslin.g2021, , no. 91/92dNAS of Ukraine, M.M.

We compared the efficacy of yellow Delta traps and yellow Bucket traps, baited with Olive Fruit Fly lure, which attracts both B. oleae males and females. Traps were tested in 20 commercial olive groves, at three locations during autumn (March–May) in 2013. The yellow Delta traps caught significantly more B. oleae than the yellow Bucket traps, as well as significantly more B. oleae males than females. Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) and Bactrocera biguttula (Bezzi) were also trapped during the study. For both species, yellow Delta traps caught significantly more individuals than yellow Bucket traps.

Drought acclimation is attained by avoidance mechanisms in the short term and by adaptation changes in the long term. In this study, we applied deficit irrigation at nursery stage to elicit species-specific physiological responses and biomass production in two ornamental shrub species, comparing two settings: open air (OA) and greenhouse (GH). Viburnum opulus L. and Photinia x fraseri ‘Red robin’ were compared under three irrigation levels: severe water deficit (SWD), moderate water deficit (MWD) and control (C). In both experiments, SWD induced lower values of water potentials in both species whereas MWD had similar effects to C. In OA, SWD reduced earlier stomatal conductance in V. opulus and photosynthesis rate in P. x fraseri and in GH V. opulus showed a reduction of gas exchange even in MWD. P. x fraseri showed greater stomatal control capacity. In contrast, treatments did not affect PSII efficiency even if P. x fraseri proved a greater capacity to differentiate the I–P phase of the fluorescence transient in SWD conditions. In both experiments, SWD and MWD affected leaf area by lowering the number of leaves in P. x fraseri and reducing leaf surface in V. opulus. Moreover, V. opulus showed early leaf senescence and premature fall. Deficit irrigation had effects also on leaf characteristics: smaller leaf area unit in V. opulus, reduced biomass and leaf mass per area and succulence in both species, increase of spongy tissue thickness. Eventually, we can state that P. x fraseri can withstand 30 % evapotranspiration, while maintaining functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3astomatal conductance 3ashrubs 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3aacclimation 3adrought 3aViburnum opulus 3adeficit irrigation 3aleaf area 3aPhotinia fraseri 3airrigation rates 3aphotosystem II 3aphysiological response 3abiomass production 3aleaves 0asenescence1 aBussotti, Filippo1 aRaschi, A.,1 aTognetti, R.,1 aEnnos, Roland,0 tTrees.g2015 Apr., v. 29, no. 2 p.407-422dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-014-1120-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245011200184500001900296520147800315592002801793650001901821650001501840650001001855650001101865650001101876650001201887650002201899653002201921653002001943653001601963653001301979653001501992653001602007653002102023700003002044700003002074700006202104773010902166856008602275852000902361655001202370IND60716154820221120042019.0210121e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071615482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Rodríguez, M.

Crocus sativus L. corms were harvested in two different vegetative stages, 20 days prior to leaf senescence (V3–20 d) and shortly after leaf senescence (V3). They were then placed in two different storage conditions for forcing, and the corms were kept in incubation conditions at 25 °C for 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days, and in ultra-low oxygen (ULO) cooling chambers for 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days. Subsequently, the flowers of the corms grown under controlled environmental conditions were harvested, and the stigmas were dehydrated. Finally, the saffron quality was analyzed according to ISO 3632:2011 with respect to colouring strength (parameter at 440 nm), bitterness (parameter at 257 nm) and aromatic strength (parameter at 330 nm), and the amount of the primary quality compounds was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The corms of Crocus sativus L. were able to remain in incubation conditions for 30 to 120 days and in the ULO chamber for 30 to 90 days with a saffron quality similar to that of traditionally grown saffron; the best saffron quality results were found for incubation conditions in vegetative stage V3–20 d for 30 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocus sativus 3abitterness 3acorms 3aleaves 3aoxygen 3asaffron 3avegetative growth 0aCrocus sativus L. 0aCrocetin esters 0aPicrocrocin 0aSafranal 0aIncubation 0aULO chamber 0aVegetative stage1 aMoratalla-López, Natalia1 aLópez-Córcoles, Horacio1 aAlonso, Gonzalo L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9980-50730 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 277 p.109811-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245008900169300002000258520106500278592002801343650001101371650001201382650001901394650001301413653003701426653002701463653001501490653001301505653000901518653002001527700001701547700002001564700002201584700001501606700002301621700002201644700002101666700002001687773012601707856008001833852000901913655001201922IND60555363020221119224321.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536302DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b097582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanford, Michael G.10aLaser-Assisted Focused He+ Ion Beam Induced Etching with and without XeF2 Gas Assist  ap. 29155-29162.  aFocused helium ion (He⁺) milling has been demonstrated as a high-resolution nanopatterning technique; however, it can be limited by its low sputter yield as well as the introduction of undesired subsurface damage. Here, we introduce pulsed laser- and gas-assisted processes to enhance the material removal rate and patterning fidelity. A pulsed laser-assisted He⁺ milling process is shown to enable high-resolution milling of titanium while reducing subsurface damage in situ. Gas-assisted focused ion beam induced etching (FIBIE) of Ti is also demonstrated in which the XeF₂ precursor provides a chemical assist for enhanced material removal rate. Finally, a pulsed laser-assisted and gas-assisted FIBIE process is shown to increase the etch yield by ∼9× relative to the pure He⁺ sputtering process. These He⁺ induced nanopatterning techniques improve material removal rate, in comparison to standard He⁺ sputtering, while simultaneously decreasing subsurface damage, thus extending the applicability of the He⁺ probe as a nanopattering tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahelium 3amilling 3ananotechnology 3atitanium 0afocused ion beam induced etching 0alaser-assisted etching 0ahelium ion 0atitanium 0aXeF2 0ananofabrication1 aMahady, Kyle1 aLewis, Brett

How to remove these dyes in effluents effectively remains a major concern in wastewater treatment. In this work, the accelerating biodegradation effect of two inorganic intermediates generated by UV irradiation on a monoazo dye, Acid Orange 7 (AO7), was studied in a biofilm reactor. RESULTS: The biodegradation reaction fitted well with fractional‐order kinetics. The promotion effects of k trend for the two inorganic intermediates were NH₄⁺ addition > SO₄²⁻ addition (> AO7 biodegradation alone). NH₄⁺ ions increased biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) gradually: compared with 0.5 mg L⁻¹ addition protocol, the BOD of 3 mg L⁻¹ addition protocol was enhanced about five‐fold. SO₄²⁻ ions showed a positive effect at low concentration and a negative effect at high concentration. In addition, the effect of the two inorganic intermediates on aerobic microbial respiration rate (i.e. SOUR) was similar to BOD. Based on the analysis of high‐throughput sequencing and cluster of orthologous groups, a mechanism of accelerating azo dye biodegradation by using its available intermediates was proposed. CONCLUSION: This work revealed that the main inorganic intermediates of the azo dye could accelerate its biodegradation rates. In addition, the bioreactor provided an integrated anaerobic/aerobic micro‐environment that was beneficial to promoting this acceleration effect. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  a51508330cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aacid orange 7 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3abioreactors 3acell respiration 3atextile mill effluents 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater treatment1 aPeng, Qian1 aXuan, Runhe1 aZhang, Yongming1 aXue, Gang1 aSun, Weihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8797-14640 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.2336-2342dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.67613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04665naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245013800165520309200303592002803395650001803423650001103441650001403452650002303466650001603489650001103505650002103516650001503537650001703552650001903569650001403588650001103602650002103613650001403634650001803648650001303666650001203679650001703691651002403708651001403732651001203746651001503758651001003773651000903783700002603792700002603818700002503844700002303869700001803892773011703910856007504027852000904102655001204111IND60649767120221118033126.0190706e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064976712DNAL7 a10.3390/land70401492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroshans, Garth  R.10aAssessing the Value of Soil Inorganic Carbon for Ecosystem Services in the Contiguous United States Based on Liming Replacement Costs  aSoil databases are very important for assessing ecosystem services at different administrative levels (e.g., state, region etc.). Soil databases provide information about numerous soil properties, including soil inorganic carbon (SIC), which is a naturally occurring liming material that regulates soil pH and performs other key functions related to all four recognized ecosystem services (e.g., provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services). However, the ecosystem services value, or &ldquo;true value,&rdquo; of SIC is not recognized in the current land market. In this case, a negative externality arises because SIC with a positive value has zero market price, resulting in the market failure and the inefficient use of land. One potential method to assess the value of SIC is by determining its replacement cost based on the price of commercial limestone that would be required to amend soil. The objective of this study is to assess SIC replacement cost value in the contiguous United States (U.S.) by depth (0&ndash;20, 20&ndash;100, 100&ndash;200 cm) and considering different spatial aggregation levels (i.e., state, region, land resource region (LRR) using the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) soil database. A replacement cost value of SIC was determined based on an average price of limestone in 2014 ($10.42 per U.S. ton). Within the contiguous U.S., the total replacement cost value of SIC in the upper two meters of soil is between $2.16T (i.e., 2.16 trillion U.S. dollars, where T = trillion = 1012) and $8.97T. States with the highest midpoint total value of SIC were: (1) Texas ($1.84T), (2) New Mexico ($355B, that is, 355 billion U.S. dollars, where B = billion = 109) and (3) Montana ($325B). When normalized by area, the states with the highest midpoint SIC values were: (1) Texas ($2.78 m&minus;2), (2) Utah ($1.72 m&minus;2) and (3) Minnesota ($1.35 m&minus;2). The highest ranked regions for total SIC value were: (1) South Central ($1.95T), (2) West ($1.23T) and (3) Northern Plains ($1.01T), while the highest ranked regions based on area-normalized SIC value were: (1) South Central ($1.80 m&minus;2), (2) Midwest ($0.82 m&minus;2) and (3) West ($0.63 m&minus;2). For land resource regions (LRR), the rankings were: (1) Western Range and Irrigated Region ($1.10T), (2) Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region ($926B) and (3) Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region ($635B) based on total SIC value, while the LRR rankings based on area-normalized SIC value were: (1) Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region ($3.33 m&minus;2), (2) Southwestern Prairies Cotton and Forage Region ($2.83 m&minus;2) and (3) Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region ($1.59 m&minus;2). Most of the SIC is located within the 100&ndash;200 cm depth interval with a midpoint replacement cost value of $2.49T and an area-normalized value of $0.34 m&minus;2. Results from this study provide a link between science-based estimates (e.g., soil order) of SIC replacement costs within the administrative boundaries (e.g., state, region etc.).  aPublisher supplied data 3acost analysis 3acotton 3adatabases 3aecosystem services 3afeed grains 3aforage 3ainorganic carbon 3airrigation 3aland markets 3aland resources 3alimestone 3aliming 3aliming materials 3alivestock 3amarket prices 3aprairies 3asoil pH 3awinter wheat 3aGreat Plains region 3aMinnesota 3aMontana 3aNew Mexico 3aTexas 3aUtah1 aMikhailova, Elena  A.1 aPost, Christopher  J.1 aSchlautman, Mark  A.1 aZurqani, Hamdi  A.1 aZhang, Lisha 0 tLand.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land70401493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013300170300001600303500001500319520192500334592002802259650001502287650002102302650002702323650002302350650001102373650001002384650001402394650002002408650001402428650000902442650001002451650002202461650001302483651001002496653002302506700001802529700002202547773008002569856008102649852000902730655001202739IND60121687420221119085212.0150318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012168742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-014-1122-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViswanathan, M.

As endemic and threatened species are susceptible to loss of genetic variation due to stochastic factors, investigation was carried out to assess genetic diversity of Monoon tirunelveliense (Annonaceae), which is a steno endemic and a critically endangered species from the Kalakkad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in India, using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs). Thirty-five samples collected from seven populations were screened by 34 primers, wherein 11 primers produced 65 clear and reproducible bands that included 43.08 % of polymorphic bands (PPB), at the rate of 1–6 bands population⁻¹and 5.90 bands primer⁻¹. Nei’s genetic diversity (H) was 0.1428, on an average. Analysis of Shannon information index (I) showed 0.2120, on an average, and total genetic diversity (HT) was moderate with 0.2651 and genetic diversity within populations (HS) was a low of 0.1428. Proportion of total diversity among populations (GST) was 0.4613. Gene flow among populations (Nm) was 0.5839 individuals generation⁻¹indicating a low migration rate among populations. Mantel test showed no significant correlation among genetic differentiation and geographical distance (r = 0.489, p = 0.007). Phylogenetic relationship among Monoon species using rbcL and matK gene sequences derived by combined Bayesian analysis is given. Besides conserving all the existing populations, matured fruits should be collected and sown in debris-free soil to increase the percentage of seed germination as seeds are highly vulnerable to the attack of termites and microbial decay. Seeds from genetic diversity-rich Populations 2 and 3 are recommended for propagation to increase the extent and occurrence of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnonaceae 3aseed germination 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aendangered species 3afruits 3aseeds 3aphylogeny 3aBayesian theory 3agene flow 3asoil 3atrees 3agenetic variation 3aIsoptera 3aIndia 0athreatened species1 aRajasekar, C.1 aSathish Kumar, P.0 tTrees.g2015 Apr., v. 29, no. 2 p.437-447dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-014-1122-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245010400212500001900316520112500335592002801460650002201488650002501510650001301535650001401548650001001562650001401572650001701586650001101603650002201614650001201636650002101648650001101669650002301680650001401703653003201717653001901749653001301768653002101781700003101802700003501833700008401868700007601952700003102028700003102059700002502090773010902115856008602224852000902310655001202319IND60716155020221120032711.0210121e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071615502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Marcela1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4838-408510aAgronomic, physical–chemical and sensory evaluation of pepper hybrids (Capsicum chinense Jacquin)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCapsicum chinense peppers are considered the most Brazilian of the species and have wide genetic diversity among cultivars. Its demand is increasing, requiring the development of new hybrid cultivars, with better agronomic and nutritional categories. The objective of the study was to carry out agronomic, physical-applied and sensory evaluations of five hybrids and an open pollination cultivar (OP) (BRS Moema) of C. chinense. The five hybrids obtained higher productivity, yield and biometry of fruits, being ideal for the processed and fresh market. The cultivar BRS Moema and two hybrids (F1 10 and F1 12), had better fruit properties (lipids and fibers), and the F1 12 hybrid stood out for containing the highest antioxidant activity and capsaicin content. From the sensory point of view, the hybrids had greater sums for the attributes of preference (size, color, pungency and sweet taste). Thus, it is concluded that the hybrids F1 12 and F1 23 have the potential to be new cultivars in terms of productivity and yield, combining good agronomic, nutritional and sensory characteristics for a C. chinense species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum chinense 3aantioxidant activity 3abiometry 3acapsaicin 3acolor 3acultivars 3afresh market 3afruits 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3aopen pollination 3apepper 3asensory evaluation 3asweetness 0aAntioxidant characteristics 0aPlant breeding 0aPungency 0aSensory analysis1 aSantos, Camila Peixoto dos1 aVerruma-Bernardi, Marta Regina1 aCarrilho, Elma Neide Vasconcelos Martins1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3819-941X1 aSilva, Paula Porrelli Moreira da1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6885-18701 aSpoto, Marta Helena Fillet1 aCiarrocchi, Isabella Rocha1 aSala, Fernando Cesar0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 277 p.109819-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010200163300001800265520043600283592002800719650002600747650001300773650003600786650001400822650002300836650002300859650001100882650002600893650001100919700006100930773012100991856008301112852000901195655001201204IND60649693320221120140646.0190705e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064969332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b018462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qiao10aCobalt-Catalyzed Tandem Radical Cyclization/C–C Coupling Initiated by Directed C–H Activation  ap. 5238-5242.  aA cobalt–N-heterocyclic carbene catalyst promotes a tandem radical cyclization/C–C coupling reaction between tosylamide-tethered bromo-alkenes and aryl N–H imines initiated by chelation-assisted arene C–H activation, affording 3-(arylmethyl)pyrrolidine derivatives in moderate to good yields.

Healthcare providers have relied on clinical methods, devices such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) sensors, and radiography (the gold standard) to evaluate NFT placements. Most institutions include radiographs in their protocols for NFT insertions, making it expensive and cumbersome. A new commercial CO₂ sensor was developed to assist in these procedures, and the authors evaluated its use. Methods: Nurses performing NFT placement completed questionnaires following each procedure. The nurses recorded the clinical methods used to determine proper insertion and, based on them, where the NFT was located. Nurses then evaluated NFT insertion with the CO₂ sensor; from the readings, they recorded where the tube was located. Confirmation of tube placement was performed radiographically. Results: The authors evaluated 424 NFT insertions. Of these, 15 (3.5%) were incorrectly placed into the airway, and 409 were correctly placed into the esophagus. The CO₂ sensor correctly assessed NFT placement in 421 (99%) of the 424 cases. The authors found the device to have a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 99.8%. Conclusions: The CO₂ sensor is a helpful bedside tool to use in conjunction with clinical methods during NFT insertions. However, there is insufficient evidence to abandon the use of radiographs to confirm tube placement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acolorimetry 3aesophagus 3anurses 3aprotocols 3aquestionnaires 3aradiography 0acarbon dioxide 0agastrointestinal intubation 0aenteral nutrition 0acritical care1 aOchoa, Juan B.1 aBrown, Nefertiti1 aBayless, Angela1 aCorreia, M.

One straightforward possibility when selecting for two traits is to base selection on the ratio of two trait values, particularly if the ratio has a biological or economic interpretation. In this study, selection was simulated on the ratio of two polygenically inherited Traits X and Y which were normally distributed and had genetic variances of one. The criterion for selection was the ratio (X/Y). The research objectives were to determine in the selected elite population (i) the responses of the numerator and denominator traits and the ratio, per se, to increasing selection pressure, (ii) the effect of genetic correlation between two traits on ratio selection, and (iii) the selection differentials of ratio trait for estimation of realized heritability. When the two traits had equal variances and means, selection to increase the ratio caused a greater decrease in the mean value of the denominator trait than an increase in the numerator trait. Conversely, selection to decrease the ratio always decreased the mean of the numerator trait more than it increased the denominator trait. For a highly negative genetic correlation (−0.75) between traits, the selection response of the ratio was maximized. When genetic correlation was 0.50 or 0.75, the response of one component trait was near zero. The standardized selection differential for the ratio trait, in comparison with the normally distributed trait, was biased upwards with selection for increased ratio and biased downwards with selection for decreased ratio.

We do this in the case of Sweden, where a set of firms are covered by both types of regulations—the Swedish [Formula: see text] tax and the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Our results indicate that there is a significant degree of heterogeneity in the transaction costs of the firms in our sample. Moreover, for some of the firms, the transaction costs are high when compared with the actual cost of the [Formula: see text] tax and the price of the EU ETS. Furthermore, we find that the MRV costs are lower for [Formula: see text] taxation than for the EU ETS, which confirms the general view that regulating emissions upstream via a [Formula: see text] tax yields lower transaction costs vis-á-vis downstream regulation via emissions trading.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental markets 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amonitoring 3aprices 3ataxes 3aSweden1 aJaraitė, Jūratė0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2019 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.965-1001dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-018-0235-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009100169300001600260520168400276592002801960650001501988650001302003650001102016650000902027650001802036650001602054653002902070653001702099653001502116653004102131653004202172653002502214700002402239773007402263856008402337852000902421655001202430IND60585434320221120151947.0171109e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058543432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Sunyoung10aParametric study of an absorption refrigeration machine using advanced exergy analysis  ap. 453-467.  aAn advanced exergy analysis of a water–lithium bromide absorption refrigeration machine was conducted. For each component of the machine, the proposed analysis quantified the irreversibility that can be avoided and the irreversibility that is unavoidable. It also identified the irreversibility originating from inefficiencies within the component and the irreversibility that does not originate from the operation of the considered component. It was observed that the desorber and absorber concentrated most of the exergy destruction. Furthermore, the exergy destruction at these components was found to be dominantly endogenous and unavoidable. A parametrical study has been presented discussing the sensitivity of the different performance indicators to the temperature at which the heat source is available, the temperature of the refrigerated environment, and the temperature of the cooling medium used at the condenser and absorber. It was observed that the endogenous avoidable exergy destruction at the desorber, i.e. the portion of the desorber irreversibility that could be avoided by improving the design and operation of the desorber, decreased when the heat source or the temperature at which the cooling effect was generated increased, and it decreased when the heat sink temperature increased. The endogenous avoidable exergy destruction at the absorber displayed the same variations, though it was observed to be less affected by the heat source temperature. Contrary to the aforementioned two components, the exergy destruction at the evaporator and condenser were dominantly endogenous and avoidable, with little sensitivity to the cycle operating parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abromides 3aexergy 3aheat 3arefrigeration 3atemperature 0aAbsorption refrigeration 0aWater–LiBr 0aSecond law 0aEndogenous/Exogenous irreversibility 0aAvoidable/Unavoidable irreversibility 0aSensitivity analysis1 aGoni Boulama, Kiari0 tEnergy.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 76 p.453-467dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001600273520203000289592002802319650002602347650001202373650001202385650001902397650001702416650001002433650002702443650001602470650002002486650001002506650000902516650001702525650001602542651002102558700001802579773008002597856008102677852000902758655001202767IND60121687620221119084849.0150318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012168762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-014-1124-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Lisa J.10aIntra-annual dendroclimatic reconstruction for northern British Columbia, Canada, using wood properties  ap. 461-474.  aKEY MESSAGE : Analyses of tree-ring wood properties combined with an understanding of tree physiology provided detailed intra-annual insights into historical and seasonal climate phenomena in sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro®software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July–August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May–June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July–August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aclimate 3aforests 3agrowing season 3agrowth rings 3alakes 3aphysiological response 3atemperature 3atree physiology 3atrees 3awood 3awood density 3awood fibers 3aBritish Columbia1 aSmith, Dan J.0 tTrees.g2015 Apr., v. 29, no. 2 p.461-474dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-014-1124-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009800175300001800273520204400291536011802335592002802453650002002481650001902501650002002520650001402540650001502554651001602569651001002585653001902595653002402614653001402638653002102652700001602673700002002689700001602709700002002725773012902745856008602874852000902960655001202969IND60722392620221118044542.0210515e20201214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072239262DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2020.18238972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatzenberger, Katja10aEvaluating the need for an animal welfare assurance programme in South Tyrolean dairy farming  ap. 1146-1156.  aAnimal welfare assurance is of great importance as dairy farming is recently under increasing pressure to meet societal and commercial expectations. Therefore, this study aims to determine the current welfare situation of dairy cattle housed in tie-stalls and free stalls in South Tyrol (Eastern Italian Alps) in order to evaluate the need for establishment of an animal welfare assurance programme. For reasons of research economy, a protocol was used for data collection that would also be applicable for practical use in an animal welfare assurance scheme. Analyses of resource-based and animal-based indicators recorded in 204 farms in North and South Tyrol (1891 dairy cows) reveal some important animal welfare problems mainly related to the provision of resources and the prevalence of skin alterations especially in tie-stall barns, which are still widely spread in mountain areas. Hence, the implementation of an animal welfare assurance scheme is urgently needed to reflect public concerns through regular and standardised monitoring of welfare indicators and continuous encouragement of improvements in dairy cattle welfare towards predefined targets. Concerning tie-stalls, interventions in stall design as well as the selective use of local breeds best adapted to the mountainous conditions appear to be appropriate measures to optimise dairy cattle health and welfare. These findings substantiate the high value of the data that would be collected as part of the assurance programme to gain insights, which could be used in preventive and corrective health plans to improve welfare-friendliness in dairy farming of South Tyrol.HighlightsAn adverse effect on animal welfare in tie-stalls was pointed out, even though this housing system is still widely spread in the Alpine region. An animal welfare assurance programme for dairy cattle is urgently needed in South Tyrol, where some welfare problems currently exist. Regular and standardised monitoring of indicators encourages improvements in dairy cattle health and welfare.  aThis article was further supported by the Open Access Publishing Fund provided by the Free University of Bolzano.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanimal welfare 3adata collection 3amountains 3atie stalls 3aAlps region 3aItaly 0aAnimal welfare 0aassurance programme 0adairy cow 0amountain farming1 aRauch, Elke1 aErhard, Michael1 aReese, Sven1 aGauly, Matthias0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2020 Dec. 14, v. 19, no. 1 p.1146-1156dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2020.18238973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245004600172300001400218520119800232592002801430650002301458650002301481650002201504650002001526650001801546650002501564650003101589653000801620653000801628653000801636653003201644653001901676653001701695653002201712653002001734653001701754653002601771773011001797856008601907852000901993655001202002IND60628448220221121043039.0190206e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062844822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2017.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Abhimanyu10aAutoregressive spatial spectral estimates  ap. 80-95.  aNonparametric spectral density estimates find many uses in econometrics. For stationary random fields on a regular spatial lattice, we propose an autoregressive nonparametric spectral density estimate that is guaranteed positive even when suitable edge-effect correction is employed and is simple to compute using least squares. Our estimate is based on truncating a true half-plane infinite autoregressive representation, while also allowing the truncation length to diverge in all dimensions to avoid the potential bias due to truncation at a fixed lag-length. Uniform consistency of the proposed estimate is established, and new criteria for order selection are also suggested and studied in practical settings. The asymptotic distribution of the estimate is shown to be zero-mean normal and independent at fixed distinct frequencies, mirroring the behaviour for time series. A small Monte Carlo experiment examines finite sample performance. Technically the key to the results is the covariance structure of stationary random fields defined on regularly spaced lattices. We show the covariance matrix to satisfy a generalization of the Toeplitz property familiar from time series analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3aleast squares 3atime series analysis 3avariance covariance matrix 0aC14 0aC18 0aC21 0aSpectral density estimation 0aHAC estimation 0aRandom field 0aCovariance matrix 0aSpatial process 0aLattice data 0aCentral limit theorem0 tJournal of econometrics.g2018 Mar., v. 203, no. 1 p.80-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2017.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01707naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245007600174300001600250520073500266592002801001650001101029650001901040650001401059650002201073650001101095650001101106650001801117700003101135773013601166856008201302852000901384655001201393IND60638868920221117232742.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063886892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-018-0234-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarella, Paolo Giorgio10aCarbon Tax, Emission Standards, and Carbon Leak Under Price Competition  ap. 941-964.  aWe consider a two-country model of price competition, with one polluting firm in each country and differentiated products.

Under the tax the two firms set their prices simultaneously, in a Bertrand game. Under the standard the home firm’s price is conditioned on the price of the foreign firm, so as to abide the emission constraint. As a result, the tax leads to higher leakages and global emissions than the standard. The standard also implies a better trade balance for the home country than the tax.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3aemissions 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprices 3atrade balance1 aTrentinaglia, Maria Teresa0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2019 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.941-964dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-018-0234-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245013700161520178200298592002802080650002702108650002602135650001502161650002502176650003502201650001602236650002202252650001502274650001602289650001102305650001902316650001702335650001802352650001202370650001602382651001202398700002502410700001902435773011702454856007502571852000902646655001202655IND60649767420221118033221.0190706e20181205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064976742DNAL7 a10.3390/land70401512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKivinen, Sonja 10aPeople and Post-Mining Environments: PPGIS Mapping of Landscape Values, Knowledge Needs, and Future Perspectives in Northern Finland  aMining can have a notable environmental and social footprint both during the production phase and after the mine closure. We examined local stakeholders&rsquo; viewpoints on two post-mining areas in northern Finland, Hannukainen and Rautuvaara, using a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) approach. Spatially explicit data on local residents&rsquo; and visitors&rsquo; values, knowledge needs, and future perspectives on mining landscapes were collected with an online map-based survey tool (Harava). The results show that post-mining sites were generally considered unpleasant places. A majority of respondents were of the opinion that areas would need better reclamation and landscaping measures. The landscape surrounding the post-mining sites contained a wide diversity of pleasant places with high nature and recreational value. Respondents addressed various environmental concerns related to the impacts of former mining activities on the quality of ground water and surface water, potential soil contamination, and the safety of natural products. Opinions on the planned mine reopening were strongly divided among the respondents. One of the key questions was whether a large open-pit mine and nature-based tourism can coexist in the same region. Our results highlight that &ldquo;the shadow of the mine&rdquo;&mdash;observed environmental impacts, uncertainties related to the spatial extent, duration, and magnitude of impacts, and knowledge gaps&mdash;can affect local stakeholders&rsquo; land use far outside the mining sites and long after the mine closure. Identifying and mapping stakeholder values, opinions, and knowledge needs could significantly improve post-mining land use planning and mitigate the loss of multifunctional landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acitizen participation 3aecotourism 3aenvironmental impact 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3aland use planning 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3amining 3asoil pollution 3astakeholders 3asurface water 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aFinland1 aVartiainen, Kaarina 1 aKumpula, Timo 0 tLand.g2018 Dec. 05, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land70401513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245009500168300002000263520102000283592002801303650002401331650002601355650001301381650001401394650002201408650003301430650001701463650001501480650000901495650001501504653001701519653002201536653001401558653001501572653001401587700002301601700001701624700001501641773012601656856008001782852000901862655001201871IND60555363420170710000000.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536342DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b098052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Castaño, M.10aAnalysis of Zinc Nitride Resistive Indicators under Different Relative Humidity Conditions  ap. 29163-29168.  aZinc nitride (Zn₃N₂) is a metastable material in ambient conditions because of its high reactivity with water molecules. In this work we perform a systematic analysis of the oxidation of Zn₃N₂ layers grown by RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The aging and transformation of the layers toward a ZnO film is explored by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry and scanning electron microscopy for conditions with different relative humidity (RH). Accurate depth profiling by means of elastic recoil detection analysis with a time-of-flight telescope demonstrated the substitutional reaction between O and N and the important effect of the RH in this process. Because of this metastability the resistivity of the layers changes several orders of magnitude. Taking advantage of this principle, we develop electronic indicators and characterize the transformation of their electrical properties as a function of the ambient RH, finding a good correlation between the transformation time and the RH level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aelectrical properties 3anitrides 3aoxidation 3arelative humidity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3atelescopes 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0azinc nitride 0arelative humidity 0aindicator 0asputtering 0aoxidation1 aRedondo-Cubero, A.1 aVázquez, L.1 aPau, J.

However, the hot spot problem of the LED is very critical for its lifetime and efficiency. TIMs (Thermal Interface Materials) have been used to enhance the cooling performance of the LED. However its thermal conductivity is not high enough to overcome the hot spot problem. In this study, nano-pastes are made by adding CNT (carbon nanotube) and graphene to the thermal grease to enhance the heat dissipation. It is found that the thermal conductivities of CNT grease and graphene grease enhance up to 16% and 6% at 0.75 wt% of the nanoparticles, respectively, compared with the pure thermal grease. The cooling performances of the LED package with applied CNT paste and graphene paste are enhanced by reducing the LED chip temperature 7.5 °C and 5.5 °C at 0.75 wt% of nanoparticles, respectively. It is also found that the nano-paste materials help the enhancement of heat spreading to remove the hot spot problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aenergy conversion 3agraphene 3aheat 3alight emitting diodes 3ananoparticles 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 0aEnergy conversion 0aNano-pastes 0aLight Emitting Diode 0aCooling performance1 aKang, Yong Tae0 tEnergy.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 76 p.468-476dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.08.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245009600206300001800302500002000320520163300340592002801973596006602001596006102067596007002128596000802198650002802206650001702234650001702251650001802268650003202286650001402318650001902332650001302351650001502364650001702379650002702396650001602423700006102439700003202500700002302532700002302555700001902578700002002597773015102617856007302768852000902841655001202850IND60743162820221119104431.0210707e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074316282DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.67602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrano‐Arnaldos, Mar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5919-095112aA simplified kinetic model to describe the solvent‐free enzymatic synthesis of wax esters  ap. 2325-2335.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The use of biotechnological processes at industrial scale is a promising tool to replace conventional synthesis as an efficient and eco‐friendly technology. For that purpose, the kinetic modelling of an in‐lab optimized enzymatic process prior to scaling‐up is of great utility. RESULTS: In this work, a kinetic model for the solvent‐free synthesis of cetyl laurate, myristate, palmitate and stearate using different commercial immobilized lipases has been developed. In order to describe the esterification process of the cetyl esters separately and as a mixture similar to natural spermaceti, a pseudo‐first‐order kinetic has been proposed and tested. A relation between the inverse values of the kinetic constant and the amount of biocatalyst has been observed. The effect of temperature on the reaction rate can be accurately described by the Arrhenius equation except for immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus, which appears to be less resistant to temperatures above 70 °C. CONCLUSION: Low deviations between experimental and predicted values (R² ≥ 0.99) indicate that this pseudo‐first‐order kinetic model can be considered valid for the data range studied. In addition, the reaction rate of spermaceti can be successfully predicted through a weighted average of the kinetic constants obtained during the synthesis of each cetyl ester. This simple but accurate kinetic model for describing the solvent‐free enzymatic biosynthesis of wax esters from spermaceti may contribute to extending the application of lipases as industrial catalysts. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  aCTQ2015‐66723‐RcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aTorres QuevedocMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  cSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación  cFPI 3aThermomyces lanuginosus 3abiocatalysts 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aequations 3aesterification 3akinetics 3apalmitates 3astearic acid 3asustainable technology 3atemperature1 aMurcia, M Dolores1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1582-08991 aOrtega‐Requena, Salvadora1 aMontiel, M Claudia1 aMáximo, Fuensanta1 aGómez, Elisa,1 aBastida, Josefa0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.2325-2335dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.67603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002500161245007100186300001600257500000900273500001500282520165200297592002801949650001601977650001601993650001602009650001002025650001302035650003702048650002302085650002102108650002002129651001202149653001002161653001502171700002102186773012102207852000902328856009802337655001202435IND2056296320221122052022.0191122e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205629632DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500020022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSohédjié, Ouattara10aEffect of Growth Habit on Yield Components of Late-Planted Soybean  ap. 411-415.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aLate-planted soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yields are usually lower than full-season soybean yields. Indeterminate growth habit may be superior to the traditional determinate growth habit for late planting in the southeastern USA. The objective of our study was to determine the effect of determinate and indeterminate growth habit genes on yield components of late-planted near-isogenic fines of soybean. Twenty-three determinate and 23 indeterminate near-isogenic lines (near-isolines) of soybean from three populations were compared in the field at Brewton, Tallassee, and Shorter, AL, in 1991 and 1992. Determinates had lower lowest-pod heights, more mainstem branches per plant, and more two-seeded pods than indeterminates. Growth habit did not affect total pods per plant, mainstem or branch pods per plant, seeds per plant, seed mass, or number of three-seeded pods per plant. The growth habit × population and growth habit × location interactions were significant for most traits, but the growth habit × year interactions were nonsignificant or small. Number of mainstem pods was the only yield component correlated with yield (r = 0.36**). We conclude that (i) growth habit genes have little consistent effect on most yield component traits, (ii) growth habit effects are site- and population-specific in the southeastern USA, and (iii) seed yield is not correlated with yield component traits in late-planted soybean.

We examine the sieve MLE of the model, where the disturbances are i.i.d.with an unknown distribution. We show that the spatial autoregressive process with Tobit censoring and related variables are spatial near-epoch dependent (NED). A related contribution is that we develop some exponential inequalities for spatial NED random fields. With these inequalities, we establish the consistency of the estimator. Asymptotic distributions of structural parameters of the model are derived from a functional central limit theorem and projection.Simulations show that the sieve MLE can improve the finite sample performance upon misspecified normal MLEs. As an empirical application, we examine the school district income surtax rates in Iowa. Our results show that the spatial spillover effects are significant, but they may be overestimated if disturbances are restricted to be normally distributed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3aincome 3astatistical analysis 3aIowa 0aC14 0aC21 0aC24 0aC63 0aSpatial autoregressive model 0aTobit model 0aSieve maximum likelihood estimation 0aNear-epoch dependence 0aSocial network1 aLee, Lung-fei0 tJournal of econometrics.g2018 Mar., v. 203, no. 1 p.96-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2017.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245011200161300001600273520101100289592002801300650001201328650002401340650001501364773012801379856008001507852000901587655001201596IND60765243820220419000000.0220419e20120217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076524382DNAL7 a10.17221/5056-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRejnuš, O.14aThe present significance of commodity exchange trading in the conditions of the current world economy&nbsp;  ap. 497-502.  aThe paper discusses the importance of commodity exchange trading while placing a special emphasis on the increasingly close interconnection between commodity markets and financial instruments markets. The aim of the paper is to prove that at present, commodity markets cannot be seen as strictly separate from markets trading in financial instruments, as there are increasingly close links between the two, which effectively lead to the transfer of financial resources invested in the financial market into the real economy. The paper analyses the most significant ties that already exist between the commodities and financial investment instruments in the financial and capital market, as well as the links that are very likely to come into existence in the near future. In the concluding part, there is a summary of the reasons that will necessarily lead to a further world-wide development of commodity exchange trading and a prediction of the lines along which this development is likely to take place.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aeconomic investment 3aprediction0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 52, no. 11 p.497-502dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/5056-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245013800206300001600344520129000360592002801650650001001678650001101688650001201699650001901711650001101730650002301741650001501764650002501779650001201804650001501816651001801831653003001849653002201879653001601901653002601917653002201943653002701965700001401992700001702006700001902023700002102042773010502063856008502168852000902253655001202262IND60570800920221118052639.0190411e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057080092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2017.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuguerza, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4335-066310aStructural impoverishment of the subtidal vegetation of southeastern Bay of Biscay from 1991 to 2013 in the context of climate change  ap. 166-179.  aThis study assesses changes in the taxonomic and functional structure and in the diversity of the shallow (3–9m) subtidal vegetation off the southeastern coast of the Bay of Biscay by studying 19 locations between 1991 and 2013. Results provide evidence that the three-dimensional assemblages of shallow subtidal bottoms in the study area may be shifting towards less structurally complex communities. Canopy-forming algae are declining whereas simple thallus turfs composed of a combination of filamentous, polysiphonated and foliose non-corticated algae are becoming abundant along with articulated corallines and crustose species. Moreover, a significant increase in taxa richness and diversity was found, mainly due to the development of opportunistic and morphologically simple forms with warm-water affinity. The potential ecological consequences of canopy loss for coastal ecosystems are discussed. Given that changes in climate conditions are predicted to intensify, the prevalence of the new turfing space occupiers in the study area here considered seems to be realistic on the basis of their ability to compete for space and resist disturbance. Consequently, major implications for the functioning and diversity of the ecosystem and for ecosystem services may be expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3acanopy 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3athallus 3avegetation 3aBay of Biscay 0aAlternative stable states 0aBiogenic habitats 0aCanopy loss 0aEcological resilience 0aLong-term changes 0aMacroalgal assemblages1 aDíez, I.1 aQuintano, E.1 aBustamante, M.1 aGorostiaga, J.M.0 tJournal of sea research.g2017 Dec., v. 130 p.166-179dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2017.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245016400163300001600327500001900343500002000362520140900382592002801791596006101819650001901880650002001899650002001919650001301939650001601952650001401968650001101982650003201993650001602025700003102041700002202072700001902094700002102113700002302134700002602157700001802183700002202201700001702223773011602240856007302356852000902429655001202438IND60734389720221123033333.0210417e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073438972DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.121562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarilar, Véronique10aAllopolyploidy has a moderate impact on restructuring at three contrasting transposable element insertion sites in resynthesized Brassica napus allotetraploids  ap. 593-604.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe role played by whole‐genome duplication (WGD) in evolution and adaptation is particularly well illustrated in allopolyploids, where WGD is concomitant with interspecific hybridization. This ‘Genome Shock’, usually accompanied by structural and functional modifications, has been associated with the activation of transposable elements (TEs). However, the impact of allopolyploidy on TEs has been studied in only a few polyploid species, and not in Brassica, which has been marked by recurrent polyploidy events. Here, we developed sequence‐specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP) markers for three contrasting TEs, and compared profiles between resynthesized Brassica napus allotetraploids and their diploid Brassica progenitors. To evaluate restructuring at TE insertion sites, we scored changes in SSAP profiles and analysed a large set of differentially amplified SSAP bands. No massive structural changes associated with the three TEs surveyed were detected. However, several transposition events, specific to the youngest TE originating from the B. oleracea genome, were identified. Our study supports the hypothesis that TE responses to allopolyploidy are highly specific. The changes observed in SSAP profiles lead us to hypothesize that they may partly result from changes in DNA methylation, questioning the role of epigenetics during the formation of a new allopolyploid genome.  aPublisher supplied data  a#ANR‐05‐BDIV‐015cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aBrassica napus 3aDNA methylation 3aallotetraploidy 3adiploidy 3aepigenetics 3aevolution 3agenome 3ainterspecific hybridization 3atransposons1 aPalacios, Paulina Martinez1 aRousselet, Agnès1 aRidel, Céline1 aFalque, Matthieu1 aEber, Frédérique1 aChèvre, Anne‐Marie1 aJoets, Johann1 aBrabant, Philippe1 aAlix, Karine0 tnew phytologist.g2013 Apr., v. 198, no. 2 p.593-604dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.121563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011200175300001600287520147800303536031201781592002802093596003902121650001402160650002202174650002802196650001902224650001502243650001202258650001502270650002402285650002202309650001302331650002002344650001502364650002502379650001302404650001302417650002202430653001402452653001402466653002102480653001402501700002102515700002202536773012402558856008502682852000902767655001202776IND60702338020221120215409.0200717e20200807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070233802DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2020.17260342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosanigo, Marina P.10aLimiting resources on the reproductive success of a cavity-nesting bee species in a grassland agroecosystem  ap. 583-591.  aIntensive agricultural land use can impact pollinators mainly through habitat loss and/or modification. Native bees are negatively affected by agricultural intensification, isolation from natural habitats, decreases in plant diversity, and reduction in the availability of nesting sites. Despite this, in the Pampean region, there are scarce studies about the effect of agricultural activities on native bees. We studied the nesting ecology of the native leafcutter bee Megachile gomphrenoides (Megachilidae) in eight sites immersed in an agricultural matrix, where land use is a mosaic of agricultural land and some semi-natural areas. The sampling was developed using paired trap-nests in fragments without agricultural management and in soybean crops. We aimed to analyse the effects of floral and nesting resources on the abundance, the reproductive success and the parasitism rate of a population of M. gomphrenoides in a Pampean agroecosystem. Floral diversity was significantly correlated with abundance of nests and brood cells, and both parasitism rate and reproductive success of M. gomphrenoides were higher in nests built in fragments without agricultural management when compared to crop areas. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between reproductive success and flower diversity in crop areas. These results suggest that floral diversity is limiting the abundance of M. gomphrenoides nests, its reproductive success as well as its parasitism rate.  aThe authors thank the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), the Agencia Nacional de Promoción Cientifica y Tecnológica, and the Universidad de Buenos Aires for financial support through grants UBACyT 20020130200203BA, PIP 11220110100312, and PICT 2015-2523, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  aUBACyTa03BA, PIPa12, and PICTa- 3aMegachile 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3aagroecosystems 3aapiculture 3aflowers 3agrasslands 3ahabitat destruction 3aintensive farming 3aland use 3aleafcutter bees 3aparasitism 3areproductive success 3aresearch 3asoybeans 3aspecies diversity 0aArgentina 0atrap-nest 0afloral resources 0aparasites1 aMarrero, Hugo J.1 aTorretta, Juan P.0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2020 Aug. 7, v. 59, no. 4 p.583-591dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2020.17260343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171500001900268520193900287592002802226650001302254650001302267650001602280650002202296650001302318650002302331650001202354650001502366650001902381650001302400650001702413653000802430653000702438653000702445653000702452653000702459653000902466653000802475653001602483653001802499653002102517653001302538653001102551700001602562700001502578700001602593700001502609700001802624700005702642700001802699700001602717700001502733700002002748700005502768700001502823700001502838773010902853856008602962852000903048655001203057IND60716155420221120042055.0210121e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071615542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jingjing10aMapping of QTLs detected in a broccoli double diploid population for planting density traits  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe planting density of broccoli can directly affect the yield and overall health of plants. Nonetheless, studies on the genetic base of planting density in broccoli are rather limited. In this study, the important planting density-dependent factors of broccoli, plant height (PH), maximum outer petiole length (PL) and leaf width (LW), were investigated during 2017 and 2018. In this study, mapping of QTL for PH, PL and LW based on a DH population in broccoli, and as well as the interaction between QTLs and the environment. The DH population was constructed with 176 genotypes obtained from F₁ hybrid produced by crossing two different inbred lines 86101 (P₁) and 90196 (P₂). In our study, a linkage group including a total of 438 SSR markers were constructed covering a length of 1168.26 cM using QTL IciMapping 4.0 software. Finally, there were mainly four QTLs (phc1, phc2, phc4−2, phc4−3), one QTL (plc6−2), and two QTLs (lwc1, lwc3−1) corresponding for PH, PL and LW recurred during the two years. In three environments, inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) analysis showed that there was a major QTL for PH at 7.20 cM on chromosome 1 with a high explanatory contribution rate of 20.05 %. The QTL at the 11.10 cM position of chromosome 6 was located for the PL with a high explanatory contribution rate of 20.02 %. The QTL at the 147.00 cM position of chromosome 3 was located on LW with a high explanatory contribution rate of 19.97 %. Interestingly, we found an overlap region (pplc4) in the chromosome 4 containing three QLTs for traits PH, PL, and LW (phc4−2, plc4−3, and lwc4−2). According to this study, the possible positions of candidate genes were screened to provide a basis for further locating and cloning genes for plant height, maximum outer petiole and leaf width, which would be beneficial to breeding of broccoli and the Brassica crops, especially in high planting density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica 3abroccoli 3achromosomes 3acomputer software 3adiploidy 3agenetic background 3ahybrids 3aleaf width 3alinkage groups 3apetioles 3aplant height 0aQTL 0aDH 0aPH 0aPL 0aLW 0aICIM 0aSSR 0aQTL mapping 0aDH population 0aPlanting density 0aPlanting 0aHeight1 aSun, Jifeng1 aLiu, Eryan1 aYuan, Suxia1 aLiu, Yumei1 aHan, Fengqing1 aLi, Zhansheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5867-728X1 aFang, Zhiyuan1 aYang, Limei1 aZhuang, Mu1 aZhang, Yangyong1 aLv, Honghao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2635-30421 aWang, Yong1 aJi, Jialei0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 277 p.109835-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01618naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245005900131300001200190506002800202520062800230592002800858506003700886650001200923650001900935650001600954650001300970653002100983653005301004653001701057653001101074700002101085700002301106773014201129852000901271655001201280IND60764517220221207082415.0180808e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076451722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammad, Seddik10aCutting-Edge Topics in Research on Veterinary Sciences  ap. 1-3.  aResource is Open Access  aWe are pleased to announce the first edition of the SVU-International Journal of Veterinary Sciences (SVU-IJVS).

This is in keeping with the pivotal role of the insulin/IGF pathway in longevity determination from model organisms to primates, with the association between obesity and age-related disorders, and with the dramatic acceleration of senescence by diabetes. Importantly, metabolic and oxidative damages concomitantly occur in aging as consequences of tissue hyperstimulation by insulin. With its double identity of generator of mitochondrial oxidant species and of signaling adaptor in the insulin receptor cascade, the 66Kd Shc protein (p66Shc) has drawn major attention as a negative determinant of life span and healthy longevity in mammals. We have demonstrated that these effects are related, at least in part, to p66Shc effect on the mTOR/S6K cascade that promotes obesity and insulin resistance and shortens life span.  aPublisher supplied data 3alongevity 3asomatomedins 3aoxidants 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin receptors 3ainsulin 3amammals 3adiabetes 3aobesity 3anutrients 3aPrimates 0asenescence1 aFusco, Salvatore1 aPani, Giovambattista0 tVitamins and Hormones.g2013, v. 91 p.219-241dElsevier Science & Technologyx0083-67297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-407766-9.00009-23Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010700165300001600272520157000288592002801858650001901886650001101905650001701916650002501933650002201958650001301980650001501993650002602008650000902034650001102043650001402054650001402068650001102082650001002093650001602103650000802119650001902127653001602146653000902162653001402171653001902185653001402204700002102218700001602239700001602255700002002271773009502291856008502386852000902471655001202480IND60612038620221121014718.0200614e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061203862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2018.06.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanna, R.10aConcentration of rare earth elements during high temperature pyrolysis of waste printed circuit boards  ap. 602-610.  aAn in-depth investigation was carried out on the recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) from a variety of waste printed circuit boards (PCBs). High temperature pyrolysis was carried out at 850 °C for 15 min using horizontal resistance and thermal plasma furnaces with different levels of turbulence. The concentration of REEs in key pyrolysis residues, namely, copper rich red metallic fraction, lead/tin rich white metallic fraction and slag rich carbonaceous residues, were determined using ICP analysis. Most of the REEs were found concentrated in the carbonaceous residue with negligible levels of REEs recovered in the two metallic fractions. Most of the recovered REEs showed a high affinity towards to refractory oxides silica and alumina, and little affinity towards metals Cu, Pb and Sn. The yield of REEs was significantly higher from the plasma furnace indicating the important role of turbulence in the dissociation & subsequent diffusion of REEs during pyrolysis. While La, Pr, Sm and Y required turbulent conditions for their recovery, Nd, Gd, Ce and Dy were relatively easy to dissociate and extract from the waste. Significant amounts of REEs could thus be recovered from waste PCBs as concentrated recyclates for further processing and extraction of individual rare earths. This study has shown that PCBs could prove to be a valuable urban mining resource of REEs. The recovery of REEs, in addition to precious and other metals, could play an important role towards enhancing the economic and environmental sustainability of e-waste recycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acopper 3adissociation 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronic wastes 3afurnaces 3agadolinium 3ahorizontal resistance 3alead 3amining 3apyrolysis 3arecycling 3asilica 3aslags 3atemperature 3atin 3aturbulent flow 0aRare earths 0aPCBs 0aRecycling 0aPlasma furnace 0aPyrolysis1 aEllamparuthy, G.1 aCayumil, R.1 aMishra, SK,1 aMukherjee, P.S.0 tWaste management.g2018 Aug., v. 78 p.602-610dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008000170300001400250520133600264592002801600653003601628653001501664653002701679653001601706653001701722653001601739700001801755773007101773856008201844852000901926655001201935IND60547633420221118222711.0161027s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054763342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ieri.2014.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVatti, Rambabu A.10aThroughput Improvement of Randomly Deployed Wireless Personal Area Networks  ap. 42-48.  aThroughput is the key parameter used to estimate the quality of service of the Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). Throughput of the network is degraded mainly due to the packet loss. The Packet loss problem is more in the networks, in which the nodes are deployed randomly. There are three significant factors responsible for packet loss in wireless Personal Area networks. They are, interference of co-existed networks working in the same frequency band, collisions due to co-located networks, and failure of intermediate nodes near the sink due to their over usage. In this paper, authors propose a solution to solve the problem of packet loss due to over usage of the intermediate nodes. The authors propose a routing algorithm, based on the remaining energy at the intermediate nodes, to prevent the over usage of intermediate nodes. Remaining-energy based Adaptive Multi-hop Algorithm (RAMA), which takes the routing decision based on the remaining energy at each of the neighbouring nodes and adopts short distance multi hop communication to relay the data from source node to sink node. The algorithm is implemented on TI wireless sensor nodes, and the performance is compared with SimpliciTI protocol. The experimental results show that a 27% improvement in the throughput is achieved with the proposed algorithm RAMA.  aPublisher supplied data 0aWireless Personal Area Networks 0aThroughput 0arandom node deployment 0apacket loss 0ainterference 0aCollisions.1 aGaikwad, A.N.0 tIERI Procedia.g2014, v. 7 p.42-48dElsevier B.V.x2212-66787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ieri.2014.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04473naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015900168300001600327520285300343592002803196650001703224650001303241650002103254650001203275650001103287650001603298650001503314650001003329650001403339650001403353650001903367650001803386650002503404650002303429650002703452650002403479650001203503650000903515650001103524651001003535700002103545700002703566700002303593700002203616700002303638700002403661700001903685773010203704856008103806990002303887852000903910655001203919IND60096183520221120182943.0141104e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009618352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2010.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontero, Paulina10aSeasonal variability of primary production in a fjord ecosystem of the Chilean Patagonia: Implications for the transfer of carbon within pelagic food webs  ap. 202-215.  aWe characterized the seasonal cycle of productivity in Reloncaví Fjord (41°30′S), Chilean Patagonia. Seasonal surveys that included measurements of gross primary production, community respiration, bacterioplankton secondary production, and sedimentation rates along the fjord were combined with continuous records of water-column temperature variability and wind forcing, as well as satellite-derived data on regional patterns of wind stress, sea surface temperatures, and surface chlorophyll concentrations. The hydrography and perhaps fjord productivity respond to the timing and intensity of wind forcing over a larger region. Seasonal changes in the direction and intensity of winds, along with a late-winter improvement in light conditions, may determine the timing of phytoplankton blooms and potentially modulate productivity cycles in the region. Depth-integrated gross primary production estimates were higher (0.4–3.8gCm⁻²d⁻¹) in the productive season (October, February, and May), and lower (0.1–0.2gCm⁻²d⁻¹) in the non-productive season (August). These seasonal changes were also reflected in community respiration and bacterioplankton production rates, which ranged, respectively, from 0.3 to 4.8gCm⁻²d⁻¹ and 0.05 to 0.4gCm⁻²d⁻¹ during the productive and non-productive seasons and from 0.05 to 0.6gCm⁻²d⁻¹ and 0.05 to 0.2gCm⁻²d⁻¹ during the same two periods. We found a strong, significant correlation between gross primary production and community respiration (Spearman, r=0.95; p<0.001; n=12), which suggests a high degree of coupling between the synthesis of organic matter and its usage by the planktonic community. Similarly, strong correlations were found between bacterioplankton secondary production and both gross primary production (Spearman, r=0.7, p<0.05, n=9) and community respiration (Spearman, r=0.8, p<0.05, n=9), indicating that bacterioplankton may be processing an important fraction (8–59%) of the organic matter produced by phytoplankton in Reloncaví Fjord. In winter, bacterial carbon utilization as a percentage of gross primary production was >100%, suggesting the use of allochthonous carbon sources by bacterioplankton when the levels of gross primary production are low. Low primary production rates were associated with a greater contribution of small cells to autotrophic biomass, highlighting the importance of small-sized plankton and bacteria for carbon cycling and fluxes during the less productive winter months. Fecal pellet sedimentation was minimal during this period, also suggesting that most of the locally produced organic carbon is recycled within the microbial loop. During the productive season, on the other hand, the area exhibited a great potential to export organic matter, be it to higher trophic levels or vertically towards the bottom.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3abacteria 3abacterioplankton 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3aecosystems 3afeces 3afood webs 3ahydrology 3aorganic matter 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3aseasonal variation 3asecondary productivity 3asurface temperature 3asurveys 3awind 3awinter 3aChile1 aDaneri, Giovanni1 aGonzález, Humberto E.1 aIriarte, Jose Luis1 aTapia, Fabián J.1 aLizárraga, Lorena1 aSánchez, Nicolás,1 aPizarro, Oscar0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 31, no. 3-4 p.202-215dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2010.09.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010000170300001600270520102600286592002801312650002501340650001601365650002101381650003101402650003501433650001101468650001601479650001501495650001201510653001201522653001301534653003401547653000901581653002001590653001401610653002501624700002001649700002701669773011201696856008601808852000901894655001201903IND60597562120221118125024.0190705e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059756212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoccia, Flavio10aGenetically modified food versus knowledge and fear: A Noumenic approach for consumer behaviour  ap. 682-688.  aThe theme of genetically modified organisms is very important for modern consumers, especially when they approach novel foods.

The primary outcome included the total score of Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). The secondary outcomes included the MRS composite subscale scores and severity of symptoms. Statistical tests were used to analyze the results.At post-intervention, Tribulus in comparison to the placebo showed a statistically significant reduction in the severity of menopausal transition symptoms, MRS total and composite subscale scores (P<0.001) without any side effects. The intra-group comparison showed a significant reduction in the MRS total, subscale scores (P<0.001) and severity of symptoms (P<0.05). At post-intervention, Tribulus group showed higher reduction than the placebo group in the MRS total mean score (10.43±5.19 vs 16.86±4.9).

Hence, it is essential to develop and test methods for controlling pollutants from occupational backgrounds. We have tested an air cleaner device in reducing aerosol numbers by filtration and airborne bacteria by photocatalysis from an enclosed type dairy barn. Here, we had shown a significant reduction of larger size aerosol numbers (2.0–10.0 µm) and airborne total aerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and complete clearance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the exhaust air of the air cleaner device. A greater 8.05% and 61.56% reduction of 5.0–10.0 µm aerosol numbers and airborne E. coli, respectively, were observed in the instantly treated central air of the dairy barn. We had found an increasing trend of aerosol numbers and airborne bacteria concentrations in the central air of the dairy barn after stopping the air cleaner device. We also had observed increased bacterial load in the filter paper of the air treatment chamber of the air cleaner device with the advancement of cleaning time. These findings are essential to validate air cleanings from various types of dairy microenvironments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair cleaners 3abarns 3aeconomic sustainability 3afiltration 3amicrobial load 3aphotocatalysis 3apollution 3aresearch1 aIkeguchi, Atsuo1 aNaide, Takanori0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 July, v. 29, no. 35 p.53022-53035dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19514-23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012800168300001400296500001500310520124900325592002801574650003701602650002201639650001601661650001301677650002101690650001201711650001401723650000801737650002401745650003301769650004401802650001101846650001101857650001401868650001601882650002301898653002101921700002101942773009501963856008602058852000902144655001202153IND60096684820221122054801.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009668482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Wenlei10aProduction of biodiesel by transesterification of soybean oil using calcium supported tin oxides as heterogeneous catalysts  ap. 55-62.  a2019-12-06  aThe main objective of this work was to develop an environmentally benign process for the production of biodiesel by using a stable solid base catalyst. To this purpose, different heterogeneous CaO–SnO₂ catalysts have been prepared by means of impregnation methods. Various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were applied for the catalyst characterization. The transesterification of soybean oil with methanol, to produce biodiesel, was carried out under batch conditions at refluxed methanol over the CaO–SnO₂ catalysts. The catalytic activity is found to be highly dependent on the Ca/Sn ratio and calcination temperature. The solid catalyst with the Ca/Sn molar ratio of 4:1 and calcined at a temperature of 973K, performed the best activity, reaching the conversion to methyl esters of 89.3% after 6h of reaction at methanol reflux temperature (343K) when a methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1 and catalyst dosage of 8wt.% were employed. Further, the solid catalyst is proved to be stable and durable for the transesterification reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3asoybean oil 3amethanol 3athermogravimetry 3acalcium 3acatalysts 3atin 3atransesterification 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aesters 3aoxides 3abiodiesel 3atemperature 3acatalytic activity 0athermal analysis1 aZhao, Liangliang0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Dec., v. 76 p.55-62dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245015900170300001600329520196600345592002802311653002102339653002502360653001702385653002102402700002702423700002302450700002002473700002002493773014002513856008402653852000902737655001202746IND60126633020221121022032.0151107e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012663302DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-94.2.5862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedlacek, John D.10aLife History Attributes of Indian Meal Moth (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and Angoumois Grain Moth (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) Reared on Transgenic Corn Kernels  ap. 586-592.  aThe Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hüübner), and Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier), are two globally distributed stored-grain pests. Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the impact that corn (Zea mays L.) kernels (i.e., grain) of some Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) corn hybrids containing Cry1Ab Bt δδ-endotoxin have on life history attributes of Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth. Stored grain is at risk to damage from Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth; therefore, Bt corn may provide a means of protecting this commodity from damage. Thus, the objective of this research was to quantify the effects of transgenic corn seed containing Cry1Ab δδ-endotoxin on Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth survival, fecundity, and duration of development. Experiments with Bt grain, non-Bt isolines, and non-Bt grain were conducted in environmental chambers at 27 ±± 1°°C and ≥≥60% RH in continuous dark. Fifty eggs were placed in ventilated pint jars containing 170 g of cracked or whole corn for the Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth, respectively. Emergence and fecundity were observed for 5 wk. Emergence and fecundity of Indian meal moth and emergence of Angoumois grain moth were significantly lower for individuals reared on P33V08 and N6800Bt, MON 810 and Bt-11 transformed hybrids, respectively, than on their non-Bt transformed isolines. Longer developmental times were observed for Indian meal moth reared on P33V08 and N6800Bt than their non-Bt-transformed isolines. These results indicate that MON 810 and Bt-11 Cry1Ab δδ-endotoxin-containing kernels reduce laboratory populations of Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth. Thus, storing Bt-transformed grain is a management tactic that warrants bin scale testing and may effectively reduce Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth populations in grain without application of synthetic chemicals or pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIndian meal moth 0aAngoumois grain moth 0astored grain 0atransgenic grain1 aKomaravalli, Sunila R.1 aHanley, Anthony M.1 aPrice, Bryan D.1 aDavis, Paula M.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2001 Apr., v. 94, no. 2 p.586-592dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-94.2.5863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245009500183300001600278520083900294592002801133650000901161650002001170650002201190650001701212650001001229650001901239700002101258700002101279773009701300856008601397852000901483655001201492IND60096684920221122054734.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009668492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWróblewski, Włodzimierz,10aSelection of the cooling system configuration for an ultra-critical coal-fired power plant  ap. 554-560.  aThe appropriate selection of the condenser pressure, apart from raising the live steam parameters, is a factor which could have a decisive impact on the improvement in the efficiency of the thermal cycle. The pressure value depends both on the parameters and configuration of the cooling system. The condenser cooling system configuration is particularly important in the case of newly designed high-capacity ultra-supercritical power plants. The presented study comprises a comparison of two variants of a cooling system for a 900MW ultra-supercritical power unit. The serial and parallel configurations of the condenser are considered. A thermodynamic analysis which takes account of the exhaust loss of the LP turbine is performed. Additionally, an economic analysis based on the NPV method is conducted for all investigated cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acooling systems 3aeconomic analysis 3apower plants 3asteam 3athermodynamics1 aDykas, Sławomir1 aRulik, Sebastian0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Dec., v. 76 p.554-560dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245012200208500001900330520157100349592002801920650002101948650002601969650001301995650001502008650001702023650001502040650001902055650000902074653001502083653002002098653004402118700001702162700001702179773010302196856008702299852000902386655001202395IND60730120420221120175918.0210513e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073012042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1116672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Guangyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9889-977610aSlippery liquid-infused porous surfaces with inclined microstructures to enhance durable anti-biofouling performances  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the development of biocompatible materials for biomedical applications, infections and their resulting inflammation responses are important issues caused typically by the adhesion of micro-organisms on medical devices. Recently slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) has provided a new strategy for anti-biofouling and low-adhesion surfaces, however, there are still some bottlenecks in practical uses, particularly the loss of lubricant significantly restricts the durability and stability of SLIPS. In this paper, we micro-fabricated well-controlled micro-cavities with different profiles (vertical or inclined walls) to investigate the long-term anti-biofouling effect of SLIPS. We explored microstructure geometries in two aspects: the aspect ratio and the slope angle relevant with the Laplace pressure and the oil contact area which lead to different oil-locking abilities. High aspect ratio and inclined slope were demonstrated with better oil-locking ability as well as significantly increased anti-fouling performances. Under the same experimental setup, the Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria coverage on SLIPS with 80 μm-depth 20° inclined micro-cavities was only ∼30 % of that with vertical micro-cavities, while increasing aspect ratio by 4 times induced ∼3 times enhanced anti-fouling effect. On basis of these findings, we propose the enhanced SLIPS with inclined microstructures to achieve better oil-locking ability and long-term anti-biofouling performance, which may broaden many practical applications of SLIPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3adurability 3ainflammation 3alubricants 3amicrostructure 3aoils 0aBiofouling 0aAnti-biofouling 0aSlippery liquid-infused porous surfaces1 aLiu, Fenglin1 aWu, Tianzhun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 June, v. 202 p.111667-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1116673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245008900167500001900256520108200275592002801357650001501385650001301400650001201413650003501425650001701460650001001477650001101487650001301498650002001511650001501531650001301546650001001559650001301569650001901582650001701601651001201618700003001630700001901660700002301679700002001702700002401722773011901746856007701865852000901942655001201951IND60735111720221121090722.0210423e20210329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073511172DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100407242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Bella, Giuseppa 10aDiscrimination of Tunisian Honey by Mineral and Trace Element Chemometrics Profiling  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe concentrations of 19 chemical elements have been determined in 36 honey samples of different botanical (wildflower, eucalyptus, eucalyptus red flowers, prickly pears, lemon blossom, thyme, almond, rosemary and jujube) honeys from the three geographical areas of Tunisia (Sidi Bouzid, Nabeul and Sfax) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

The correlation on the basis of mineral element content between the honey samples and their botanical and/or geographical origins was in some measure achieved. The data collected on the samples were also used to evaluate the nutritional quality and the potential health risks associated with elements via consumption of the Tunisian honey.

Most of the previously developed edge mineral grain detectors are uniquely based on the physical properties of the X-ray-, electron-, or optical-derived images; not permitting the exploitation of the specific physical properties of each image type at the same time. More advanced techniques, such as 3D microtomography, permit the reconstruction of tridimensional models of mineral fabric arrays, even though adjacent mineral grain boundaries with the same atomic density are often not detectable. Only electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) allows providing high-performing grain boundary detection that is crystallographically differentiated per mineral phase, even though it is relatively expensive and can be executed only in duly equipped microanalytical laboratories by suitably trained users. Instead, the MFA toolbox allows quantifying fabric parameters subdivided per mineral type starting from a crossed-polarizers high-resolution RGB image, which is useful for identifying the edges of the individual grains characterizing rock fabrics. Then, this image is integrated with a set of micro-X-ray maps, which are useful for the quantitative extrapolation of elemental distribution maps. In addition, all this is achieved by means of low-cost and easy-to-use equipment. We applied the tool on amphibolite, mylonitic-paragneiss, and -tonalite samples to extrapolate the particle fabric on different metamorphic rock types, as well as on the same sandstone sample used for another edge detector, which is useful for comparing the obtained results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3afabrics 3ametamorphic rocks 3asandstone 3aspatial data1 aOrtolano, Gaetano 1 aGodard, Gaston 1 aCirrincione, Rosolino 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Jan. 27, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100200513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245010100212300001200313500001900325520131800344592002801662596003101690596005201721650001301773650000801786650002001794650001701814650001001831650001301841650001201854650002801866650000901894650002701903650001601930650001901946650001801965650001501983700002201998700001802020700002302038773014102061856008302202852000902285655001202294IND60702397020221119015856.0200724e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070239702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-04717-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarjalainen, Anna K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1017-901910aBlackfly Larvae (Simulium spp.) Can Intensify Methylmercury Biomagnification in Boreal Food Webs  ap. 379.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlobal pollution of mercury (Hg) threatens ecosystem and human health. We measured total Hg (THg) and monomethylmercury (MMHg) concentrations in filter-feeding blackfly (Simulium spp.) larvae in the inflows and the outflows of six boreal lakes with no Hg point source pollution. THg in the larvae ranged from 0.03 to 0.31 mg kg⁻¹ dw and MMHg between 0.02 and 0.25 mg kg⁻¹ dw. The proportion of MMHg in the larvae was 74 ± 0.16% and ranged from 43 to 98% of THg, the highest proportions being comparable to those typically found in aquatic predatory insects and fish. We compared the larvae MMHg concentrations to river water quality, catchment land-use, and to size-adjusted lake pike THg data. Two of the investigated catchments have been affected by a multimetal biomine since 2008 and were characterized by higher conductivity and higher urban land-use activity. Larvae THg and MMHg concentrations were higher in the lake inflows than in outflows and associated with water conductivity and catchment land-use activity. Lake pike THg concentrations were highly correlated to lake outflow blackfly larvae MMHg concentrations. Our data illustrate that blackfly larvae take up high percentage of THg that is MMHg, which in turn is available for higher consumers in aquatic and terrestrial food webs.  aPublisher supplied data  a281800cAcademy of Finland  aPersonal mobility grantcJyväskylän Yliopisto 3aSimulium 3aair 3abioaccumulation 3ahuman health 3alakes 3aland use 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3apike 3apoint source pollution 3ariver water 3asoil pollution 3awater quality 3awatersheds1 aSalmelin, Johanna1 aDimock, Brian1 aHintelmann, Holger0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 July, v. 231, no. 7 p.379-379dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04717-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010500166520196100271592002802232650002302260650003202283650002202315650001302337650002502350650001302375650002302388650001602411650001102427650001402438650002002452650001302472650001502485650002502500650001102525650001102536650001002547650002202557650002202579700002302601700002202624700002302646773012202669856008102791961001302872852000902885655001202894IND60783921920221119173021.0220726e20220630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078392192DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120715842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoder, Kathy J.10aRelationship between Temperate Grass Sward Characteristics and the Grazing Behavior of Dairy Heifers  aSward architecture mediates ruminant grazing behavior in temperate grazing lands. Temperate grasses differ in their sward structure, which may influence the grazing behavior of cattle. We determined relationships between the grazing behavior of dairy heifers and the sward structure of the following temperate grasses: meadow fescue (Schedonorus pratensis (Huds.) P. Beauv.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), quackgrass (Elymus repens (L.) Gould), and reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.). Vegetative-stage grasses were rotationally grazed by Holstein heifers (average initial body weight of 460 kg) during 5 day periods in the spring, summer, and fall of 2007 and 2008. The herbage dry matter (DM) allowance was twice the expected daily intake (11 kg DM animal⁻¹ d⁻¹). The sward characteristics were measured before grazing (e.g., the herbage height and mass, vertical distribution of leaf and stem fraction, and nutritive value). The grazing behavior of the heifers was quantified using automatic jaw movement recorders. In this study, the grass species had little effect on the grazing behavior. However, the bite rate was negatively correlated with the herbage mass, while the number of bites was positively correlated with the sward height and herbage mass. These results suggest that when herbage availability is not limited, grazing dairy heifers exhibit similar ingestive and rumination behavior across grass species and seasons, yet jaw movement dynamics may respond to the different characteristics of the swards. The results of this study provide the following benefits: (1) they inform managers about the jaw movement mechanics that can be expected of dairy heifers in temperate forage systems, showing that they are not limited by herbage allowance, and (2) they provide insight for future studies that employ on-animal sensors to evaluate foraging dynamics and animal performance outcomes in temperate forage pasture systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3aElymus repens subsp. repens 3aFestuca pratensis 3aHolstein 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aagronomy 3aanimal performance 3abody weight 3aleaves 3amechanics 3anutritive value 3apastures 3arumination 3aspatial distribution 3aspring 3asummer 3asward 3atemperate grasses 3avegetative growth1 aBrink, Geoffrey E.1 aRaynor, Edward J.1 aCasler, Michael D.0 tAgronomy.g2022 June 30, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120715843Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle00972naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003200145245005100177500002900228520019000257592002800447650001200475650001300487650001000500773012000510856007900630852000900709655001200718IND60729306420221121073911.0210228e20210122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072930642DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120200942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInsects Editorial Office,  10aAcknowledgment to Reviewers of Insects in 2020  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aPeer review is the driving force of journal development, and reviewers are gatekeepers who ensure that Insects maintains its standards for the high quality of its published papers [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsects 3ajournals 3apeers0 tInsects.g2021 Jan. 22, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120200943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04169naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002400184245009800208300001200306506007600318520226600394592002802660506003702688650002202725650002702747650001602774650001502790650001002805650000902815650001502824650000902839650002602848650001902874650001302893650001102906650001802917650001602935650002202951650001202973650001502985650000903000650001003009650001903019650001503038650001203053650002603065650001103091650002203102650001103124650003103135650001603166650001203182650003603194700002003230700002503250700002103275700001903296700002003315773009303335856004603428852000903474655001203483IND4492758320221207091133.0140121e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449275832DNAL7 a219430712pmid7 aPMC31938202pmcid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-4-1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKweka, Eliningaya J14aThe role of cow urine in the oviposition site preference of culicine and Anopheles mosquitoes  ap. 432.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Chemical and behavioural ecology of mosquitoes plays an important role in the development of chemical cue based vector control. To date, studies available have focused on evaluating mosquito attractants and repellents of synthetic and human origins. This study, however, was aimed at seasonal evaluation of the efficiency of cow urine in producing oviposition cues to Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Culex quinquefasciatus in both laboratory and field conditions. METHODS: Oviposition response evaluation in laboratory conditions was carried out in mosquito rearing cages. The oviposition substrates were located in parallel or in diagonal positions inside the cage. Urine evaluation against gravid females of An. arabiensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus was carried out at Day 1, Day 3 and Day 7. Five millilitres (mls) of cow urine was added to oviposition substrate while de-chlorinated water was used as a control. In field experiments, 500 mls of cow urine was added in artificial habitats with 2500 mls of de-chlorinated water and 2 kgs of soil. The experiment was monitored for thirty consecutive days, eggs were collected daily from the habitats at 7.00 hrs. Data analysis was performed using parametric and non-parametric tests for treatments and controls while attraction of the oviposition substrate in each species was presented using Oviposition Activity Index (OAI). RESULTS: The OAI was positive with ageing of cattle urine in culicine species in both laboratory and field experiments. The OAI for anopheline species was positive with fresh urine. The OAI during the rainy season was positive for all species tested while in the dry season the OAI for culicine spp and Anopheles gambiae s.l., changed with time from positive to negative values. Based on linear model analysis, seasons and treatments had a significant effect on the number of eggs laid in habitats, even though the number of days had no effect. CONCLUSION: Oviposition substrates treated with cow urine in both laboratory and field conditions have shown that cow urine left to age from 1-7 days has an influence on oviposition behavioural response in mosquitoes. The analysis of microbial colonies for decaying urine should be investigated along with its associated by-products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aattractants 3abyproducts 3acages 3acows 3adry season 3aeggs 3afield experimentation 3agravid females 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alinear models 3aoviposition 3aoviposition sites 3arearing 3arepellents 3asoil 3aurine 3avector control 3awet season 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxphysiology 2aCattle 2aCulexxphysiology 2aFemale 2aInsect Vectorsxphysiology 2aOviposition 2aSeasons 2aUrinexchemistryxparasitology.1 aOwino, Eunice A1 aMwang’onde, Beda J1 aMahande, Aneth M1 aNyindo, Mramba1 aMosha, Franklin0 tParasites & vectors.g2011 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.432-432dSpringer-Verlagx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-4-184  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245015100169500001400320520115800334592002801492650002301520650001301543650001301556650000901569650001201578650001601590650001401606650002601620650002201646650001901668651001201687700002301699700002201722700001901744700002301763773012001786856007901906852000901985655001201994IND60729306620221121073932.0210228e20210222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072930662DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120201852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilaseca, Carolina 10aUnraveling the Morphological Variation of Triatoma infestans in the Peridomestic Habitats of Chuquisaca Bolivia: A Geometric Morphometric Approach  aNAL-light  aMorphometrics has been used on Triatomines, a well-known phenotypically variable insect, to understand the process of morphological plasticity and infer the changes of this phenomenon. The following research was carried out in two regions of the inter-Andean valleys and two Chaco regions of Chuquisaca-Bolivia. Triatoma infestans adults were collected from the peridomestic (pens and chicken coops) along a geographic gradient in order to evaluate the morphological differentiation between groups and their pattern of sexual shape dimorphism. Geometric morphometric methods were applied on the wings and heads of T. infestans. The main findings include that we proved sexual dimorphism in heads and wings, determined the impact of environmental factors on size and shape and validated the impact of nutrition on head shape variation. These results show that geometric morphometric procedures can be used to provide key insight into the biological adaptation of T. infestans on different biotic (nutrition) and abiotic (environment) conditions, which could serve in understanding and evaluating infestation processes and further vector control programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriatoma infestans 3achickens 3ageometry 3ahead 3ainsects 3amorphometry 3anutrition 3aphenotypic plasticity 3asexual dimorphism 3avector control 3aBolivia1 aMéndez, Marco  A.1 aPinto, Carlos  F.1 aLemic, Darija 1 aBenítez, Hugo  A.0 tInsects.g2021 Feb. 22, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120201853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245010400206300001800310506007600328520185700404592002802261506003702289650001802326650001402344650000802358650001202366650001002378650001202388650003302400650001102433650001602444650001402460650001302474650002302487650001002510650001102520650001002531650001602541650001802557650002202575650001902597653002402616653002102640653001902661700002102680700002202701700002202723773017402745856007902919852000902998655001203007IND60172116220221207132242.0150602e20120612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017211622DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11216241092doi7 aPMC33860902pmcid7 a226453652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Arx, Martin10aFloral humidity as a reliable sensory cue for profitability assessment by nectar-foraging hawkmoths  ap. 9471-9476.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMost research on plant–pollinator communication has focused on sensory and behavioral responses to relatively static cues. Floral rewards such as nectar, however, are dynamic, and foraging animals will increase their energetic profit if they can make use of floral cues that more accurately indicate nectar availability. Here we document such a cue—transient humidity gradients—using the night blooming flowers of Oenothera cespitosa (Onagraceae). The headspace of newly opened flowers reaches levels of about 4% above ambient relative humidity due to additive evapotranspirational water loss through petals and water-saturated air from the nectar tube. Floral humidity plumes differ from ambient levels only during the first 30 min after anthesis (before nectar is depleted in wild populations), whereas other floral traits (scent, shape, and color) persist for 12–24 h. Manipulative experiments indicated that floral humidity gradients are mechanistically linked to nectar volume and therefore contain information about energy rewards to floral visitors. Behavioral assays with Hyles lineata (Sphingidae) and artificial flowers with appropriate humidity gradients suggest that these hawkmoth pollinators distinguish between subtle differences in relative humidity when other floral cues are held constant. Moths consistently approached and probed flowers with elevated humidity over those with ambient humidity levels. Because floral humidity gradients are largely produced by the evaporation of nectar itself, they represent condition-informative cues that facilitate remote sensing of floral profitability by discriminating foragers. In a xeric environment, this level of honest communication should be adaptive when plant reproductive success is pollinator limited, due to intense competition for the attention of a specialized pollinator.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHyles lineata 3aOenothera 3aair 3aanimals 3acolor 3acorolla 3adry environmental conditions 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3aflowering 3aforaging 3aheadspace analysis 3amoths 3anectar 3aodors 3apollinators 3aprofitability 3arelative humidity 3aremote sensing 0apollination biology 0ahonest signaling 0afloral display1 aGoyret, Joaquín1 aDavidowitz, Goggy1 aRaguso, Robert A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 June 12, v. 109, no. 24 p.9471-9476dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11216241093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011700166300001800283520125800301592002801559650001701587650001101604650001401615650001301629650002201642650001501664650001101679650001901690650000901709650001501718650001501733650001601748651001701764651001501781700001601796773010401812856008101916990002301997852000902020655001202029IND60096184720221121225301.0141104e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009618472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2010.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamylton, S.M.10aGeomorphological modelling of tropical marine landscapes: Optical remote sensing, patches and spatial statistics  ap.

This paper demonstrates how a habitat map derived from remotely sensed imagery was used as the basis for the development of an explanatory model to investigate factors influencing the linearity of alternating carbonate sand and seagrass patches on a reef flat in the Seychelles, western Indian Ocean. In combination with techniques established in landscape ecology for interrogating broad scale processes and spatial statistical procedures that bring geography explicitly into the analysis, an emergent framework for the quantification and investigation of geomorphological processes is illustrated. The combined influence of adjacent spur and groove amplitude and incident wave power accounted for 81% of the variation in sand and seagrass patch linearity across the habitat map. A series of steps in model development are examined, including observation, measurement, experimentation and interpretation. These steps both define and permit an empirical approach to geomorphology and the case study highlights how each can be achieved by adopting an interdisciplinary framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoasts 3ageography 3ahabitats 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asand 3aseagrasses 3astatistics 3awater power 3aIndian Ocean 3aSeychelles1 aSpencer, T.0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 31, no. 2S p.S151-S161dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2010.02.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009300162300001400255520140300269592002801672650001901700650001401719650001301733650001801746650001601764650001201780650001901792650002201811650000901833650001301842650002101855653001801876653001601894653001601910653003201926700001601958700005901974700001802033700002102051700002702072773010302099856008202202852000902284655001202293IND60526292020221120035819.0190403e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052629202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2015.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Wanju10aGrain yield and quality responses of tropical hybrid rice to high night-time temperature  ap. 18-25.  aHigh temperature has a pronounced effect on grain yield and quality in rice. Climate change has increased night temperature more than day temperature in many parts of the world. How rice responds to high night-time temperature (HNT) is largely unknown. This study presents the first effort to assess the response of tropical hybrid rice to HNT. Six commercial tropical hybrid rice cultivars together with a tolerant (N22-aus) and a susceptible (Gharib-indica) genotype were evaluated under control temperature (23°C) and HNT (29°C) starting from panicle initiation until maturity under field conditions at the International Rice Research Institute during the dry (DS) and wet (WS) seasons of 2013. Overall, HNT significantly decreased grain yield of Gharib and all tested hybrids across both seasons, with less average reduction in the DS (13.4%) than in the WS (18.6%). Among the yield components, spikelets m−2 most significantly contributed to yield variation under control and/or HNT during both DS and WS followed by grain weight, while the contribution of seed-set was low and season-specific. Grain quality in most hybrids was also strongly affected by HNT, with decreased head rice yield, increased chalkiness and reduced grain width. Given this vulnerability to HNT, there is an urgent need to explore options for improving the adaptation of rice hybrids to increasingly warmer nights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3agenotype 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3ainflorescences 3anight temperature 3arice 3aseed set 3ayield components 0aGrain quality 0aGrain yield 0aHybrid rice 0aHigh night-time temperature1 aYin, Xinyou1 aStruik, Paul C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2196-547X1 aXie, Fangming1 aSchmidt, Ralf C.1 aJagadish, Krishna S.V.0 tField crops research.g2016 Apr., v. 190 p.18-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2015.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245015400173300001600327520125500343592002801598653002901626653002801655653001101683653002801694653001701722700001901739773014001758856008401898852000901982655001201991IND60126634020221121052753.0151107e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012663402DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-94.3.6732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaldstein, Daniel E.10aApple Damage, Pest Phenology, and Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Tebufenozide for Control of Obliquebanded Leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)  ap. 673-679.  aFruit damage by obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), was examined on four different apple cultivars during 1997––1999 in heavily infested orchards in New York State. Initial fruit damage occurred 354 ±± 26 degree-days base 6°°C (DD₆) after the first moth catch from the overwintering generation and continued to increase until after the typical spray season (≈≈1,300 DD₆). In addition to apple damage by late instars, fruit damage occurred by early instars of the summer and overwintering generations. The insect growth regulator tebufenozide was used as a model insecticide to determine how a slow-acting insecticide and its relative toxicity to early (neonate) and late (fourth and fifth) instars may influence the efficacy of sprays for the control of the obliquebanded leafroller. Because tebufenozide is a slow-acting compound, bioassays were conducted to determine what percentage of the total mortality to neonates occurs at each 24 h interval until 10 d. Based on a polynomial regression, half of the total mortality to larvae at the LC₂₅, LC₅₀, LC₉₀, and LC₉₉ occurred at 7.2, 5.0, 4.1, and 3.0 d, respectively. Late instars were three times more tolerant to tebufenozide than neonates.  aPublisher supplied data 0aobliquebanded leafroller 0aChoristoneura rosaceana 0aapples 0ainsect growth regulator 0atebufenozide1 aReissig, W.

Mating disruption has been an increasingly frequent addition to these management tools. Efficacy of mating disruption for control of navel orangeworm damage has been demonstrated in experiments that included control plots not treated with either mating disruption or insecticide. However, the navel orangeworm flies much farther than many orchard pests, so large plots of an expensive crop are required for such research. A large almond orchard was subdivided into replicate blocks of 96 to 224 ha and used to compare harvest damage from navel orangeworm in almonds treated with both mating disruption and insecticide, or with either alone. Regression of navel orangeworm damage in researcher-collected harvest samples from the interior and center of management blocks on damage in huller samples found good correlation for both and supported previous assumptions that huller samples underreport navel orangeworm damage. Blocks treated with both mating disruption and insecticide had lower damage than those treated with either alone in 9 of the 10 years examined. Use of insecticide had a stronger impact than doubling the dispenser rate from 2.5 to 5 per ha, and long-term comparisons of relative navel orangeworm damage to earlier- and later-harvested varieties revealed greater variation than previously demonstrated. These findings are an economically important confirmation of trade-offs in economic management of this critical pest. Additional monitoring tools and research tactics will be necessary to fulfill the potential of mating disruption to reduce insecticide use for navel orangeworm.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cAlmond Board of Californiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000078220 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmyelois transitella 3aalmonds 3ainsecticides 3aorchards 3aoverwintering 3apests 3aCalifornia1 aBurks, Charles  S.0 tInsects.g2021 Feb. 22, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120201883Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013700166300001600303520155900319592002801878650002201906650002501928650001501953650001301968650001301981650001801994650003602012650001802048650001702066650001702083650003702100653001202137653001702149653002702166653002702193653002302220700001802243700005102261700001302312773011102325856008602436852000902522655001202531IND60597563220221118124643.0190410e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059756322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jianan10aInteraction between sorghum procyanidin tetramers and the catalytic region of glucosyltransferases-I from Streptococcus mutans UA159  ap. 152-159.  aSorghum procyanidins (SPC) tetramers were reported to have inhibitory effects on the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), which is one of the primary pathogenic bacteria that cause caries. To make clear the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of SPC tetramers on the adhesion of S. mutans, it is important to understand the interaction between SPC tetramers and the catalytic region of glucosyltransferases-I (GTF-I/CAT) from S. mutans. In this study, fluorescence quenching, UV–visible (UV–Vis) absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies were applied to investigate the interaction between SPC tetramers and the GTF-I/CAT from S. mutans UA159. The fluorescence quenching results demonstrated that SPC tetramers combined with GTF-I/CAT protein on one binding site, and the fluorescence intensity of GTF-I/CAT protein was decreased regularly by static quenching with increasing concentrations of SPC tetramers. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of GTF-I/CAT protein were also changed with a red shift owing to the impact of SPC tetramers. In addition, the proportions of α-helix, β-sheet and random coil in the secondary structure of GTF-I/CAT protein were obviously altered by SPC tetramers. In conclusion, SPC tetramers have a strong affinity for GTF-I/CAT protein by altering its conformation and micro-environment. Our results suggest that SPC tetramers interact with GTF-I/CAT to interfere with the adhesion of S. mutans, which may facilitate the better application of SPC tetramers in the prevention of dental caries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aabsorption 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3abinding sites 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adental caries 3afluorescence 3aprocyanidins 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aSorghum 0aProcyanidins 0aGlucosyltransferases-I 0aFluorescence quenching 0aCircular dichroism1 aYan, Fangfang1 aLu, Qun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6211-65651 aLiu, Rui0 tFood research international.g2018 Oct., v. 112 p.152-159dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013600164300001400300520172800314592002802042650001402070650001202084650001502096653001902111653002202130653001502152653002302167653001902190653003402209653002402243653004202267700001602309773010502325856005102430852000902481655001202490IND50087068420221118045027.0140412e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008706842DNAL7 a10.1080/03949370.2012.7113702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, K.L.10aEfficiency of aggressive and submissive visual displays against environmental motion noise in Jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus)  ap. 82-94.  aDespite variations of environmental noise, signals are designed to be effective and conspicuous over an appreciable distance. In particular, visual signals must be perceptible against interference caused by natural elements, such as windblown vegetation. We examined the efficiency of aggressive and submissive displays to elicit behavioural responses from observers in the Jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus) across relative environmental noise. Both displays have been reported to play an important role during social interactions in this species. We conducted two video playback experiments that utilised a high-resolution computer-generated lizard animation to produce social displays that were embedded within simulated windblown vegetation. First, we compared the efficiency a full aggressive display action pattern (comprised of a tail-flick, backward-forward arm wave, and push-up body rock) to a slow arm wave submissive display, against identical background of windblown vegetation. Second, we compared the tail-flick (alerting component) to the slow arm wave across three varying natural conditions, in which the vegetation behind the displays acted as simulated noise: calm, typical, and windy. We found that aggressive displays were more efficient to elicit an observer's response than submissive signals. Furthermore, the tail-flick display is more efficient than submissive displays across a range of natural variation in windblown vegetation movement, but both signals remain efficient in the face of environmental motion noise. Our results suggest that constraints from the environmental background scene play may have a critical role in the evolution of signal design used in Jacky dragon communication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3alizards 3avegetation 0avisual signals 0asignal efficiency 0aaggressive 0asubmissive display 0awind condition 0acomputer-generated animations 0aenvironmental noise 0aJacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus)1 aRieucau, G.0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 25, no. 1 p.82-94dTaylor & Francisx1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2012.711370  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012900177500001900306520126500325592002801590650001801618650001501636650002401651650001501675650001401690650001701704650000901721650001701730650002101747651001801768653002401786653002201810653002001832653002101852700002201873700002101895700001701916700001801933700002001951700002101971700002301992700002602015700001902041700001802060773010502078856008502183852000902268655001202277IND60730121320221120180029.0210527e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073012132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1039322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaggia, Marie-Eugénie10aAt each site its diversity: DNA barcoding reveals remarkable earthworm diversity in neotropical rainforests of French Guiana  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite their recognized essential role in soil, earthworms in tropical environments are still understudied. The aim of this study was to re-evaluate the diversity at the regional scale, as well as to investigate the environmental and spatial drivers of earthworm communities. We sampled earthworm communities across a range of habitats at six localities in French Guiana using three different sampling methods. We generated 1675 DNA barcodes and combined them with data from a previous study. Together, all sequences clustered into 119 MOTUs which were used as proxy to assess species richness. Only two MOTUs were common between the six localities and 20.2% were singletons, showing very high regional species richness and a high number of rare species. A canonical redundancy analysis was used to identify key drivers of the earthworm community composition. The RDA results and beta-diversity calculations both show strong species turnover and a strong spatial effect, resulting from dispersal limitations that are responsible for the current community composition. Sampling in different microhabitats allowed the discovery of 23 MOTUs that are exclusively found in decaying trunks and epiphytes, highlighting hidden diversity of earthworms outside of soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aNeotropics 3acommunity structure 3aearthworms 3aepiphytes 3arare species 3asoil 3asoil ecology 3aspecies richness 3aFrench Guiana 0aTropical rainforest 0aCommunity ecology 0aDiversity level 0aSampling methods1 aDecaëns, Thibaud1 aLapied, Emmanuel1 aDupont, Lise1 aRoy, Virginie1 aSchimann, Heidy1 aOrivel, Jérôme1 aMurienne, Jérôme1 aBaraloto, Christopher1 aCottenie, Karl1 aSteinke, Dirk0 tApplied soil ecology.g2021 Aug., v. 164 p.103932-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1039323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245019100177520169400368592002802062650002502090650002002115650001302135650001402148650001002162650001602172650001602188650001602204650002002220650001102240650002102251650001602272650001302288650002202301650001502323650003202338653001802370653001702388653001802405653005402423653003102477700002202508700002502530700002402555700002202579700002002601700002402621700002502645773009302670856008602763852000902849655001202858IND60731561120221117204100.0211227e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073156112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e063782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWopara, Iheanyichukwu10aAnxiogenic and memory impairment effect of food color exposure: upregulation of oxido-neuroinflammatory markers and acetyl-cholinestrase activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus  aErythrosine and tartrazine are one of the synthetic azo dye mostly consumed in food, drugs and other industrial compounds. This study was designed to investigate the adverse effect of combine erythrosine and tartrazine on cognitive and neurobehavioral functions, pro-oxidants, endogenous antioxidants, cholinergic system and pro-inflammatory cytokines in rats.Erythrosine and tartrazine (2 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, b.w., p.o, 50:50) was administered to rats (n = 6) for 6 weeks. Memory and neurobehavioral assessment using Novel object recognition test (NORT) and Elevated plus maze (EPM) and biochemical (pro-oxidants and anti-oxidant enzymes) and pro-inflammatory cytokine measurement from the brain sub regions namely, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were done at the end of treatment. The results showed (p < 0.05) significant decreased memory and neurobehavioral function, increased acetyl-cholinesterase and pro-oxidants activity (Malonaldehyde level and Nitrite), decreased endogenous anti-oxidants (Glutathione and Catalase) and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-α). We suggested that the mechanism by which this oxidative and neuro-inflammatory damage and cholinergic system alteration occur might be related to the release of metabolite in fission of the azo dyes of the combined erythrosine and tartrazine administration in the animals. However, we concluded on these findings that erythrosine and tartrazine dyes significantly provoke the release of oxido-nitrergic and neuroinflammatory stress markers and also may incite acetyl-cholinesterase activities in different brain regions leading to memory and neurobehavioral impairment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aadverse effects 3acatalase 3acognition 3acolor 3aerythrosine 3aglutathione 3ahippocampus 3amalondialdehyde 3amemory 3amemory disorders 3ametabolites 3anitrites 3aprefrontal cortex 3atartrazine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aNeurobehavior 0aPro-oxidants 0aAnti-oxidants 0aTumor necrosis factor-alpha acetyl-cholinesterase 0aErythrosine and tartrazine1 aModo, Emmanuel U.1 aAdebayo, Olusegun G.1 aMobisson, Samuel K.1 aNwigwe, Jovita O.1 aOgbu, Prince I.1 aNwankwo, Vincent U.1 aEjeawa, Constance U.0 tHeliyon.g2021 Mar., v. 7, no. 3 p.e06378-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e063783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010300163520123600266592002801502650001301530650001401543650002401557650001201581650001401593650001401607650000901621650001201630650001101642650001301653650001301666650002201679650001101701650002901712650000901741650001701750650001101767653001701778653001601795653001401811653001401825653002201839700002301861700001501884773012201899856008102021852000902102655001202111IND60736056520221122174356.0211030e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073605652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1116082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lina10aEffect of reducing sugars on the in-vitro glycation of goat milk whey protein by mass spectrometry  aDry heating of protein with reducing sugar can promote the glycation of protein to form glycation products. Therefore, glycation of whey protein from goat milk, with different reducing saccharides in a dry state condition, was monitored by gel electrophoresis, and ESI tandem mass spectrometry. Whey protein was incubated with different saccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose, lactose, ribose and xylose) at molar ratio of 1:2 with lysine residue and saccharide reducing-end (final concentration 1 mg mL⁻¹) at 37 °C, 65% relative humidity maintained by KI solution for 24 h. Overall, 237 unique glycated peptides, corresponding to 303 sites in 208 proteins, were identified by QE-HF MS/MS. In total, 142 hexosylated and 54 lactosylated site were found in hexose and lactose induced whey, respectively. It was revealed that glucose and galactose both had higher number of glycated proteins and peptides compared with the other saccharides based on Amadori glycation level; whereas, ribose and xylose pentose sugar showed the higher level of glycated end products than the mono and di-saccharides. This work enabled to provide a comprehensive summary about the glycation of goat milk whey protein in a dry state condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3afructose 3agalactose 3agel electrophoresis 3aglucose 3aglycation 3agoat milk 3aheat 3alactose 3alysine 3apentoses 3apeptides 3arelative humidity 3aribose 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awhey 3awhey protein 3axylose 0aWhey protein 0aSaccharides 0aGlycation 0aGoat milk 0aMaillard reaction1 aChandra Roy, Manik1 aZhou, Peng0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 July, v. 147 p.111608-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1116083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014600162500001400308520086700322592002801189650001601217650001101233650001801244650001401262650002301276650002101299650001501320650001301335650001501348650001301363650001401376650001401390650001301404650001201417651001701429653002501446653001901471653001801490653004001508700001901548700003201567700002001599700002001619700001901639773011101658856007401769852000901843655001201852IND60709002420221119132809.0200902e20200327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070900242DNAL7 a10.4081/tz.2020.672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHema, Emmanuel M.10aLine-transect data may not produce reliable estimates of interannual sex-ratio and age structure variation in West African savannah ungulates  aNAL-light  aAdult sex ratios and age structures are important wildlife population parameters, but they have been poorly investigated in ungulate species in West African savannahs. We used line transects to investigate these parameters in 11 ungulates from a protected area in south-western Burkina Faso during the period 2010-2018. We created an empirical model of “detectability” for each species based on its main ecological characteristics (habitat and group size) and body size, and then compared the observed interannual inconsistency in sex ratios and age structures with the a priori detectability score. Six out of 11 species showed low interannual inconsistency in sex ratio and age structure. In 82% of the study species, however, the predicted detectability score matched the observed score, with two exceptions being Tragelaphus scriptus and Sincerus caffer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTragelaphus 3aadults 3aage structure 3abody size 3aconservation areas 3aempirical models 3agroup size 3ahabitats 3apopulation 3asavannas 3asex ratio 3aungulates 3awildlife 3azoology 3aBurkina Faso 0apopulation structure 0aComoé-Léraba 0aline transect 0apredictive “detectability”model1 aOuattara, Yaya1 aTou, Maomarco Abdoul Ismael1 aAmori, Giovanni1 aKarama, Mamadou1 aLuiselli, Luca0 tTropical zoology.g2020 Mar. 27, v. 33, no. 1 p.67-dPAGEPress PublicationswJournal:2037x0394-69757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/tz.2020.673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245012400202300001800326506007600344520148200420592002801902506003701930650002701967650002001994650001202014650002002026650003102046650001002077650001902087650001102106650002202117650002702139650001302166650002502179650002602204650001402230653002302244653000902267653003102276653001802307653002502325700002702350700002102377700002402398700002102422773010202443856007402545852000902619655001202628IND60117820920221207095546.0141126e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011782092DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu1922doi7 aPMC42023282pmcid7 a251933122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRech, Gabriel E.10aNatural Selection on Coding and Noncoding DNA Sequences Is Associated with Virulence Genes in a Plant Pathogenic Fungus  ap. 2368-2379.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNatural selection leaves imprints on DNA, offering the opportunity to identify functionally important regions of the genome. Identifying the genomic regions affected by natural selection within pathogens can aid in the pursuit of effective strategies to control diseases. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide patterns of selection acting on different classes of sequences in a worldwide sample of eight strains of the model plant-pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum graminicola. We found evidence of selective sweeps, balancing selection, and positive selection affecting both protein-coding and noncoding DNA of pathogenicity-related sequences. Genes encoding putative effector proteins and secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes show evidence of positive selection acting on the coding sequence, consistent with an Arms Race model of evolution. The 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes coding for effector proteins and genes upregulated during infection show an excess of high-frequency polymorphisms likely the consequence of balancing selection and consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis of evolution acting on these putative regulatory sequences. Based on the findings of this work, we propose that even though adaptive substitutions on coding sequences are important for proteins that interact directly with the host, polymorphisms in the regulatory sequences may confer flexibility of gene expression in the virulence processes of this important plant pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlomerella graminicola 3adisease control 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aintergenic DNA 3amodels 3anatural selection 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aproteins 3aregulatory sequences 3asecondary metabolites 3avirulence 0apositive selection 0aPAML 0aColletotrichum graminicola 0apathogenicity 0aarms race hypothesis1 aSanz-Martín, José M.1 aAnisimova, Maria1 aSukno, Serenella A.1 aThon, Michael R.0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.2368-2379dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu1923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013300166520133300299592002801632650002801660650001001688650000901698650001601707650002601723650002101749650001001770650001001780650001201790650001601802650000701818650001501825650001301840650001201853650003401865650001301899653001601912653003401928653001801962653001001980653003101990700001202021700001802033700001902051700001402070700001802084773012202102856008102224852000902305655001202314IND60736056620221122174433.0211030e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073605662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1116092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingbin10aEffects of oregano essential oil and nisin on the shelf life of modified atmosphere packed grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus)  aEffects of oregano essential oil (EO) and nisin on the shelf life and microbial community of grass carp fillets packed under modified atmosphere were investigated. The shelf life of fish samples was evaluated based on sensory attributes and spoilage indicators, including color, odor, texture, overall acceptability, total volatile basic nitrogen, and biogenic amines. The addition of oregano EO, nisin, and oregano EO combined with nisin significantly extended the shelf life of fish fillets from 16 d to 20, 20, and 28 d, respectively. In addition, changes in microbial composition of fish fillets were measured by using Illumina-MiSeq high-throughput sequencing and classical microbiological analysis. Adding oregano EO and nisin significantly inhibited the microbial growth of fish fillets, especially lactic acid bacteria which were the dominant spoilage bacteria in fish fillets. While the use of oregano EO and/or nisin did not change the dominant bacteria of fish samples, they significantly lowered total viable counts. Treating fish fillets with nisin lowered the tyramine level and increased the pH value, due to the inhibitory effect on Gram-positive bacteria. The results suggest that oregano EO combined with nisin have great potential to be used as natural antimicrobials to extend the shelf life of grass carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3acolor 3afish 3alactic acid 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial growth 3anisin 3aodors 3aoregano 3aoregano oil 3apH 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3atexture 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3atyramine 0aFish fillet 0aModified atmosphere packaging 0aEssential oil 0aNisin 0aHigh-throughput sequencing1 aLi, Yan1 aYang, Xiaoxue1 aLiu, Xiaochang1 aHong, Hui1 aLuo, Yongkang0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 July, v. 147 p.111609-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1116093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009100156300001800247520171900265592002801984650001602012650002302028650002202051650003402073650001402107650001502121650001902136650001302155650001602168700001402184700001602198700001402214700001602228700002102244700001902265700001802284700001802302700001702320700001802337700001702355700001702372700001302389773014202402856007502544852000902619655001202628IND60767425020221120180226.0220216e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076742502DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta10161g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXian, Kaihu10aDelicate crystallinity control enables high-efficiency P3HT organic photovoltaic cells  ap. 3418-3429.  aAs a benchmark semiconducting polymer, poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) has been broadly used to construct a wide range of organic electronic devices such as photovoltaic cells, photodetectors, thermoelectrics, and transistors. In the last two decades, numerous studies have concentrated on modulating the morphology and performance of organic solar cells based on P3HT and fullerene derivatives. In comparison with P3HT:fullerene systems, the blends of P3HT with emerging nonfullerene acceptors remain significantly less explored and the structure–performance relationships are not well established. In this work, time-dependent grazing incidence X-ray scattering and real-space microscopy experiments were carried out to monitor the microstructure change of the high-efficiency blend of P3HT and a Y6-type nonfullerene acceptor (i.e., ZY-4Cl) over the duration of thermal annealing. By precisely manipulating the crystalline order of both the donor and acceptor, we found that simply shortening the annealing time can cause a remarkable 19-fold increase in the solar cell efficiency. We observed profound changes in all the photovoltaic parameters (open-circuit voltage, current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency) within the first 1 minute, while a slight variation emerged in the later stage. Attractively, the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend film subject to thermal annealing for merely 30 seconds gave rise to a remarkable power conversion efficiency of ∼10.7%, which is the best efficiency of P3HT-based organic photovoltaic cells at present. The research shed light on the morphological optimization and cost-effective processing of polythiophene:nonfullerene blends for optoelectronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acost effectiveness 3acrystal structure 3aelectric potential difference 3afullerene 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3apolymers 3asolar cells1 aLiu, Yang1 aLiu, Junwei1 aYu, Jinde1 aXing, Yifan1 aPeng, Zhongxiang1 aZhou, Kangkang1 aGao, Mengyuan1 aZhao, Wenchao1 aLu, Guanghao1 aZhang, Jidong1 aHou, Jianhui1 aGeng, Yanhou1 aYe, Long0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 10, no. 7 p.3418-3429dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta10161g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013100166300001400297520138400311592002801695650002201723650001501745650001201760650001001772650002101782650002001803653002901823653002201852653002601874653001701900653002101917700001601938700001701954700001801971700001501989700002002004700001102024700001802035773011002053856008302163961001302246852000902259655001202268IND60087530120221118174739.0161023e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008753012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruifu10aCharacterization of two cellobiose dehydrogenases and comparison of their contributions to total activity in Neurospora crassa  ap. 24-32.  aCellobiose dehydrogenase production by Neurospora crassa was investigated in this study. N. crassa has two putative cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) genes (cdh) in its genome. CDH was produced only under cellulolytic conditions. Deletion of nc-cdh1 eliminated almost all of the strain’s CDH activity, whereas the deletion of nc-cdh2 had little effect on total extracellular CDH activity, which indicates that NC-CDH1 is a major contributor to overall CDH activity. The homologous expression of nc-cdh1 and nc-cdh2 under the control of the constitutive D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpdA) promoter enabled recombinant CDH production under non-cellulolytic conditions. Both NC-CDH1 and NC-CDH2 produced by N. crassa were successfully purified and characterized for the first time. NC-CDH1 and NC-CDH2 have molecular weights of 100kDa and 130kDa, respectively. When their N-linked glycans were removed by N-glycosidase F treatment, both enzymes showed a molecular weight of 95kDa. Although NC-CDH2 lacks the cellulose-binding module and contributed marginally to total CDH activity in N. crassa, NC-CDH2 has specific activity similar to that of NC-CDH1 (7.93 vs. 8.89IUmg−1), and it has a much lower Km value than that of NC-CDH1 (5.79 vs. 25.72μM). The lower activity contribution of NC-CDH2 in the wild-type strain may results from its lower enzyme production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeurospora crassa 3acellobiose 3aenzymes 3agenes 3amolecular weight 3apolysaccharides 0aCellobiose dehydrogenase 0aNeurospora crassa 0aHomologous expression 0aPurification 0aCharacterization1 aXu, Chenwei1 aShen, Qirong1 aKasuga, Takao1 aWu, Weihua1 aSzewczyk, Edyta1 aMa, Di1 aFan, Zhiliang0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Aug., v. 82 p.24-32dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245004300205300001800248500001500266506007600281520156600357592002801923506003701951650001801988650000902006650001402015650004202029650001102071650002902082650002902111650001202140653001602152653001002168653001002178653001002188700002102198700002502219773010202244856007402346852000902420655001202429IND60117821320221207105528.0141126e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011782132DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu1962doi7 aPMC42023322pmcid7 a253648032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHooks, Katarzyna B.10aIntron Evolution in Saccharomycetaceae  ap. 2543-2556.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntrons in protein-coding genes are very rare in hemiascomycetous yeast genomes. It has been suggested that these species have experienced extensive intron loss during their evolution from the postulated intron-rich fungal ancestor. However, no intron-devoid yeast species have been identified and some of the introns remaining within the genomes of intron-poor species, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appear to be beneficial during growth under stress conditions. In order to reveal the pattern of intron retention within intron-poor yeast species and better understand the mechanisms of intron evolution, we generated a comprehensive set of 250 orthologous introns in the 20 species that comprise the Saccharomycetaceae, by analyzing RNA deep-sequencing data and alignments of intron-containing genes. Analysis of these intron sets shows that intron loss is at least two orders of magnitude more frequent than intron gain. Fine mapping of intron positions shows that intron sliding is rare, and that introns are almost always removed without changing the primary sequence of the encoded protein. The latter finding is consistent with the prevailing view that homologous recombination between reverse-transcribed mature mRNAs and the corresponding genomic locus is the primary mechanism of intron loss. However, we also find evidence that loss of a small number of introns is mediated by micro-homology, and that the number of intron losses is diminished in yeast species that have lost the microhomology end joining and nonhomologous end joining machinery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3aloci 3aevolution 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ayeasts 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ahomologous recombination 3aintrons 0aintron loss 0agenes 0ayeast 0afungi1 aDelneri, Daniela1 aGriffiths-Jones, Sam0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.2543-2556dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu1963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013100161300001800292500001900310520149900329592002801828596005901856596004501915650002901960650003001989650001202019650001902031650001202050650001302062650001102075650001502086650001102101650001902112651001002131700005202141700001402193700001302207773012602220856008202346852000902428655001202437IND60709003320221119133019.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070900332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-020-05372-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQing, Y.10aUltra-high resolution regional climate projections for assessing changes in hydrological extremes and underlying uncertainties  ap. 2031-2051.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe frequency and intensity of extreme hydrological events (droughts and floods) have been increasing over the past few decades, which has been posing a threat to water security and agriculture production. Thus, projecting the future evolution of hydrological extremes plays a crucial role in sustainable water management and agriculture development in a changing climate. In this study, we develop the high-resolution projections of multidimensional drought characteristics and flood risks using the convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the horizontal grid spacing of 4 km for the Blanco and Mission River basins over South Texas. Uncertainties in model parameters are addressed explicitly, thereby leading to probabilistic assessments of hydrological extremes. Our findings reveal that the probabilistic multivariate assessments of drought and flood risks can reduce the underestimation and the biased conclusions generated from the univariate assessment. Furthermore, our findings disclose that future droughts are expected to become more severe over South Texas even though the frequency of the occurrence of droughts is projected to decrease, especially for the long-term drought episodes. In addition, South Texas region is expected to experience more floods with an increasing river discharge. Moreover, the Blanco and Mission river basins will suffer from higher flood risks as flood return periods are expected to become longer under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a51809223cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a1-ZE8ScHong Kong Polytechnic University 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural productivity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adynamics 3amodels 3ariver flow 3arivers 3awater security 3aTexas1 aWang, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7827-187X1 aZhang, B.1 aWang, Y.0 tClimate dynamics.g2020 Oct., v. 55, no. 7-8 p.2031-2051dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05372-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009600166300001400262520121600276592002801492650002001520650001301540650001201553650001501565650001501580650001001595650002601605650001001631650001901641650003101660653002401691653001501715653000901730653003701739653001301776653001001789653001801799700001701817700001501834700001801849700001801867773011001885856008301995852000902078655001202087IND60087530820221118174737.0161023e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008753082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Niantao10aOdorous composting gas abatement and microbial community diversity in a biotrickling filter  ap. 73-80.  aThis study aimed to remove complex odorous gas produced from composting using a biotrickling filter and to observe the temporal and special distributions of bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes. The removal efficiencies of the total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) were 26.1% and 81.5% before and after inoculation of volatile organic compounds (VOC)-degrading microbes, respectively. Especially trimethylamine was 100% degraded. In the first and second composting period, the odor reduction efficiencies showed average values of 86.2% and 94.5%, respectively. The total average of the bacteria in the biofilm was 2.06 × 109 CFU/g TS, which was 22.2% higher than that of the control (the culture of microbes prior to the inoculation of VOC-degrading microbes). The bacteria may have played a predominant role in odor removal. The total average of the fungi in the biofilm was 9.64 × 106 CFU/g TS, which was only 6.40% of the control. The total average of the actinomycetes in the biofilm was 5.10 × 105 CFU/g TS, which was 5.63 times higher than that of the control.

Herein, LaFeO₃ perovskite (as photosystem II) was shelled by nitrogen-doped graphene (NGr as photosystem I) functionalized with ultralow Pt loading to produce an impactful and stable ternary Z-scheme platform: LaFeO₃@NGr–Pt. Under visible-light irradiation, the LaFeO₃@NGr₃–Pt₀.₅ entity (a NGr shell thickness of 3 nm and Pt loading of 0.5 wt%) delivered a PHE performance of 3.52 μmol mgcₐₜ⁻¹ h⁻¹, superior to those of binary LaFeO₃@NGr₃ (1.86 μmol mgcₐₜ⁻¹ h⁻¹), NGr–Pt₀.₅ (0.88 μmol mgcₐₜ⁻¹ h⁻¹), and free-standing NGr (0.34 μmol mgcₐₜ⁻¹ h⁻¹) catalysts. It also showed outstanding PHE performance compared to previous advanced Z-scheme species. In addition, the ternary Z-scheme system exhibited a high maximum apparent quantum yield of 18.25% at 450 nm. This excellent performance of the Z-scheme platform can be attributed to the following. (i) The interfacial contact between LaFeO₃ and NGr facilitated charge carrier transfer under light. (ii) The promising direct Z-scheme platform not only preserved the strong redox potentials of the two photosystems but also inhibited charge recombination significantly. (iii) Finally, the Pt cocatalyst attracted the electrons migrating from NGr and assisted the adsorption of hydrogen atoms, thus accelerating the overall catalytic reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3alight 3aphotocatalysis1 aDi Liberto, Giovanni1 aKo, Hyungduk1 aPark, Jaehong1 aWang, Wenmeng1 aShin, Doyeong1 aSon, Hoki1 aVan Le, Quyet1 aVan Nguyen, Tuan1 aVan Tan, Vo1 aPacchioni, Gianfranco1 aLee, In-Hwan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 10, no. 7 p.3330-3340dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta10376h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04339naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245013400207300001800341500001900359520282800378592002803206596004503234650003103279650001203310650001303322650001103335650000903346650003003355650001103385651001703396700002803413700001803441700002403459700002203483700001903505700002603524700001803550700001903568700002103587700002403608700002003632773012603652856008203778852000903860655001203869IND60709003520221119133140.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070900352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-020-05358-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolteni, Franco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0651-456610aBoreal-winter teleconnections with tropical Indo-Pacific rainfall in HighResMIP historical simulations from the PRIMAVERA project  ap. 1843-1873.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigates how teleconnections linking tropical rainfall anomalies and wintertime circulation in the northern extra-tropics are represented in historical simulations for the period 1950–2010 run by partners of the EU-funded PRIMAVERA project, following the HighResMIP protocol of CMIP6. The analysis focusses on teleconnections from the western/central Indian Ocean in mid-winter and from the NINO4 region in both the early and the late part of winter; this choice is justified by a substantial change in the relationship between ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the two parts of the season. Model results for both coupled integrations and runs with prescribed sea-surface temperature (SST) are validated against data from the latest ECMWF 20th-century re-analysis, CERA20C. Simulations from six modelling groups are considered, comparing the impact of increasing atmospheric resolution in runs with prescribed SST, and of moving from uncoupled to coupled simulations in the high-resolution version of each model. Single runs were available for each model configurations at the time of writing, with one centre (ECMWF) also providing a 6-member ensemble. Results from this ensemble are compared with those of a 6-member multi-model ensemble (MME) formed by including one simulation from each model. Using only a single historical simulation from each model configuration, it is difficult to detect a consistent change in the fidelity of model-generated teleconnections when either atmospheric resolution is increased or ocean coupling is introduced. However, when simulations from six different models are pooled together in the MME, some improvements in teleconnection patterns can be seen when moving from uncoupled to coupled simulations. For the ECMWF ensemble, improvements in the coupled simulations are only apparent for the late-winter NINO4 teleconnection. While the Indian Ocean teleconnection and the late-winter NINO4 teleconnection appear equally robust in the re-analysis record, the latter is well simulated in the majority of both uncoupled and coupled runs, while the former is reproduced with (generally) much larger errors, and a high degree of variability between individual models and ensemble members. Most of the simulations with prescribed SST fail to produce a realistic estimate of multi-decadal changes between the first and the second part of the 60-year record. This is (at least partially) due to their inability to simulate an Indian Ocean rainfall change which, in observations, has a zonal gradient out of phase with SST changes. In coupled runs, at least one model run with both realistic teleconnections and a good simulation of the inter-decadal pattern of Indian Ocean rainfall also shows a realistic NAO signal in extratropical multi-decadal variability.  aPublisher supplied data  a641727cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aclimate 3adynamics 3amodels 3arain 3asurface water temperature 3awinter 3aIndian Ocean1 aRoberts, Christopher D.1 aSenan, Retish1 aKeeley, Sarah P.

The potential influence of sea-surface temperature (SST) on ISM variation at millennial time scales has been progressively proposed in recent studies. Towards a better understanding of Holocene evolution of ISM, especially the potential response to variations in SST, a 643 cm continuous sediment sequence covering the past 11.1 ka was recovered from Beihai Wetland in western Yunnan Plateau. Fossil pollen analysis revealed that evergreen broadleaved forest dominated the regional vegetation in the early Holocene, which represented a warm and humid period associated with strong ISM. Expansions of deciduous broadleaved forest and grassland from 5.2 cal. ka BP to the present, together with the appearance of abundant plant remains, indicate the formation of the wetland system. Ordination analysis of the pollen assemblages further confirmed the abrupt vegetation turnover at ca. 5.2 cal. ka BP, which is consistent with the abrupt decline in reconstructed mean annual precipitation (Pₐₙₙ, from ca. 1400 to 1100 mm), and indicates an abrupt decline in the summer monsoon. We performed a climate regime shift test on various records from the ISM domain and eastern Africa and found this phenomenon as well, which could not be explained by changes in solar insolation or the migration of the ITCZ. A mid-Holocene cooling was detected from the Indian Ocean, especially a decreased SST in the tropical Indian Ocean ca. 5.5 cal. ka BP. Cooling of the tropical Indian Ocean possibly caused the abrupt retreat of the summer monsoon by restraining the duration of the monsoonal season and the convergent process, which was supported by an abrupt monsoon decline based on results from a minimal concept model.  aPublisher supplied data  a41877282cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41861134030cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aHolocene epoch 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3acooling 3adeciduous forests 3adecline 3adynamics 3aevolution 3agrasslands 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aordination techniques 3apalynology 3apollen 3apollen analysis 3asediments 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3awetlands 3aChina 3aEastern Africa 3aIndian Ocean1 aShen, Ji1 aWang, Yong1 aLiu, Xingqi1 aCao, Xianyong1 aHerzschuh, Ulrike0 tClimate dynamics.g2020 Oct., v. 55, no. 7-8 p.1961-1977dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05363-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245016000153300001800313520178500331592002802116650002302144650001502167650001302182650002202195650001502217650001402232650001102246650001402257700001802271700001502289700001802304700001402322700001402336700001502350700001702365773014202382856007502524852000902599655001202608IND60767426020221120180204.0220216e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076742602DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta10585j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kai10aEdge-segregated ternary Pd–Pt–Ni spiral nanosheets as high-performance bifunctional oxygen redox electrocatalysts for rechargeable zinc–air batteries  ap. 3808-3817.  aRational design of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts to simultaneously accelerate the sluggish reversible oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) is an enormous challenge that restricts the working efficiency and rechargeable cyclability of metal–air batteries. Here we report a facile one-pot synthesis of edge-segregated trimetallic Pd–Pt–Ni spiral nanosheets (SpNSs) to serve as active dual-electrocatalysts toward ORR and OER electrocatalysis under alkaline conditions, showcasing a workable cathode electrocatalyst for high-performance and rechargeable zinc–air batteries (ZABs). These trimetallic SpNSs are generated from a template-directed, spiral dislocation growth process with the later deposited Pt–Ni active ingredient mainly segregated at the low-coordinated edges. Partial in situ oxidation of incorporated Ni generates highly dispersed NiOₓ species which play a crucial role in modulating the electronic structure of Pd and Pt and providing strong hydroxyl adsorption sites. Owing to these merits, the Pd₄₅Pt₄₄Ni₁₁ SpNSs exhibit excellent ORR mass activity (4.90 A mgPd₊Pₜ⁻¹) in 0.1 M KOH, which is 28.8 times that of commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, they require a substantially lower overpotential than Pt/C and Ni-free counterparts to attain a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² for the reverse OER. When employed as the cathode in a practical ZAB, the Pd₄₅Pt₄₄Ni₁₁ SpNSs present greatly improved power density and rechargeability compared to the Pt/C benchmark. This work realizes atomic-level manipulation for the distribution of active ingredients on ultrathin 2D multimetallic nanostructures, offering a novel platform for the exploration of high-performance energy conversion heterocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aadsorption 3acathodes 3aenergy conversion 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asynthesis1 aHuang, Hongpu1 aZhu, Yuxin1 aWang, Shupeng1 aLyu, Zixi1 aHan, Xiao1 aKuang, Qin1 aXie, Shuifen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 10, no. 7 p.3808-3817dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta10585j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011200169300001300281520104900294592002801343650002301371650001601394650001801410650001901428650001001447650001301457650001701470650001001487650003301497650002201530650001401552650001101566650001601577653002301593653001901616653001901635653002201654700001401676700002001690700002801710773010901738856008301847852000901930655001201939IND60087531220221118174929.0161023e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008753122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaiti, Sonakshi10aIsolation and characterisation of starch/polyvinyl alcohol degrading fungi from aerobic compost environment  ap. 9-12.  aTwo fungi, responsible for the degradation of starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) biocomposite films were isolated from aerobic compost environment by extensive screening. ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) sequencing of the two fungi samples showed 99% identity at 99% coverage with the sequence from Penicillium daleae, and 100% identity at 100% coverage with the sequence from Aspergillus flavus. An extensive weight loss study was performed using these two fungi on starch/PVA films separately. In comparison to the weight loss observed in the compost (nearly 60%), starch/PVA films exhibited a higher weight loss (nearly 71%) by these two fungi after 30 days of degradation. The borax crosslinked films exhibited 85% degradation by A. flavus. After 15 days of degradation by fungus closely related to P. daleae, the borax crosslinked films disappeared completely. This study showed that the A. flavus and fungus with close affinity to P. daleae can degrade such biocomposite films more efficiently in comparison to biodegradation in compost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aPenicillium 3abiocomposites 3abiodegradation 3aborax 3acomposts 3acrosslinking 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3ascreening 3astarch 3aweight loss 0aBiocomposite films 0aITS sequencing 0aBiodegradation 0aWeight loss study1 aRay, Dipa1 aMitra, Debarati1 aMukhopadhyay, Aniruddha0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Aug., v. 82 p.9-12dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008600166300001800252500001900270520206700289592002802356596008602384596005902470596005902529596007702588650001202665650001602677650002002693650001302713650001402726650001102740650002302751650001602774650001202790650001102802651001002813700005602823700001202879700001702891700001702908773012602925856008203051852000903133655001203142IND60709004320221119133032.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070900432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-020-05380-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhiqiang10aClimatology of Tibetan Plateau vortices derived from multiple reanalysis datasets  ap. 2237-2252.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Tibetan Plateau vortex (TPV) is a mesoscale weather system active in the near-surface layer, which is one of the major systems for the generation of precipitation in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, no long-term observations of the TPVs are available due to the scarcity of observations in the TP. Thereby, long-term, high-accuracy reanalysis products are a reliable source for the analysis of characteristic TPV activities and possible mechanisms behind. In the present study, an objective analysis method is implemented to obtain a complete dataset of TPV based on several reanalysis products, including the ERA-Interim, ERA40, JRA55, NCEP CFSR, and NASA MERRA2. The TPVs are detected and tracked by the minima in geopotential height at 500 hPa. Results indicate that the TPVs derived from multiple reanalysis products have quite similar spatial patterns and temporal variability. The characteristic parameters of the TPVs derived from a given reanalysis data are related to the resolution of this reanalysis product. Higher-resolution reanalysis products can yield more low-pressure systems, which explains why the TPVs derived from high-resolution reanalysis datasets generally have longer lifetime, stronger and larger vortex scale than those from low-resolution reanalysis products, although the total number of TPVs are similar. The annual average number of TPVs generated in the TP is 63.5, and these TPVs largely originate in the mountainous area of the central western TP around (34° N, 78–95° E) and a belt zone (30° N, 80–84° E) in the southern TP, where the elevation is around 5500 m. The TPVs often dissipate in low valleys and the lee side of mountains. They mainly occur in the warm season during May–September, most active in the summer and least active in the winter. More TPVs form in the daytime than in the nighttime. Those TPVs that move out of the TP account for less than 10–14% of all TPVs, and they usually follow three moving paths: eastward (6.9–7.8%), northeastward (2.3–3.4%) and southward (2.3–3.5%).  aPublisher supplied data  aXDA2006010104cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  a41775075cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91637105cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGYHY201406001cNational Special Project for Commonweal Industry in China 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3adata collection 3adynamics 3amountains 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3awarm season 3aweather 3awinter 3aChina1 aGuo, Weidong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0299-63931 aJia, La1 aYao, Xiuping1 aZhou, Zhenbo0 tClimate dynamics.g2020 Oct., v. 55, no. 7-8 p.2237-2252dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05380-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245018300214300002000397520186600417592002802283650001902311650001902330650002502349650001102374650003202385650003302417650001702450650001202467650002702479650001102506650001402517650002402531650001302555651001202568651001102580651001002591651001202601773015502613856008302768852000902851655001202860IND60786047620221120173230.0220802e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078604762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19575-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnifade, Stephen Taiwo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1497-783510aRetrospecting on resource abundance in leading oil-producing African countries: how valid is the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in a sectoral composition framework?  ap. 52761-52774.  aPolicymakers and authorities in Africa are often concerned about economic growth and stability owing to the long history of socioeconomic problems that have bedeviled the continent for years. However, increasing environmental degradation challenges in recent times beckons for adequate attention considering Africa’s vulnerability to climate change and environmental disasters. Thus, the current study examines the illustrious environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in a sectoral composition framework of fossil resources abundance among leading oil-producing African economies, including Algeria, Nigeria, Angola, and Egypt, using a combination of quantile regression (QR) approach and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) for data between 1995 and 2016. Based on the empirical results from the study, three main factors significantly increase environmental pollution through CO₂ emissions among the countries, namely: fossil energy consumption, income levels, and the shares of the manufacturing sector in the total gross domestic product (GDP). While income growth exacerbates pollution, the negative impacts of the income square were only significant at the lower and mid quantiles of the understudied periods in the QR estimates. Thus, the EKC hypothesis was not convincingly upheld for the countries as its validity demonstrates significant quantile effects. Furthermore, the tripartite causality nexus among real income, resource rent, and share of the service sector in GDP, which is unobserved in the share of the manufacturing sector, reflect the infamous Dutch disease argument among the resource-dependent countries. Hence, to promote environmental sustainability and address resource dependency toward the actualization of SDGs (1, 8, 12, and 13), the study recommends energy portfolios diversification alongside economic diversification.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3aenvironmental Kuznets curve 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afossil fuels 3afossils 3agross domestic product 3aincome 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3aAlgeria 3aAngola 3aEgypt 3aNigeria0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 July, v. 29, no. 35 p.52761-52774dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19575-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016400169520126000333592002801593650001801621650001501639650001301654650001701667650001801684650001601702650001801718650001101736650001101747650001301758650000901771653001501780653002501795653000901820653001901829653000901848700001601857700002401873700001601897700001801913773010501931856008702036852000902123655001202132IND60730118320221119110542.0210619e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073011832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1263782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Limin10aInteraction mechanism of the adopted reagents in the flotation recovery of sphalerite and pyrite from a galena flotation tailing: First-principles calculations  aSphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS) and pyrite (FeS₂) are the important metallic sulphide minerals. These three sulphide minerals are often associated with each other, and large amounts of sphalerite and pyrite are lost in the galena flotation tailings. In this study, the flotation method was employed to recover sphalerite and pyrite from a galena flotation tailing waste. The reagent scheme, including Cu²⁺ activator and butyl xanthate (BX) collector, can efficiently recover sphalerite and pyrite to obtain a two-mineral mixed concentrate with the Zn and Fe grades of ∼17 % and ∼26 %, respectively, in the sphalerite-pyrite bulk rough flotation. Quicklime (CaO) depressant in combination with BX collector can efficiently separate sphalerite and pyrite to obtain the two products in the sphalerite/pyrite separation rough flotation: the sphalerite concentrate with the Zn grade of ∼33 % and the pyrite concentrate with the Fe grade of ∼36 %. The first-principles calculations were employed to study the interaction mechanism of the adopted reagents in the recoveries of sphalerite and pyrite from the galena flotation tailing. This study provides an important reference for the recoveries of sphalerite and pyrite from similar galena tailings.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium oxide 3acollectors 3acolloids 3aconcentrates 3aconcentrating 3amethodology 3amine tailings 3amixing 3apyrite 3asurfaces 3atail 0aSphalerite 0aFlotation separation 0aCu2+ 0aButyl xanthate 0aLime1 aGao, Jiande1 aKhoso, Sultan Ahmed1 aLiu, Yuling1 aTian, Mengjie0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 May 20, v. 617 p.126378-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1263783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012500165300001800290500001400308520126800322592002801590650001901618650002401637650002801661650000901689650001801698650001701716650001001733650001601743650001601759650001501775650002301790650001201813650002101825650001601846650001801862650002101880650002901901700002501930700001701955700001801972773012601990856007402116852000902190655001202199IND60711482820221120221537.0200928e20200923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071148282DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo01527j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsensio-Grau, Andrea10aEnhancing the nutritional profile and digestibility of lentil flour by solid state fermentation with Pleurotus ostreatus  ap. 7905-7912.  aNAL-light  aLentils (Lens culinaris) present an excellent nutrient profile. However, the increasing displacement of legumes from the diet and the possible negative effects of the food matrix and antinutrient factors encourage the application of new strategies to improve nutrient digestibility and to produce food concepts that contribute to the increase of legume consumption. This study approached the solid-state fermentation of lentils with an edible fungus (Pleurotus ostreatus) in order to produce improved lentil flour. Fermentation contributed to the increase of protein (23%), resistant starch (9.8%), and polyphenols (from 2.1 to 3.2 mg gallic acid equivalent per g dry matter). After simulating in vitro digestion, fermented flours presented a higher fraction of digested protein (17%) along with lower starch hydrolysis (34 vs. 24%), while the polyphenol content increased from 3.1 to 7.73 mg gallic acid equivalent per g dry matter. Thus, this study supports the application of solid-state fermentation with this edible fungus to obtain lentil flours with an enhanced digestibility profile as compared to non-fermented counterparts. Lentil flours could be used as a novel raw material in the formulation of new food concepts with an enhanced nutritional profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLens culinaris 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aantinutritional factors 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aedible fungi 3aflour 3afood matrix 3agallic acid 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestion 3alentils 3anutrient content 3apolyphenols 3araw materials 3aresistant starch 3asolid state fermentation1 aCalvo-Lerma, Joaquim1 aHeredia, Ana1 aAndrés, Ana,0 tFood & function.g2020 Sept. 23, v. 11, no. 9 p.7905-7912dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01527j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001600290520176400306592002802070650002702098650002702125650001702152650001902169650001002188650001602198650001902214650001802233650001002251650001202261650000902273650000702282650001602289650002002305650001102325650001302336650001102349650001602360650003702376650002102413650002502434653001802459653001502477653001902492653003202511653002302543653001602566700001802582700001602600700001202616700001402628700001602642700001902658773011202677856008602789852000902875655001202884IND60597560620221118125029.0190705e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059756062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.05.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chenxi10aIsolation, characterization, and application of a novel specific Salmonella bacteriophage in different food matrices  ap. 631-641.  aApplication of bacteriophages to eliminate foodborne pathogens in food matrices is an emerging research field. In this study, a promising phage candidate specific for Salmonella strains was screened and its ability to decrease Salmonella counts in some food, such as milk, sausage, and lettuce, was investigated. A total of 58 Salmonella phages were isolated from a wastewater treatment plant, sewage near a river, farm ditch near a lake, and poultry house. Among them, phages LPST10, LPST18, and LPST23 were highly efficient in infecting Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028. In particular, phage LPST10 could infect all the tested Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis strains with high efficiency. Bacterial challenge tests revealed that phage LPST10 and its combination with phages LPST18 and LPST23 could consistently inhibit the growth of multiple strains. Phage LPST10 presented a lysis time of about 50 min with a burst size of 101 PFU/CFU, exhibited two distinct phases in the one-step growth curve, and was stable at a pH range of 3–13 that corresponds to the pH of most of the foods (pH 3.5–7.5) and at temperatures between 30 °C and 60 °C. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that phage LPST10 belongs to the Siphoviridae family, with an icosahedral head with a diameter of 83.26 nm and tail length and width of approximately 144.89 nm and 10.9 nm, respectively. A significant decrease in the bacterial counts (0.92–5.12 log10 CFU/sample) and an increase in phage titers (0–2.96 log10 PFU/sample) were observed in different food matrices tested. These results demonstrated that phage LPST10 is a promising candidate for controlling Salmonella contamination in foods owing to its safety and effectiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aSiphoviridae 3abacteriophages 3afarms 3afood matrix 3afood pathogens 3agrowth curves 3alakes 3alettuce 3amilk 3apH 3aplate count 3apoultry housing 3arivers 3asausages 3asewage 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviral morphology 3awastewater treatment 0aBacteriophage 0aSalmonella 0aLysis capacity 0aBiological characterization 0aBiological control 0aFood safety1 aShi, Jianchun1 aMa, Wenjuan1 aLi, Zhi1 aWang, Jia1 aLi, Jinquan1 aWang, Xiaohong0 tFood research international.g2018 Sept., v. 111 p.631-641dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.05.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245009100163300001200254520185000266592002802116650001402144650001602158650002702174650002202201650001802223650002402241650002802265650001602293651001002309653003302319653004202352653001402394653001102408700001702419700001102436700001502447773010902462856008302571852000902654655001202663IND60526289520221120092949.0190403e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052628952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Yuan10aExperiment and analysis on flow rate of improved subsurface drainage with ponded water  ap. 1-9.  aAn improved subsurface drainage with characteristics of less land occupied and reasonable flow rate drained was presented to overcome the disadvantage of small flow rate of conventional subsurface pipe drainage and adapt to the new challenge of agricultural drainage. Based on soil column experiment, the performance of improved subsurface drainage was discussed in saturated and unsaturated soil. During the experiment, five factors of filter width, soil medium, surface ponding depth, outflow condition and groundwater depth were considered. Then, drainage equation for improved subsurface drainage flow rate under conditions of surface ponding and homogeneous saturated soil was first proposed. The results indicated that improved subsurface drainage performed better in both saturated and unsaturated soil with surface ponding. Flow rates of improved subsurface drainage equaled to 2–3 times of that in conventional subsurface pipe drainage when filter width varied from 2cm to 6cm in completely saturated fine-sand medium. In addition, the greater the hydraulic conductivity gaps between filter and soil in a specific range, the more effective the improved subsurface drainage is. Besides, in case of large groundwater depth, improved subsurface drainage was still effective. When groundwater depth was 2 times of drain depth, improved subsurface drainage flow rate was comparable to 2 times of that in conventional subsurface pipe drainage in saturated fine-sand medium. The calculated flow rates matched well with the observed ones. The research results can provide technical support to the application of improved subsurface drainage. Meanwhile, it will be beneficial to enrich agricultural drainage technologies in China, which is of practical significance to ensure food safety and promote sustainable development of irrigated areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3afood safety 3ahydraulic conductivity 3airrigated farming 3apipe drainage 3asubsurface drainage 3asustainable development 3awater table 3aChina 0aImproved subsurface drainage 0aConventional subsurface pipe drainage 0aFlow rate 0aFilter1 aWang, Shaoli1 aXu, Di1 aQu, Xingye0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Nov., v. 177 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009200167300002000259520224900279592002802528650001802556650001602574650002902590650001202619650002002631650001802651650001002669650002302679650002402702650001302726650001202739650002802751650002302779651001302802700002902815700002102844700001902865700001802884773015502902856008303057852000903140655001203149IND60786047820221120163530.0220802e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078604782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18177-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahzad, Tahir10aPeople’s attitude towards willingness-to-pay for environmental protection in Pakistan  ap. 52635-52654.  aRecent environmental research has found that people with higher incomes and in more developed countries are more willing to pay (WTP) to protect their environment than people in developing countries. Based on this assumption, the study investigated Pakistani citizens’ attitudes toward environmental protection, precisely their willingness to pay higher prices and taxes to preserve the natural environment. The research was carried out in three Punjab cities (Hasan Abdal, Wah, and Taxila) and four KPK cities (Abbottabad, Havelian, Mansehra, and Haripur). The selected cities are home to knowledgeable people who work in various universities, schools, hospitals, medical colleges, and nearby industrial estates and have a sense of environmental protection and can understand the healthcare issues related to environmental damages. The survey was divided into two sections: one about the participants’ socio-demographic information and the other about people’s willingness to pay higher prices and taxes to protect the environment. Four hundred and sixty-two people took part in the survey, and the data were analyzed using the bootstrap regression approach. The results show that gender has a detrimental impact, although population density and education positively impact a country’s willingness to pay for environmental protection (WTPEP). Women are more likely to engage in pro-environmental behavior than men, resulting in disparities in their perceptions of male and female respondents in the study. People who live in crowded places tend to pay for environmental protection because of population density, healthcare difficulties, and air pollution. The respondents are well-versed in the externalities of environmental pollution; they are hopeful about paying for a better healthcare environment. Other criteria, such as the respondent’s income, health status, total pollution level in the country, and per capita income, enable respondents to pay for environmental preservation to achieve long-term sustainable growth. The government must embrace air quality regulations and empower its citizens by offering better healthcare services since they are enthusiastic about paying higher taxes and fees to protect the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aenvironmental protection 3afemales 3ahealth services 3ahealth status 3amales 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3awillingness to pay 3aPakistan1 aShah, Syed Tahir Hussain1 aRais, Syed Imran1 aAkhtar, S.

The mite resistant lines had significantly low mite abundances and prevalences in each selected generation. The high mite-resistant lines of the first selected generation showed resistance equal to that of bees that had undergone natural selection from tracheal mite infestations for 3 yr in New York. Additionally, the high mite-resistant lines of the second selected generation and Buckfast bees had significantly lower mite abundances and prevalences than honey bees from control colonies which had never been exposed to tracheal mite infestation in Ontario. These results corroborate studies that have shown that honey bees possess genetic components for tracheal mite resistance that can be readily enhanced in a breeding program. The two methods used for evaluating relative resistance of honey bees to tracheal mites, a short-term bioassay and evaluation in field colonies, were positively correlated (rₛ == 0.64, P < 0.001).  aPublisher supplied data 0ahoney bee 0aApis mellifera 0atracheal mite 0aAcarapis woodi 0amite resistance 0abee breeding1 aOtis, Gard W.1 aScott-Dupree, Cynthia D.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2001 Apr., v. 94, no. 2 p.332-338dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-94.2.3323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245008800170300001600258520129700274592002801571650001601599650001001615650001801625650002701643650001201670650001201682650001201694650001101706650001301717650001601730650002801746650001201774650002201786650001401808650002001822650001701842650002101859650001201880650001401892650002501906650001101931650001401942653001701956653001901973653002001992653002802012653001702040700001702057700002202074700002002096773009502116856008402211852000902295655001202304IND60568169220221119115108.0190416e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056816922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2017.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKováčik, Jozef10aLong-term impact of cadmium shows little damage in Scenedesmus acutiformis cultures  ap. 184-190.  aLong-term (30days) responses of green alga Scenedesmus acutiformis to cadmium (Cd) excess (1 or 10μM) were studied under in vitro heterotrophic conditions (Milieu Bristol medium containing glucose and casein). No extensive changes of morphology were observed but Cd slightly depleted chlorophyll autofluorescence and some mineral content (K, Ca, and Mg). However, Cd (mainly at 10μM) stimulated increase in biomass and accumulation of ascorbic acid, non-protein thiols, and phenols. Signs of oxidative stress (elevation of ROS, depletion of nitric oxide and viability, changes in the activities of SOD, CAT and GR) were also observed. Total Cd reached only 17.3 and 45.2μg/g DW at 1 or 10μM Cd but bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was comparable with other species and cultivation/exposure conditions (BAF~40 at 10μM Cd) indicating that rather inorganic compounds than glucose or casein affect Cd accumulation. Short-term (24h) exposure of algae to identical Cd doses in HEPES buffer revealed higher absolute Cd content in comparison with 30days of cultivation (8- and 17-fold) and comparison with previous studies indicates that S. acutiformis is a better cadmium accumulator. The extensive use of fluorescence microscopy for oxidative stress detection in algae is also carefully discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3aalgae 3aascorbic acid 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acasein 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence microscopy 3aglucose 3along term effects 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3aphenols 3apotassium 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiols 3aviability 0aAntioxidants 0aAxenic culture 0aBioaccumulation 0aFluorescence microscopy 0aHeavy metals1 aBabula, Petr1 aPeterková, Viera1 aHedbavny, Josef0 tAlgal research.g2017 July, v. 25 p.184-190dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2017.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011600168300001600284520139700300592002801697650001201725650001401737650001701751650001301768650000901781650001901790650001901809650002701828650002901855653002901884653002301913653002101936653001101957653000801968653001901976700001701995700001902012700001402031700001902045700001702064700001902081700001302100773011202113856008602225852000902311655001202320IND60597560720221118125100.0190705e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059756072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.05.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Jun-Yan10aComparative experiments of fibril formation from whey protein concentrate with homogeneous and secondary nuclei  ap. 556-564.  aTwo types of special structures, homogeneous and secondary nuclei, form during fibril formation. The structural and functional properties of amyloid fibrils in whey protein concentrate (WPC) with different ratios of added homogeneous nuclei to secondary nuclei were investigated. Thioflavin T fluorescence analysis and kinetic equations indicated that two types of nuclei could accelerate WPC fibrillation compared with WPC self-assembling into amyloid fibrils, thereby reducing the lag time and increasing the number of fibrils. However, there were considerable differences in the nucleation-inducing capability of WPC fibrillation between homogeneous and secondary nuclei. The number of fibrils formed by adding homogeneous nuclei was higher than that obtained with secondary nuclei, the increase in the Th T fluorescence intensity induced by homogeneous nuclei was 1.83-fold much than secondary nuclei. Meanwhile, secondary nuclei yielded a 2.71-fold faster aggregation rate of WPC than homogeneous nuclei, particularly during the first hour of thermal treatment (protein mass ratio of nuclei to WPC 1:1). The gelation time of WPC after secondary nuclei addition was shorter, from 10 h (WPC (2.0/6.5)) to 4 h (WPC + HN) to 2 h (WPC + SN); however, the gel microstructure of WPC after the addition of homogeneous nuclei was denser, yielding a preferred water holding capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aequations 3afluorescence 3agelation 3agels 3aheat treatment 3amicrostructure 3awater holding capacity 3awhey protein concentrate 0aWhey protein concentrate 0aHomogeneous nuclei 0aSecondary nuclei 0aFibril 0aGel 0aMicrostructure1 aXu, Hong-Hua1 aXie, Ming-Ming1 aWang, Xin1 aDong, Shi-Rong1 aLi, Tie-Jing1 aYue, Chong-Hui1 aCui, Lin0 tFood research international.g2018 Sept., v. 111 p.556-564dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.05.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014100175300001600316520116400332592002801496650001901524650002701543650001601570650001201586650001401598650001301612650001501625650001601640650001001656650002301666650001001689650002301699650001701722650001001739651001001749653002301759653001001782653001901792653002201811653002201833653001501855653001501870700002901885700005801914700002101972700002801993773011202021856008602133852000902219655001202228IND60597560820221118125034.0190705e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059756082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.05.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouzas-Cid, Yolanda10aInfluence of supplementary irrigation on the amino acid and volatile composition of Godello wines from the Ribeiro Designation of Origin  ap. 715-723.  aConcentrations of amino acids and volatile compounds of a given grapevine cultivar might be altered by inter-annual climate variability and management practices such as irrigation. These compounds determine, in part, aroma and sensory characteristics of wines. The current study aimed at assessing the amino acid profile of musts and wines and the volatile composition of wines from Vitis vinifera (L.) cultivar ‘Godello’ grown in the Ribeiro Designation of Origin (NW Spain) under rain-fed and supplementary irrigation (SI) conditions over three years (2012-2014). Supplementary irrigation increased must titratable acidity. However, must amino acid concentrations were not significantly altered by SI. In contrast, the concentrations of ethyl lactate and geraniol were greater in wines from the SI treatment. Significant correlations between amino acids in musts and volatiles in wines were observed. Our results highlight the low impact of SI on must and wine composition, likely due to the low level of water stress experienced by Godello vines. Understanding the effects of SI on wine properties could aid to adapt management practices in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3aclimate 3acultivars 3ageraniol 3airrigation 3alactic acid 3aodors 3atitratable acidity 3avines 3avolatile compounds 3awater stress 3awines 3aSpain 0aNitrogen compounds 0aAroma 0aClimate change 0aVine water status 0aVitis vinifera L. 0aRibeiro DO 0aWhite wine1 aTrigo-Córdoba, Emiliano1 aFalqué, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4944-12641 aOrriols, Ignacio1 aMirás-Avalos, José M.0 tFood research international.g2018 Sept., v. 111 p.715-723dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.05.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009000166300001300256520072000269592002800989650001401017650001601031650001101047650001401058650001001072650001301082650001201095650001401107650002601121653001401147653001701161653002301178653001501201653001601216653003101232653001501263700001601278700001401294773010401308856005101412852000901463655001201472IND50087064720221118050240.0140412e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008706472DNAL7 a10.1080/03949370.2011.5828872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeraz, L.C.10aPrey selection in a nocturnal web-building spider, Eriophora edax (Araneae Araneidae)  ap. 1-13.  aA field study was conducted to compare hourly captures by nocturnal adult female orb-web spiders (Eriophora edax) and the insect fauna collected at the same time, using a UV light trap. Predation of the spiders is related to the activity patterns of Lepidoptera, since this order of insects was the dominant prey type of E. edax. Also, E. edax showed a positive selection (Ivlev's index of electivity) for Lepidoptera, which means that the spiders showed a selective over-predation of this prey taxon from the pool of insect prey available in the habitat. Based on our results, we suggest that this spider's behaviour might represent an adaptation to the first step in the evolution of a spider-moth specialisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneidae 3aLepidoptera 3aadults 3aevolution 3afauna 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3apredation 3aultraviolet radiation 0aAraneidae 0aweb building 0apredation strategy 0aweb spider 0aLepidoptera 0abehavioural specialisation 0aadaptation1 aHénaut, Y.1 aLegal, L.0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 24, no. 1 p.1-13dTaylor & Francisx1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2011.582887  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245007200207300001800279506007600297520105300373592002801426506003701454650003201491650001501523650001901538650001401557650002001571650001001591650001801601650001201619650001201631650001701643650002301660650002901683700001601712700002001728773017401748856007901922852000902001655001202010IND60172113120221207135230.0150602e20120612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017211312DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11026251082doi7 aPMC33860882pmcid7 a226453392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChopra, Vivek S.10aTranscriptional repression via antilooping in the Drosophila embryo  ap. 9460-9464.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscriptional repressors are thought to inhibit gene expression by interfering with the binding or function of RNA Polymerase II, perhaps by promoting local chromatin condensation. Here, we present evidence for a distinctive mechanism of repression, whereby sequence-specific repressors prevent the looping of distal enhancers to the promoter. Particular efforts focus on the Snail repressor, which plays a conserved role in promoting epithelial-mesenchyme transitions in both invertebrates and vertebrates, including mesoderm invagination in Drosophila , neural crest migration in vertebrates, and tumorigenesis in mammals. Chromosome conformation capture experiments were used to examine enhancer looping at Snail target genes in wild-type and mutant embryos. These studies suggest that the Snail repressor blocks the formation of fruitful enhancer–promoter interactions when bound to a distal enhancer. This higher-order mechanism of transcriptional repression has broad implications for the control of gene activity in metazoan development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aDrosophila 3acarcinogenesis 3achromatin 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainvertebrates 3amammals 3amutants 3aneural crest 3arepressor proteins 3atranscription (genetics)1 aKong, Nikki1 aLevine, Michael0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 June 12, v. 109, no. 24 p.9460-9464dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11026251083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014800167520178200315592002802097650001602125650001302141650002602154650002302180650000902203650001802212650001502230650002502245650001902270650001802289650001702307650003102324650002302355650001502378650002402393650001402417650002102431650001002452650000902462650001302471651001802484653002002502653003202522700002502554700002302579700002402602700005902626773012502685856008302810852000902893655001202902IND60679633420221120135130.0200210e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067963342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2019.1068122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusch, Anna K.12aA high-diversity/IPM cropping system fosters beneficial arthropod populations, limits invertebrate pests, and produces competitive maize yields  aIn the United States, current crop production often favors simplified rotations of maize and soybeans in conjunction with a heavy reliance on synthetic inputs that consequently degrade environmental health and increase production costs, without necessarily improving yields. While often stigmatized as underperforming compared to conventional systems, “sustainable intensification” of cropping systems offers an alternative that relies on crop rotation diversity, continuous crop cover, and integrated pest management to combat pests. Within a long-term no-till systems experiment, our main goal was to determine if a high diversity-IPM system (HiDiv-IPM) could compete with a low diversity-preemptive pest management system (LoDiv-PP) in terms of invertebrate pest management, biological control, and maize establishment and yield. Our results suggest that early-season pests, particularly caterpillars, reduced maize establishment by 10 % in the HiDiv-IPM system compared to the LoDiv-PP system. Both our simple and more diverse rotations suffered from slug damage that reduced crop establishment, however, overall slug abundance and damage tended to be equal. Despite lower seedling establishment and greater caterpillar damage, maize in the HiDiv-IPM rotation yielded similarly to the LoDiv-PP rotation, suggesting that other factors, such as higher levels of predation evident in the more diverse rotation or possible nutrient- and soil quality-related issues, contributed to productivity. These results support the notion that a HiDiv-IPM system can compete with a LoDiv-PP system and, contrary to the most common approach for controlling insects in maize production in the U.S., aggressive, preemptive pest management was not necessary to achieve competitive yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3abeneficial arthropods 3abiological control 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental health 3ainsect control 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect pests 3aintegrated pest management 3amanagement systems 3ano-tillage 3aplant establishment 3apredation 3aproduction costs 3aslugs 3asoil 3asoybeans 3aUnited States 0aNatural enemies 0aSustainable intensification1 aDouglas, Margaret R.1 aMalcolm, Glenna M.1 aKarsten, Heather D.1 aTooker, John F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9303-66990 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 292 p.106812-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.1068123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011000171300001600281520074900297592002801046650000801074650001101082650002201093650002801115650001501143700001501158700002101173773009701194856008601291852000901377655001201386IND60096682920221122022138.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009668292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.06.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, S.M.A.13aAn economic optimization of evaporator and air collector area in a solar assisted heat pump drying system  ap. 377-384.  aThis paper presents an economic optimization of evaporator and air collector area of a solar assisted heat pump drying system. Economic viability of solar heating systems is usually made by comparing the cost flows recurring throughout the lifetime of the solar and conventional alternative systems. Therefore, identification of optimum variables by using a simulation program and an economic analysis based on payback period of the system are presented in this paper. FORTRAN language is used to run the simulation. Effect of load and different economic variables on payback period is also investigated. Economic analysis reveals that system has sufficient amount of savings during the life cycle with a minimum payback period of about 4years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adrying 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic sustainability 3aheat pumps1 aSaidur, R.1 aHawlader, M.N.A.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Dec., v. 76 p.377-384dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.06.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013200155300001800287500001400305520132500319592002801644650002501672650002501697650001601722650001401738650000901752650002101761650001601782650001401798650001801812650001501830650001601845650001501861650000901876650001801885650001201903650001401915650001201929650002901941650001101970650000901981650001801990650001102008650001202019650001102031700001702042700001502059700001702074700001702091700001502108700001602123773012602139856007402265852000902339655001202348IND60711483120221120221634.0200928e20200923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071148312DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo01594f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Liuqin10aMaternal serine supply from late pregnancy to lactation improves offspring performance through modulation of metabolic pathways  ap. 8089-8098.  aNAL-light  aMaternal dietary serine affects free amino acid content in milk and the antioxidant ability of progeny. However, whether maternal dietary serine has any effects on offspring performance in pigs and related metabolic consequences remains unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of different levels of maternal dietary serine from late pregnancy to lactation on sow reproductive performance and offspring performance, and on the metabolome of milk and the serum of sows and their offspring. The results showed that sows fed a diet supplemented with 25% serine of the basal diet (l-Ser) had a higher litter weight, and higher average piglet weight at birth and aged 21 days when compared with sows fed the basal diet (CON). We found a large number of metabolites in both colostrum and milk that differed significantly between sows in the CON and l-Ser groups. Additionally, twenty metabolites differed in the serum of piglets aged 21 days between the CON and l-Ser groups. Most of these metabolites are involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism, glutathione and taurine metabolism, as well as phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, which may contribute to the growth-promoting effects of serine on offspring. Our results imply that maternal serine has the potential to improve offspring outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood serum 3acolostrum 3adiet 3afree amino acids 3aglutathione 3alactation 3alitter weight 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3amilk 3aphospholipids 3apiglets 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3aserine 3asows 3asphingolipids 3asupply 3ataurine 3aweight1 aLiu, Yonghui1 aLong, Jing1 aZhou, Xihong1 aZeng, Sijing1 aLi, Tiejun1 aYin, Yulong0 tFood & function.g2020 Sept. 23, v. 11, no. 9 p.8089-8098dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01594f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009200166300001200258500001900270520131200289592002801601596006601629650002901695650001601724650002101740650002201761650000901783650001501792650001701807650002101824650001601845651001001861700002201871700003301893773015101926856008302077852000902160655001202169IND60702395120221119015907.0201127e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070239512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08496-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Anant10aImpact of anthropogenic activities on the alluvial aquifers of north-east Punjab, India  ap. 527.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn increase in the human population, urbanization, industrialization, infrastructural development, and current agricultural practices acts as major factors leading to the decline of the groundwater table in the region. The present study analyzes the noticeable effect of anthropogenic pressure on the groundwater table in the Bist-Doab region in Punjab, India, from 1996 to 2016. Statistical techniques, viz., Mann-Kendall Z statistics and Sen’s slope, were used to estimate the water table decline in the area. The results indicate that there was a slight increase in the groundwater table in the Kandi belt of Siwalik foothills and south-western parts of the region. In the rest of the areas, a significant declining trend was observed in the groundwater table. The decline in the water table ranged from 56 to 149 cm per year in the pre- and post-monsoon seasons due to increasing in rice cultivated area, which is an alarming situation in the aquifer system of the region. Hence, to reduce the further decline of the groundwater table, water management practices need to be encouraged in the region. There is requiring immediate attention to change the present land-use/cover practices and to grow less water-consuming crops instead of high water-consuming crops to reduce the pressure on groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data  aNot applicablecUniversity Grant Commission, New Delhi, India 3aanthropogenic activities 3agroundwater 3ahuman population 3aindustrialization 3arice 3astatistics 3aurbanization 3awater management 3awater table 3aIndia1 aRai, Suresh Chand1 aRai, S.

Skin lesions appeared like hyperkeratotic papules with coiled hairs and perifollicular hemorrhages. A diagnosis of scurvy was made upon demonstration of low serum levels of ascorbic acid. An allergy evaluation found cross‐reactivity between pollens and food, related to the presence of panallergens. Moreover, we found that our patient was also affected by celiac disease. In conclusion, scurvy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with petechiae and ecchymosis, especially when food restriction, malabsorption, or psychiatric disorders are present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3ablood serum 3aceliac disease 3across reaction 3adiet 3aedema 3ahemorrhage 3ahospitals 3ahypertrophy 3apain 3apatients 3ascurvy1 aPorceddu, Enrica1 aPero, Erika1 aLupascu, Andrea1 aGallo, Antonella1 aDe Simone, Clara1 aNucera, Eleonora1 aAruanno, Arianna1 aGiarretta, Igor1 aPola, Roberto1 aLandolfi, Raffaele0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2021 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.1063-1067dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncp.106163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017500158300001800333500001400351520145000365592002801815650002601843650001601869650002701885650001601912650001901928650002101947650002101968650002101989650001802010650001802028650001002046650002002056650002102076650000902097650001302106650003602119700001402155700001302169700001702182700001802199700001402217700001802231773012602249856007402375852000902449655001202458IND60711483320221120221535.0200928e20200923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071148332DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo01663b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhiqing10aAstaxanthin attenuates oxidative stress and immune impairment in d-galactose-induced aging in rats by activating the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway and suppressing the NF-κB pathway  ap. 8099-8111.  aNAL-light  aAs a potential antioxidant, astaxanthin (AST) exhibits anti-aging effects. However, its relationships to oxidative stress and immunity have yet to be sufficiently investigated. In this research, integrated analysis of oxidative stress and immunosenescence was performed to elucidate the efficacy and potential mechanisms of AST in d-galactose-induced aging in rats. The results showed that AST significantly decreased malonaldehyde (MDA) levels and increased antioxidase activity, in addition to demonstrating the ability to repair histopathological injuries to the liver, thereby attenuating oxidative stress. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression was up-regulated by 117.95%, whereas Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) expression was simultaneously down-regulated by 51.22%. Moreover, AST significantly reduced interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, as well as expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) (p65) and i-kappa-B-alpha (IκBα) proteins. Findings of repair of immune organs, as well as elevated levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), suggest a novel mechanism by which AST could regulate cellular immunity and humoral immunity to attenuate immunosenescence. The anti-aging effects of AST were shown to be due in part to the Nrf2/Keap1 and NF-κB pathways, and AST treatment ameliorated oxidative stress and immune impairment overall.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-aging properties 3aastaxanthin 3acell-mediated immunity 3aexhibitions 3ahistopathology 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3aresearch 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aXiao, Jie1 aLiu, Han1 aYao, Kangfei1 aHou, Xiaoning1 aCao, Yong1 aLiu, Xiaojuan0 tFood & function.g2020 Sept. 23, v. 11, no. 9 p.8099-8111dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01663b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012900164300001600293520146500309592002801774653002401802653002301826653002801849653002501877653001001902653002701912700002001939773014001959856008402099852000902183655001202192IND60126630920221122133031.0151107e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012663092DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-94.2.3972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReed, J.

Bioassay of neonate European corn borer larvae of 16 colonies collected from the midwestern United States indicated LC₅₀ values ranging from 13.2 to 65.1 ng of Cry9C protein per square centimeter. Neonate European corn borer LC₉₀ values ranged from 46.5 to 214 ng/cm². Neonate larvae of three colonies of southwestern corn borer collected from the southern and southwestern United States exhibited LC₅₀ values from 16.9 to 39.9 ng of Cry9C protein per square centimeter. Southwestern corn borer neonate LC₉₀ confidence limit values ranged from 40.3 to 157 ng of Cry9C protein per centimeter. The most sensitive southwestern corn borer colony was collected from the Mississippi delta exhibiting an LC₅₀ value of 22.6 ng of Cry9C per cm² and also displayed the widest LC₉₀ confidence limits of 40.3-94.8 ng of Cry9C per cm². Geographic baseline susceptibility data establishes the natural genetic variation and provides the foundation for future testing of insect populations exposed to increased use of Bacillus thuringiensis-based crops. Insect resistance management and stewardship of Cry9C will rely upon baseline data for the validation of discriminating dose assays for European corn borer and southwestern corn borer.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEuropean corn borer 0aOstrinia nubilalis 0asouthwestern corn borer 0aDiatrea grandiosella 0aCry9C 0aBacillus thuringiensis1 aHalliday, W.

The area of study was an open sea network cage farm where European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), and meagre (Argyrosomus regius) species are cultivated with an annual capacity of 7900 tons in the Bay of Çeşme Ildır (Aegean Sea). Samples of surface and bottom water and sediment were taken seasonally from four stations (three cage and one reference station) between December 2013 and October 2014. The study found that the maximum concentrations of ammonium-nitrogen, phosphate-phosphorus, and nitrite-nitrogen were observed in summer, whereas those of nitrate-nitrogen, silica, and chlorophyll-a increased in spring. In comparison with other studies conducted in the region, the amounts of nutrients, except for silica, were found to be considerably lower. Nonetheless, the values of silica and phosphate-phosphorus exceeded the limits for clean seawater. There has been no similar study conducted in recent years due to increased aquaculture capacity in this bay.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014-1-TEZ-44cİzmir Katip Çelebi University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit 3aArgyrosomus regius 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aSparus aurata 3aammonium nitrogen 3acages 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3aelectrical conductivity 3afish farms 3amarine fish 3anitrate nitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphosphate phosphorus 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asediments 3asilica 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3aAegean Sea1 aKaraduman, Fatma Rabia0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Aug., v. 192, no. 8 p.528-528dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08487-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245006600163300001400229520124900243592002801492650001001520650001801530650001501548650001501563650001801578650001001596653002801606653001701634653002401651653001601675653001401691700001801705700001301723700001801736700001701754700001301771773010501784856005101889852000901940655001201949IND50087065020221118050132.0140412e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008706502DNAL7 a10.1080/03949370.2011.5878342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, C.10aNutcrackers become choosy seed harvesters in a mast-crop year  ap. 54-61.  aAs an efficient seed-disperser, Eurasian nutcrackers (Nucifraga caryocatactes) generally consume and hoard mature, edible pine seeds for future use. In 2009, when the Arolla pine, Pinus. cembra, produced a mast-crop, we investigated cones discarded by nutcrackers. Most cones were only partly eaten and some mature seeds remained in the distal part. This was in contrast to years of lower seed production when nearly all seeds were harvested from the majority of cones. To determine whether nutcracker cone-discarding behaviour maximised intake rate, seed kernels and the aborted seeds rate were measured from the different cone parts. In 2009, seeds from cone-tops were on average 17% lighter than in the base and middle sections, and the proportion of aborted seeds in the top part was 81% higher than in the other sections. There was no difference in seed mass and proportion of aborted seeds in cone-tops of intact cones and cones handled by nutcrackers. Regarding each cone as a patch, cone discarding behaviour can be considered as an optimal cone-leaving rule, maximising rate of energy-intake, supporting the Marginal Value Theorem. Hence, we suggest that increased food abundance leads to more selective seed harvesting in nutcrackers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aenergy intake 3aharvesters 3aharvesting 3aseed abortion 3aseeds 0aNucifraga caryocatactes 0aPinus cembra 0apartial consumption 0apatch model 0amast-crop1 aWauters, L.A.1 aRong, K.1 aMartinoli, A.1 aPreatoni, D.1 aTosi, G.0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 24, no. 1 p.54-61dTaylor & Francisx1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2011.587834  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011400165300001600279500001500295520159100310592002801901650001801929650001101947650001101958650001401969650002601983650001402009650002202023650001402045650001602059650001302075651001002088653001702098700001802115700002902133700002102162773010202183856008102285990002302366852000902389655001202398IND60096182220221120144849.0141104e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009618222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2010.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalma, Sergio10aSeasonal and vertical distributional patterns of siphonophores and medusae in the Chiloé Interior Sea, Chile  ap. 260-271.  a2019-12-06  aThe horizontal and vertical distribution of jellyfish was assessed in the Chiloé Inland sea, in the northern area of the Chilean Patagonia. A total of 41 species of cnidarians (8 siphonophores, 31 hydromedusae, 2 scyphomedusae) were collected. Eleven jellyfish species were recorded for the first time in the area. Species richness was higher in spring than in winter (37 vs. 25 species, respectively). Species such as Muggiaea atlantica, Solmundella bitentaculata, and Clytia simplex were extremely abundant in spring. The total abundance (408,157ind 1000m⁻³) was 18 times higher in spring than in winter (22,406ind 1000m⁻³). The horizontal distribution of the most abundant species (four in winter, five in spring) showed decreasing abundances in the north–south direction in winter and spring. Peak abundances occurred in the northern microbasins (Reloncaví Fjord, Reloncaví and Ancud gulfs), where the water column stability, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance were higher, compared with the southern microbasins (Corcovado Gulf, Boca del Guafo). During the spring higher jellyfish abundance season, the vertical distribution of the dominant species (except M. atlantica) showed peak values at mid-depth (30–50m) and in the deepest sampled layer (50–200m). This vertical distribution pattern reduced seaward transport in the shallowest layer through estuarine circulation and also limited mortality by predation in the more illuminated shallow layers. Thus, jellyfish were able to remain in the interior waters during the season of maximum biological production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphytoplankton 3awinter 3aspring 3aScyphozoa 3abiological production 3apredation 3aspecies diversity 3amortality 3azooplankton 3aHydrozoa 3aChile 0aHydromedusae1 aSilva, Nelson1 aCristina Retamal, María1 aCastro, Leonardo0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 31, no. 3-4 p.260-271dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2010.04.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017200169300001600341520157200357592002801929650001801957650001201975650001701987650001802004650001602022650001602038650001602054650001802070650001902088650001602107650001102123650002002134650001302154650001702167650001902184650001802203650002302221650001002244650001002254650004202264650003302306650002902339650000702368650003302375650001802408650001802426650001802444653000902462653001702471653003102488653002402519700005502543700001702598700001402615700001302629700001802642700001502660773011202675856008602787852000902873655001202882IND60597561020221118125051.0190705e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059756102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.05.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZang, Jinhong10aDynamics and diversity of microbial community succession during fermentation of Suan yu, a Chinese traditional fermented fish, determined by high throughput sequencing  ap. 565-573.  aThe main goal of this study was to investigate the dynamics, diversity and succession of microbial community present during the preparation of Suan yu (fermented fish), with and without starter cultures by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS1 genes. Firmicutes and Ascomycota were the predominant phyla of bacteria and fungi, respectively, in all samples. At the genus level, Lactobacillus, Macrococcus and Staphylococcus were the predominating bacteria throughout the fermentation process, regardless of the inclusion of starter cultures. Saccharomyces was the predominating fungal genus in the early-fermentation stage of samples that inoculated starter cultures (MS), while the final product was dominated by Candida and Wickerhamomyces. Compared with naturally-fermented samples (NS; no starter cultures), Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Vibrio, Fusicolla and Torulaspora were inhibited and Aureobasidium emerged in samples inoculated with starter cultures (P < .05). Unweighted pair-group and principal component analyses of bacterial and fungal compositions revealed that microbiota structures differed between NS and MS samples. Redundancy analysis indicated that water content and pH might be important factors influencing the dominant bacterial and fungal community. Results indicated that microbial community were dynamic during fermentation process and the inoculation of mixed starter culture inhibited the growth of many organisms associated with food spoilage and contributed to the improvement of the quality of Suan yu products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAureobasidium 3aCandida 3aEnterococcus 3aLactobacillus 3aLactococcus 3aLeuconostoc 3aMacrococcus 3aSaccharomyces 3aStaphylococcus 3aTorulaspora 3aVibrio 3aWickerhamomyces 3abacteria 3afermentation 3afermented fish 3afood spoilage 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amultiple strain starters 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3awater content 0aFish 0aFermentation 0aHigh-throughput sequencing 0aMicrobial community1 aXu, Yanshun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1724-94811 aXia, Wenshui1 aYu, Dawei1 aGao, Pei1 aJiang, Qixing1 aYang, Fang0 tFood research international.g2018 Sept., v. 111 p.565-573dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.05.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016800169300001600337520215900353592002802512650001402540650002502554650002102579650001402600650001502614650001902629650001402648650001402662650001102676650001202687650001702699650001602716650001802732700001802750700001602768700001602784700001502800700001702815773009702832856008602929852000903015655001203024IND60096683220221122002551.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009668322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalash, S.M.10aState of the art of NOₓ mitigation technologies and their effect on the performance and emission characteristics of biodiesel-fueled Compression Ignition engines  ap. 400-420.  aBiodiesel fuels have the potential to become a reliable substitute for diesel which is used moderately to meet the current energy demands. This fuel can be produced from new or used vegetable oils, non-edible sources and animal fats, which are non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable. In spite of the many advantages of using biodiesel, most of the researchers have reported that they produce higher NOₓ emissions compared to diesel, which is a deterrent to the market expansion of these fuels. In this study, the different paths to reduce NOₓ emissions from diesel engines by applying several technologies, such as using additives into fuel, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), water injection (WI), emulsion technology (ET), injection timing retardation (ITR), simultaneous technology (ST) and low temperature combustion (LTC) mode are reviewed briefly. The impacts of different NOₓ mitigation technologies on biodiesel-fueled diesel engine performance and emissions are also analyzed critically and different methods of their implementation are shown. This paper also provides a comparison of different NOₓ mitigation technologies based on previous articles related to this topic. From this comparative study, it was found that the average reduction of NOₓ emissions by using additives, EGR, WI & ET, ITR, ST and LTC are in the ranges 4–45%, 26–84%, 10–38%, 9.77–37%, 22–95% and 66–93% respectively, compared to biodiesel combustion without applying technologies. However, the average reduction of NOₓ emissions by using those technologies for biodiesel are reasonable, 36–46%, 3–34%, 21–37%, 33–92% and 8.68–70% respectively, when compared to diesel. The results of this paper show that using new NOₓ mitigation technology, such as LTC, is more efficient and promising than the others because of its having the capability to reduce both NOₓ and particulate matter (PM) emissions simultaneously without significant penalties with regard to engine performance. However, applying this technology has increased CO and HC emissions in several cases due to the reduction in their oxidation rates in the combustion chamber.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aanimal fats and oils 3abiodegradability 3abiodiesel 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3amarkets 3aparticulates 3atemperature 3avegetable oil1 aMasjuki, H.H.1 aKalam, M.A.1 aMasum, B.M.1 aSanjid, A.1 aAbedin, M.J.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Dec., v. 76 p.400-420dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245005200171300001600223520123000239592002801469650001501497650002501512650001201537650001101549650001701560650001701577650002101594650001501615650002301630650002301653650001101676650002901687650001001716650001701726650001001743650001201753653001801765653001101783653001101794653001701805653000901822773009901831856008501930852000902015655001202024IND60568169720221121075229.0190416e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056816972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoulter, John E.12aA physical economic model of ecosystem services  ap. 195-200.  aTo make full use of the power of economics, ecosystem services accounting can show how work done can be understood from the carbon cycle and compared with the economic actions represented in the Circular Flow of the Macroeconomy. The comparison is useful in fitting data from both fields on the one spreadsheet to assist in economic and environmental management. This requires some review of concepts originally formed before the industrial revolution discoveries of modern science. Though labor and capital are conventionally considered as distinct, the concept of “work” is shown in a simple case study to be a unifying concept derived from the factor, “force” which may be biological or mechanical, almost invariably fueled in purposive action by the combustion of a carbohydrate (food or organic fuel) or hydrocarbons. Adapting from Odum’s “fractal cascade” of usable energy, 30,000 solar photons pass through a hierarchy of 5 phases to deliver work done by the breaking 2 carbon-hydrogen bonds. For the Earth in 2015 the increase in broken C–H bonds over those reconstituted naturally was 18×1038, emphasizing a unidirectional trend to higher costs, rather than any hoped-for recovery of business cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3abusiness enterprises 3acapital 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acase studies 3achemical bonding 3acombustion 3aeconometric models 3aecosystem services 3aemergy 3aenvironmental management 3afuels 3ahydrocarbons 3alabor 3aphotons 0aChemical bond 0aOxygen 0aCarbon 0aCarbon cycle 0aWork0 tEcosystem services.g2017 June, v. 25 p.195-200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003300149245013000182300001300312520195500325592002802280650002802308650002102336650001202357650002602369650002102395650001602416650002602432650002602458650001402484650000702498650002202505650001902527650001402546650002002560650000902580650001802589650002102607650002502628651001102653653001702664653002802681653002002709653001402729653002502743700003002768700002202798700002802820700003002848700001902878700003102897700003002928773011002958856008403068852000903152655001203161IND60526290020221120065042.0201125e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052629002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorin, José Bernardo Moraes10aSoil solution chemical attributes, rice response and water use efficiency under different flood irrigation management methods  ap. 9-17.  aThe water availability is the main limiting factor of global rice production under flood irrigation. In this context, water suppression during the rice growing cycle (intermittent irrigation) arises as an alternative to traditional continuous irrigation. However, the intermittent irrigation may affect the dynamics of soil solution chemical attributes, the water use and the rice yield. Thus, our study aims to evaluate the electrochemical characteristics and nutrient availability in soil solution during the growing cycle, the plant response and the water use efficiency of irrigated rice under different flood irrigation management methods. For this, a field experiment was conducted in Southern Brazil, with three treatments: 1) continuous irrigation; 2) one water suppression (between V6–V8); and 3) two water suppressions (between V6–V8 and V8–V10). Regarding soil solution electrochemistry, the pH and redox potential (EH) were affected by the water suppression, increasing and decreasing due to soil reoxidation, respectively. The electrical conductivity (EC) decreased during the rice growing cycle, accompanying the plant development. The nutrients (except the potassium) were affected by water suppression, diminishing their availability. However, when the water layer was reestablished, there were no differences on soil solution electrochemistry among the irrigation methods. Regarding rice response, no differences were observed and the amounts produced were, in average, 9.9 and 13.4Mgha⁻¹ of grains and shoot dry matter, respectively. The same occurred for the water amount utilized and water use efficiency (WUE) and the values observed were, in average, 9094m³ha⁻¹ and 1.1kgm⁻³, respectively. More studies regarding different flood irrigation management methods are necessary to encourage the adoption of intermittent irrigation by rice farmers of Southern Brazil and increase the sustainability of rice production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3afarmers 3afield experimentation 3aflood irrigation 3agrain yield 3airrigation scheduling 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3apH 3aplant development 3aplant response 3apotassium 3aredox potential 3arice 3asoil solution 3asurge irrigation 3awater use efficiency 3aBrazil 0aOryza sativa 0aIntermittent irrigation 0aEletrochemistry 0aNutrients 0aWater use efficiency1 aCarmona, Felipe de Campos1 aAnghinoni, Ibanor1 aMartins, Amanda Posselt1 aJaeger, Isadora Rodrigues1 aMarcolin, Elio1 aHernandes, Gustavo Cantori1 aCamargo, Estefânia Silva0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Oct., v. 176 p.9-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008200170520122600252592002801478650002301506650002001529650002301549650001101572653001901583653003501602653002301637653002901660700002401689700006001713773012101773856008301894852000901977655001201986IND60679633820221120161422.0200128e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067963382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2019.1068952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHušková, Marie,10aTests for validity of the semiparametric heteroskedastic transformation model  aThere exist a number of tests for assessing the nonparametric heteroskedastic location-scale assumption. The goodness-of-fit tests considered are for the more general hypothesis of the validity of this model under a parametric functional transformation on the response variable, specifically testing for independence between the regressors and the errors in a model where the transformed response is just a location/scale shift of the error is considered. The proposed criteria use the familiar factorization property of the joint characteristic function under independence. The difficulty is that the errors are unobserved and hence one needs to employ properly estimated residuals in their place. The limit distribution of the test statistics is studied under the null hypothesis as well as under alternatives, and also a resampling procedure is suggested in order to approximate the critical values of the tests. This resampling is subsequently employed in a series of Monte Carlo experiments that illustrate the finite-sample properties of the new test. The performance of related test statistics for normality and symmetry of errors is also investigated, and application of our methods on real data sets is provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3adata collection 3aheteroskedasticity 3amodels 0aBootstrap test 0aHeteroskedastic transformation 0aIndependence model 0aNonparametric regression1 aMeintanis, Simos G.1 aPretorius, Charl1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6165-28680 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2020 Apr., v. 144 p.106895-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2019.1068953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245008700183300001600270520104700286592002801333653001901361653002201380653002601402653002301428700001701451700002101468700001301489773014001502856008401642852000901726655001201735IND60126631220221121183626.0151107e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012663122DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-94.2.4392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermoso de mendoza, A.

Clementine yield loss was correlated with the number of aphids per square meter of canopy, obtaining the corresponding formula. Starting from this formula, the economic injury level (EIL) was calculated as follows: [[218,333C ++ 11,130.6 ·· VP₀K]]/[[57.08 ·· VP₀K −− 100C]] == EIL (aphids/m²), where C == total insecticide cost per hectare, V == fruit price per kilogram, P₀ == yield per hectare of a minimum pest level orchard, and K == reduction of injury due to treatment. Starting from the EIL, the economic threshold, the environmental EIL, and the environmental economic threshold were obtained. Formulae relating the number of aphids per square meter with other simpler indices expressing these thresholds (percentage of infested shoots, infested shoots per 0.25 m² ring, index of infestation, percentage of occupied rings, and number of weekly captured aphids in a yellow trap) also were calculated.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAphis gossypii 0aCitrus clementina 0aeconomic injury level 0aeconomic threshold1 aBelliure, B.1 aCarbonell, E.

The physicochemical properties were recognized, proving the well-aligned presence of SmVO₄/CNF. The samples obtained were tested for electrochemical studies as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), determining the lower resistance resulting in higher conductivity with Rct at 53 Ω. Prospective enhancement was observed for SmVO₄/CNF/GCE with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) towards isoniazid electrochemical detection. The effective active surface area was calculated to be 0.155 cm⁻² for SmVO₄/CNF/GCE being two times larger than bare GCE with CV analysis. A lower detection limit of about 0.005 μM and a limit of quantification of about 0.0198 μM were significantly recognized with the linear range of about 0.09−800 μM as obtained by DPV analysis. Coexisting materials with ISZ had no interactions establishing excellent selectivity among interfering molecules. Biological and pharmaceutical samples exposed for real-time studies with an effective recovery range. Thus, collecting all these results will be a useful sensor being fabricated with SmVO₄/CNF for synergetic detection of ISZ in real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanofibers 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aisoniazid 3ananospheres 3asamarium 3asurface area 3avoltammetry 0aBimetallic composite 0aCarbon nanofiber 0aAntituberculosis drug 0aBiological samples 0aPharmaceutical sample1 aChen, Shen-Ming0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 May 20, v. 617 p.126385-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1263853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010100167300001400268520091300282592002801195650000901223650001401232650002001246650001801266650001101284650001701295700001901312773009501331856008601426852000901512655001201521IND60096683420221122033859.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009668342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTargui, N.10aAnalysis of a double pipe heat exchanger performance by use of porous baffles and pulsating flow  ap. 43-54.  aA numerical investigation is carried out to analyze the effect of porous baffles and flow pulsation on a double pipe heat exchanger performance. The hot fluid flows in the inner cylinder, whereas the cold fluid circulates in the annular gap. The Darcy–Brinkman–Forchheimer model is adopted to describe the flow in the porous regions and the finite volume method is used to solve the governing equations with the appropriate boundary conditions. The effects of the amplitude and frequency of pulsation, as well as the porous baffles permeability on the flow structure and the heat exchanger efficiency are analyzed. The results reveal that the addition of an oscillating component to the mean flow affects the flow structure, and enhances the heat transfer in comparison to the steady non pulsating flow. The highest heat exchanger performance is obtained when only the flow of the hot fluid is pulsating.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aequations 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3apermeability1 aKahalerras, H.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Dec., v. 76 p.43-54dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245014300156500001900299520146900318592002801787650002001815650001601835650001501851650002001866650001501886650002401901650001701925651001001942700002001952700002001972700001601992700001802008700002202026700001402048773016002062856007602222852000902298655001202307IND60729304620221120064937.0210228e20210220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072930462DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi100200932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Wei 12aA Novel Hybrid Method for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping-Based GeoDetector and Machine Learning Cluster: A Case of Xiaojin County, China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLandslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) could be an effective way to prevent landslide hazards and mitigate losses. The choice of conditional factors is crucial to the results of LSM, and the selection of models also plays an important role. In this study, a hybrid method including GeoDetector and machine learning cluster was developed to provide a new perspective on how to address these two issues. We defined redundant factors by quantitatively analyzing the single impact and interactive impact of the factors, which was analyzed by GeoDetector, the effect of this step was examined using mean absolute error (MAE). The machine learning cluster contains four models (artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian network (BN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM)) and automatically selects the best one for generating LSM. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, prediction accuracy, and the seed cell area index (SCAI) methods were used to evaluate these methods. The results show that the SVM model had the best performance in the machine learning cluster with the area under the ROC curve of 0.928 and with an accuracy of 83.86%. Therefore, SVM was chosen as the assessment model to map the landslide susceptibility of the study area. The landslide susceptibility map demonstrated fit with landslide inventory, indicated the hybrid method is effective in screening landslide influences and assessing landslide susceptibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3ainventories 3alandslides 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aspatial data 3aChina1 aLi, Xiaoshuang 1 aChien, Wen-pin,1 aYang, Yang 1 aLiu, Hongwei 1 aRobledo, Luis  F.1 aNie, Wen 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100200933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245006900210520124100279592002801520650002401548650001801572650001801590653001601608653001701624653001901641653002201660653001701682653003001699700002101729700002101750773012101771856008301892852000901975655001201984IND60679633920221120161420.0200128e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067963392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2019.1069032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrar, Solomon W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6802-340X10aNonparametric procedures for partially paired data in two groups  aA fully nonparametric method is developed for comparing samples with partially paired data. Partially-paired (correlated) data naturally arise, for example, as a result of missing values, in incomplete block designs or meta analysis. In the nonparametric setup, treatment effects are characterized in terms of functionals of distribution functions and the only assumption needed is that the marginal distributions are non-degenerate. The setup accommodates binary, ordered categorical, discrete and continuous data in a seamless fashion. The use of nonparametric effects addresses the Behrens–Fisher problem from the nonparametric point of view and allows construction of confidence intervals. Although the nonparametric methods are mainly asymptotic, methods for small sample approximations are also proposed. Size and power simulation results show numerical evidence of favorable performance of the nonparametric methods. The new nonparametric method has overwhelming power advantage when treatment effects are in the shape of the distributions and they perform comparably well with parametric methods for location-type alternatives. Data from randomized trials in public health are used to illustrate the application of the method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3ameta-analysis 3apublic health 0aInteraction 0aMissing data 0aNonparametrics 0aPaired comparison 0aRank methods 0aRelative treatment effect1 aFeyasa, Merga B.1 aEshetu Wencheko,0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2020 Apr., v. 144 p.106903-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2019.1069033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245017000168520180100338592002802139650000802167650001602175650001502191650001302206650001102219650001002230650002402240700001602264700001302280700001502293773013302308856008402441852000902525655001202534IND60783920420221119173258.0220726e20220708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078392042DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120709862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shuzhen 10aResearch on Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm for Cooperative Harvesting Trajectory Optimization of an Intelligent Multiarm Straw-Rotting Fungus Harvesting Robot  aIn view of the difficulties of fruit cluster identification, the specific harvesting sequence constraints of aggregated fruits, and the balanced harvesting task assignment for the multiple arms with a series-increasing symmetric shared (SISS) region, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization algorithm, which combines genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) stepwise, to optimize the multiarm cooperative harvesting trajectory of straw-rotting fungus to effectively improve the harvesting efficiency and the success rate of non-destructive harvesting. In this approach, firstly, the multiarm trajectory optimization problem is abstracted as a multiple travelling salesman problem (MTSP). Secondly, an improved local density clustering algorithm is designed to identify the cluster fruits to prepare data for harvesting aggregated fruits in a specific order later. Thirdly, the MTSP has been decomposed into M independent TSP (traveling salesman problem) problems by using GA, in which a new DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) assignment rule is designed to resolve the problem of the average distribution of multiarm harvesting tasks with the SISS region. Then, the improved ant colony algorithm, combined with the auction mechanism, is adopted to achieve the shortest trajectory of each arm, which settles the difficulty that the clustered mature fruits should be harvested in a specified order. The experiments show that it can search for a relatively stable optimal solution in a relatively short time. The average harvesting efficiency is up to 1183 pcs/h and the average harvesting success rate is about 97%. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can better plan the harvesting trajectory for multiarm intelligent harvesting, especially for areas with many aggregated fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aagriculture 3aalgorithms 3aauctions 3afruits 3afungi 3asystem optimization1 aJia, Bocai 1 aYu, Tao 1 aYuan, Jin 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 July 08, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120709863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011500160500001900275520123400294592002801528650001501556650002501571650001401596650001601610650001501626650001401641650000901655650001701664650001501681650001501696651002101711700001601732700002701748700001901775700001901794700002301813700002001836700001701856773011901873856007701992852000902069655001202078IND60735110320221121034033.0210423e20210326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073511032DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100407112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Yujin 10aUnique Metabolic Profiles of Korean Rice According to Polishing Degree, Variety, and Geo-Environmental Factors  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe precise determination of the chemical composition in crops is important to identify their nutritional and functional value. The current study performed a systematic delineation of the rice metabolome, an important staple in Asia, to investigate the following: (1) comparative features between brown and white rice; (2) variety-specific composition (Ilpum vs. Odae); and (3) cultivation of region-dependent metabolic content. Global metabolic profiling and data-driven statistics identified the exclusive enrichment of compounds in brown rice compared to white rice. Next, the authors investigated a variety-governed metabolic phenotype among various geo-environmental factors. Odae, the early-ripening cultivar, showed higher contents of most chemicals compared to the late-ripening cultivar, Ilpum. The authors identified regional specificity for cultivation among five areas in Korea which were characterized by polishing degree and cultivar type. Finally, the current study proposes a possible linkage of the region-specific metabolic signatures to soil texture and total rainfall. In addition, we found tryptophan metabolites that implied the potential for microbe–host interactions that may influence crop metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrown rice 3achemical composition 3acultivars 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3aphenotype 3arain 3asoil texture 3astatistics 3atryptophan 3aKorean Peninsula1 aLee, Bo  Mi1 aYi, Ŭn-mic(Composer)1 aKim, Chang-ho,1 aSeo, Jeong-Ah 1 aChoi, Hyung-Kyoon 1 aKim, Yŏng-suk,1 aLee, Do  Yup0 tFoods.g2021 Mar. 26, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100407113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011000173300001600283520120600299592002801505653002201533653001801555653001501573653001601588700002601604700002501630700002701655773012201682856008401804852000901888655001201897IND60126631520221121183728.0151107e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012663152DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-94.2.4552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoucher, Thomas Jude10aEffect of Trap Position, Habitat, and Height on the Capture of Pepper Maggot Flies (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 455-461.  aTrapping results indicate that pepper maggot, Zonosemata electa (Say), flies occupy tree canopies adjacent to fields when not on host plants. Several in- and near-field trap positions were used to find a reliable monitoring system for adult pepper maggots. Traps baited with liquid ammonium hydroxide (Stills-style trap), hung in the canopy of trees on the edges of pepper fields, caught significantly more Z. electa flies than when positioned lower along the treeline or in the field. In a second experiment, significantly more pepper maggot flies were captured in sugar maples compared with choke cherry trees, which indicates a pest preference for certain nonhost habitats. The lowest trap height tested (2.1 m) failed to capture Z. electa flies in either tree species when the pest population level was low. These studies demonstrated that pepper maggot flies can be reliably detected with Stills-style traps positioned at ≈≈6.4 m height within the canopy of sugar maple trees adjacent to pepper fields. Fruit oviposition scars also are useful site-specific indicators of pepper maggot presence/absence and may aid in determining if insecticide applications are necessary and in timing sprays.  aPublisher supplied data 0aZonosemata electa 0apepper maggot 0amonitoring 0aTephritidae1 aAshley, Richard Allan1 aAdams, Roger Gilbert1 aMorris, Thomas Francis0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2001 Apr., v. 94, no. 2 p.455-461dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-94.2.4553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010000172300001600272500001500288520111400303592002801417650001801445650002001463650001601483650001301499650001201512650002801524650001201552650001601564650001001580650001401590653002301604653002201627653002201649653001601671773010701687856005101794852000901845655001201854IND50087065720221118050408.0140412e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008706572DNAL7 a10.1080/03949370.2011.6162282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosicki, Jakub Z.10aEffect of weather conditions on nestling survival in the White Stork Ciconia ciconia population  ap. 140-148.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper presents how weather conditions affect survival of White Stork Ciconia ciconia nestlings. The main goals of the present study are to determine the most critical period for breeding output and to investigate factors influencing reproductive efficiency of the studied population. The mean survival rate of the whole nesting period (day 52 from egg laying to day 20 of nestlings life) was 0.668 (95% CL: 0.611–0.725) and did not differ between years, while mean survival for incubation period was 0.721 (0.681–0.761) and also was not significantly different between years. Finally, the mean survival rate for the nestling period was 0.903 (0.869–0.937) and was different between years.This study shows that the most critical period in the breeding cycle is the time of incubation and the first days of the nestling's life. The period from egg laying to day 20 of the nestling's life is characterised by the highest hazard ratio. Finally, the study demonstrates that, like many other bird species, White Stork nestlings' survival is affected by low temperatures and a high level of precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3asurvival rate 3aCiconia ciconia 3aoviposition 3abreeding 3aweather 3areproductive efficiency 3anesting 3atemperature 3abirds 3anestlings 0aweather conditions 0anestling survival 0aincubation period 0aWhite Stork0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 24, no. 2 p.140-148dTaylor & Francisx1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2011.616228  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009700171300002000268520110800288592002801396650002201424650002501446650001401471650001301485650002301498650002801521650002701549650001501576700001901591773015501610856008301765852000901848655001201857IND60786049120221120133119.0220802e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078604912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19458-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehera, Puspanjali10aNexus between environment regulation, FDI, and green technology innovation in OECD countries  ap. 52940-52953.  aTo achieve the goal of “sustainable development,” a crucial way is promoting green technology innovation. This paper examines the nexus between environment regulation, FDI, and green technology innovation in OECD countries from 1998 to 2018. The study uses a pooled mean group, random effect model, and GMM model to analyze the relationship empirically. A Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causal test also tests the causal relationship between variables. The result indicates that environment regulation significantly relates to green technology innovation and encourages the economy to adopt green technology innovation. This result further explained FDI exerts a negative effect on green technology innovation. The findings suggest that there is a need to execute a proper effective environmental policy, especially concerning FDI, to gain the spillover effect on promoting green technology in the host country, specifically in OECD countries. This study provides policy implications to effectively formulate environmental regulation and FDI inflow to gain technology spillover to promote green technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental policy 3apollution 3aresearch 3astatistical models 3asustainable development 3asustainable technology 3atechnology1 aSethi, Narayan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 July, v. 29, no. 35 p.52940-52953dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19458-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245012200206300001600328520099100344592002801335650001701363650001201380650001201392651001401404651001001418651001001428653002201438653002001460653001601480653002501496653003701521700001601558700002001574700001501594700001401609773011601623856008301739852000901822655001201831IND60526290520221120073702.0190403e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052629052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Xiaoping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7300-754010aDevelopment of a water transfer compensation classification: A case study between China, Japan, America and Australia  ap. 151-157.  aThe compensation mechanism for agricultural water transfer (CMAWT) is an important method for reducing or eliminating the negative effects of agricultural water transfer. Summarizing global CMAWT experiences is important to set up a reasonable CMAWT in China. In this study, a classification theory for CMAWT is established to evaluate the CMAWT of China, Japan, America, and Australia. Results showed that China’s CMAWT is converting from the bureaucratic to the market type. Japan’s CMAWT is mainly the autonomous type. CMAWT of America and Australia are market type. Water transfer market in Australia is more sophisticated among the comparison countries. Government of China and Japan participated more in the agricultural water transfer than the government of America and Australia. Farmers participated least in agricultural water transfer in China than in other compared countries. The case study showed that the proposed theory can classify the CMAWT of different countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3afarmers 3amarkets 3aAustralia 3aChina 3aJapan 0aBureaucratic form 0aAutonomous form 0aMarket form 0aCompensation methods 0aAnalytic hierarchy process (AHP)1 aHan, Yuping1 aZhang, Xiaohong1 aChen, Jing1 aLi, Daoxi0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 182 p.151-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012000165300001600285520124900301592002801550650000901578650001101587650001601598650001001614650001401624650002101638650001001659651001001669653001801679653002501697653002101722653002801743700001101771773010701782856005101889852000901940655001201949IND50087065920221118050438.0140412e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008706592DNAL7 a10.1080/03949370.2011.6245522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, W.B.10aVariation in mating patterns in the Andrew's toad Bufo andrewsi along an elevational gradient in southwestern China  ap. 174-186.  aThe mating pattern in animals is regarded as a consequence of sexual selection of phenotypic characters, and variations in sexual selection strength will result in different mating patterns. In view of this, we studied variation in mating patterns in the Andrew's toad Bufo andrewsi across five elevation populations (range = 1000–2100 m) in southwestern China. The results showed that there was a high male-biased operational sex ratio in all populations. Mean adult male SVL differed significantly among localities and amplexus conditions, showing a significant among-locality difference in large male advantage. Mean age of adult males differed among localities and mating status, suggesting an old-male mating advantage for all populations. A significant age-assortative mating pattern was only observed in the 2100-m site. There were significant among-locality differences in large or old-male advantage and size or old-assortative patterns. Among the sites, the operational sex ratios were positively correlated with size ratios of males (amplectant SVL/non-amplectant SVL), but not age ratios of males (amplectant age/non-amplectant age). The strength of size-assortative mating did not increase with increasing operational sex ratios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBufo 3aadults 3acorrelation 3amales 3asex ratio 3asexual selection 3atoads 3aChina 0aAndrew's toad 0aelevational gradient 0asexual selection 0asize-assortative mating1 aLu, X.0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 24, no. 2 p.174-186dTaylor & Francisx1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2011.624552  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245008700205300001800292506007600310520126900386592002801655506003701683650001201720650001201732650001501744650001901759650002001778650003601798650001701834650001601851650000901867650001301876650001101889650001401900650002001914650001901934653001701953653001601970653001101986653003101997700002202028700001902050700003102069700002302100700002402123700002702147700002602174700002002200700002502220700003202245700002402277700002402301773017402325856007902499852000902578655001202587IND60172114320221207131941.0150602e20120612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017211432DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11190381092doi7 aPMC33860592pmcid7 a226476002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArranz, Alicia10aAkt1 and Akt2 protein kinases differentially contribute to macrophage polarization  ap. 9517-9522.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aActivated macrophages are described as classically activated or M1 type and alternatively activated or M2 type, depending on their response to proinflammatory stimuli and the expression of genetic markers including iNOS, arginase1, Ym1, and Fizz1. Here we report that Akt kinases differentially contribute to macrophage polarization, with Akt1 ablation giving rise to an M1 and Akt2 ablation resulting in an M2 phenotype. Accordingly, Akt2 ⁻/⁻ mice were more resistant to LPS-induced endotoxin shock and to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis than wild-type mice, whereas Akt1 ⁻/⁻ mice were more sensitive. Cell depletion and reconstitution experiments in a DSS-induced colitis model confirmed that the effect was macrophage-dependent. Gene-silencing studies showed that the M2 phenotype of Akt2 ⁻/⁻ macrophages was cell autonomous. The microRNA miR-155, whose expression was repressed in naive and in LPS-stimulated Akt2 ⁻/⁻ macrophages, and its target C/EBPβ appear to play a key role in this process. C/EBPβ, a hallmark of M2 macrophages that regulates Arg1, was up-regulated upon Akt2 ablation or silencing. Overexpression or silencing of miR-155 confirmed its central role in Akt isoform-dependent M1/M2 polarization of macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acolitis 3adextran 3aendotoxins 3agene silencing 3agenetic markers 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amice 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aprotein kinases 3asodium sulfate 0ainflammation 0aperitonitis 0asepsis 0ainflammatory bowel disease1 aDoxaki, Christina1 aVergadi, Eleni1 aMartinez de la Torre, Yeny1 aVaporidi, Katerina1 aLagoudaki, Eleni D.1 aIeronymaki, Eleftheria1 aAndroulidaki, Ariadne1 aVenihaki, Maria1 aMargioris, Andrew N.1 aStathopoulos, Efstathios N.1 aTsichlis, Philip N.1 aTsatsanis, Christos0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 June 12, v. 109, no. 24 p.9517-9522dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11190381093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011100163300001600274500002000290520176400310592002802074650003102102650002002133650001802153650001402171650001502185650001102200650001902211650002102230650002302251650001902274650002002293650002502313650002102338650000902359700005502368700002102423700006102444700001902505700002202524700006102546700002102607773013002628856007402758852000902832655001202841IND60788547020221119030731.0220815e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078854702DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.107472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Daniel T.10aRecommendations for photoprotection of parenteral nutrition for premature infants: An ASPEN position paper  ap. 927-941.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough crucial in improving health outcomes in the preterm infants, parenteral nutrition (PN) is not without risk, especially if handled improperly. A growing body of evidence suggests that components of PN admixtures, including lipid injectable emulsions (ILEs), are susceptible to degradation, including oxidation when exposed to light (ie, photo‐oxidation), resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species. Infants, especially those born preterm, are considered more susceptible to consequences of oxidative stress than children and adults. Oxidative stress is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intestinal failure–associated liver disease. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) assembled a working group to provide recommendations on clinical practice surrounding photoprotection of PN.This Position Paper reviews the scientific literature on the formation of quantifiable peroxides and other degradation products when PN admixtures and ILEs are exposed to light and reports adverse clinical outcomes in premature infants exposed to PN. Recommendations for photoprotection of PN admixtures and ILEs are provided, as well as the challenges in achieving complete photoprotection with the equipment, supplies, and materials currently available in the US. ASPEN and the authors understand that the full implementation of complete photoprotection may not currently be feasible given current product availability; recommendations provided in this paper serve to represent the goal to which to strive as well as to highlight the importance of product availability to achieve these practices. This paper has been approved by the ASPEN Board of Directors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abronchopulmonary dysplasia 3aenteral feeding 3aenterocolitis 3aequipment 3aintestines 3alipids 3aliver diseases 3aoxidative stress 3aparenteral feeding 3aphotooxidation 3apremature birth 3aradiation resistance 3aretinal diseases 3arisk1 aAyers, Phil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0940-54291 aFleming, Barbara1 aGura, Kathleen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0431-896X1 aGutsul, Liliia1 aMichalski, Austin1 aHolcombe, Beverly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3411-19191 aSacks, Gordon S.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2021 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.927-941dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncp.107473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04121naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245010000175300002000275520224200295592002802537596007502565596007502640596007502715596007502790650001602865650001602881650002402897650003502921650001202956650002002968650002902988650001703017650000903034650000903043650001803052650001703070650001503087650001403102650001803116650001303134650001903147650001603166650001303182651001103195700003003206700002303236700002503259700003603284773015503320856008303475852000903558655001203567IND60786049420221120112648.0220802e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078604942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19433-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Elizeu Chiodi10aStudy of controlled migration of cadmium and lead into foods from plastic utensils for children  ap. 52833-52843.  aLead (Pb) is a highly neurotoxic chemical element known for reducing intelligence quotient (IQ) and promoting antisocial behavior in children and adolescents, while cadmium (Cd) is a carcinogenic bioaccumulative element. Both these metals are included in the priority pollutant list of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and in the WHO List of Chemicals of Major Public Health Concern, where contaminated foods and beverages are the most common pathways of exposure. The objective of this study was to determine total Cd and Pb levels in colored plastic utensils (cups, mugs, bowls, feeding bottles, and plates) for use by children and to measure the specific migration of these elements into beverages and foods. Total contaminant levels were determined using a handheld X-ray fluorescence analyzer. Specific migration tests were conducted using the simulant solutions acetic acid 3% (m/v) and water. Migration levels were determined by ICP-MS. Specific migration tests for Pb were also performed on commercially available samples (cola soft drink, orange juice, vinegar, and milk), with levels determined by graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS). A total of 674 utensils were analyzed in loco at major commercial centers in Greater São Paulo, of which 87 were purchased for containing Cd and Pb concentrations above permitted limits. Mean concentrations of the metals detected in the purchased utensils were 1110 ppm for Pb and 338 ppm for Cd. For specific migration assays, Pb levels were 187, 13, and 380 times above the permitted limit (0.01 mg.kg -1) for acetic acid, water, and orange juice, respectively. Cd levels were 50 and 2.4 times above the maximum permitted limit (0.005 mg.kg -1) for acetic acid and water, respectively. The districts where the utensils were purchased were grouped according to their social vulnerability index and compared using ANOVA. Pb levels were different between low and medium/high social vulnerability groups (p = 0.006). The findings corroborate the initial hypothesis that these utensils constitute a major source of exposure to PTEs such as Cd and Pb, pointing to the need for stricter regulation and inspection by the Brazilian regulatory agencies.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/11087-8cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2016/10060-9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/14392-9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2014/20945-2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aX-radiation 3aacetic acid 3aantisocial behavior 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acarcinogenicity 3aenvironmental protection 3afluorescence 3alead 3amilk 3aneurotoxicity 3aorange juice 3apollutants 3apollution 3apublic health 3aresearch 3asocioeconomics 3asoft drinks 3avinegars 3aBrazil1 aLeroux, Isabelle Nogueira1 aLuz, Maciel Santos1 aBatista, Bruno Lemos1 aOlympio, Kelly Polido Kaneshiro0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 July, v. 29, no. 35 p.52833-52843dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19433-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245011600161500001900277520159300296592002801889650001501917650001501932650002701947650001101974650001301985650001701998651001002015700001502025700001702040700001902057700001602076700001502092773016002107856007602267852000902343655001202352IND60729305320221121073942.0210228e20210222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072930532DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi100201002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Tingting 10aPractical Efficient Regional Land-Use Planning Using Constrained Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm Optimization  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPractical efficient regional land-use planning requires planners to balance competing uses, regional policies, spatial compatibilities, and priorities across the social, economic, and ecological domains. Genetic algorithm optimization has progressed complex planning, but challenges remain in developing practical alternatives to random initialization, genetic mutations, and to pragmatically balance competing objectives. To meet these practical needs, we developed a Land use Intensity-restricted Multi-objective Spatial Optimization (LIr-MSO) model with more realistic patch size initialization, novel mutation, elite strategies, and objectives balanced via nominalizations and weightings. We tested the model for Dapeng, China where experiments compared comprehensive fitness (across conversion cost, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), ecosystem services value, compactness, and conflict degree) with three contrast experiments, in which changes were separately made in the initialization and mutation. The comprehensive model gave superior fitness compared to the contrast experiments. Iterations progressed rapidly to near-optimality, but final convergence involved much slower parent–offspring mutations. Tradeoffs between conversion cost and compactness were strongest, and conflict degree improved in part as an emergent property of the spatial social connectedness built into our algorithm. Observations of rapid iteration to near-optimality with our model can facilitate interactive simulations, not possible with current models, involving land-use planners and regional managers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aecosystems 3agross domestic product 3amodels 3amutation 3aspatial data 3aChina1 aZhang, Yu 1 aSu, Fenzhen 1 aLyne, Vincent 1 aCheng, Fei 1 aXiao, Han 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Feb. 22, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100201003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013900171300001600310520187200326592002802198650001402226650001502240650001902255650001402274650001602288650002002304650001002324773009702334856008602431852000902517655001202526IND60096684320221122054752.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009668432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Kyunghyun10aEffects of pilot injection pressure on the combustion and emissions characteristics in a diesel engine using biodiesel–CNG dual fuel  ap. 506-516.  aBiodiesel–compressed natural gas (CNG) dual fuel combustion (DFC) system is studied for the simultaneous reduction of particulate matters (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engine. In this study, biodiesel is used as a pilot injection fuel to ignite the main fuel, CNG of DFC system. In particular, the pilot injection pressure is controlled to investigate the characteristics of engine performance and exhaust emissions in a single cylinder diesel engine. The results show that the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) of biodiesel–CNG DFC mode is lower than that of diesel single fuel combustion (SFC) mode at higher injection pressure. However, the combustion stability of biodiesel–CNG DFC mode is increased with the increase of pilot injection pressure. At the same injection pressure, the start of combustion of biodiesel–CNG DFC is delayed compared to diesel SFC due to the increase of ignition delay of pilot fuel. On the contrary, it is observed that as the pilot injection pressure increase, the combustion process begins and ends a little earlier for biodiesel–CNG DFC. The ignition delay in the DFC is about 1.2–2.6°CA longer compared to diesel SFC, but decreases with increases of pilot injection pressure. Smoke and NOx emissions are decreased and increased, respectively, as the pilot injection pressure increases in the biodiesel–CNG DFC. In comparison to diesel SFC, smoke emissions are significantly reduced over all the operating conditions and NOx emissions also exhibited similar reduction trend except for the full load condition in biodiesel–CNG DFC. DFC yields higher CO emissions compared to diesel SFC over all engine conditions except for 100% load. The more unburned hydrocarbon emissions are exhausted in the DFC mode than in the diesel SFC; however, this decreases with increases in pilot injection pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3anatural gas 3anitrogen oxides 3asmoke0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Dec., v. 76 p.506-516dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245015800218300001600376520154800392592002801940650001101968650000801979650002301987650001602010650001702026650001102043650003702054650001902091650001802110650000902128650001502137650001302152650001502165650000902180650001702189650001602206650001102222653002202233653002102255653001302276653001802289653002602307653001702333653002702350653001702377653003302394700001902427700001902446700001902465700002502484700002802509700002302537700002402560700001902584700001802603700002002621773016002641856008502801852000902886655001202895IND60731559320221117211509.0210527e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073155932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanforlini, Bruno Micael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8803-052410aAssociation of body surface area with fat mass, free fat mass and total weight in healthy individuals, and implications for the dosage of cytotoxic drugs  ap. 471-477.  aIn oncology, the dosage of anti-neoplastic drugs is generally adapted to the patient's body surface area (BSA). We investigated the potential differences between BSA and body weight (BW) in estimating the variability in body composition among individuals, especially older adults.The study population included 322 community-dwelling individuals with different age and sex: 45 adult men (AM, age 18–65 years), 86 older men (OM, age >65 years), 54 adult women (AW, age 18–65 years), and 137 older women (OW, age >65 years). For each participant, we estimated the body composition with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and we calculated the BSA using the DuBois and DuBois formula. The strength of relationships between fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) with BSA, BW, and BMI were expressed as correlation (r) and determination coefficients (R²).Most of the included sample was normal weight (45.7%) or overweight (41.9%). FFM demonstrated a stronger association with BSA than with BW or BMI in all age/sex groups, with r ranging from 0.831 to 0.924 (p < 0.001 for all) and R2 from 0.691 to 0.853. Conversely, BW and BMI were more strongly related to FM than BSA, especially in women. For such relationship, BW, in particular, showed r ranging from 0.793 to 0.924 (p < 0.001 for all).This study suggests that BSA may be more appropriately used to estimate FFM, compared with BW. Instead, alternative parameters should be considered to estimate FM in patients at risk for adverse effects of lipophilic drugs, especially in older age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aage 3aclinical nutrition 3acorrelation 3acytotoxicity 3adosage 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3alean body mass 3alipophilicity 3amass 3aoverweight 3apatients 3apopulation 3arisk 3asurface area 3avariability 3aweight 0aBody surface area 0aBody composition 0aFat mass 0aFat-free mass 0aAnti-neoplastic drugs 0aDosage drugs 0aVolume of distribution 0aOlder adults 0aPhysical activity in elderly1 aAlessi, Agnese1 aPontarin, Anna1 aDe Rui, Marina1 aZoccarato, Francesca1 aSeccia, Daniele Michele1 aTrevisan, Caterina1 aBrunello, Antonella1 aBasso, Umberto1 aManzato, Enzo1 aSergi, Giuseppe0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 June, v. 43 p.471-477dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245010000203300001800303520177000321592002802091596007402119650002502193650002502218650002102243650001602264650002402280650001202304650001002316650001602326650002102342650001102363650003502374650001702409650001202426650001302438650001802451650001802469653002302487653004002510653001802550653002802568653001702596700002102613700001602634700005602650700001502706700001802721700001802739773011002757856008202867852000902949655001202958IND60709000920221119134359.0200902e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070900092DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-11-19-0409-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yuanye1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5213-660210aDetrimental Effects of Multiple Mutations in Position 240 of Fusarium graminearum β₂-Tubulin  ap. 1522-1529.  aFusarium graminearum causes Fusarium head blight (FHB), a destructive disease of cereal crops worldwide. Carbendazim (methylbenzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate [MBC]) is widely used for controlling FHB. A previous study showed that the F240L mutation in the β₂-tubulin of F. graminearum (Fgβ₂-tubulin) confers hypersensitivity to MBC. Whether the substitution of phenylalanine by other amino acids in position 240 of the Fgβ₂-tubulin gene also confers hypersensitivity to MBC is unknown. Moreover, the biological fitness of these mutants is poorly understood. In this study, we substituted position 240 of Fgβ₂-tubulin with other amino acids. We found that the F240A, F240E, F240I, and F240Y mutations in Fgβ₂-tubulin could also confer F. graminearum hypersensitivity to MBC, although the effective concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (EC₅₀) differed among the mutations. The F240G mutation, in contrast, decreased the sensitivity to MBC. In addition, a molecular docking assay indicated that the binding affinity between Fgβ₂-tubulin and MBC were increased by the F240A, F240E, F240I, and F240Y mutations but decreased by the F240G mutation. All mutants had normal conidial morphology, but the growth rates and pathogenicity of the F240A, F240E, F240G, F240I, and F240Y mutants were significantly decreased. Moreover, the F240A and F240G mutants produced twisted hyphae. In addition, microtubules were sparse and rarely observed in β₂F240A-EGFP, β₂F240E-EGFP, and β₂F240G-EGFP. These results indicate that position 240 (phenylalanine) is not only vital to the function of Fgβ₂-tubulin but also plays an important role in regulating the sensitivity of F. graminearum to MBC. Any mutation in this site would be detrimental to survival.  aPublisher supplied data  a31730072cKey Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3abinding capacity 3acarbendazim 3acomputer simulation 3aconidia 3agenes 3agrain crops 3ahypersensitivity 3ahyphae 3amedian effective concentration 3amicrotubules 3amutants 3amutation 3apathogenicity 3aphenylalanine 0abiological fitness 0adisease control and pest management 0aFgβ2-tubulin 0agenetics and resistance 0aposition 2401 aZhang, Yuanshuai1 aHe, Zongzhe1 aDuan, Yabing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4183-87291 aLi, Yanjun1 aWang, Jianxin1 aZhou, Mingguo0 tPhytopathology.g2020 Sept., v. 110, no. 9 p.1522-1529dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-11-19-0409-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001400181245006800195300001800263506007600281520139200357592002801749506003701777650001801814650001201832650001401844650002201858650001201880650002301892651001101915653001501926653001701941653002501958653001201983700001901995700002102014700002002035700001902055773010202074856007402176852000902250655001202259IND60117819120221207065610.0141126e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011781912DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu1742doi7 aPMC42023152pmcid7 a251231132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenli10aCharacterization of Newly Gained Introns in Daphnia Populations  ap. 2218-2234.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs one of the few known species in an active phase of intron proliferation, the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex is an especially attractive system for interrogating the gain and loss of introns in natural populations. In this study, we used a comparative population-genomic approach to identify and characterize 90 recently gained introns in this species. Molecular clock analyses indicate that these introns arose between 3.9 × 105 and 1.45 × 104 years ago, with a spike in intron proliferation approximately 5.2 × 104 to 1.22 × 105 years ago. Parallel gains at homologous positions contribute to 47.8% (43/90) of discovered new introns. A disproportionally large number of new introns were found in historically isolated populations in Oregon. Nonetheless, derived, intron-bearing alleles were also identified in a wide range of geographic locations, suggesting intron gain and, to a lesser degree, intron loss are important sources of genetic variation in natural populations of Daphnia. A majority (55/90 or 61.1%) of the identified neointrons have associated internal direct repeats with lengths and compositions that are unlikely to occur by chance, suggesting repeated bouts of staggered double-strand breaks (DSBs) during their evolution. Accordingly, internal, staggered DSBs may contribute to a passive trend toward increased length and sequence diversity in nascent introns.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDaphnia pulex 3aalleles 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3aintrons 3asequence diversity 3aOregon 0anew intron 0aage estimate 0adouble-strand breaks 0aDaphnia1 aKuzoff, Robert1 aWong, Chen Khuan1 aTucker, Abraham1 aLynch, Michael0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.2218-2234dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu1743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010200167300001400269520099800283592002801281650003101309650002701340650002201367650002201389650002101411650002401432650003001456650000901486650001301495650001901508650001001527650001601537650002601553650004101579650001401620650001701634650000901651650000701660650001401667650001301681650000901694650001601703653001901719653000901738653001901747653001701766653001901783700001701802700001601819700001701835700001301852773011001865856008301975852000902058655001202067IND60087528720221118175355.0161023e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008752872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, M.L.10aProduction and partial characterization of biosurfactant produced by crude oil degrading bacteria  ap. 28-34.  aProduction of biosurfactant by crude oil degrading bacteria for use in microbial enhanced oil recovery was investigated.

Cold chain logistics is one of the most common methods to store and sell bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). The purpose of this study was to investigate how bigeye tuna (T. obesus) deteriorate during simulated cold chain logistics with fluctuating temperatures by monitoring the quality changes and water distribution. The physical and chemical results showed that the sensory score, texture profile analysis (TPA), and water holding capacity (WHC) decreased, while total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), K value, aerobic plate counts (APC), and psychrotrophic bacterial counts increased with fluctuating temperatures during 132 h. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection showed that the T₂₁ (trapped water) and proton density decreased, while T₂₂ (free water) decreased initially and then increased, indicating continuous water loss and water migration during storage. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that springiness, hardness, chewiness, T₂₁, and sensory score were correlated with each other (p < 0.05) and the linear combination of quality indicators and T₂transverse relaxation time was established. Besides, temperature fluctuation (batch 3) accelerated the deterioration of bigeye tuna according to the comprehensive score of PCA.

Herein, we report a strategy for maximizing the battery reversibility of binderless freestanding electrodes using conversion-type SnO₂ quantum particles. The C–Sn bond between the active materials and the graphene conductor immobilizes the redox reaction sites, enabling fast charge transfer and reversible charge/discharge, and the morphological nature of the porous aerofilm satisfies the fast ion access and reversible volume recovery. Unlike typical conversion-type electrodes that undergo huge capacity fading, our freestanding aerofilm SnO₂ electrode maintains its capacity within 3% reduction, showing a highly reversible capacity of 1301 mA h g⁻¹. This study provides critical strategies enabling an acceleration of the successful realization of next-generation reversible batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aanodes 3abatteries 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3aredox reactions1 aSenthil, Chenrayan1 aJung, Sung Mi1 aJung, Hyun Young0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 10, no. 7 p.3595-3604dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta09716d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245017200178500001900350520248400369592002802853650002402881650001402905650001202919650001202931650002102943650001002964650001802974650001102992650001403003650001803017650002003035650002203055650002203077651001303099653001503112700002603127700002303153700002403176773011203200856008503312852000903397655001203406IND60731560220221117203439.0210513e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073156022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parepi.2021.e002102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoldeyohannes, Demelash10aPrevalence of Schistosomiasis (S. mansoni and S. haematobium) and its association with gender of school age children in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSchistosomiasis (S. mansoni and S. haematobium) is an important neglected tropical disease in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, Schistosomiasis has been prioritized as neglected tropical disease and remained among major public health burden on school age children of the country. Few studies conducted on the association between prevalence of Schistosomiasis and gender of school age children have inconclusive finding about the association between these two variables. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was done to determine the pooled prevalence of Schistosomiasis and its association with gender of school age children in Ethiopia.In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as: Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central library, Google Scholar, and HINARI were systematically searched. STATA version 14 was used to estimate pooled prevalence of Schistosomiasis using random effects model with 95% confidence interval. The results were presented by using forest plot and statistical heterogeneity was checked by using the Cochran Q test (chi-squared statistic), I² test statistic and by visual examination of the forest plot.From the total of 427 studies identified for this review, 50 studies were included in the final analysis. The analysis noted that pooled prevalence of Schistosomiasis in Ethiopia was 28.78% (95% CI: 23.81, 33.74). The subgroup analysis indicated that extreme variability was observed in the prevalence of Schistosomiasis across the regions of the country. The highest (39.77%) prevalence of Schistosomiasis was reported from the southern region, whereas the lowest (14.95%) prevalence of Schistosomiasis was reported from Afar region. Male school age children were 58% more likely infected with Schistosomiasis than female school age children in Ethiopia (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.83).The Prevalence of Schistosomiasis was higher than the 2018 report of the Ethiopian federal ministry of health. The prevalence of Schistosomiasis was predominant among male gender of the school age children. Therefore, sustainable control of Schistosomiasis requires the approaches that must go beyond current deworming program. Complementary prevention strategies including health education, safe water and adequate sanitary facilities provision should be simultaneously implemented. The underlining causes of variation in risk factors of Schistosomiasis among males and females should be further studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3adeworming 3afemales 3aforests 3ahealth education 3amales 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aparasites 3apublic health 3aschistosomiasis 3asystematic review 3atropical diseases 3aEthiopia 0aPrevalence1 aSahiledengle, Biniyam1 aTekalegn, Yohannes1 aHailemariam, Zeleke0 tParasite epidemiology and control.g2021 May, v. 13 p.e00210-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23217x2405-67317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parepi.2021.e002103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245013800164300001600302520100000318592002801318650003301346650001401379650001201393650001001405650001301415650001501428650001201443650002101455650000701476650001201483650001601495650001101511650000901522653002501531653001801556653001701574653001901591700001601610700001701626700001701643700001501660773011201675856008301787852000901870655001201879IND60087529120221118175418.0161023e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008752912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Zhen10aBiochemical characterization of three keratinolytic enzymes from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia BBE11-1 for biodegrading keratin wastes  ap. 166-172.  aKeratin-degrading strain Stenotrophomonas maltophilia BBE11-1 was isolated from a poultry farm. According to zymogram analysis, there were at least two keratinolytic enzymes produced. After three steps of purification by different chromatographies, three keratinolytic enzymes were effectively separated. Partial characterizations of three enzymes showed that K1, K2 and K3 were 48 kDa, 36 kDa and 17 kDa respectively. Alkaline pHs 7–11 and temperatures 40–50 °C were optimal for three enzymes. K3 protein cooperated with other two enzymes greatly enhanced keratinolytic activity and markedly degraded feather within 24 h. Cooperative action of K1 and K2 remarkably wiped off cuticle layers of wool without damaging internal fibers, and the addition of K3 with K1 and K2 also showed obvious structure change of wool. Cooperative mechanism of keratinous degradation and potential applications of keratin-waste hydrolysis or dehairing in leather industry by three enzymes were discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 3adehairing 3aenzymes 3afarms 3afeathers 3ahydrolysis 3akeratin 3aleather industry 3apH 3apoultry 3atemperature 3awastes 3awool 0aKeratinolytic enzyme 0aKeratin waste 0aPurification 0aBiodegradation1 aZhang, Juan1 aLiu, Baihong1 aDu, Guocheng1 aChen, Jian0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Aug., v. 82 p.166-172dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245008300201300001800284506007600302520142300378592002801801506003701829650002601866650001201892650001801904650001701922650001701939650001801956650001201974650002101986650001002007650001002017650002902027650002302056650001102079650001502090650001902105650001402124650001102138650002202149650001502171653002902186653003202215653002202247653001502269700002502284773010202309856007402411852000902485655001202494IND60117820220221207113207.0141126e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011782022DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu1852doi7 aPMC42176912pmcid7 a251699832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTernes, Chad M.10aGene Transfers Shaped the Evolution of De Novo NAD+ Biosynthesis in Eukaryotes  ap. 2335-2349.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNAD+ is an essential molecule for life, present in each living cell. It can function as an electron carrier or cofactor in redox biochemistry and energetics, and serves as substrate to generate the secondary messenger cyclic ADP ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Although de novo NAD+ biosynthesis is essential, different metabolic pathways exist in different eukaryotic clades. The kynurenine pathway starting with tryptophan was most likely present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes, and is active in fungi and animals. The aspartate pathway, detected in most photosynthetic eukaryotes, was probably acquired from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont that gave rise to chloroplasts. An evolutionary analysis of enzymes catalyzing de novo NAD+ biosynthesis resulted in evolutionary trees incongruent with established organismal phylogeny, indicating numerous gene transfers. Endosymbiotic gene transfers probably introduced the aspartate pathway into eukaryotes and may have distributed it among different photosynthetic clades. In addition, several horizontal gene transfers substituted eukaryotic genes with bacterial orthologs. Although horizontal gene transfer is accepted as a key mechanism in prokaryotic evolution, it is supposed to be rare in eukaryotic evolution. The essential metabolic pathway of de novo NAD+ biosynthesis in eukaryotes was shaped by numerous gene transfers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aanimals 3aaspartic acid 3abiosynthesis 3achloroplasts 3aendosymbionts 3aenzymes 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3akynurenine pathway 3aniacin 3aphosphates 3aphotosynthesis 3aphylogeny 3aribose 3asecond messengers 3atryptophan 0ahorizontal gene transfer 0aendosymbiotic gene transfer 0aNAD+ biosynthesis 0ametabolism1 aSchönknecht, Gerald0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.2335-2349dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu1853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245017600159300001800335520140400353592002801757650001801785650001101803650001901814650001301833650002201846650001501868650003201883700002301915700001901938700001801957700001701975700001901992700001402011700001402025700001502039700001502054700001502069700001602084700001402100773014202114856007502256852000902331655001202340IND60767424420221120195241.0220216e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076742442DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta09991d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Lusheng10aFace-on oriented hydrophobic conjugated polymers as dopant-free hole-transport materials for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with a fill factor approaching 85%  ap. 3409-3417.  aDeveloping high-performance dopant-free hole transport materials (DF-HTMs) is critical to realizing stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a class of siloxane-terminated polymers (PBZ-Si) with low surface energy were studied as DF-HTMs in PSCs. These polymers have good film-forming properties with unique face-on orientation and suitable valence bands. More importantly, the siloxane-terminated side-chains exhibited fantastic multifunctionality, providing the polymer with sufficient solubility, increased hole mobility, passivation capability, and hydrophobicity. Furthermore, for the first time, we observed directly the preferential face-on molecular orientation of polymeric HTMs on perovskite films by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering. Finally, planar n–i–p PSCs employing PBZ-3Si with complete siloxane-terminated side chains as the DF-HTM displayed a high efficiency of 20.18%, with an unprecedented fill factor up to 85%, a record fill factor value in all n–i–p PSCs with dopant-free HTMs. Moreover, the device with PBZ-3Si showed excellent thermal and moisture stability. The devices without encapsulation retained 76% of the initial efficiency after 333 h under 85 °C and 70 ± 10% relative humidity conditions. This work proves that siloxane-terminated side-chains are essential for the rational design of polymeric DF-HTMs toward efficient and stable PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3apolymers 3arelative humidity 3asolubility 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aShibayama, Naoyuki1 aJiang, Haiying1 aZhang, Zilong1 aMeng, Lingyi1 aZhang, Lianjie1 aWang, Can1 aZhao, Nan1 aYu, Yaming1 aIto, Seigo1 aWu, Jihuai1 aChen Junwu,1 aGao, Peng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 10, no. 7 p.3409-3417dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta09991d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008600172520114100258592002801399650001501427650001201442650001801454650001501472650001601487653002301503653002501526653003701551653002101588653003601609700005901645700001901704773009301723856008601816852000901902655001201911IND60731560820221117203842.0211227e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073156082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e061432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Priyajit10aEntropy generation in nanofluid flow due to double diffusive MHD mixed convection  aThis work is concerned with the numerical study of laminar, steady MHD mixed convection flow, and entropy generation analysis of Al2O3-water nanofluid flowing in a lid-driven trapezoidal enclosure. The aspect ratio of the cavity is taken very small. The cavity is differentially heated to study the fluid flow, heat, and mass transfer rate. The adiabatic upper wall of the enclosure is allowed to move with a constant velocity along the positive x-direction. The second-order finite difference approximation is employed to discretize the governing partial differential equations, and a stream-function velocity formulation is used to solve the coupled non-linear partial differential equations numerically. The simulated results are plotted graphically through streamlines, isotherms, entropy generation, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number. The computations indicate that the average Nusselt number and average Sherwood number are decreasing functions of Hartmann number, aspect ratio, and nanoparticle volume fraction. Significant changes in streamlines, temperature and concentration contours for high Richardson number are observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3aentropy 3amass transfer 3ananofluids 3atemperature 0aEntropy generation 0aMHD mixed convection 0aLid driven trapezoidal enclosure 0aLow aspect ratio 0aDouble diffusive nanofluid flow1 aMahapatra, T.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3715-45321 aParveen, Rujda0 tHeliyon.g2021 Mar., v. 7, no. 3 p.e06143-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e061433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013600167300001600303520092400319592002801243650001301271650001801284650001501302650001901317650001001336650001501346650001101361650003301372651001001405653001601415653002901431653001801460653002801478653002201506653002001528700002501548700002101573700002801594773011201622856008301734852000901817655001201826IND60087529720221118175409.0161023e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008752972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicci, Sandra10aRole of the microboring marine organisms in the deterioration of archaeological submerged lapideous artifacts (Baia, Naples, Italy)  ap. 199-206.  aEndolithic microorganisms responsible for micro-erosion of submerged archaeological artifacts, found in the Underwater Archaeological Park of Baia (Naples) were analyzed.

The data confirm that endolithic cyanobacteria, chlorophytes and fungi together with macroboring organisms due to the growth of clionaids and bivalves play a significant role in biodeterioration processes of submerged calcareous artifacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aCyanobacteria 3aOstreobium 3abiodegradation 3afungi 3apolyesters 3aresins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aItaly 0aMicroboring 0aArchaeological artifacts 0aBaia (Naples) 0aIchnoreticulina elegans 0aEurygonum nodosum 0aScolecia filosa1 aPietrini, Anna Maria1 aBartolini, Marco1 aPerasso, Carlotta Sacco0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Aug., v. 82 p.199-206dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016100164300001600325520136000341592002801701650002901729650001701758650002301775650001301798650001901811650001401830650001101844650001201855651001001867651001601877653001801893653001801911653002101929653001301950653002001963700001701983700001702000700002002017700001802037700001702055773010802072856005102180852000902231655001202240IND50087062520221118011456.0140412e20110413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008706252DNAL7 a10.1080/03949370.2011.5550842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazza, G.10aEcological characterisation of streams invaded by the New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray 1843): the case study of a National Park in Italy  ap. 151-164.  aSince the nineteenth century, the mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray 1843), native to New Zealand, has been introduced into several European countries, Italy included. As a first step to contain its spread and establishment, it seems necessary to understand the characteristics of the environment that are more favourable for this species' invasion. To this aim, we analysed a number of physico-chemical and biotic parameters of four streams, two invaded and two not yet invaded, in the National Park of the Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna (Central Italy), where the species was first recorded in 2008. The two categories of streams, invaded and non-invaded, differ in only three of the 20 analysed characteristics of the habitat; that is, availability of crevices, width stream, and maximum water depth. This suggests that, despite P. antipodarum's documented tolerance to pollution, the high-quality waters of the park are highly susceptible to its invasion, if its vectors and pathways are not identified and adequately monitored. Most of the environmental parameters analysed in the studied streams were shown to be similar to those reported in the literature as preferred/tolerated by the species. Our findings pinpoint the vulnerability of nature reserves to species invasions, and call for more effective preventative measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotamopyrgus antipodarum 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3ahabitats 3anational parks 3apollution 3asnails 3astreams 3aItaly 3aNew Zealand 0abenthic fauna 0ainland waters 0ainvasive species 0aMollusca 0aprotected areas1 aAgostini, N.1 aAquiloni, L.1 aCianfanelli, S.1 aTricarico, E.1 aGherardi, F.0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 23, no. 2 p.151-164dTaylor & Francisx1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2011.555084  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013800169520129000307592002801597650002201625650002301647650002501670650002301695650001701718650001501735650001501750650001001765650002301775650001201798650001501810650001201825650001901837650001401856653001101870653002001881653003101901653002301932653001801955700001501973700002401988700005602012700001602068700001802084700002502102773011402127856008602241852000902327655001202336IND60730116620221119110421.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073011662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1133822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Naveed10aSucrose-dependent production of biomass and low-caloric steviol glycosides in adventitious root cultures of Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.)  aThe market demand for steviol glycosides (SGs) is gradually increasing worldwide due to their low-caloric nature. SGs are commonly added as a sweetener to various food items and are particularly useful for obese and diabetic patients. Production of SGs is predominantly obtained from the plant Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana). Propagation of Stevia plants for SGs production is limited due to short-term viability of seeds and high labor demands for shoot multiplication. Adventitious root cultures (ARC) offer an alternative production system to whole plants for extraction of SGs. The overall objective of this study was to enhance the production of SGs in SRC of Stevia by differential sucrose feeding (05−50 g l⁻¹). A high concentration of sucrose (50 g l⁻¹) boosted biomass accumulation while a low concentration (10 g l⁻¹) enhanced biosynthesis of major SGs (stevioside and rebaudioside-A). A strongly positive correlation was found between biomass accumulation and phenolics and flavonoids production respectively. Furthermore, 20 g l⁻¹ to 40 g l⁻¹ sucrose stimulated dulcoside-A, phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant activity. The results suggest that adventitious root cultures can be a viable option for large-scale production of SGs for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStevia rebaudiana 3aadventitious roots 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass production 3abiosynthesis 3aflavonoids 3aglycosides 3alabor 3aphenolic compounds 3asteviol 3astevioside 3asucrose 3asupply balance 3aviability 0aStevia 0aSucrose feeding 0aAdventitious root cultures 0aSteviol glycosides 0aPolyphenolics1 aRab, Abdur1 aSājid, Muḥammad,1 aAhmad, Nisar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3299-34091 aFazal, Hina1 aAli, Mohammad1 aEgertsdotter, Ulrika0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 June, v. 164 p.113382-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1133823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013600157300001800293500001400311520150200325592002801827650002001855650002101875650001501896650001801911650001801929650001601947650002101963650001801984650001702002650001702019650002102036650001602057650002002073650001502093650001102108650002802119650002102147650001602168650003002184650001002214650001602224650001602240650000902256650001302265650001602278650001702294650002402311700001502335700001502350700001302365700001102378700001802389700001302407773012602420856007402546852000902620655001202629IND60711481420221120232726.0200928e20200923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071148142DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo01338b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuanyuan10aGuavinoside B from Psidium guajava alleviates acetaminophen-induced liver injury via regulating the Nrf2 and JNK signaling pathways  ap. 8297-8308.  aNAL-light  aBenzophenone glycosides are a major type of polyphenols present in guava. To date, there is still poor understanding of the relationship between benzophenone glycosides and the hepatoprotective effects attributed to this edible fruit. Herein, the protective effects of guavinoside B (GUB), a main benzophenone glycoside present in guava fruit, against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Fluorescence measurement demonstrated that GUB (at a concentration of 30 μM) significantly reduced the intracellular ROS levels in APAP-treated HepG2 cells. In addition, GUB (100 mg kg⁻¹ d⁻¹) pretreatment markedly alleviated APAP-induced hepatocyte infiltration and necrosis in C57BL/6 mice, and improved serum and hepatic biochemical parameters, such as ALT, AST, SOD, GSH, ROS, MDA, and TNF-α levels. RT-PCR and western blot experiments revealed that GUB up-regulated Nrf2, GCLC and NQO1, while reducing p-JNK gene expression in the liver. The fermentation experiment further revealed that the displayed beneficial effects of GUB in vivo might be related to the gut microbial metabolite gallic acid. These promising data suggested that GUB showed potent hepatoprotective effects through regulating the Nrf2 and JNK signaling pathways. Further investigation of the absorption and metabolism of benzophenones would be warranted to promote the utilization of these phenolics as functional food ingredients against oxidative stress-induced chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsidium guajava 3aWestern blotting 3aabsorption 3aacetaminophen 3abenzophenones 3ablood serum 3achronic diseases 3aedible fruits 3afermentation 3afluorescence 3afunctional foods 3agallic acid 3agene expression 3aglycosides 3aguavas 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahuman cell lines 3aingredients 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver 3ameasurement 3ametabolites 3amice 3anecrosis 3apolyphenols 3apretreatment 3asignal transduction1 aXu, Jialin1 aLi, Dongli1 aMa, Hang1 aMu, Yu1 aHuang, Xueshi1 aLi, Liya0 tFood & function.g2020 Sept. 23, v. 11, no. 9 p.8297-8308dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01338b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03851naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148242066300173245015200836300001800988500001901006520171301025592002802738596012002766596007002886650001102956650002102967650001602988650001103004650001103015650001403026650001103040650001603051650002503067650001903092651001103111700001803122700003203140700002603172773012803198856008203326852000903408655001203417IND60702391820221119020056.0200718e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070239182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-020-02151-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanul-Macario, Cesar10aRelations empiriques de la réponse de la charge hydraulique et de la salinité des eaux souterraines aux variations du niveau de la mer et de la recharge verticale dans les aquifères karstiques côtiers captifs Relaciones empíricas de la respuesta de la salinidad de las aguas subterráneas a las variaciones del nivel del mar y la recarga vertical en los acuíferos kársticos costeros confinados 沿海承压岩溶含水层地下水水头—盐度对海平面和垂直补给量变化的经验关系 Relações empíricas da resposta da salinidade da água subterrânea a variações do nível do mar e recarga vertical em aquíferos costeiros cársticos10aEmpirical relationships of groundwater head–salinity response to variations of sea level and vertical recharge in coastal confined karst aquifers  ap. 1679-1694.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCoastal aquifers are characterized by a mixing zone with freshwater–saltwater interactions, which have a strong relationship with hydrological forcings such as astronomical and storm tides, aquifer recharge and pumping effects. These forcings govern the aquifer hydraulic head, the spatial distribution of groundwater salinity and the saline interface position. This work is an empirical evaluation through time-series analysis between aquifer head and groundwater salinity associated with the sea-level dynamics and the aquifer recharge. Groundwater pressure, temperature and salinity were measured in a confined aquifer in the northwest coast of Yucatan (México) during May 2017–May 2018, along with precipitation. Cross-correlation and linear Pearson correlation (r) analyses were performed with the data time series, separating astronomical and meteorological tides and vertical recharge effects. The results show that the astronomical and meteorological tides are directly correlated with the aquifer head response (0.71 < r < 0.99). Salinity has a direct and strong relationship with the astronomical tide (0.76 < r < 0.98), while the meteorological tide does not (r < 0.5). The vertical recharge showed a moderate correlation with the aquifer head (0.5 < r < 0.7) and a nonsignificant correlation with the groundwater salinity (r < 0.5). In this study, the sea level (r > 0.7) is a more important forcing than the vertical recharge (with 0.5 < r < 0.7). Empirical relationships through time-series analysis and the separation of individual hydrological forcings in the analysis are powerful tools to study, define and validate the conceptual model of the aquifer.  aPublisher supplied data  aPAPIIT - IN111916cDirección General de Asuntos del Personal Académico, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México  aPhD Fellowship for CCMcConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología 3acoasts 3aconfined aquifer 3agroundwater 3akarsts 3amodels 3asea level 3astorms 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awater salinity 3aMexico1 aSalles, Paulo1 aHernández-Espriú, Antonio1 aPacheco-Castro, Roger0 tHydrogeology journal.g2020 Aug., v. 28, no. 5 p.1679-1694dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-020-02151-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
