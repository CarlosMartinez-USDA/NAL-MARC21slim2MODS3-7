N2O emissions from secondary-level wastewater treatment processes are relatively well understood as a result of intensive international research effort in recent times, yet little information exists to date on the role of sewers in wastewater management chain N2O dynamics. Here we provide the first detailed assessment of N2O levels in the untreated influent (i.e. sewer network effluent) of three large Australian metropolitan wastewater treatment plants. Contrary to current international (IPCC) guidance, results show gravity sewers to be a likely source of N2O. Results from the monitoring program revealed hydraulic flow rate as a strong driver for N2O generation in gravity sewers, with microbial processes (nitrification and possibly denitrification) implicated as the main processes responsible for its production. Results were also used to develop a presumptive emission factor for N2O in the context of municipal gravity sewers. Considering the discrepancy with current IPCC Guidelines, further work is warranted to assess the scale and dynamics of N2O production in sewers elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenitrification 3aemissions 3agravity 3agreenhouse gases 3aguidelines 3amonitoring 3anitrification 3anitrous oxide 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aCities 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNitrous Oxidexanalysis 2aSewagexchemistry 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxinstrumentationxstatistics & numerical data. 0aNew South Wales 0aGravity sewer networks 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aMunicipal wastewater 0aNitrification–denitrification 0aNitrous oxide 0aUrban water sector1 aDaikeler, Alexander1 aPeters, Gregory M.1 aMann, Kirsten1 aAshbolt, Nicholas J.1 aStuetz, Richard M.1 aPeirson, William L.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 468-469 p.211-218dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.08.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012400159520155600283592002801839650001501867650001901882650002101901650001901922650002501941650001601966650001601982650001501998650001302013650001202026650002202038650001902060650002602079650002002105651001002125700001702135700001702152700001402169700001502183700001702198700001602215773011902231856007302350852000902423655001202432IND60653369920221119070444.0190714e20180629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065336992DNAL7 a10.3390/w100708682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Qiuxiang10aSimulating the Evolution of the Land and Water Resource System under Different Climates in Heilongjiang Province, China  aHeilongjiang Province is under the pressure of a water shortage due to climate change, population growth and economic development. To effectively manage regional land and water resources, this paper describes a system dynamics model that was built to simulate the interaction between land and water resources and socioeconomic factors, as well as the evolution of regional land and water resources in different climates in Heilongjiang Province. The results show that the declining trend of unused land area and the water supply&ndash;demand ratio will not stop, even under the most optimistic (e.g., humid climate) climate conditions, if the current land use patterns continue. Therefore, measures should be taken to manage the unreasonable usage patterns of land and water resources in this region. This study simulated the evolution of regional land and water resources for five scenarios under an arid climate by changing the net irrigation quota for paddy fields, the water quota for industrial use, forestland area, annual change rate of farmland area, and the growth rate of the gross industrial output value. Further, a combined scenario that can maximally reduce the regional land and water resource sustainable risk was identified. The simulation of the combined scenario showed that it can effectively increase the degree of regional land and water resource use in the region, as well as reduce the risks that threaten these resources. This study provides theoretical support for the efficient use of land and water resources in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adynamic models 3aeconomic development 3aforest land 3ahumid zones 3airrigation 3aland use 3apaddies 3apopulation growth 3arisk reduction 3asocioeconomic factors 3awater shortages 3aChina1 aZhao, Youzhu1 aWang, Zilong1 aFu, Qiang1 aWang, Tian1 aZhou, Zhimei1 aDong, Yujie0 tWater.g2018 June 29, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100708683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245011700167300001600284500002000300520157800320592002801898650001601926650001201942650002301954650001101977650002101988650002002009650001302029650002902042650001002071650001202081650001802093650001602111650001402127650001402141650001302155650001202168650002702180650003502207650001602242651002102258651002602279700002002305700001802325700002102343773010802364856007302472852000902545655001202554IND60572023120221117094859.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057202312DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.009462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeneviratne, Sampath S.10aLow levels of hybridization across two contact zones among three species of woodpeckers (Sphyrapicus sapsuckers)  ap. 887-898.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThree species of closely related woodpeckers (sapsuckers; Sphyrapicus) hybridize where they come into contact, presenting a rare ‘λ‐shape’ meeting of hybrid zones. Two of the three arms of this hybrid zone are located on either side of the Interior Plateau of British Columbia, Canada bordering the foothills of the Coast Mountains and the Rocky Mountains. The third arm is located in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The zones of hybridization present high variability of phenotypes and alleles in relatively small areas and provide an opportunity to examine levels of reproductive isolation between the taxa involved. We examined phenotypes (morphometric traits and plumage) and genotypes of 175 live birds across the two hybrid zones. We used the Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) method to identify 180 partially diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to generate a genetic hybrid index (GHI) for each bird. Phenotypically diverged S. ruber and S. nuchalis are genetically closely related, while S. nuchalis and S. varius have similar plumage but are well separated at the genetic markers studied. The width of both hybrid zones is narrower than expected under neutrality, and analyses of both genotypes and phenotypes indicate that hybrids are rare in the hybrid zone. Rarity of hybrids indicates assortative mating and/or some form of fitness reduction in hybrids, which might maintain the species complex despite close genetic distance and introgression. These findings further support the treatment of the three taxa as distinct species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphyrapicus 3aalleles 3aassortative mating 3acoasts 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agenotyping by sequencing 3ahills 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3amorphometry 3amountains 3aphenotype 3aplateaus 3aplumage 3areproductive isolation 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3awoodpeckers 3aBritish Columbia 3aRocky Mountain region1 aDavidson, Peter1 aMartin, Kathy1 aIrwin, Darren E.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2016 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.887-898dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.009463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245015800178300001400336520116500350592002801515653002601543653002001569653002401589653001401613700001901627700002001646700002201666773010101688856008701789852000901876655001201885IND60594047420221118114532.0180510e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059404742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbas, Buket Bezgin10aSynthesıs of a new electrochromıc polymer based on tetraphenylethylene cored tetrakıs carbazole complex and ıts electrochromıc devıce applıcatıon  ap. 72-79.  aPoly-1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)ethene P(TCP) was successfully synthesized by electrochemical oxidation of corresponding monomer, namely, 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)ethene (TCP) using dichloromethane as the solvent and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as supporting electrolyte. Spectroelectrochemical properties of P(TCP) were investigated in situ recording the electronic absorption spectra of the polymer film coated on indium-tin oxide (ITO) at various potentials.

The objective evaluation of the colors of P(TCP) at various potentials was performed through colorimetry studies on the basis of ⿿Commission Internationale de l⿲Eclairage⿿ (CIE) standards. The morphology of the polymer film was investigated by AFM analysis. A dual type electrochromic device based on P(TCP) was constructed and its spectroelectrochemical properties were investigated.

In this study, the concentration and characteristics of raw water DOC and THM formation potential (THMFP) entering an upland potable water treatment works were analysed over twelve months. Correlations between raw water DOC characteristics, standardised THMFP (STHMFP) and % DOC removal were also investigated. DOC and THM precursor removal during a series of treatment stages was examined over this period, as well as potential selectivity in the removal of DOC fractions, to assess the importance of different treatment stages for DOC removal and THM amelioration. Though THMFP removal remained high and fairly stable throughout the study period (83–89%), the data suggest that this was mostly the result of high DOC removal rates rather than the selective removal of THM precursors. Whilst this chemical agnosticism makes DOC removal more robust, it may make the overall process more vulnerable to exceeding permissible THM concentrations under changing climatic conditions. The kinetics of the reaction between DOC and chlorine appeared to vary seasonally, indicating temporal changes in the proportions of fast- and slow-reacting precursors with implications for THM concentrations at the point of delivery to the consumer. The initial treatment stages, comprising coagulation–flocculation and dissolved air floatation (DAF) were by far the most important in terms of bulk DOC removal and the preferential removal of THM precursors, though, surprisingly, DOC quality was also modified following chlorination and secondary rapid gravity filtration (RGF). Though net THM concentration decreased following initial treatment stages, a doubling in the proportion of brominated THMs (BrTHMs), which are reported to be more carcinogenic, was also observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abromination 3acarcinogenicity 3achlorination 3achlorine 3aclimatic factors 3adissolved organic carbon 3adrinking water 3afiltration 3agravity 3areaction kinetics 3aregrowth 3atemporal variation 3awater quality standards 3awater treatment 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aCarbonxisolation & purification 2aChemical Fractionation 2aChromatography, Gel 2aFlocculation 2aKinetics 2aSeasons 2aTrihalomethanesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purification 2aWater Purificationxmethods 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0aCoagulation 0aDissolved organic carbon 0aSize exclusion chromatography 0aTrihalomethanes 0aXAD fractionation1 aHolliman, Peter J.1 aWillis, Naomi1 aFreeman, Christopher0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 468-469 p.228-239dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.08.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012500164300001600289500002000305520135100325592002801676650001601704650001201720650001601732650001101748650001101759650000901770650001201779650001401791650002001805650002201825650001501847650001501862650001901877650001701896650001301913650001001926650001401936650001201950650001101962650001301973650001201986700001901998773011602017856008202133852000902215655001202224IND60587834920221122231531.0180102s1994    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058783492DNAL7 a10.1111/are.1994.25.s2.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSKAALA, Ø.10aGenetic markers in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., their potential for experimental studies of gene flow and adaptation  ap. 121-129.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn autumn 1992, a number of farmed and wild Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., spawners were screened for genetic variability in isoenzymes expressed in low‐risk tissues. Samples of muscle and fin tissues were taken by biopsy shortly before spawning. In the Daleelv hatchery a male heterozygous for GPI‐3*105 allele was crossed with four females homozygous for the common allele from Matre aquaculture station. In the River Hålva a wild male heterozygous for a GPI‐1,2*160 allele was crossed with a female homozygous for the common allele. Another female from Matre aquaculture stations, heterozygous for the MDH‐3,4*85 allele was crossed with a male homozygous for the common allele. Mortality was recorded during the egg and fry stages. The families were sampled four times during 1993, each individual was genotyped, and length and weight of the various genotypes recorded and compared. In all families the observed genotypic distributions were in close agreement with the expected Mendelian ratios, even in one family where the mortality was over 95%. There were no differences in performance between the two genotypes in any of the families. The inheritance of the observed variability was verified, and it is concluded that the detected alleles have a potential as genetic markers in experimental studies of gene flow and adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aalleles 3aaquaculture 3aautumn 3abiopsy 3aeggs 3afemales 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ahatcheries 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3aisozymes 3amales 3amortality 3amuscles 3arivers 3aspawning 3atissues1 aJØRSTAD, K.E.0 tAquaculture research.g1994, v. 25, no.

This study examines the effects of nuciferine on fructose-induced renal injury and explores its possible mechanism. Rats consumed drinking water or 10% fructose for 12 weeks. Fructose-fed rats were orally treated with water or 7, 14, or 28 mg/kg of nuciferine for the last 6 weeks. HK-2 cells were exposed to 5 mM fructose alone or in combination with nuciferine (2.5–40 μM) for 24 h. Nuciferine significantly attenuated fructose-induced hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation in rats. More importantly, it alleviated renal pathological injury with proteinuria at 20 and 40 mg/kg (2.58 ± 0.97 and 2.48 ± 1.04 mg/mg·creatinine, P < 0.05) compared with fructose-vehicle group (4.10 ± 1.18 mg/mg·creatinine). Furthermore, nuciferine reduced TLR4, MyD88, PI3K, ILK, p-AKT, p-P65, and NLRP3 inflammasome protein levels (P < 0.05 for all) in the renal cortex of fructose-fed rats (14 and 28 mg/kg) and fructose-exposed HK-2 cells (5–40 μM), which is consistent with its reduction of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 (P < 0.05 for all) in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest that nuciferine alleviated fructose-induced inflammation by inhibiting TLR4/PI3K/NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in rat renal cortex and HK-2 cells, which may contribute to the improvement of renal injury. 3aToll-like receptor 4 3acortex 3acreatinine 3adrinking water 3afructose 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahyperuricemia 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aleaves 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aproteinuria 3arats 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aZhao, Xiao-Juan1 aChen, Tian-Yu1 aLiu, Yang-Liu1 aJiao, Rui-Qing1 aZhang, Jian-Hua1 aMa, Junhua,1 aLiu, Jia-Hui1 aPan, Ying1 aKong, Ling-Dong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 64, no. 42 p.7899-7910dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b03031  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245007900199500001900278500002000297520140700317592002801724596007101752596004301823596004301866596001301909596007701922650001201999650002402011650001102035650002702046650001002073650002502083650001302108650001502121700002202136700006202158700002102220773012202241856007302363852000902436655001202445IND60723067520221120205450.0210111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072306752DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.132892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanner, Jason E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1361-367710aRapid restoration of belowground structure and fauna of a seagrass habitat  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeagrass meadows are habitat for an abundance and diversity of animal life, and their continuing global loss has focused effort on their restoration. This restoration not only aims to re‐establish the structure of the seagrass, but also to restore its function, particularly as habitat. The success of seagrass restoration is typically measured by the recovery of aboveground structure, but this ignores the important role of the belowground component of seagrass ecosystems, which may not recover at the same rate, and is equally important for faunal communities. We quantify infaunal communities (abundance, richness, and composition) within expanding plots of restored seagrass, and relate their change to the recovery of belowground seagrass biomass and sediment properties. We found that infaunal abundance and composition converged on that found in natural seagrass within 2 years, while the overall infaunal richness was not affected by habitat. The carbon content of surface sediments also recovered within 2 years, although recovery of belowground biomass and sediment grain size took 4 to 6 years. These results suggest that the structure of recovering seagrass habitats may not need to attain that of natural meadows before they support infauna that is comparable to natural communities. This pace and effectiveness of recovery provides some optimism for future seagrass restoration.  aPublisher supplied data  cAdelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board  aLP0989354cAustralian Research Council  aFT0991953cAustralian Research Council  cSA Water  cSouth Australian Department for Environment, Water and Natural Resources 3aanimals 3abelowground biomass 3acarbon 3aecological restoration 3afauna 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3aseagrasses1 aMcSkimming, Chloe1 aRussell, Bayden D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1282-99781 aConnell, Sean D.0 tRestoration ecology.g2021 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.e13289-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.132893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245014000169300001600309500002000325520195100345592002802296650001402324650002102338650001302359650002702372650001102399650002102410650001102431650001002442650001202452650002702464650002202491650001402513650001202527650001502539650002302554650002002577650001202597650001802609650002302627650002102650650001402671650001702685700002502702700002002727700002102747773010802768856007302876852000902949655001202958IND60572023420221117095355.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057202342DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.013512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuglielmo, Christopher G.14aThe effects of dietary macronutrients on flight ability, energetics, and fuel metabolism of yellow‐rumped warblers Setophaga coronata  ap. 133-148.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe catabolism of protein from organs and muscles during migratory flight is necessary to produce glucose, key metabolic intermediates, and water, but may have negative effects on flight range and refueling at stopovers. We tested the hypothesis, suggested by previous studies, that birds that eat high‐protein insect diets use more protein for fuel in flight than those that eat high‐carbohydrate fruits. First, we fed migratory yellow‐rumped warblers synthetic fruit or mixed insect/fruit diets, and measured metabolic rates and fuel mixture under basal conditions and during exercise in a hop/hover wheel respirometer. Birds eating the fruit diet had greater plasma triglyceride and non‐esterified fatty acid concentrations, and the higher protein mixed diet increased plasma uric acid only during feeding. Diet did not affect metabolic rates or the fuel mixture under resting or exercise conditions. We then fed yellow‐rumped warblers synthetic diets that differed only in the relative proportion of carbohydrate and protein (60:15 versus 15:60 as % dry mass) and tested them in wind tunnel flights lasting up to six hours. Birds fed the high carbohydrate diet became heavier and fatter than when fed the high protein diet. Plasma uric acid concentration was increased and plasma phospholipid concentration was decreased by the high protein diet in the pre‐flight state (after a 3 h fast), but diet only affected plasma phospholipids during flight (lower in high protein birds). Neither diet nor amount of body fat affected the rate of loss of lean mass or fat during flight. Inter‐individual or seasonal differences in diet do not appear to influence the amount of protein catabolized during endurance flight. However, birds fed the high carbohydrate diet had greater voluntary flight duration, independent of body fatness, suggesting that there may be other performance benefits of high carbohydrate diets for migratory birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSetophaga 3aartificial diets 3aexercise 3afatty acid composition 3aflight 3afree fatty acids 3afruits 3afuels 3aglucose 3ahigh carbohydrate diet 3ahigh protein diet 3aingestion 3ainsects 3ametabolism 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory birds 3amuscles 3aphospholipids 3aseasonal variation 3atriacylglycerols 3auric acid 3awind tunnels1 aGerson, Alexander R.1 aPrice, Edwin R.1 aHays, Quentin R.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2017 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.133-148dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.013513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009100172300001600263520126800279592002801547596001901575650001501594650001201609650002101621650001601642650002701658650001701685650001001702650002501712653001701737653001301754653001201767653001401779653000901793653002701802700002401829700002501853700002601878700002601904773013201930856008502062852000902147655001202156IND60614817820221119235226.0181002e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061481782DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2018.14724492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoonmee, Sirilak10aCytotoxicity in the frog (Fejervarya limnocharis) after acute cadmium exposure in vivo  ap. 978-989.  aChromosome aberrations (CA) in frogs (Fejervarya limnocharis) exposed to 5, 10 and 20 mg/L of cadmium chloride (CdCl₂) for 24, 48 and 72 h were invetegated. Treated frogs were compared to a control group. Cadmium (Cd) was not detected in the water or control frogs. The highest Cd concentrations in water and frog samples were found at 20 mg/L exposed for 72 h. The water samples indicated that exposure to 10 mg/L of Cd for 24 h was significantly different from the control (p < 0.05). Cd concentrations in frogs differed significantly between the control and experimental groups (p < 0.05). The cytotoxicity assessment revealed ten types of CA in the frogs, including single chromatid gap (SCG), isochromatid gap, single chromatid break, isochromatid break, iso-arm fragmentation, single chromatid decomposition, centric fragmentation, centromere gap, deletion and fragmentation. The most common CA in the study was SCG. The statistical analysis indicated significant differences in the percentage of cells with CA for exposures of 20 mg/L (24 h), 10 and 20 mg/L (48 h) and 5, 10 and 20 mg/L (72 h) compared to the control (p < 0.05). The results of this study show that high Cd concentrations and long duration exposure can cause CA in frogs.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018cKKU 2018 3aFejervarya 3acadmium 3acadmium chloride 3acentromeres 3achromosome aberrations 3acytotoxicity 3afrogs 3astatistical analysis 0aCytotoxicity 0aexposure 0acadmium 0aamphibian 0afrog 0aFejervarya limnocharis1 aThitiyan, Thitaporn1 aTanomtong, Alongklod1 aTengjaroenkul, Bundit1 aNeeratanaphan, Lamyai0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 75, no. 6 p.978-989dRoutledgewJournal:12219x1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2018.14724493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008800166300001800254520125100272592002801523650001401551650001601565650001701581650001201598650001801610650001601628650000901644650001401653650001901667650001401686650001301700700002801713700003101741700001901772700002301791700003001814700002701844773010701871856007801978852000902056655001202065IND60137857420221118031358.0150524e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013785742DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2014004792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicolas, Jonathan10aDetection of marine neurotoxins in food safety testing using a multielectrode array  ap. 2369-2378.  aSCOPE: At the European level, detection of marine neurotoxins in seafood is still based on ethically debated and expensive in vivo rodent bioassays. The development of alternative methodologies for the detection of marine neurotoxins is therefore of utmost importance. We therefore investigated whether and to what extent a multielectrode array (MEA) approach can be used as an in vitro alternative for screening of marine neurotoxins potentially present in seafood. METHODS: This MEA approach utilizes rat cortical neurons comprising a wide range of ion channels/pumps and neurotransmitter receptors targeted by marine neurotoxins. We tested the effects of neurotoxic model compounds, pure marine neurotoxins, and extracts from contaminated seafood on neuronal activity of rat cortical neurons cultured on commercial 48‐well plates to increase throughput. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that the MEA approach has a sensitivity of 88% (7/9 model compounds, 6/6 pure marine neurotoxins, and 2/2 marine neurotoxins present in seafood extracts were correctly identified) and a good reproducibility compared to existing in vitro alternatives. We therefore conclude that this MEA‐based approach could be a valuable tool for future food safety testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3afood safety 3aion channels 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotoxins 3arats 3areceptors 3asafety testing 3ascreening 3aseafoods1 aHendriksen, Peter J.

In particular, the St. Marys River, a Great Lakes connecting channel, lost >50% of its historic rapids habitat over the past century. In 2016, the natural flow was restored to the Little Rapids area of the St. Marys River. The goal of our study was to evaluate physical and ecological responses to the restoration of the Little Rapids area. Extensive habitat and biological data were collected prior to restoration (2013 and 2014), and after restoration (2017 and 2018). Measured parameters included total suspended solids, current velocity, benthic macroinvertebrates, and larval, juvenile, and adult fishes. Total suspended solids stayed low (<4 mg/L) following restoration, with the exception of a single construction‐related event. Pre‐restoration data indicated that all measured velocities were below the target flow rate of 0.24 m/s, whereas 70% of the measured habitat was above the target flow post‐restoration. Abundance and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates were reduced following restoration (>90% reduction). We observed a 45% increase in richness of larval fish 2 years after restoration and a 131% increase in catch per unit effort. For adult fishes, the proportion of individuals with a preference for fast‐moving waters increased from 1.5 to 45% in the restored area, and from 7 to 15% upstream of the restored area; a similar response was observed for lithophilic spawners. The physical and biological conditions of the Little Rapids improved and resembled conditions typical of rapids habitat extent in other areas of the river and other systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cGreat Lakes Commission  cGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative  cU.S. Geological Survey  cMichigan Department of Natural Resources  cNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3aadults 3aaquatic habitat 3aecological restoration 3afish larvae 3ajuveniles 3amacroinvertebrates 3arivers 3aMichigan1 aEllis, Eric1 aKapuscinski, Kevin L.1 aRoseman, Edward F.1 aHeatlie, Terry1 aMoerke, Ashley0 tRestoration ecology.g2021 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.e13310-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.133103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245020300177300001600380520128700396592002801683650001701711650002601728650001401754650001101768650001101779650001101790650001501801650002301816650001501839650001001854650001601864650001901880650001701899651001501916651001401931651001401945653003201959653005001991653001702041653002602058653003402084653001302118653002202131700002502153773009702178856008502275852000902360655001202369IND60573711820221119035154.0170724e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371182DNAL7 a10.1080/21658005.2017.13235882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacevičius, Egidijus10aFirst record of the European hake (Merluccius merluccius (Linnaeus, 1758): Actinopterygii: Gadiformes: Merlucciidae) in the coastal zone of Lithuania (southeastern Baltic Sea: eastern Gotland basin)  ap. 117-123.  aOn 10 September 2015, a specimen of the European Hake (Merluccius merluccius Linnaeus, 1758). It is the first documented report on this boreal-subtropic, benthopelagic fish in the brakish water area of the southeastern part of the Baltic Sea. The fish was caught during the hydrological autumn, before the disappearance of the seasonal thermocline near Šventoji. The fish assemblage was dominated by seasonally prevalent marine and freshwater straggler fishes. The total length (TL) of the specimen was 51.3 cm, and weight 901.75 g. It was a 3.5–4-year-old male fish with its ogives in maturity stage III. A roundworm Contracaecum acus (Rudolphi, 1809) was detected in its intestine. Remains of Bylgides sarsi were found in the gut. The specimen was caught after the Major Baltic Inflow in December 2014. This marine fish entered the semiclosed low-salinity zone, which is beyond the optimal feeding and reproduction area in the North Sea, indicating spatial and temporal connections between the two seas. A distributional shift of rare marine fishes, which was evidenced by their more frequent catches in 2015–2016. Straggler fishes are distinguished from native species by the presence of translocated Trematoda and Nematoda that are characteristic of higher salinity waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aContracaecum 3aMerluccius merluccius 3aTrematoda 3aautumn 3abasins 3acoasts 3afreshwater 3aindigenous species 3aintestines 3amales 3amarine fish 3amaturity stage 3areproduction 3aBaltic Sea 3aLithuania 3aNorth Sea 0aThe southeastern Baltic Sea 0aEast Gotland Basin: Lithuanian shallow waters 0abiodiversity 0aMerluccius merluccius 0amarine straggler fish species 0aparasite 0aContracaecum acus1 aKregždys, Žilvinas0 tZoology and ecology.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 27, no. 2 p.117-123dTaylor & Francisx2165-80137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21658005.2017.13235883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245005200163300001400215500002000229520077900249592002801028650001801056650002001074650002001094650001101114650001201125650001501137650002201152700002401174773010601198856007301304852000901377655001201386IND60572023620221117095438.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057202362DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.012702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiltschko, Wolfgang10aHoming pigeons as a model for avian navigation?  ap. 66-74.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe findings on the navigational mechanisms of homing pigeons and the available data on those of wild birds, in particular migrants, are compared. There are important parallels in the use of the magnetic field and the sun for directional orientation. Also the findings on the navigational ‘map’, its preferred use by experienced birds and the strategy of using route information to acquire the necessary knowledge to establish the ‘map’, obtained in pigeons studies, can probably be generalized to wild birds and migrants in their home region. It seems that birds share a common navigational system. Special development of migratory birds, however, is the innate migration program that enables young first‐time migrants to reach their still unknown wintering area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColumba livia 3amagnetic fields 3amigratory birds 3amodels 3apigeons 3awild birds 3awintering grounds1 aWiltschko, Roswitha0 tJournal of avian biology.g2017 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.66-74dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.012703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04072naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245011800177520210700295592002802402650001002430650002602440650002802466650000902494650001702503650001302520650000902533650002202542650001002564650001102574650001602585650001402601650000902615650002202624650002002646653000902666653000802675653000802683653000902691653000902700653000802709653000802717653000802725653000802733653000902741653000702750653000802757653001502765653003402780653002302814653001402837653002802851700002002879700002002899700001902919700001602938700002002954700001902974700001602993700002203009700002103031700002103052700001703073700001903090773013003109856009003239852000903329655001203338IND60761094820221118233857.0220124e20220216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076109482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1095032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakabayashi, Yuki10aIsolation and characterization of Staphylococcus argenteus strains from retail foods and slaughterhouses in Japan  aStaphylococcus argenteus has been recently established as a novel species of Staphylococcus aureus complex. It is known to cause various human diseases, such as skin and soft-tissue infections, sepsis, and staphylococcal food poisoning, although the source of infection has not been clearly described. In food poisoning cases, the source of bacterial contamination in food is unknown. This study examined the prevalence of S. argenteus among retail fresh food and poultry slaughterhouses in Japan. Among 642 food samples examined, successful isolation of S. argenteus was achieved in 21 of 151 (13.9%) chicken samples. No isolations from pork, beef, fish, or vegetables in retail markets were confirmed. Multiple-locus sequence typing revealed that the 21 isolates were classified into four sequence types (ST) that were divided into 14 subtypes using spa-typing. All food isolates were susceptible to methicillin and did not show positivity for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene. When bacteria were isolated from two poultry slaughterhouses in the same region, 14 S. argenteus strains were successfully isolated from only one slaughterhouse. Thirteen of 14 strains were isolated from a poultry carcass and slaughterhouse environments during a certain sampling period and were all classified as ST5961 with identical spa-type. Also, the number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected on the core genomes of the same 13 strains were between 0 and 17, suggesting a long-term inhabitation of an S. argenteus strain inside the facility. Furthermore, one isolate from chicken meat was also genetically linked with the same lineage of slaughterhouse isolates, with ≤15 SNVs being detected. Additionally, one slaughterhouse isolate from chiller water and three chicken isolates were classified into the same cluster by phylogenetic analysis, although the number of pairwise SNVs ranged from 62 to 128. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrated S. argenteus in a food processing facility and the possible bacterial contamination on food during food processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacterial contamination 3abeef 3achicken meat 3achickens 3afish 3afood microbiology 3agenes 3ahumans 3amethicillin 3aphylogeny 3apork 3apoultry carcasses 3aslaughterhouses 0aBAPS 0aBHI 0aCPS 0aMLST 0aMRSA 0aPVL 0aSAC 0aSEs 0aSFP 0aSNVs 0aST 0aWGS 0aPrevalence 0aStaphylococcus aureus complex 0aFood-borne illness 0aGenotypes 0aWhole-genome sequencing1 aTakemoto, Kohei1 aIwasaki, Satomi1 aYajima, Tomoya1 aKido, Akiko1 aYamauchi, Akiko1 aKuroiwa, Kyoko1 aKumai, Yuko1 aYoshihara, Shizue1 aTokumoto, Hayato1 aKawatsu, Kentaro1 aYasugi, Mayo1 aMiyake, Masami0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2022 Feb. 16, v. 363 p.109503-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1095033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245009800206500001900304500002000323520179900343592002802142596006802170596006302238650001302301650001202314650002602326650002702352650002602379650001502405650001002420650001302430650002102443650002302464650001802487650001902505650001202524650001502536650001702551700005802568700006402626700006702690700007302757773012202830856007302952852000903025655001203034IND60723067720221120205314.0210111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072306772DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.133032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnésimo, Cecilia M.

Mining has produced great impacts on this ecosystem. Spontaneous regeneration of abandoned canga mined areas has not been observed. One of the active methods most widely used for ecological restoration in environments where soil has been lost or severely degraded is topsoil transposition due to the physical, chemical, and microbiological improvement of the substrate, in addition to the seed bank. Thus, plant succession was monitored for 40 months after topsoil transposition in a canga area degraded by aluminum mining, without any other type of management. A completely randomized design with 70 permanent plots (1 × 1 m) was used. Annual phytosociological surveys were carried out and floristic and vegetational spectra were constructed with the life‐forms proposed by Raunkiaer. Floristic composition was compared with a reference site. Overall, 105 species were identified. Both flora and vegetation changed over time, increasing resemblance to the reference areas. The floristic and vegetational spectra after 4 years of topsoil deposition are similar to pristine ones. The vegetation spectrum showed an increase in the dominance of phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes, while therophytes reduced their proportion. The early successional stage is dominated by weeds, like in other canga restoration studies, but did not impede the native species regeneration. Cangas's species recruited well from transposed topsoil. Unlike other studies with fertilized topsoil, our findings show the efficiency of topsoil transposition to provide initial conditions for the ecological restoration of this ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais 3aaluminum 3abauxite 3abotanical composition 3aecological restoration 3aecological succession 3aecosystems 3aflora 3ahabitats 3ahemicryptophytes 3aindigenous species 3aphanerophytes 3aphytosociology 3atopsoil 3avegetation 3awoody plants1 aDias, Diego D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8154-14791 aVale Beirão, Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4573-998X1 aKozovits, Alessandra R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7312-00761 aMessias, Maria Cristina T.

All the adsorption isotherms onto activated carbons were described by the Freundlich equation. To analyze the isotherms on the polymeric adsorbents the Langmuir-Freundlich equation was used. It was found that in the low range of the concentrations the adsorptive properties of the activated carbons are reduced in the following direction DTO>WD-ekstra>CWZ-22>AG>A>AG5. Reducing the adsorptive properties of the polymeric adsorbents states was carried out in the following order: XE-340> XE-572>XE-563>XE-348. The adsorbents XE-340, XE-572 and XE-563 have much more higher adsorptive properties than the applied activated carbons. Lower adsorptive properties of XE-348 are the result of its high surface polarity.  aPublisher supplied data 0a1,2-dichloropropane 0aactivated carbon 0aadsorption 0apolymeric adsorbents 0awaste1 aMilchert, Eugeniusz0 tPolish Journal of Chemical Technology.g2007 Oct. 19, v. 9, no. 2 p.34-36dVersitax1899-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10026-007-0021-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245014400178300001600322520101500338592002801353653001901381653002801400653002101428653002201449653004101471700002201512700001801534700001701552773010301569856008701672852000901759655001201768IND60594048020221118114828.0180510e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059404802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasini, Mariacecilia10aSolid-state Effects in the Cyclovoltammetric HOMO-LUMO Determination: The case of Dinitrophenyl-hydrazone α,Ͽ-substituted Oligothiophenes  ap. 261-267.  aNew acceptor⿿donor⿿acceptor (A-D-A) small molecules consisting of a central thiophene-based donor building block, i.e. 3-dodecyl-thiophene (for NTN) and 3,3⿲⿿-dihexyl-terthiophene (for NT3N), and dinitrophenyl-hydrazone acceptor ends were synthesized. The materials display intense optical absorption spectra with absorption edge down to 1.65eV. Cyclic voltammetry in solution shows oxidation and reduction processes with HOMO and LUMO energy levels at -5.6 and -3.5eV. Cyclic voltammetry of NT3N cast films displays an unusual splitting of both oxidation and reduction peaks into two components with the same potential separation (0.45V). Films of tetrahexyl-sexithiophene, selected as a model compound of NT3N without polar ends, show an analogous albeit much lower (0.13V) splitting of the first one-electron oxidation process.

A critical step in determining air pollutant emissions from the barns at these facilities is the accurate assessment and continuous monitoring of the barn ventilation rates. One of the most recent efforts to accurately determine barn ventilation rate was to continuously monitor fan operation, differential static pressure, fan speed, and air density related environmental variables, coupled with in-situ fan performance assessments at a range of static pressures, as applied in the 24-month National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). Uncertainty analyses associated with these calculations aided in characterising and qualifying the measurements. This paper describes methods used in the NAEMS to determine ventilation rates of four rooms (rooms 5–8) in a mechanically-ventilated pig finishing quad barn. The overall 2-yr average daily dry-standard ventilation rates (mean ± SD) were 13.5 ± 11.3, 13.8 ± 11.6, 14.5 ± 12.9, and 13.6 ± 12.9 m3 [dry-standard] s−1 for rooms 5–8, respectively. Thorough uncertainty analyses demonstrated that the estimated uncertainty of the ventilation rate (dry-standard) under typical site conditions decreased from 9.4% to 4.1% between the minimum (3.7 m3 [ds] s−1) and maximum (45.2 m3 [ds] s−1) capacities of the ventilation system. These results confirmed that larger numbers of operating fans lead to lower relative uncertainties for barn ventilation rates and that the uncertainty of ventilation rate measurements can be reduced by improved and more frequent in-situ fan calibrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3abarns 3aconcentrated animal feeding operations 3aemissions 3aenvironmental factors 3afinishing 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3aventilation systems 0aVentilation rate 0aFan model 0aUncertainty 0aLivestock housing 0aSwine 0aPig1 aLim, Teng-Teeh1 aJin, Yaomin1 aHeber, Albert J.1 aNi, Ji-Qin1 aCortus, Erin L.1 aKilic, Ilker0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 May, v. 121 p.96-104dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008800169300001600257520150000273592002801773650002001801650001401821650002001835650001001855650003501865653003801900653002201938653002701960653001301987653001902000653002602019700002102045700001802066700002102084700002302105700001902128700001902147773011802166856008502284852000902369655001202378IND60622855420221120201142.0190403e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062285542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2018.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoskát, Csaba10aAre both notes of the common cuckoo’s call necessary for familiarity recognition?  ap. 685-690.  aCommon cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) are best known for their simple two-note calls (“cu-coo”), which are uttered only by males during the breeding season. A previous playback study revealed that territorial males were more tolerant toward playbacks of the calls of familiar, neighbouring individuals than toward unfamiliar, stranger simulated intruders, exhibiting the classical “dear-enemy” phenomenon. Here we experimentally assessed whether the acoustic cues for familiarity recognition are encoded in the first and/or second note of these simple calls. To do so, we played mixed sound files to radio-tagged cuckoos, where the first part of the two-note calls was taken from strangers and the second part from neighbours, or vice versa. As controls, we used behavioural data from two-note neighbour and two-note stranger call playbacks. Cuckoos responded consistently to the two types of mixed sound files. When either the first or second note of the call was taken from a stranger and the other note from a neighbour, they responded to these sound files similarly to two-note playbacks of strangers: they approached the speaker of the playbacks more closely and the calling response-latency to playbacks was longer than to familiar controls. These findings point to the importance of both notes in familiarity recognition. We conclude that familiarity recognition in male common cuckoos needs the complete structure of the two-note cuckoo call, which is characteristic for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuculus canorus 3aacoustics 3abreeding season 3amales 3aradio frequency identification 0aNeighbour-stranger discrimination 0aDear-enemy effect 0aIndividual recognition 0aPlayback 0aSound analysis 0aAcoustic manipulation1 aHauber, Márk E.1 aBán, Miklós1 aFülöp, Attila,1 aGeltsch, Nikoletta1 aMarton, Attila1 aElek, Zoltán,0 tBehavioural processes.g2018 Dec., v. 157 p.685-690dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2018.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01955naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245008600175300001400261520095500275592002801230653001201258653002001270653002101290653000801311700002101319700002601340700002301366700002301389700002301412773010401435856008101539852000901620655001201629IND60520433520221120201414.0160520e20071019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052043352DNAL7 a10.2478/v10026-007-0024-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzynkowska, Małgorzata14aThe mercury analysis in airborne particles emitted from coal-combustion processes  ap. 46-48.  aDetermination of trace elements in combusted materials has always been an interesting field of environmental studies. Particulate matter, in particular, is a serious problem which, can lead to air pollution especially by heavy metals emissions in urban and industrial areas. There is a considerable concern about the elevated level of mercury released during combustion and the proportion of anthropogenic mercury in the environment. Nowadays, small-scale installations have been identified as a significant source-pathway for mercury pollution, particularly those that use coal. A total amount of mercury was determined using Mercury Analyzer. The investigated material consists of bottom ash, fly ash, slag, soot or dust. The obtained results varied according to the type of the material and plant. The developed methodology was checked by carrying out the analysis of certificate material of Soil NCS ZC 73001 and the reference material of Soil-7.  aPublisher supplied data 0amercury 0acoal-combustion 0amercury analyzer 0aash1 aLeśniewska, Ewa1 aPawlaczyk, Aleksandra1 aAlbińska, Jadwiga1 aBawolak, Katarzyna1 aParyjczak, Tadeusz0 tPolish Journal of Chemical Technology.g2007 Oct. 19, v. 9, no. 2 p.46-48dVersitax1899-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10026-007-0024-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245009500166300001800261520179600279592002802075650001502103650001402118650002802132650001702160650001702177650001702194650001702211650001502228650001602243650001902259650002102278650003402299650001602333650001502349650001602364650001702380650001602397651001202413700002102425700002502446773010702471856007802578852000902656655001202665IND60137857920221118031345.0150524e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013785792DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2014004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerding, Johannes10aDetermination of mycotoxin exposure in Germany using an LC‐MS/MS multibiomarker approach  ap. 2358-2368.  aSCOPE: In this study, the exposure of a German population (n = 101) to mycotoxins was assessed using an LC‐MS/MS urinary multibiomarker approach. Food consumption of the participants was documented with a food frequency questionnaire to correlate mycotoxin exposure with individual nutritional habits. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of 23 urinary biomarkers including trichothecenes (deoxynivalenol (DON), DON‐3‐glucuronide (DON‐3‐GlcA), T‐2 toxin, HT‐2 toxin (HT‐2, HT‐2‐toxin‐4‐glucuronide (HT‐2‐GlcA), fumonisins (fumonisin B₁,fumonisin B₂), aflatoxins (aflatoxin B₁, aflatoxin G₂, aflatoxin B₂, aflatoxin M₁), zearalenone and derivatives (zearalanone, α‐zearalenol, β‐zearalenol, zearalenone‐14‐O‐glucuronide, zearalanone‐14‐O‐glucuronide, α‐zearalenol‐14‐O‐glucuronide/β‐zearalenol‐14‐O‐glucuronide), ochratoxin A, ochratoxin alpha, enniatin B and dihydrocitrinone was evaluated using a validated, sensitive “dilute and shoot”‐LC‐MS/MS method applying Scheduled MRMᵀᴹtechnology. Six mycotoxins and urinary metabolites were detected (DON, DON‐3‐GlcA, zearalenone‐14‐O‐glucuronide, T‐2 toxin, enniatin B, and dihydrocitrinone) in 87% of the samples in single‐ or co‐occurence. Only DON and DON‐3‐GlcA were detectable in quantifiable amounts. A provisional mean daily intake of 0.52 μg DON/kg body weight was calculated. No statistical evidence for the correlation of staple food intake and urinary biomarker concentration could be determined. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest a low everyday exposure of the investigated German population to mycotoxins, but reveal peak exposures above the widely accepted tolerable daily intake to DON in parts of the population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHT-2 toxin 3aT-2 toxin 3aacceptable daily intake 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin B2 3aaflatoxin G2 3aaflatoxin M1 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3adeoxynivalenol 3afood consumption 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3afumonisins 3ametabolites 3aochratoxin A 3azearalenone 3aGermany1 aCramer, Benedikt1 aHumpf, Hans‐Ulrich0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2014 Dec., v. 58, no. 12 p.2358-2368dWiley-VCHx1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2014004063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245017600162300002000338520138500358592002801743650002001771650001901791650001501810650001701825650001901842650001601861650002101877650001601898650001301914650002101927650000901948650001601957650001701973650001101990650001002001650002702011651001002038700001302048700001402061700001702075700001402092700001502106700001502121700001702136700001802153700001702171700005602188773014302244856007902387852000902466655001202475IND60620169920221120142713.0181106e20180927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062016992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b030442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Yongjie10aEffects of Personal Short-Term Exposure to Ambient Ozone on Blood Pressure and Vascular Endothelial Function: A Mechanistic Study Based on DNA Methylation and Metabolomics  ap. 12774-12782.  aShort-term exposure to ambient ozone is associated with adverse cardiovascular effects, with inconsistent evidence on the molecular mechanisms. We conducted a longitudinal panel study among 43 college students in Shanghai to explore the effects of personal ozone exposure on blood pressure (BP), vascular endothelial function, and the potential molecular mechanisms. We measured real-time personal ozone exposure levels, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), and locus-specific DNA methylation of ACE and EDN1 (coding ET-1). We used an untargeted metabolomic approach to explore potentially important metabolites. We applied linear mixed-effect models to examine the effects of ozone on the above biomarkers. An increase in 2 h-average ozone exposure was significantly associated with elevated levels of BP, ACE, and ET-1. ACE and EDN1 methylation decreased with ozone exposure, but the magnitude differed by genomic loci. Metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in serum lipid metabolites following ozone exposure that are involved in maintaining vascular endothelial function. Our findings suggested that acute exposure to ambient ozone can elevate serum levels of ACE and ET-1, decrease their DNA methylation, and alter the lipid metabolism, which may be partly responsible for the effects of ozone on BP and vascular endothelial function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aacute exposure 3abiomarkers 3ablood lipids 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3acollege students 3aendothelins 3agenomics 3alipid metabolism 3aloci 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3aozone 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aChina1 aNiu, Yue1 aCai, Jing1 aLin, Zhijing1 aLiu, Cong1 aLi, Huichu1 aChen, Chen1 aSong, Weimin1 aZhao, Zhuohui1 aChen, Renjie1 aKan, Haidong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1871-89990 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Sept. 27, v. 52, no. 21 p.12774-12782dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b030443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245008400167520149900251592002801750650001001778650001401788650003501802650001101837650001101848650001701859650001701876651001301893700002401906773016101930856007702091852000902168655001202177IND60757766820221123040811.0211125e20211028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075776682DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi101107312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavares, Joana Paulo10aSpatial Modeling and Analysis of the Determinants of Property Crime in Portugal  aMany researchers have unraveled innovative ways of examining geographic information to better understand the determinants of crime, thus contributing to an improved understanding of the phenomenon. Property crimes represent more than half of the crimes reported in Portugal. This study investigates the spatial distribution of crimes against property in mainland Portugal with the primary goal of determining which demographic and socioeconomic factors may be associated with crime incidence in each municipality. For this purpose, Geographic Information System (GIS) tools were used to analyze spatial patterns, and different Poisson-based regression models were investigated, namely global models, local Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) models, and semi-parametric GWPR models. The GWPR model with eight independent variables outperformed the others. Its independent variables were the young resident population, retention and dropout rates in basic education, gross enrollment rate, conventional dwellings, Guaranteed Minimum Income and Social Integration Benefit, purchasing power per capita, unemployment rate, and foreign population. The model presents a better fit in the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto and their neighboring municipalities. The association of each independent variable with crime varies significantly across municipalities. Consequently, these particularities should be considered in the design of policies to reduce the rate of property crimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrime 3aeducation 3ageographic information systems 3aincome 3amodels 3aspatial data 3aunemployment 3aPortugal1 aCosta, Ana Cristina0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Oct. 28, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi101107313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05056naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003900132024001100171040001800182100002300200245010800223300001600331506017300347520218700520592002802707650001302735650001402748650002102762650002202783650002102805650001202826650001102838650001502849650002402864650002802888650002802916650002902944650002002973650002302993650002203016650002603038650001903064650001303083650002103096650002603117650001503143650001403158650001103172650002003183650002403203650001903227650001203246650001003258651001303268651002403281651002903305651001303334653002203347653002603369653003603395653002803431653002903459653003103488653001003519700002803529700003203557700002203589700002203611700002603633700002403659773013303683856008603816856011203902956017804014961001304192852000904205655001204214IND60006201620221214224113.0190410e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000620162DNAL7 a2998212aris7 a10113/620162hdl7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30001-12doi8 ans9117  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKELLY, Charlene N.10aSwitchgrass Biochar Effects on Plant Biomass and Microbial Dynamics in Two Soils from Different Regions  ap. 329-342.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBiochar amendments to soils may alter soil function and fertility in various ways, including through induced changes in the microbial community. We assessed microbial activity and community composition of two distinct clayey soil types, an Aridisol from Colorado (CO) in the U.S. Central Great Plains, and an Alfisol from Virginia (VA) in the southeastern USA following the application of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) biochar. The switchgrass biochar was applied at four levels, 0%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10%, approximately equivalent to biochar additions of 0, 25, 50, and 100 t ha−1, respectively, to the soils grown with wheat (Triticum aestivum) in an eight-week growth chamber experiment. We measured wheat shoot biomass and nitrogen (N) content and soil nutrient availability and N mineralization rates, and characterized the microbial fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles of the soils. Net N mineralization rates decreased in both soils in proportion to an increase in biochar levels, but the effect was more marked in the VA soil, where net N mineralization decreased from −2.1 to −38.4 mg kg−1. The 10% biochar addition increased soil pH, electrical conductivity, Mehlich- and bicarbonate-extractable phosphorus (P), and extractable potassium (K) in both soil types. The wheat shoot biomass decreased from 17.7 to 9.1 g with incremental additions of biochar in the CO soil, but no difference was noted in plants grown in the VA soil. The FAME recovery assay indicated that the switchgrass biochar addition could introduce artifacts in analysis, so the results needed to be interpreted with caution. Non-corrected total FAME concentrations indicated a decline by 45% and 34% with 10% biochar addition in the CO and VA soils, respectively, though these differences became nonsignificant when the extraction efficiency correction factor was applied. A significant decline in the fungi:bacteria ratio was still evident upon correction in the CO soil with biochar. Switchgrass biochar had the potential to cause short-term negative impacts on plant biomass and alter soil microbial community structure unless measures were taken to add supplemental N and labile carbon (C).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aAridisols 3aPanicum virgatum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3acarbon 3aclay soils 3acommunity structure 3adry matter accumulation 3aelectrical conductivity 3afatty acid methyl esters 3agrowth chambers 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3ashoots 3asoil amendments 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nutrients 3asoil pH 3awheat 3aColorado 3aGreat Plains region 3aMidwestern United States 3aVirginia 0acorrection factor 0aextraction efficiency 0afatty acid methyl ester profile 0anitrogen mineralization 0asoil microbial community 0asoil nutrient availability 0awheat1 aCALDERÓN, Francisco C.1 aACOSTA-MARTÍNEZ, Verónica1 aMIKHA, Maysoon M.1 aBinyamin, Joseph,1 aRutherford, David W.,1 aRostad, Colleen E.,0 tPedosphere.g2015 June, v. 25, no. 3 p.329-342dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30001-13Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/620163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Calderon%20-%20Switchgrass%20biochar%20effects%20on%20plant%20biomass%20and%20microbial%20dynamics.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002100135024001900156040001800175100001800193245002500211300001200236506007600248520123100324592002801555506003701583650001501620650003301635650001301668650001101681650001801692650002001710650002201730650001301752650003101765650001301796650001401809650001701823650001601840650002101856650001901877650001201896650001101908700002601919700002001945700002401965773010301989856008702092852000902179655001202188IND60119467220221207062611.0141214e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011946722DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2002-3-4-reviews30062doi7 aPMC1393522pmcid7 a119830662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, Ben M.,10aRetroviral proteases  ap. 359.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe proteases of retroviruses, such as leukemia viruses, immunodeficiency viruses (including the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV), infectious anemia viruses, and mammary tumor viruses, form a family with the proteases encoded by several retrotransposons in Drosophila and yeast and endogenous viral sequences in primates. Retroviral proteases are key enzymes in viral propagation and are initially synthesized with other viral proteins as polyprotein precursors that are subsequently cleaved by the viral protease activity at specific sites to produce mature, functional units. Active retroviral proteases are homodimers, with each dimer structurally related to the larger class of single-chain aspartic peptidases. Each monomer has four structural elements: two distinct hairpin loops, a wide loop containing the catalytic aspartic acid and an α helix. Retroviral gene sequences can vary between infected individuals, and mutations affecting the binding cleft of the protease or the substrate cleavage sites can alter the response of the virus to therapeutic drugs. The need to develop new drugs against HIV will continue to be, to a large extent, the driving force behind further characterization of retroviral proteases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aPrimates 3aanemia 3aaspartic acid 3aenzyme activity 3aimmunosuppression 3aleukemia 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3amutation 3anew drugs 3apolyproteins 3aproteinases 3aretrotransposons 3aviral proteins 3aviruses 3ayeasts1 aGoodenow, Maureen M.,1 aGustchina, Alla1 aWlodawer, Alexander0 tGenome biology.g2002 Apr., v. 3, no. 4 p.359-359dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2002-3-4-reviews30063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245008600162520143200248592002801680650001401708650001601722650001101738650001301749650001601762650002401778650001001802650001601812650001701828650001901845700001601864700001901880700001501899700001501914773016101929856007702090852000902167655001202176IND60757767020221120034740.0211125e20211028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075776702DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi101107322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Xiongfeng 10aBuilding Typification in Map Generalization Using Affinity Propagation Clustering  aBuilding typification is of theoretical interest and practical significance in map generalization. It aims to transform an initial set of buildings to a subset, while maintaining the essential distribution characteristics and important individual buildings. This study focuses on buildings located in residential suburban or rural areas and generalizes them to medium or small scale, for which the typification process can be viewed as point-similar object selection that generates exemplars in local building clusters. From this view, we propose a novel building typification approach using affinity propagation exemplar-based clustering. Based on a sparse graph constructed on the input building set, the proposed approach considers all buildings as potential cluster exemplars and keeps passing messages between those objects; thus, high-quality representative objects (i.e., exemplars) of the initial building set can be obtained and further outputted as the typified result. Experiments with real-life building data show that the proposed method is superior to the two existing representative methods in maintaining the overall distribution characteristics. Meanwhile, the importance of each individual building and the constraints of the road network can be embedded flexibly in this method, which gives some advantages in terms of preserving important buildings and the local structural distribution along the road, etc.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aexhibitions 3agraphs 3ajournals 3amethodology 3aresidential housing 3aroads 3arural areas 3aspatial data 3asuburban areas1 aChen, Huan 1 aHuang, Haoran 1 aLiu, Qian 1 aYang, Min 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Oct. 28, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi101107323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014000154300001800294520162800312592002801940650002501968650002001993650001302013650001202026650001202038650001602050650002602066650002102092650003102113650002402144650001002168650003502178650002402213650001602237650001902253650001902272650001202291650001402303650002002317650001402337650001402351650001302365650001802378650001202396653001602408653001102424653000902435653001502444653002402459653002002483700001802503700001302521700001902534700001502553700001902568773012602587856007402713852000902787655001202796IND60152115720221119024051.0150529e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015211572DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcu1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Kang10aArabidopsis thaliana Phosphoinositide-Specific Phospholipase C Isoform 3 (AtPLC3) and AtPLC9 have an Additive Effect on Thermotolerance  ap. 1873-1883.  aThe heat stress response is an important adaptation, enabling plants to survive challenging environmental conditions. Our previous work demonstrated that Arabidopsis thaliana Phosphoinositide-Specific Phospholipase C Isoform 9 (AtPLC9) plays an important role in thermotolerance. During prolonged heat treatment, mutants of AtPLC3 showed decreased heat resistance. We observed no obvious phenotypic differences between plc3 mutants and wild type (WT) seedlings under normal growth conditions, but after heat shock, the plc3 seedlings displayed a decline in thermotolerance compared with WT, and also showed a 40–50% decrease in survival rate and chlorophyll contents. Expression of AtPLC3 in plc3 mutants rescued the heat-sensitive phenotype; the AtPLC3 -overexpressing lines also exhibited much higher heat resistance than WT and vector-only controls. The double mutants of plc3 and plc9 displayed increased sensitivity to heat stress, compared with either single mutant. In transgenic lines containing a AtPLC3:GUS promoter fusion, GUS staining showed that AtPLC3 expresses in all tissues, except anthers and young root tips. Using the Ca ²⁺-sensitive fluorescent probe Fluo-3/AM and aequorin reconstitution, we showed that plc3 mutants show a reduction in the heat-induced Ca ²⁺ increase. The expression of HSP genes (HSP18.2 , HSP25.3 , HSP70-1 and HSP83) was down-regulated in plc3 mutants and up-regulated in AtPLC3 -overexpressing lines after heat shock. These results indicated that AtPLC3 also plays a role in thermotolerance in Arabidopsis , and that AtPLC3 and AtPLC9 function additionally to each other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aadditive effect 3aaequorin 3aanthers 3acalcium 3achlorophyll 3aenvironmental factors 3afluorescent dyes 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphospholipase C 3aroot tips 3aseedlings 3astaining 3asurvival rate 3atissues 0aArabidopsis 0aAtPLC3 0aCa2+ 0aHeat shock 0aSignal transduction 0aThermotolerance1 aLiu, Yu-Liang1 aLi, Bing1 aZhou, Ren-Gang1 aSun, Da-Ye1 aZheng, Shu-Zhi0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.1873-1883dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245012100171300001800292520116800310592002801478650003101506650002101537650001401558650002001572650001401592650001001606650002001616650002401636650002101660650002601681650002001707650001301727650001101740700002001751700001801771773011701789856005501906852000901961655001201970IND4510123720221120041648.0150730e200011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451012372DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01754.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGronow, Sabine10aComparative functional characterization in vitro of heptosyltransferase I (WaaC) and II (WaaF) from Escherichia coli  ap. 6602-6611.  aHeptosyltransferase II, encoded by the waaF gene of Escherichia coli, is a glycosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the inner core region of lipopolysaccharide.

This study aims to examine the contamination level, health risks and source apportionment of Tl in common vegetables from typical farmlands distributed over a densely populated residential area in a pyrite mine city, which has been exploiting Tl-bearing pyrite minerals over 50 years. Results showed excessive Tl levels were exhibited in most of the vegetables (0.16–20.33 mg/kg) and alarming health risks may induce from the vegetables via the food chain. Source apportionment of Tl contamination in vegetables was then evaluated by using Pb isotope fingerprinting technique. Both vegetables and soils were characterized with overall low ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb. This indicated that a significant contribution may be ascribed to the anthropogenic activities involving pyrite deposit exploitation, whose raw material and salgs were featured with lower ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb. Further calculation by binary mixing model suggested that pyrite mining and smelting activities contributed 54–88% to the thallium contamination in vegetables. The results highlighted that Pb isotope tracing is a suitable technique for source apportionment of Tl contamination in vegetables and prime contamination from pyrite mining/smelting activities urges authorities to initiate proper practices of remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aanthropogenic activities 3afood chain 3afood security 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3aisotope labeling 3alead 3amining 3apyrite 3araw materials 3aremediation 3aresidential areas 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 3athallium 3atoxicity 3avegetables 0aMetal contamination 0aIsotopic analysis 0aSource apportionment 0aFood safety 0aPlant uptake1 aWei, Xudong1 aZhou, Yuting1 aTsang, Daniel C.W.1 aBao, Zhi'an1 aYin, Meiling1 aLippold, Holger1 aYuan, Wenhuan1 aWang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0250-74091 aFeng, Yuexing1 aChen, Diyun0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 703 p.135547-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014300160300001600303520125500319592002801574650001901602650002401621650002801645650001901673650001801692650001101710650003001721650001601751650001301767650001401780650002301794650001501817700002401832700002001856700001801876700002501894773012701919856007502046852000902121655001202130IND60657830820221121042555.0190823e20130730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065783082DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60026b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Peng-Yuan10aHigh-throughput characterisation of osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells using pore size gradients on porous alumina  ap. 924-932.  aThe ability to control the cellular response is of critical importance when designing advanced biomaterials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. An important aspect of biointerfacial interactions is surface topography at the nanoscale and therefore this needs to be taken into consideration. Here, a pore size gradient in porous alumina (pAl) was fabricated with pore sizes ranging from 50 nm to 3 μm. The attachment behaviour and osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was investigated along this topography gradient for up to 2 weeks. Generally, cell attachment density and spreading area decreased with increasing pore size. Pore wall width and solid surface fraction also played a key role in cell adhesion. After 2 weeks, osteogenesis of hMSCs was enhanced by porous topography with a pore size of 120–230 nm in diameter and 10 nm pore wall width, compared with other topographies of the gradient. The results demonstrate that the gradient format allows in-depth high-throughput screening of surface parameters that are important for the control of mammalian cell behaviour, thereby advancing the development of new and improved biomaterials for e.g. orthopaedic and tissue engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aattachment behavior 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3acell adhesion 3ahumans 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3aorthopedics 3aporosity 3ascreening 3atissue engineering 3atopography1 aClements, Lauren R.1 aThissen, Helmut1 aTsai, Wei-Bor1 aVoelcker, Nicolas H.0 tBiomaterials science.g2013 July 30, v. 1, no. 9 p.924-932dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60026b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245008400209300001200293500001400305506007600319520082700395592002801222506003701250650001701287650002101304650001401325650002201339650001401361650001901375650001001394650002101404650001801425650000901443650000901452650002801461650002401489650001601513700002101529773012401550856008201674852000901756655001201765IND60688714920221207075715.0200416e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068871492DNAL7 a10.1186/1297-9686-33-2-1052doi7 aPMC27053872pmcid7 a113338302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorva, Pablo M.10aQuantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) mapping for growth traits in the mouse: A review  ap. 105.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe attainment of a specific mature body size is one of the most fundamental differences among species of mammals. Moreover, body size seems to be the central factor underlying differences in traits such as growth rate, energy metabolism and body composition. An important proportion of this variability is of genetic origin. The goal of the genetic analysis of animal growth is to understand its "genetic architecture", that is the number and position of loci affecting the trait, the magnitude of their effects, allele frequencies and types of gene action. In this review, the different strategies developed to identify and characterize genes involved in the regulation of growth in the mouse are described, with emphasis on the methods developed to map loci contributing to the regulation of quantitative traits (QTLs).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarchitecture 3abody composition 3abody size 3aenergy metabolism 3aevolution 3agene frequency 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3agrowth traits 3aloci 3amice 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3avariability1 aMedrano, Juan F.0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2001 Apr., v. 33, no. 2 p.105-105dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x0999-193X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1297-9686-33-2-1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013000166300001600296520121100312592002801523650001401551650001501565650001301580650001301593650002001606650001801626653002901644653003301673653005301706653004201759653004401801700001701845773010201862856008601964852000902050655001202059IND60585817320221120052955.0171114e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058581732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhe10aIrreversibility analysis for optimization design of plate fin heat exchangers using a multi-objective cuckoo search algorithm  ap. 126-135.  aThis paper introduces and applies an improved multi-objective cuckoo search (IMOCS) algorithm, a novel met-heuristic optimization algorithm based on cuckoo breeding behavior, for the multi-objective optimization design of plate-fin heat exchangers (PFHEs). A modified irreversibility degree of the PFHE is separated into heat transfer and fluid friction irreversibility degrees which are adopted as two initial objective functions to be minimized simultaneously for narrowing the search scope of the design. The maximization efficiency, minimization of pumping power, and total annual cost are considered final objective functions. Results obtained from a two dimensional normalized Pareto-optimal frontier clearly demonstrate the trade-off between heat transfer and fluid friction irreversibility. Moreover, a three dimensional Pareto-optimal frontier reveals a relationship between efficiency, total annual cost, and pumping power in the PFHE design. Three examples presented here further demonstrate that the presented method is able to obtain optimum solutions with higher accuracy, lower irreversibility, and fewer iterations as compared to the previous methods and single-objective design approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuculidae 3aalgorithms 3abreeding 3afriction 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 0aPlate-fin heat exchanger 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aImproved multi-objective cuckoo search algorithm 0aEntropy generation minimization (EGM) 0aEntransy dissipation minimization (EDM)1 aLi, Yanzhong0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 101 p.126-135dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011800169300001800287500001400305520092900319592002801248650002001276650001901296650000901315650000901324650001401333650002901347650001101376650001101387653001101398653001501409653001101424653001301435700001601448700001401464700002501478700002001503773015101523856008001674852000901754655001201763IND60710094620221119032654.0200908e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071009462DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.v0iOF.91222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatra, Manas Kumar10aEffect of season on growth and reproduction performance of improved backyard poultry in North Eastern Hill Region  ap. 1071-1076.  aNAL-light  aA study was undertaken to evaluatethe seasonal influenceon performance of Vanaraja(n=3924) and Gramapriya (n=2227) maintained in five different batches during 2011–14. Better growth was observed in summer during brooding. At brooding, mortality was significantly higher during winter in Vanaraja and during summer in Gramapriya. The egg production was higher when birds started laying in winter than in summer. The overall Hen Day Egg Production (HDEP) was higher in Vanaraja (p<0.01) than the Gramapriya. The fertility level varied between 68 to 90% in both varieties. The hatchability percentage on fertile egg set (FES) varied within the range of 70 to 90. It was concluded that better egg production performance could be obtained from Vanaraja birds, raised in summer and those initiated laying in winter. Therefore, the seasonal factors should be taken care of while raising parent line to achieve optimum production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3aegg production 3aeggs 3ahens 3amortality 3areproductive performance 3asummer 3awinter 0aGrowth 0aGramapriya 0aSeason 0aVanaraja1 aHajra, D.K.1 aDas, R.K.1 aSarakāra, Pradīpa,1 aDeka, Bidyut C.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2018 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.1071-1076dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.v0iOF.91223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007700173300001600250520130900266592002801575650002001603650003001623650001101653650001901664650002001683650001101703650001101714650001501725650001101740651001201751700002001763700002601783700001801809700001801827773011301845856008101958852000902039655001202048IND60439014920221116170615.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043901492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-014-1290-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumitrescu, Alexandru10aRecent climatic changes in Romania from observational data (1961–2013)  ap. 111-119.  aThe paper presents a country-wide trend analysis in seasonal air temperature, precipitation, sunshine hours and wind speed over the 1961–2013 period. Changes in annual temperature and precipitation extremes are also investigated by means of 14 indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The air temperature and the number of sunshine hours present significant increasing trends in winter, spring and summer; the precipitation amount is rather stable, with increasing trends in autumn and decreasing trends in the other seasons, at few locations. The wind speed shows downward trends in all seasons, in agreement with the tendency of the terrestrial stilling. The annual thermal extremes show decreasing trends for the cold-related indices and increasing trends for the warm-related ones, with the warming signal being consistent over the region. The most striking results concern the number of summer days which is increasing at 95 % of the stations and the duration of warm spells increasing at 83 % of the stations. The annual precipitation extremes show mixed signals in all eight indices, with the majority of the stations presenting no significant trends. Our findings are in good agreement with recent studies on climatic variability in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asummer 3awind speed 3awinter 3aRomania1 aBojariu, Roxana1 aBirsan, Marius-Victor1 aMarin, Lenuta1 aManea, Ancuta0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2015 Oct., v. 122, no. 1-2 p.111-119dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-014-1290-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015000156300001600306520205000322592002802372650001202400650002502412650001002437650001702447650002302464650001302487650001302500650002002513650001902533650001102552650001102563650001902574650001202593650001302605650001902618650002202637650001802659700001802677700001502695700001702710700001702727773012702744856007502871852000902946655001202955IND60657831020221121042628.0190823e20130730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065783102DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60028a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Mengchi10aMussel-inspired bioactive ceramics with improved bioactivity, cell proliferation, differentiation and bone-related gene expression of MC3T3 cells  ap. 933-941.  aMussels possess the ability to attach to virtually any type of inorganic and organic surfaces due to the existence of phenylalamine and lysine amino acids. Inspired by the property of mussels, polydopamine has been used for modifying bioinert materials, such as metals, semiconductors and plastics to improve their surface hydrophilicity. However, there are no reports about the effect of a polydopamine modification on apatite mineralization and the biological response of bioactive ceramics (not bioinert materials) for bone regeneration applications. Akermanite bioceramics (AKT, Ca₂MgSi₂O₇) are a typical bioactive material with osteostimulation properties for bone tissue regeneration. The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the effect of a polydopamine modification on the physicochemical and biological properties of AKT bioceramics, including attachment, proliferation, ALP activity and bone-related gene expression of tissue cells. The results show that a self-assembled polydopamine layer on the surface of AKT bioceramics was formed by incubating AKT bioceramics in a dopamine/Tris–HCl solution. Polydopamine-modified AKT (PDB-AKT) bioceramics showed significantly improved surface roughness, hydrophilicity and apatite-mineralization ability compared to AKT bioceramics. In addition, the polydopamine modification distinctively enhanced the attachment, proliferation, alkaline phosphate activity and bone-related gene expression of MC3T3 cells on AKT bioceramics. The possible reason for the improved cytocompatibility may be related to the improved surface roughness and apatite mineralization as well as the ionic environment at an early stage of cell culture. Our results suggest that the polydopamine modification is a viable method to further improve the apatite mineralization and biological response of bioactive ceramics for better bone regeneration applications, indicating that the polydopamine modification is a universal method to enhance the bioactivity for both bioinert and bioactive materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3abioactive properties 3abones 3acell culture 3acell proliferation 3aceramics 3adopamine 3agene expression 3ahydrophilicity 3alysine 3ametals 3amineralization 3amussels 3aplastics 3asemiconductors 3asurface roughness 3atissue repair1 aZhang, Yufeng1 aZhai, Dong1 aChang, Jiang1 aWu, Chengtie0 tBiomaterials science.g2013 July 30, v. 1, no. 9 p.933-941dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60028a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03794naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245016800174520223800342592002802580650002302608650002602631650002602657650001902683650001402702650001402716650001402730650001402744650001902758650002902777650001402806650001602820650001602836650002502852651001702877653002002894653002602914653002302940653000902963653002602972653001702998700005903015700002203074773011903096856008803215852000903303655001203312IND60676613620221120060008.0200503e20200410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067661362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Tracy L.B.10aAntibiotic resistant Klebsiella spp. from a hospital, hospital effluents and wastewater treatment plants in the uMgungundlovu District, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  aHospital effluents are crucial hotspots for the dissemination of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. This study analysed hospital effluent and proximate wastewater treatment plants for the presence of antibiotic resistant Klebsiella spp. Water samples were obtained twice over a three-month period from an urban and rural hospital at three effluent points each, and from two proximate wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) comprising influent and effluent and river water samples up/downstream the WWTPs. Presumptive Klebsiella spp. were enumerated, isolated, and phenotypically confirmed using a well-established commercial test system for Enterobacteriaceae (API20E). Clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were provided by a hospital for comparison. The antibiotic resistance profiles of Klebsiella spp. isolates to 16 selected antibiotics were established according to EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing). In addition, extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase production was analysed. A total of 93 confirmed Klebsiella spp. isolates from hospital effluents and 37 from WWTPs were obtained, comprising K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca. The viable counts for confirmed Klebsiella spp. for hospital effluents ranged from 1.38 × 10² to 1.03 × 10⁴, while those for WWTP influent were in a range of 1.76 × 10³ to 5.10 × 10³ CFU/ml. A higher proportion of Klebsiella spp. from urban hospital effluent was categorized as multidrug-resistant (MDR) (23%) compared to rural hospital effluent (9%). Resistance was observed to all antibiotic classes tested. Several clinical isolates presented resistance to four carbapenem antibiotics, while certain isolates from hospital effluent and WWTPs exhibited ertapenem and doripenem resistance. Fifteen Klebsiella spp. isolates (clinical and from urban hospital effluent) produced carbapenemases. Hospital effluents in South Africa contain antibiotic resistant Klebsiella spp. and may pose a risk to proximate informal communities if inadequately treated. Moreover, common phenotypic resistance profiles among isolates from the clinical-hospital effluent-wastewater works continuum suggest a need for further treatment of such effluent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella oxytoca 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3adoripenem 3aeffluents 3aertapenem 3ahospitals 3amicroorganisms 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphenotype 3aplate count 3ariver water 3awastewater treatment 3aSouth Africa 0aKlebsiella spp. 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aHospital effluents 0aESBL 0aCarbapenem resistance 0aSouth Africa1 aSchmidt, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5584-16811 aEssack, Sabiha Y.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 10, v. 712 p.135550-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012400161300001600285520035900301592002800660650002200688650001900710650001200729650001700741650001200758650001300770650001700783650001700800700001300817700001700830700001600847700001400863700002000877700002000897700001800917773012500935856007501060852000901135655001201144IND60657831120221121042625.0190823e20130507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065783112DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60029g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Olivia T.

Weaning method was either “Weight Based Earlyor Split Weaning” i.e. TES or “Conventional Weaning”i.e. TC andtreated ascontrol. The weaning agein TCwas 56days. In TES, heavier(> 1.5kg) medium weighing (1.0–1.5 kg) and lighter (< 1.0 kg) piglets were weaned at 30 (TESH), 37 days (TESM) and 42 days), respectively. Different records pertaining to body weight, feed consumption, haematological profiles etc. were (TᴱSᴸ) collected up to 120 days. At the end of the study period, body weight of piglets was almost equal in both groups. The overall ADG at the end of study period was almost equal in all three sub-groups and in control. FCR of piglets under split and conventional weaning groups was significantly better (P<0.05) in TESH than Tc group, both during pre-and postweaning period. The PCV (%) and TLC value under different sub-groups of split-weaned piglets were almost similar to different sub-groups of conventionally weaned piglets and were within normal range. There were significant differences among haemoglobin level among different sub-group of TES and Tc and it was within the range of normal reference value. From the present study it can be concluded that split weaned piglets performed almost equally to conventionally weaned piglets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3aanimal research 3abody weight 3afeed intake 3ahemoglobin 0aConventional 0aGrowth 0aPiglet 0aWeaning 0aWelfare1 aMalik, Dalpat Singh1 aChandrahas, 1 aSahoo, Sarada Prasanna1 aSaini, Amrit Lal0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2018 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.1087-1090dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-33283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03758naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007600153245009100229520214600320592002802466650003102494650001902525650001102544650001002555650002302565650002202588650002202610650001502632650000902647650001602656650001202672650002102684650002202705650001702727653001902744653000802763653003102771653002802802653002302830653002102853700007602874700003602950700007402986773011903060856008803179852000903267655001203276IND60676613920221120055640.0200318e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067661392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVera, Jonny Fernando Rivadeneira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3309-242610aAdapting water resources systems to climate change in tropical areas: Ecuadorian coast  aClimate change is expected to increase rainfall and temperature in the tropical areas of the Ecuadorian coast. The increase in temperature will also increase evapotranspiration therefore, future water balance on Ecuadorian coast will have a slight variation. Changes in precipitation patterns and evapotranspiration will produce an increase in the water requirements for current crops, so an imbalance in the water resources systems between natural resources and water demands is expected. This study presents water resources management as an adaptation measure to climate change for reducing vulnerability in tropical areas.Twelve bias-corrected climate projections are used, from: two AR5 General Circulation Models (GCMs), two Representative Concentration Pathways, 4.5–8.5 scenarios, and three time periods, short-term (2010–2039), medium-term (2040–2069) and long-term (2070–2099). These data were incorporated into the Lumped Témez Hydrological Model. Climate change scenarios predict for the long-term period both a mean rainfall and temperature increases up to 22%-2.8 °C, respectively. Besides, the potential evapotranspiration will increase until 12% by Penman-Monteith method and 60% by Thornthwaite method. Therefore, natural water resources will finally have an increase of 19% [8–30%]. Additionally, water requirements for crops will increase around 4% and 45%.As this research shows, in tropical regions, currently viable water resources systems could become unsustainable under climate change scenarios. To guarantee the water supply in the future additional measures are required as reservoir operation rules and irrigation efficiency improvement of system from 0.43 to 0.65, which it involves improving the distribution and application system. In study area future irrigation areas have been estimated for 13,268 ha, which under climate change scenarios is unsustainable, only 11,500 ha could be expanded with a very high irrigation efficiency of 0.73. Therefore, in tropical areas the effect of climate change on expansion projects for irrigated areas should be considered to ensure the functioning systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acrops 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3arain 3atemperature 3atropics 3awater management 3awater requirement 3awater supply 0aClimate change 0aRCP 0aWater resources management 0aHydrological simulation 0aWater requirements 0aTropical climate1 aRivadeneira Vera, Jonny Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3309-24261 aZambrano Mera, Yeriel Elizabeth1 aPérez Martín, Miguel Ángel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4733-08620 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 703 p.135554-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245010400218300001200322520108200334592002801416650001301444650000801457650001601465650001401481650001601495650001701511650001501528650003101543650002301574651001801597651001101615653002301626653001801649653000901667653001301676653000901689700001901698700002701717700002201744700001601766700002201782700002601804700001801830773008501848856008401933852000902017655001202026IND60544833820221119042020.0160901e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054483382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatsoyiannis, Athanasios1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7984-942310aIndoor air characterization of various microenvironments in the Arctic.

Differences between the two categories of samples are noted with domestic environments exhibiting higher concentrations of VOCs (total VOCs ranging between 106 and 584μgm−3), while total particulate matter was highest in workplace non-office environments (ranging between 132 and 284μgm−3). The terpenes were the most abundant class of VOCs, while a variety of other compounds exhibited 100% frequency of occurrence (i.e. naphthalene, D5-volatile methyl siloxane). Compared to results from other studies/regions, the concentrations of VOCs are considered as relatively low. Based on the results and the knowledge of the typical characteristics of the Arctic lifestyle, some important sources are identified. As this is the first study that deals with indoor air quality in the coldest region globally, it is expected that it will trigger the interest of Authorities to proceed to more detailed studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair quality 3alifestyle 3anaphthalene 3aparticulates 3aterpenoids 3avolatile organic compounds 3aworking conditions 3aArctic region 3aNorway 0aIndoor air quality 0aArctic Region 0aVOCs 0aAerosols 0aBTEX1 aAnda, Erik Eik1 aCincinelli, Alessandra1 aMartellini, Tania1 aLeva, Paolo1 aGoetsch, Arntraut1 aSandanger, Torkjel M.1 aHuber, Sandra0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Oct., v. 134 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010400156300001800260520118900278592002801467650002301495650002501518650002001543650002001563650002301583650001301606650001801619650001901637650001101656700001601667700002001683773010801703856007501811852000901886655001201895IND60532790420221119171913.0160728e20130909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279042DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400968x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZengin, Adem12aA SERS-Based Sandwich Assay for Ultrasensitive and Selective Detection of Alzheimer’s Tau Protein  ap. 3001-3009.  aIn this study, a simple and highly selective homogeneous sandwich assay was developed for fast and ultrasensitive detection of the tau protein using a combination of monoclonal antitau functionalized hybrid magnetic nanoparticles and polyclonal antitau immobilized gold nanoparticles as the recognition and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) component, respectively. The magnetic silica particles were first coated with poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) via surface-mediated reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and then biofunctionalized with monoclonal antitau, which are both specific for tau and can be collected via a simple magnet. After separating tau from the sample matrix, they were sandwiched with the SERS substrate composed of polyclonal antitau and 5,5-dithiobis(2-dinitrobenzoic acid) on gold nanoparticles. The correlation between the tau concentration and SERS signal was found to be linear within the range of 25 fM to 500 nM. The limit of detection for the sandwich assay is less than 25 fM. Moreover, the sandwich assay was also evaluated for investigating the tau specificity on bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abovine serum albumin 3adetection limit 3aimmunoglobulins 3amagnetic materials 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3asilica1 aTamer, Ugur1 aCaykara, Tuncer0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 Sept. 09, v. 14, no. 9 p.3001-3009dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm400968x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245012300212300002000335520207200355592002802427650002202455650002502477650001702502650001302519650000902532650002102541650001802562650001402580650001902594650001402613650000702627650001402634650000902648650001702657700005902674700006002733700006202793773014202855856007902997852000903076655001203085IND60620170520181220000000.0181106e20181016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062017052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b032062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomasArrigo, Laurel K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6758-376010aImpact of Organic Matter on Iron(II)-Catalyzed Mineral Transformations in Ferrihydrite–Organic Matter Coprecipitates  ap. 12316-12326.  aPoorly crystalline Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides like ferrihydrite are abundant in soils and sediments and are often associated with organic matter (OM) in the form of mineral-organic aggregates. Under anoxic conditions, interactions between aqueous Fe(II) and ferrihydrite lead to the formation of crystalline secondary minerals, like lepidocrocite, goethite, or magnetite. However, the extent to which Fe(II)-catalyzed mineral transformations are influenced by ferrihydrite-associated OM is not well understood. We therefore reacted ferrihydrite-PGA coprecipitates (PGA = polygalacturonic acid, C:Fe molar ratios = 0–2.5) and natural Fe-rich organic flocs (C:Fe molar ratio = 2.2) with 0.5–5.0 mM isotopically labeled ⁵⁷Fe(II) at pH 7 for 5 weeks. Relying on the combination of stable Fe isotope tracers, a novel application of the PONKCS method to Rietveld fitting of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and ⁵⁷Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, we sought to follow the temporal evolution in Fe mineralogy and elucidate the fate of adsorbed ⁵⁷Fe(II). At low C:Fe molar ratios (0–0.05), rapid oxidation of surface-adsorbed ⁵⁷Fe(II) resulted in ⁵⁷Fe-enriched crystalline minerals and nearly complete mineral transformation within days. With increasing OM content, the atom exchange between the added aqueous ⁵⁷Fe(II) and Fe in the organic-rich solids still occurred; however, XRD analysis showed that crystalline mineral precipitation was strongly inhibited. For high OM-content materials (C:Fe ≥ 1.2), Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed up to 39% lepidocrocite in the final Fe(II)-reacted samples. Because lepidocrocite was not detectable by XRD, we suggest that the Mössbauer-detected lepidocrocite consisted of nanosized clusters with lepidocrocite-like local structure, similar to the lepidocrocite found in natural flocs. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the C content of ferrihydrite–OM coprecipitates strongly impacts the degree and pathways of Fe mineral transformations and iron atom exchange during reactions with aqueous Fe(II).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanaerobic conditions 3aferrihydrite 3agoethite 3airon 3aisotope labeling 3alepidocrocite 3amagnetite 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3apH 3asediments 3asoil 3aspectroscopy1 aByrne, James M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4399-73361 aKappler, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3558-95001 aKretzschmar, Ruben1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2587-24300 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Oct. 16, v. 52, no. 21 p.12316-12326dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b032063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002800189245010200217300001200319500001400331506007600345520132600421592002801747506003701775650001401812650001901826650001101845650000801856650002201864650001301886650001501899650001101914650000901925650001301934650001901947650001001966650001601976650000901992650001402001650001402015650001602029650002402045650002602069650001202095650001002107650001702117650001102134650001602145650001702161650001202178650001402190700001902204700001902223700002702242773012402269856008202393852000902475655001202484IND60688715520221207075717.0200416e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068871552DNAL7 a10.1186/1297-9686-33-3-2732doi7 aPMC27054082pmcid7 a114037482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMialon, Marie-Madeleine10aGenetic relationship between cyclic ovarian activity in heifers and cows and beef traits in males  ap. 273.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecords were collected in an experimental herd over an 11-year period from purebred Charolais heifers (n = 351), cows (n = 615) and young entire bulls (n = 383). The objective of the study was to estimate the genetic relationship between the components of female ovarian activity (age at puberty and postpartum anoestrus length), their growth rate and body condition score and beef traits measured on related bulls. Two methods were used to estimate age at puberty and postpartum anoestrus length: the detection of oestrous behaviour and a test of cyclicity based on plasmatic progesterone assay. This study shows the existence of significant heritability estimates for the different cyclicity traits (h² between 0.11 and 0.38). Most of the genetic correlation coefficients between ovarian activity and growth rate of females and males are negative and favourable (rg between -0.43 and 0.06). Cyclicity is also favourably related with body condition score in young or adult females (rg between -0.65 and -0.22). The genetic relationship between female ovarian activity and proportion of adipose tissue in the male carcass is, however, close to zero. These results show that an antagonism between male beef traits measured in this study and female ovarian activity is unlikely to be a cause for concern in the short term.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCharolais 3aadipose tissue 3aadults 3aage 3aage determination 3aanestrus 3aantagonism 3aassays 3abeef 3abehavior 3abody condition 3abulls 3acorrelation 3acows 3adetection 3aevolution 3aexhibitions 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic relationships 3aheifers 3aherds 3aheritability 3alength 3aperiodicity 3aprogesterone 3apuberty 3apurebreds1 aRenand, Gilles1 aKrauss, Daniel1 aMénissier, François,0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2001 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.273-273dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x0999-193X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1297-9686-33-3-2733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008500170300001600255520129200271592002801563650001701591650001601608650001701624650001401641650001101655650001001666650001301676650004001689650001401729650001501743650001101758650001701769650001201786650001101798650001101809700002601820773008301846856008501929852000902014655001202023IND60088442720221123035356.0141102e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008844272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalsh, Erin M.10aNon-RGD-containing snake venom disintegrins, functional and structural relations  ap. 355-362.  aSnake venom disintegrins are present in a variety of species and are functionally divided into three families: RGD, MLD and R/KTS. The RGD family of disintegrins, which bind and inhibit the physiological functions of RGD-dependent integrins, constitute the largest and most investigated family. This review will be focused on characterization of two relatively new families of snake venom disintegrins, expressing in their active site MLD and R/KTS motifs. The MLD motif, present only in heterodimeric disintegrins, mediates binding of these disintegrins to α4β1, α4β7 and α9β1 integrins, whereas the presence of a KTS or RTS sequence in the active site selectively directs activity of disintegrins to the collagen receptor α1β1 integrin. Structurally, KTS-disintegrins are short, monomeric molecules containing 41 amino acids in its polypeptide chain. Biological activities of MLD and KTS-disintegrins were investigated in many systems in vitro and in vivo. Purified disintegrins are non-toxic in therapeutic doses in rodent and avian models. Their modulatory properties were observed in investigations of cancer angiogenesis and metastasis, immunosuppression of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and asthma, as well as in neurodegenerative assays and cell apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3aasthma 3abirds 3acollagen 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aintegrins 3ametastasis 3amodels 3apolypeptides 3arodents 3asnakes 3avenoms1 aMarcinkiewicz, Cezary0 tToxicon.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 58, no. 4 p.355-362dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002200137245008900159300001800248500002000266500001500286520216000301592002802461650002802489650001902517650001902536650001802555650002202573650001702595650002202612650001702634650001102651650002102662650002202683650001502705650002102720650002202741650001302763650001302776650001602789650001302805651001202818653001002830653001602840700001602856700002102872700002102893700002202914700002602936773013302962852000903095856007403104655001203178IND4418171720221122231706.0180321e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441817172DNAL7 a10.1890/06-1301.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutsch, Werner L.10aAdvection and resulting co2 exchange uncertainty in a tall forest in central germany  ap. 1391-1405.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aPotential losses by advection were estimated at Hainich Forest, Thuringia, Germany, where the tower is located at a gentle slope. Three approaches were used: (1) comparing nighttime eddy covariance fluxes to an independent value of total ecosystem respiration by bottom‐up modeling of the underlying processes, (2) direct measurements of a horizontal CO₂ gradient and horizontal wind speed at 2 m height in order to calculate horizontal advection, and (3) direct measurements of a vertical CO₂ gradient and a three‐dimensional wind profile in order to calculate vertical advection. In the first approach, nighttime eddy covariance measurements were compared to independent values of total ecosystem respiration by means of bottom‐up modeling of the underlying biological processes. Turbulent fluxes and storage term were normalized to the fluxes calculated by the bottom‐up model. Below a u* threshold of 0.6 m/s the normalized turbulent fluxes decreased with decreasing u*, but the flux to the storage increased only up to values less than 20% of the modeled flux at low turbulence. Horizontal advection was measured by a horizontal CO₂ gradient over a distance of 130 m combined with horizontal wind speed measurements. Horizontal advection occurred at most of the evenings independently of friction velocity above the canopy. Nevertheless, horizontal advection was higher when u* was low. The peaks of horizontal advection correlated with changes in temperature. A full mass balance including turbulent fluxes, storage, and horizontal and vertical advection resulted in an increase of spikes and scatter but seemed to generally improve the results from the flux measurements. The comparison of flux data with independent bottom‐up modeling results as well as the direct measurements resulted in strong indications that katabatic flows along the hill slope during evening and night reduces the measured apparent ecosystem respiration rate. In addition, anabatic flows may occur during the morning. We conclude that direct measurements of horizontal and vertical advection are highly necessary at sites located even on gentle hill slopes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric circulation 3aturbulent flow 3acarbon dioxide 3amass transfer 3asimulation models 3aforest trees 3atemperate forests 3agas exchange 3aheight 3acell respiration 3adiurnal variation 3awind speed 3asoil respiration 3aspatial variation 3afriction 3avelocity 3ameasurement 3aaccuracy 3aGermany 0aslope 0amethodology1 aKolle, Olaf1 aRebmann, Corinna1 aKnohl, Alexander1 aZiegler, Waldemar1 aSchulze, Ernst-Detlef0 tEcological applications.g2008 Sept., v. 18, no. 6 p.1391-1405dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1301.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02643naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245006400165300001800229520166600247592002801913650001901941650001701960650002001977650001101997650001102008700002602019700002002045700001802065700002002083773013002103856007502233852000902308655001202317IND60657831520221121042559.0190823e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065783152DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60040h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobson Marsden, Hana10aControlled liposome fusion mediated by SNARE protein mimics  ap. 1046-1054.  aThe fusion of lipid membranes is essential for the delivery of chemicals across biological barriers to specific cellular locations. Intracellular membrane fusion is particularly precise and is critically mediated by SNARE proteins. To allow membrane fusion to be better understood and harnessed we have mimicked this important process with a simple bottom-up model in which synthetic fusogens replicate the essential features of SNARE proteins. In our fusogens, the coiled-coil molecular recognition motif of SNARE proteins is replaced by the coiled-coil E/K peptide complex, which is one-ninth the size. The peptides are anchored in liposome membranes via pegylated lipids. Here we discuss how the liposome fusion process is controlled by different parameters within the minimal model. The lipopeptide fusogens form specific coiled coils that dock liposomes together, resulting in the merging of membranes via the stalk intermediate. Unusually for model systems, the lipopeptides can rapidly lead to fusion of entire liposome populations and the liposomes can undergo many rounds of fusion. The rate and extent of fusion and the number of fusion rounds can be manipulated by adjusting the fusogen and liposome concentrations. For example, these parameters can be tuned such that tens of thousands of ∼100 nm liposomes fuse into a single giant liposome ∼10 μm in diameter; alternatively, conditions can be selected such that only two liposomes fuse. The improved understanding of membrane fusion shows how application-specific fusion attributes can be achieved, and paves the way for controlled nanoreactor mixing and controlled delivery of cargo to cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSNARE proteins 3alipopeptides 3amembrane fusion 3amixing 3amodels1 aKorobko, Alexander V.1 aZheng, Tingting1 aVoskuhl, Jens1 aKros, Alexander0 tBiomaterials science.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 1, no. 10 p.1046-1054dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60040h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245005300156300001800209500002000227500001500247520187900262592002802141650002802169650001502197650001902212650001902231650000902250650001702259650001402276650002002290650001702310650001402327650001102341650002702352650001602379650001602395650001402411650001302425650001202438653001002450700002002460700001802480773013302498852000902631856007402640655001202714IND4418171420221122231715.0180321e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441817142DNAL7 a10.1890/06-1894.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelcher, S.

Two examples of complex terrain are considered in detail: a forest edge, which exemplifies nonuniform forests, and hilly terrain, which can lead to drainage currents at night. Dynamical arguments show that, when boundary layer winds approach a forest edge, the mean wind adjusts on a length scale of approximately 3Lc, where Lc is the canopy drag length scale, which depends inversely on the leaf area density of the forest. Over a further distance that also scales on Lc, turbulence in the flow adjusts, and the mixing and transport in the canopy approaches the homogeneous limit. Even low hills change the neutral flow within and above the forest canopy substantially. When the canopy is tall, pressure gradients drive flow up both the upwind and downwind slopes of the hill, leading to an ejection of air out of the top of the canopy just downwind of the crest. This flow at the crest can then advect scalar out of the top of the forest, leading to large variations in the flux of scalar across the hill. At night, when the air near the ground cools and becomes stably stratified, turbulence within the canopy can collapse, even when the flow above the canopy remains turbulent. This leads to a decoupling of the air motions within the canopy from those above. The air above the canopy can then continue to pass up and over the hill, as it does in the neutral case, but at the same time, air within the canopy drains down the hill slopes as drainage currents.

H.10aPHA Recovery from Biomass  ap. 2963-2972.  aThe recovery of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from biomass, that is, from bacterial cells, is one of the major obstacles in the industrial production of these polyesters. Since PHAs are naturally synthesized as intracellular storage compounds for carbon and energy and are for this deposited in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell, PHAs are more or less tightly linked with the entire biomass, and the polyesters must be released from the cells before their isolation and purification can be conducted. This additional step, that is, the release from the cells, is a major difference from most other biotechnological processes where the product occurs outside of the cells because it is secreted into the medium in a bioreactor or because it is synthesized in vitro in an enzyme reactor in a cell free system. This additional step contributes significantly to the overall costs of production. In this review we provide an overview about the different processes that result in the release of PHA from the cells, and we evaluate these processes with regard to the suitability at large scale in the industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3acell free system 3acytoplasm 3aenergy 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates1 aHeinrich, Daniel1 aAlghamdi, Mansour A.1 aShabbaj, Ibraheem I.1 aSteinbüchel, A.,0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 Sept. 09, v. 14, no. 9 p.2963-2972dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm40102443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005500145245010900200300002000309520138400329592002801713650001501741650001901756650001701775650001701792650002101809650001501830650001201845650001601857650001101873700006001884700006101944773014302005856007902148852000902227655001202236IND60620170720221121052439.0181106e20180921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062017072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b032612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xitong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5197-342210aMechanisms of Humic Acid Fouling on Capacitive and Insertion Electrodes for Electrochemical Desalination  ap. 12633-12641.  aThough electrochemical deionization technologies have been widely explored for brackish water desalination and selective ion removal, their sustained performance in the presence of foulants common to environmental waters remains unclear. This study investigates the fundamental mechanisms by which carbonaceous electrodes used in capacitive deionization and insertion electrodes used for high-capacity selective ion removal are affected by the presence of humic acid (HA). We evaluate HA adsorption behavior and the resulting impact on the ion storage capacity and cycling stability of the electrode materials. We find that HA is primarily adsorbed to the mesopores of two carbonaceous electrodes with distinctly different pore structures, but that the ion storage and transport properties of the electrodes are not significantly impacted by HA adsorption. In contrast, HA adsorption resulted in sharp capacity decay for the insertion (Na₄Mn₉O₁₈) electrode. We attribute this decay to both hindered Na⁺ ion diffusion to the insertion interface in the presence of adsorbed HA, as well as HA mediated electrode dissolution. These findings highlight the contrasting mechanisms for HA fouling of capacitive and insertion electrodes and suggest that insertion electrodes may be more susceptible to performance decline in electrochemical deionization of environmental waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abrackish water 3adeionization 3adesalination 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afouling 3ahumic acids 3asodium1 aWhitacre, Jay F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3439-41111 aMauter, Meagan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6946-72130 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Sept. 21, v. 52, no. 21 p.12633-12641dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b032613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245012400157300001800281500001400299520176100313592002802074650001302102650001302115650001202128650002002140650001002160650003502170650001702205650001902222650001702241650001502258650001402273650001802287650003502305650002402340650001102364650000902375653001002384653002202394653001302416653001502429653001302444653001702457700001802474700001902492700002302511700001402534700001902548700001702567773015102584856007702735852000902812655001202821IND60710095620221119032457.0200908e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071009562DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.

The low heritability of fertility traits hampers improvement of these traits by conventional selection based on phenotypic records. No information is available on the role of SNPs in KiSS1 gene in cattle on semen quality parameters in bovines. KiSS1 genes code for Kisspeptin, which are essential upstream regulators of neurons secreting gonadotropin-releasing hormone and playcrucial rolein reproduction. The coding regionsalong with exon-intron boundaries of KiSS1 gene, was characterized using PCR-SSCP method and direct sequencing. Two genotypes were observed which were represented as SSCP pattern 1 and pattern 2 and found to carry one SNPs (T153C) and one insertion of G at 291_292bp. The bulls with pattern 2 were heterozygous with respect to the transition T153C and pattern1 bulls were homozygous with TT genotype. The transition was predicted to cause amino acid change from Valine to Alanine. The frequency of bulls with pattern1 and pattern 2 were 0.67 and 0.33 in 67 Holstein Friesian bulls and 0.73 and 0.27 in 13 Khillari bulls. The association study of genotypes with semen quality parameters revealed significant association of genotypes with acrosome integrity in fresh semen (P<0.05) and no association with sperm concentration, volume per ejaculate, percent live sperm and Hypo Osmotic Swelling Test (HOST) with higher acrosome integrity in bulls with pattern2. Upon validation of the results in larger population and identifying the exact roleofthenovel SNPT153C and insertion of Gat 291_292bp, theycould beincorporated in selection programme for improving fertility in bulls as markers for acrosome integrity in cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aacrosome 3aalanine 3aanimal research 3agenes 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aheritability 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3akisspeptin 3aphenotype 3asemen quality 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asperm concentration 3avaline 3azebu 0aBulls 0aHolstein Friesian 0aKhillari 0aKiSS1 gene 0aPCR-SSCP 0aPolymorphism1 aRamesha, K.P.1 aKumari, Ragini1 aSingh, Arun Pratap1 aDas, D.N.1 aBasavaraju, M.1 aMundhe, U.T.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2018 Aug., v. 52, no. 8 p.1124-1128dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.

Time ago, anaerobic digestion was usually implemented for sewage sludge stabilization but energy recovery optimization has recently gained importance. The energy balance of five WWTPs located in Catalonia revealed that depending on the configuration of the plant and its operation, between 39% and 76% of the total electric energy consumed in the WWTP could be supplied by the biogas produced. In the second part of this work, a carbon, nitrogen and sulphur flux analysis was carried out, together with an energy content evaluation for each stream in the WWTP. Results showed that 37% of the carbon found in the raw wastewater was removed during the active sludge process and 24% was transformed into biogas. The remaining carbon was found in the anaerobic dewatered sludge (22%) and in the treated water (19%). As a result, 34% of the initial energy was recovered in the form of biogas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acarbon 3aclean energy 3aelectric energy consumption 3aenergy balance 3aenergy content 3aenergy recovery 3anitrogen 3asewage sludge 3astreams 3asulfur 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aEnergy balance 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aBiogas recovery 0aWastewater treatment plant 0aFlow analysis1 aFernández, B.1 aBonmatí, A.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 101 p.255-262dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245013500162520219600297592002802493650001602521650002702537650002202564650001802586650003502604650002002639650001702659650001702676650001102693650001102704650001402715650001202729650001102741650001702752650001902769651001902788700002702807700001902834700002402853773016102877856007703038852000903115655001203124IND60757768420221120050447.0211125e20211103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075776842DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi101107452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmalki, Abrar 10aGeospatial and Machine Learning Regression Techniques for Analyzing Food Access Impact on Health Issues in Sustainable Communities  aFood access is a major key component in food security, as it is every individual’s right to proper access to a nutritious and affordable food supply. Low access to healthy food sources influences people’s diet and activity habits. Guilford County in North Carolina has a high ranking in low food security and a high rate of health issues such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the geospatial correlation between health issues and food access areas. The secondary objective was to quantitatively compare food access areas and heath issues’ descriptive statistics. The tertiary objective was to compare several machine learning techniques and find the best model that fit health issues against various food access variables with the highest performance accuracy. In this study, we adopted a food-access perspective to show that communities that have residents who have equitable access to healthy food options are typically less vulnerable to health-related disasters. We propose a methodology to help policymakers lower the number of health issues in Guilford County by analyzing such issues via correlation with respect to food access. Specifically, we conducted a geographic information system mapping methodology to examine how access to healthy food options influenced health and mortality outcomes in one of the largest counties in the state of North Carolina. We created geospatial maps representing food deserts—areas with scarce access to nutritious food; food swamps—areas with more availability of unhealthy food options compared to healthy food options; and food oases—areas with a relatively higher availability of healthy food options than unhealthy options. Our results presented a positive correlation coefficient of R² = 0.819 among obesity and the independent variables of transportation access, and population. The correlation coefficient matrix analysis helped to identify a strong negative correlation between obesity and median income. Overall, this study offers valuable insights that can help health authorities develop preemptive preparedness for healthcare disasters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3adescriptive statistics 3afood availability 3afood security 3ageographic information systems 3ahealth services 3ahealthy diet 3ahypertension 3aincome 3amodels 3amortality 3aobesity 3apeople 3aspatial data 3atransportation 3aNorth Carolina1 aGokaraju, Balakrishna 1 aMehta, Nikhil 1 aDoss, Daniel Adrian0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Nov. 03, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi101107453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010300176300001400279520173900293592002802032650001502060650001502075650002502090650001602115650001602131650001902147650002202166650002002188650001002208650004302218650002902261650001202290650000902302650002102311650001402332650002602346650001302372650001402385650002202399650001102421650002002432650001702452650001302469650001102482650001102493651000902504700002002513700002602533700002102559700001802580773007702598856008502675852000902760655001202769IND60088440220221123035216.0141102e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008844022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Gómez, B.I.10aBiochemical and molecular characterization of the venom from the Cuban scorpion Rhopalurus junceus  ap. 18-27.  aThis communication describes the first general biochemical, molecular and functional characterization of the venom from the Cuban blue scorpion Rhopalurus junceus, which is often used as a natural product for anti-cancer therapy in Cuba. The soluble venom of this arachnid is not toxic to mice, injected intraperitoneally at doses up to 200 μg/20 g body weight, but it is deadly to insects at doses of 10 μg per animal. The venom causes typical alpha and beta-effects on Na⁺ channels, when assayed using patch-clamp techniques in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. It also affects K⁺ currents conducted by ERG (ether-a-go-go related gene) channels. The soluble venom was shown to display phospholipase, hyaluronidase and anti-microbial activities. High performance liquid chromatography of the soluble venom can separate at least 50 components, among which are peptides lethal to crickets. Four such peptides were isolated to homogeneity and their molecular masses and N-terminal amino acid sequence were determined. The major component (RjAa12f) was fully sequenced by Edman degradation. It contains 64 amino acid residues and four disulfide bridges, similar to other known scorpion toxins. A cDNA library prepared from the venomous glands of one scorpion allowed cloning 18 genes that code for peptides of the venom, including RjA12f and eleven other closely related genes. Sequence analyses and phylogenetic reconstruction of the amino acid sequences deduced from the cloned genes showed that this scorpion contains sodium channel like toxin sequences clearly segregated into two monophyletic clusters. Considering the complex set of effects on Na⁺ currents verified here, this venom certainly warrant further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthoptera 3aScorpiones 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abody weight 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3adisulfide bonds 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3ainsects 3amice 3amolecular weight 3amonophyly 3apatch-clamp technique 3apeptides 3apotassium 3asequence analysis 3asodium 3asodium channels 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3avenoms 3aCuba1 aCoronas, F.I.V.1 aRestano-Cassulini, R.1 aRodríguez, R.R.1 aPossani, L.D.0 tToxicon.g2011 July, v. 58, no. 1 p.18-27dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015600157300001800313520218800331592002802519650002202547650002402569650001402593650001402607650002302621650002202644650003802666650001002704650002002714650001302734650000902747650002202756650001902778650002102797650004402818650001902862650002302881650000802904650001202912650002402924700002002948700002102968700001702989700002703006700002903033700002403062700002103086700002003107700002003127700002003147773010803167856007503275852000903350655001203359IND60532788320171121000000.0160728e20130909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053278832DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400804w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetit, Audrey10aEffect of Polymer Composition on Rheological and Degradation Properties of Temperature-Responsive Gelling Systems Composed of Acyl-Capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA  ap. 3172-3182.  aIn this study, the ability to modulate the rheological and degradation properties of temperature-responsive gelling systems composed of acyl-capped poly(ε-caprolactone-co-lactide)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone-co-lactide) (PCLA-PEG-PCLA) triblock copolymers was investigated. Eight polymers with varying molecular weight of PCLA, caproyl/lactoyl ratio (CL/LA) and capped with either acetyl- or propionyl-groups were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of l-lactide and ε-caprolactone in toluene using PEG as initiator and tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate as catalyst, and subsequently reacted in solution with an excess of acyl chloride to yield fully acyl-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA. The microstructure of the polymers was determined by ¹H NMR, and the thermal properties and crystallinity of the polymers in dry state and in 25 wt % aqueous systems were studied by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. Rheological and degradation/dissolution properties of aqueous systems composed of the polymers in 25 wt % aqueous systems were studied. ¹H NMR analysis revealed that the monomer sequence in the PCLA blocks was not fully random, resulting in relatively long CL sequences, even though transesterification was demonstrated by the enrichment with lactoyl units and the presence of PEG–OH end groups. Except the most hydrophilic polymer composed of acetyl-capped PCLA₁₄₀₀-PEG₁₅₀₀-PCLA₁₄₀₀ having a CL/LA molar ratio of 2.5, the polymers at 25 wt % in buffer were sols below room temperature and transformed into gels between room temperature and 37 °C, which makes them suitable as temperature-responsive gelling systems for drug delivery. Over a period of weeks at 37 °C, the systems containing polymers with long CL sequences (∼8 CL) and propionyl end-groups became semicrystalline as shown by X-ray diffraction analysis. Degradation of the gels by dissolution at 37 °C took 100–150 days for the amorphous gels and 250–300 days for the semicrystalline gels. In conclusion, this study shows that changes in the polymer composition allow an easy but significant modulation of rheological and degradation properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3aethylene glycol 3agelation 3agels 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amicrostructure 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3athermal properties 3atin 3atoluene 3atransesterification1 aMüller, Benno,1 aMeijboom, Ronald1 aBruin, Peter1 avan de Manakker, Frank1 aVersluijs-Helder, Marjan1 ade Leede, Leo G.

In this study, chitosan (300 mM) and yeast extract (8 g/L) were used individually or in combination to improve the yields of garlic plants under drought conditions (i.e., 75% and 50% of the water they would normally receive from irrigation) for two seasons. Significant decreases in numbers of leaves per plant and plant height, plant dry weight, relative water content, and chlorophyll a and b concentrations were found in stressed garlic plants in both seasons. The greatest reductions in these characters were recorded in plants that received only 50% of the normal irrigation in both seasons. Levels of hydrogen peroxide, products of lipid peroxidation such as malondialdehyde, and superoxide, as well as percentages of electrolyte leakage, were elevated considerably and were signals of oxidative damage. The application of the yeast extract (8 g/L) or chitosan (300 mM) individually or in combination led to a remarkable increase in the most studied characters of the stressed garlic plants. The combination of yeast extract (8 g/L) plus chitosan (300 mM) led to increase plant height (44%), ascorbic acid levels (30.2%), and relative water content (36.8%), as well as the chlorophyll a (50.7%) and b concentrations (79%), regulated the proline content and levels of antioxidant enzymes in stressed garlic plants that received 75% of the normal irrigation, and this decreased the signs of oxidative stress (i.e., percentage of electrolyte leakage and levels of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide).  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3achitosan 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3aeconomic valuation 3aelectrolyte leakage 3agarlic 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airrigation 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amedicinal plants 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant height 3aproline 3avegetables 3awater content 3ayeast extract1 aAttia, Kotb A.1 aNiedbała, Gniewko 1 aWojciechowski, Tomasz 1 aHafez, Yaser 1 aAlamery, Salman 1 aAlateeq, Talal K.1 aArafa, Sally A.0 tHorticulturae.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 7, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae71105103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013200159300001800291500001900309500002000328520196100348592002802309596006802337650002402405650001602429650003802445650001002483650001102493650001202504650001102516650001202527650001502539650002002554650001402574650002902588650001902617700001902636700002102655700002102676700002502697700002002722700002202742700002102764700006002785773011802845856007402963852000903037655001203046IND60707303720221122062927.0200819e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070730372DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.152262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattioni, Anna10aRing Finger Protein 11 acts on ligand‐activated EGFR via the direct interaction with the UIM region of ANKRD13 protein family  ap. 3526-3550.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRING finger protein 11 (RNF11) is an evolutionary conserved Really Interesting New Gene E3 ligase that is overexpressed in several human tumours. Although several reports have highlighted its involvement in crucial cellular processes, the mechanistic details underlying its function are still poorly understood. Utilizing stable isotope labelling by amino acids in culture (SILAC)‐based proteomics analysis, we identified 51 proteins that co‐immunoprecipitate with wild‐type RNF11 and/or with its catalytically inactive mutant. We focused our attention on the interaction of RNF11 with Ankyrin repeat domain‐containing protein 13 (ANKRD13)s family. Members of the ANKRD13 family contain ubiquitin‐interacting motifs (UIM) that recognize the Lys‐63‐linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains appended to Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) soon after ligand binding. We show that ANKRD13A, ANKRD13B and ANKRD13D form a complex with RNF11 in vivo and that the UIMs are required for complex formation. However, at odds with the conventional UIM binding mode, Ub modification of RNF11 is not required for the interaction with ANKRD13 proteins. We also show that the interaction between ANKRD13A and RNF11 is modulated by the EGF stimulus and that a complex formed by ANKRD13A, RNF11 and activated EGFR is transiently assembled in the early phases of receptor endocytosis. Moreover, loss of function of the E3 ligases Itchy E3 ubiquitin‐protein ligase (ITCH) or RNF11, respectively, abrogates or increases the ubiquitination of endogenous ANKRD13A, affecting its ability to bind activated EGFR. We propose a model whereby the ANKRD13 proteins act as molecular scaffolds that promote the transient formation of a complex between the activated EGFR and the E3 ligases ITCH and RNF11. By regulating the ubiquitination status of ANKRD13A and consequently its endocytic adaptor function, RNF11 promotes sorting of the activated EGFR for lysosomal degradation.  aPublisher supplied data  aIG 2013 N14135cAssociazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro 3aRING finger domains 3aendocytosis 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3agenes 3ahumans 3aligands 3amodels 3amutants 3aproteomics 3astable isotopes 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination1 aBoldt, Karsten1 aAuciello, Giulio1 aKomada, Masayuki1 aRappoport, Joshua Z.1 aUeffing, Marius1 aCastagnoli, Luisa1 aCesareni, Gianni1 aSantonico, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3897-89900 tFEBS journal.g2020 Aug., v. 287, no. 16 p.3526-3550dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.152263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002400156245010500180300001800285500002000303520234000323592002802663650002402691650001702715650002302732650001802755650002502773650002102798650002202819650001702841650001102858650002202869650001802891650002902909650002202938651001802960651001802978700002002996700002103016773013203037852000903169856007403178655001203252IND4418168420221122135905.0180321e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441816842DNAL7 a186865802pmid7 a10.1890/07-0919.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Amato, Anthony W.14aThe influence of successional processes and disturbance on the structure of tsuga canadensis forests  ap. 1182-1199.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOld‐growth forests are valuable sources of ecological, conservation, and management information, yet these ecosystems have received little study in New England, due in large part to their regional scarcity. To increase our understanding of the structures and processes common in these rare forests, we studied the abundance of downed coarse woody debris (CWD) and snags and live‐tree size‐class distributions in 16 old‐growth hemlock forests in western Massachusetts. Old‐growth stands were compared with eight adjacent second‐growth hemlock forests to gain a better understanding of the structural differences between these two classes of forests resulting from contrasting histories. In addition, we used stand‐level dendroecological reconstructions to investigate the linkages between disturbance history and old‐growth forest structure using an information–theoretic model selection framework. Old‐growth stands exhibit a much higher degree of structural complexity than second‐growth forests. In particular, old‐growth stands had larger overstory trees and greater volumes of downed coarse woody debris (135.2 vs. 33.2 m³/ha) and snags (21.2 vs. 10.7 m³/ha). Second‐growth stands were characterized by either skewed unimodal or reverse‐J shaped diameter distributions, while old‐growth forests contained bell‐shaped, skewed unimodal, rotated sigmoid, and reverse J‐shaped distributions. The variation in structural attributes among old‐growth stands, particularly the abundance of downed CWD, was closely related to disturbance history. In particular, old‐growth stands experiencing moderate levels of canopy disturbance during the last century (1930s and 1980s) had greater accumulations of CWD, highlighting the importance of gap‐scale disturbances in shaping the long‐term development and structural characteristics of old‐growth forests. These findings are important for the development of natural disturbance‐based silvicultural systems that may be used to restore important forest characteristics lacking in New England second‐growth stands by integrating structural legacies of disturbance (e.g., downed CWD) and resultant tree‐size distribution patterns. This silvicultural approach would emulate the often episodic nature of CWD recruitment within old‐growth forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoarse woody debris 3asilviculture 3aold-growth forests 3aforest stands 3aforestry development 3aTsuga canadensis 3aforest succession 3atree classes 3amodels 3asecondary forests 3aforest canopy 3aanthropogenic activities 2aTsugaxphysiology 3aMassachusetts 0aMassachusetts1 aOrwig, David A.1 aFoster, David R.0 tEcological applications.g2008 July, v. 18, no. 5 p.1182-1199dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0919.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02735naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245015500162300002000317520132000337592002801657650001301685650001401698650002501712650001201737650001801749650001001767650002201777650001201799650001301811650002201824650001101846650001701857650001401874650001101888650001501899700001901914700001401933700005501947700005602002773014302058856007902201852000902280655001202289IND60620168820221120235256.0181106e20180928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062016882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b027832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Sainan10aPrimary Formation of Highly Oxidized Multifunctional Products in the OH-Initiated Oxidation of Isoprene: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Study  ap. 12255-12264.  aIt is generally assumed that isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors are mainly formed from the secondary reactions of intermediate products with OH radicals in the gas phase and multiphase oxidation in particles. In this paper, we predicted a theoretical mechanism for the primary formation of highly oxygenated molecules (HOM) in the gas phase through successive intramolecular H-shifts and O₂ addition in the specific Z-δ isomer of hydroxyl-peroxy radicals and alkoxy radicals. The position of O₂ addition is different from that in forming hydroperoxy aldehydes. The prediction was further supported experimentally by successfully identifying a few highly oxidized peroxy radicals and closed-shell products such as C₅H₉O₇,₉, C₅H₁₀O₆,₇,₈, and C₄H₈O₅ in a flow reactor by chemical ionization mass spectrometry at air pressure. These HOM products could serve as important precursors to isoprene-derived SOA. Further modeling studies on the effect of NO concentration suggested that HOM formation could account for up to ∼11% of the branching ratio (∼9% from the 4-OH channel and ∼2% from the 1-OH channel) in the reaction of isoprene with OH when the lifetimes of peroxy radicals due to bimolecular reactions are ∼100 s, which is typical in forest regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaldehydes 3aatmospheric pressure 3aforests 3afree radicals 3agases 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aisomers 3aisoprene 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprediction1 aRiva, Matthieu1 aYan, Chao1 aEhn, Mikael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0215-48931 aWang, Liming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8953-250X0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Sept. 28, v. 52, no. 21 p.12255-12264dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b027833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003100146245013900177300001600316500001400332520198900346592002802335650002002363650001102383650001402394650001602408650001402424650001102438650000902449650002002458650001502478650001602493650001802509650001302527651001002540653002902550653001802579653002002597653003102617700001602648700001902664700002102683773014902704856008002853852000902933655001202942IND60710092320221119063650.0200908e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071009232DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.v0iOF.91352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvinashilingam, N.A.

Two villages namely Rajasani and Chopasani Charnan of Tiwri block of Jodhpur district were selected randomly from ICAR-CAZRI's Mera Gaon Mera Gaurav Initiative (MGMGI) programme. A predetermined sample of sixty respondents, 30 respondents per village were randomly selected. The data were collected through observations with the help of a personal interview schedule. The study revealed that majority of the respondents (36.66%) belonged to old aged group (> 55 years) and had their education (31.67%) up to middle level. Dairying with agriculture profession was the most (93.33 per cent) prevalent occupation. The data regarding family size indicates that majority of respondents (85%) are having 4–10 members and more than fifty per cent (53.33%) of the respondents had farm size of 1–2 ha. About 68.00 per cent of the respondents possess 1–2 milch animals. Majority (81.67%) of the respondents were in medium level of mass media exposure and extension agency contact. Almost 88.37 per cent of the respondents were not participated socially. Regarding the amount of milk production, 63.34 per cent farmers produced about 2–5 litres milk per day. More than two-third of the respondents were having medium annual income (Rs. 14, 642-Rs.32, 924) and economic motivation. Among the dairy farmers, more than half of the respondents were medium in their progressiveness and religious belief, while two third of the respondents (75%) had medium level of Fatalism-Scientism. Further the study revealed that the majority of dairy farmers (53.34%), possessed medium level of knowledge followed by 23.33 per cent each of low and high categories. The results obtained from simple correlation and path analysis indicated that thecharactersextension agencycontact and annual incomehad strong positive correlation and high magnitude of positive direct effects on knowledge level about dairy farming practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3acattle 3aeducation 3afamily size 3afarm size 3aincome 3amilk 3amilk production 3amotivation 3aoccupations 3apath analysis 3avillages 3aIndia 0aCorrelation co-efficient 0aDairy Farming 0aKnowledge level 0aPath Co-efficient analysis1 aSingh, V.B.1 aSingh, Bhagwan1 aTewari, Pratibha0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2018 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.947-952dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.v0iOF.91353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010700162300001800269520116400287592002801451650001401479650002201493650002101515650001101536650001301547650001301560650002201573653001801595653001001613653003201623653001701655653002001672700001701692700001901709700001801728700002101746700001801767700005401785700005801839773013901897856007902036852000902115655001202124IND60594620920221120055034.0180621e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059462092DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b137412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Sangmin10aRoll-to-Roll Laser-Printed Graphene–Graphitic Carbon Electrodes for High-Performance Supercapacitors  ap. 1033-1038.  aCarbon electrodes including graphene and thin graphite films have been utilized for various energy and sensor applications, where the patterning of electrodes is essentially included. Laser scribing in a DVD writer and inkjet printing were used to pattern the graphene-like materials, but the size and speed of fabrication has been limited for practical applications. In this work, we devise a simple strategy to use conventional laser-printer toner materials as precursors for graphitic carbon electrodes. The toner was laser-printed on metal foils, followed by thermal annealing in hydrogen environment, finally resulting in the patterned thin graphitic carbon or graphene electrodes for supercapacitors. The electrochemical cells made of the graphene–graphitic carbon electrodes show remarkably higher energy and power performance compared to conventional supercapacitors. Furthermore, considering the simplicity and scalability of roll-to-roll (R2R) electrode patterning processes, the proposed method would enable cheaper and larger-scale synthesis and patterning of graphene–graphitic carbon electrodes for various energy applications in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acarbon electrodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3amaterials science 0alaser printer 0atoner 0agraphene−graphitic carbon 0aroll-to-roll 0asupercapacitors1 aLim, Kyungmi1 aPark, Hyeokjun1 aPark, Jong Bo1 aPark, Seong Chae1 aCho, Sung-Pyo1 aKang, Kisuk1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8696-18861 aHong, Byung Hee1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8355-88750 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 10, no. 1 p.1033-1038dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b137413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245012300159300001600282500001400298520128400312592002801596650002001624650001301644650001601657650001201673650001801685650001501703650001001718651001001728653001501738653002301753653001301776653001301789653003101802700001701833700001901850700001901869700001601888773014901904856007602053852000902129655001202138IND60710092420221119063652.0200908e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071009242DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-33302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinha, Beena10aGenetic impact on external and internal egg quality traits of Vanaraja and Gramapriya birds and their crosses in Bihar  ap. 953-958.  aNAL-light  aPoultry farming is gaining strength in mitigating livelihood and nutritional security to the poor farmers which constitute 60% of the India's population. Thus eggs of superior quality is prerequisite for profitable marketing and for hatchability too. The present study was conducted on two improved varieties, Vanaraja (dual purpose type) and Gramapriya (the layer type) chicken developed at PDP, Hyderabad and their crosses on random mating. The genetic groups taken were Gramapriya (male) x Gramapriya (female), Vanaraja(male) x Vanaraja(female), Gramapriya(male) x Vanaraja(female)and Vanaraja (male) x Gramapriya(female). 6 males and 30 females were taken from each genetic group and maintained separately under deep litter system with a mating ratio of 1 male: 5 females. To study the genetic effect on external and internal egg quality traits, a total of more than 50 eggs were collected at random from each of 4 genetic groups upto 28 weeks of age. The average shell thickness obtained to be ranged from 0.36 to 0.39 mm. The average albumen and yolk indices were found to be ranged from 7.396 to 8.656 and 41.749 to 43.888 respectively. The average shell weight and percentage of shell weight observed to be ranged from 4.147 to 5.627 g and 17.266 to 18.003% respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3achickens 3aegg quality 3afemales 3afood security 3alivelihood 3amales 3aIndia 0aGramapriya 0aEgg quality traits 0aExternal 0aInternal 0aVanaraja and their crosses1 aMandal, K.G.1 aKumari, Ragini1 aKumari, Anjali1 aGonge, D.S.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2018 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.953-958dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-33303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245010600205300001200311506007600323520234900399592002802748506003702776650002602813650001502839650001302854650001802867650001302885650001502898650003702913650002402950650002302974700001702997700001503014700003003029700002603059773010403085856007803189852000903267655001203276IND50072430120221207054508.0150808e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007243012DNAL7 a10.1186/1751-0147-56-22doi7 aPMC39013772pmcid7 a243979272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLundberg, Åsa,10aAssociations between bacterial genotype and outcome of bovine clinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis  ap. 925.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of clinical mastitis in dairy cows worldwide. The cure rate after antimicrobial treatment of clinical S. aureus mastitis is very variable due to both cow and bacterial factors. Studies have shown that bacterial genotype might affect short-term bacteriological and clinical cure, but the long-term outcome has been less studied. The objectives of this study were to investigate associations between bacterial genotype and long-term outcome of veterinary-treated clinical mastitis (VTCM) caused by S. aureus during a follow-up period of 120 days and to study genotype variation among Swedish S. aureus isolates. S. aureus isolates from cases of VTCM were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Long-term outcome measurements used were somatic cell count (SCC), additional diagnoses of VTCM, milk yield and culling. Isolates were classified into clusters (>80% similarity) and pulsotypes (100% similarity). Clusters and pulsotypes were grouped according to occurrence. Multivariable mixed-effect linear regression models including cow and bacterial factors with possible influence on SCC or milk yield were used to calculate differences in SCC or milk yield between groups. Additional outcome measures were calculated using a test of proportions. RESULTS: The isolates (n = 185) were divided into 18 clusters and 29 pulsotypes. Two pulsotypes were classified as common, and were found in 64% of the cases of VTCM. Remaining isolates were classified as less common or rare pulsotypes. The distribution was similar at cluster level. Outcome was calculated from follow-up data on 111 cows. Significantly lower SCC during the follow-up period was found in cows infected with common clusters compared to in cows infected with less common/rare clusters. The proportion of cows with SCC <200 000 cells/ml during the whole follow-up period was significantly higher in the group common clusters than in the group less common/rare clusters. Bacterial genotype did not influence the other outcome parameters. CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, two S. aureus pulsotypes, identified in about 64% of clinical S. aureus cases, were widespread. Cows infected with the common genotypes had significantly lower SCC during 120 days after treatment compared to cows infected with less common or rare genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3adairy cows 3agenotype 3alinear models 3amastitis 3amilk yield 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aregression analysis 3asomatic cell count1 aAspán, Anna1 aNyman, Ann1 aUnnerstad, Helle Ericsson1 aWaller, Karin Persson0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2014 Dec., v. 56, no. 1 p.925-925dSpringer-Verlagx1751-01477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-56-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01379naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245007900165300001600244520047800260592002800738650002300766650001200789650002000801650001000821650001600831650001900847651001100866773011600877856007500993852000901068655001201077IND60643726320221117002714.0190513e20141121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064372632DNAL7 a10.5586/am.1973.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŁawrynowicz, Maria10aHigher macroscopic fungi in the oak-hornbeam forests of the central Poland  ap. 133-204.  aIn 1966-70 the author has investigated macroscopic fungi in the association Tilio-Carpinetum Tracz 1962 and Potentillo albae-Quercetum Liob. 1933 of nature reserves in the central Poland.

The present experiment was carried out for a time period of three and half months (within autumn season) and was accomplished in three phases/conditions. To avoid individual effect of bulls, the same three Hariana bulls were used as experimental animals in all the three phases/conditions. During the first (control) phase of experiment, the bulls were not exposed to any additional source of sound except the normal environmental sound of semen collection site. In second and third phase, bulls were exposed to a musical instrumental sound signal of 100 and 150 BPM with intensity below 85 dB. All the three phases last for a period of one month (four weeks) one after other in continuation, but the third phase was started after a gap of three weeks from the second in order to nullify the persistent effect of sound exposure to bulls during second phase of investigation. The mean values of cortisol and testosterone of Hariana bulls at no exposure, sound signal of 100 and 150 BPM were 35.30±1.82, 37.71±1.82 and 34.87±1.82; and 2.54±0.09, 2.49±0.09 and 2.72±0.09, respectively. In the present study it was observed that the trend of a non significant increase in plasma concentration of testosterone and a non significant decrease in plasma concentration of cortisol as a consequence of this exposure indicated that exposure of a sound signal of 150 BPM with intensity below 85 dB, caused a favorable change in plasma concentration of sex (testosterone) and stress (cortisol) hormones, which might have been associated with better reproductive efficiency of Hariana bulls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3aautumn 3acortisol 3afarms 3areproductive efficiency 3asemen 3atestosterone 0aBPM 0adB 0aHariana bull 0aSound exposure1 aSingh, Yajuvendra1 aShukla, Garima1 aShukla, P.K.1 aSirohi, R.1 aKumar, Muneendra1 aSwain, Dilip1 aMamta, 0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2018 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.964-967dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.v0iOF.91243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164300001100309520133200320592002801652650001701680650001501697650001401712650002501726650002201751650001401773650001001787650000701797650002501804650002601829650002501855700001401880700001901894700001901913700001701932773014801949856008202097852000902179655001202188IND60688713220221121064232.0210113e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068871322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-020-1243-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yapeng10aEnhanced triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) degradation through application of an O3/UV process: Performance optimization and degradation pathways  ap. 64.  aTriallyl isocyanurate (TAIC, C₁₂H₁₅N₃O₃) has featured in wastewater treatment as a refractory organic compound due to the significant production capability and negative environmental impact. TAIC degradation was enhanced when an ozone(O₃)/ultraviolet(UV) process was applied compared with the application of an independent O₃ process. Although 99% of TAIC could be degraded in 5 min during both processes, the O₃/UV process had a 70%mineralization rate that was much higher than that of the independent O₃ process (9%) in 30 min. Four possible degradation pathways were proposed based on the organic compounds of intermediate products identified during TAIC degradation through the application of independent O₃ and O₃/UV processes. pH impacted both the direct and indirect oxidation processes. Acidic and alkaline conditions preferred direct and indirect reactions respectively, with a pH of 9 achieving maximum Total Organic Carbon (TOC) removal. Both CO₃²– and HCO₃– decreased TOC removal, however only CO₃²– negatively impacted TAIC degradation. Effects of Cl– as a radical scavenger became more marked only at high concentrations (over 500 mg/L Cl–). Particulate and suspended matter could hinder the transmission of ultraviolet light and reduce the production of HO$ accordingly.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3acarbonates 3achlorides 3aenvironmental impact 3aorganic compounds 3aoxidation 3aozone 3apH 3atotal organic carbon 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater treatment1 aGong, Hui1 aWang, Jianbing1 aChang, Fengmin1 aWang, Kaijun0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2020 Aug., v. 14, no. 4 p.64-64dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-020-1243-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03870naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002400156245010500180300001600285500002000301500001500321520213000336592002802466650001702494650002202511650002202533650002302555650002202578650002502600650002002625650001802645650002202663650001402685650002202699650002102721650002402742650001402766650002202780650002502802650005202827650001402879650001402893650002302907650002302930650002402953651001302977653002402990700001903014700002303033700002303056773013003079852000903209856007403218655001203292IND4418169520221122221328.0180321e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441816952DNAL7 a193231972pmid7 a10.1890/08-0845.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardini, Eleanor A.10aComplex population dynamics and control of the invasive biennial Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard)  ap. 387-397.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aControlling species invasions is a leading problem for applied ecology. While controlling populations expanding linearly or exponentially is straightforward, intervention in systems with complex dynamics can have complicated, and sometimes counterintuitive, consequences. Most invasive plant populations are stage‐structured and density‐dependent—a recipe for complex dynamics—and yet few population models have been created to explore the effects of control efforts on such species. We examined the demography of the invasive biennial plant Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) on the front of its spread into a natural area and found evidence of strong density dependence in vital rates of first‐year rosette and second‐year adult stage classes. We parameterized a density‐dependent, stage‐structured projection model using field‐collected data. This model produces two‐point cycles with alternating years in which adults vs. rosettes are more prevalent. Such population dynamics match observations in natural populations, suggesting that these complicated population dynamics may result from deterministic rules. We used this model to evaluate simulated management strategies, including herbicide treatment of rosettes and clipping or pulling of adult plants. Management of A. petiolata by inducing mortality of either rosettes or adults will not be effective at reducing population density unless the induced mortality is very high (>95% for rosettes and >85% for adults) and repeated every year. Indeed, induced mortality of rosettes can be counterproductive, causing increases in the stationary distribution of A. petiolata density. This species is typical of many invasive plants (stage‐structured, short‐lived, high fertility) and exhibits common forms of density dependence. Thus, the management implications of our study should apply broadly to other species with similar life histories. We suggest that management should focus on managing adults rather than rosettes, and on creating efficient control in targeted areas of the population, rather than spreading less efficient efforts widely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aweed control 3aplant development 3asimulation models 3aAlliaria petiolata 3atemperate forests 3adevelopmental stages 3abroadleaf weeds 3aplant density 3aseed productivity 3amortality 3apopulation growth 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3abiennials 3aintroduced plants 3avegetation structure 2aBrassicaceaexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aFertility 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 3aMissouri 0apopulation dynamics1 aDrake, John M.1 aChase, Jonathan M.1 aKnight, Tiffany M.0 tEcological applications.g2009 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.387-397dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0845.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03525naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245007600177300001600253500002000269520188400289592002802173650001002201650001902211650001002230650002102240650002402261650002202285650002602307650002502333650001502358650002902373650002202402650001202424650001902436650003002455650002002485650001702505650002202522650001902544650001302563650001102576650002402587650000902611650003602620650001302656651001302669651003902682700002502721773013002746852000902876856007402885655001202959IND4418169720221122175820.0180321e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441816972DNAL7 a193231982pmid7 a10.1890/08-0485.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrer, Emily C.10aLitter drives ecosystem and plant community changes in cattail invasion  ap. 398-412.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInvaded systems are commonly associated with a change in ecosystem processes and a decline in native species diversity; however, many different causal pathways linking invasion, ecosystem change, and native species decline could produce this pattern. The initial driver of environmental change may be anthropogenic, or it may be the invader itself; and the mechanism behind native species decline may be the human‐induced environmental change, competition from the invader, or invader‐induced environmental change (non‐trophic effects). We examined applicability of each of these alternate pathways in Great Lakes coastal marshes invaded by hybrid cattail (Typha × glauca). In a survey including transects in three marshes, we found that T. × glauca was associated with locally high soil nutrients, low light, and large amounts of litter, and that native diversity was highest in areas of shallow litter depth. We tested whether live T. × glauca plants or their litter induced changes in the environment and in diversity with a live plant and litter transplant experiment. After one year, Typha litter increased soil NH₄⁺ and N mineralization twofold, lowered light levels, and decreased the abundance and diversity of native plants, while live Typha plants had no effect on the environment or on native plants. This suggests that T. × glauca, through its litter production, can cause the changes in ecosystem processes that we commonly attribute to anthropogenic nutrient loading and that T. × glauca does not displace native species through competition for resources, but rather affects them non‐trophically through its litter. Moreover, because T. × glauca plants were taller when grown with their own litter, we suggest that this invader may produce positive feedbacks and change the environment in ways that benefit itself and may promote its own invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTypha 3awetland plants 3aweeds 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aplant communities 3abotanical composition 3avegetation structure 3aecosystems 3aanthropogenic activities 3aplant competition 3amarshes 3asoil fertility 3ageographical distribution 3alight intensity 3aplant litter 3aammonium nitrogen 3amineralization 3ahabitats 3aheight 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSoil 2aTyphaceaexgrowth & development 2aWetlands 3aMichigan 0aGreat Lakes Region (North America)1 aGoldberg, Deborah E.0 tEcological applications.g2009 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.398-412dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0485.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03500naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012700168300001600295520146600311592002801777596004601805650002601851650001601877650006901893650002401962650001901986650002602005650002602031650001702057650002402074650002302098650001202121650001502133650001002148650002202158650001102180650001302191650002902204650001702233650003102250650002002281650001102301650002402312650002402336650002102360650001302381650001202394651001602406651001202422651001602434700002102450700002002471700001802491700002002509700002002529700001802549700006102567773011902628856008202747852000902829655001202838IND60688713520221121064305.0200416e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068871352DNAL7 a10.1007/s12224-019-09355-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBohner, Andreas10aEcological responses of semi-natural grasslands to abandonment: case studies in three mountain regions in the Eastern Alps  ap. 211-225.  aSemi-natural, extensively managed, grasslands are among the most species-rich agroecosystems in Europe. However, they are threatened by abandonment. We investigated the response of semi-natural grasslands to cessation of mowing at ten sites in three UNESCO Biosphere Reserves in Switzerland and Austria. We assessed vegetation characteristics, topsoil properties and microbially mediated soil processes by comparing once-a-year mowed with adjacent long-term abandoned grasslands on semi-dry, nutrient-poor, base-rich soils. Plant litter decomposition was determined using standardized substrates (Tea Bag Index). Soil microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Abandonment altered floristic composition by replacing shade-intolerant or low-growing grassland species, in particular character species of the alliance Bromion erecti, with medium- to tall-sized grasses (e.g. Brachypodium pinnatum) and tall herbs (e.g. Laserpitium latifolium). Time since abandonment had an influence on the magnitude of successional changes after abandonment. Cessation of mowing increased above-ground phytomass but decreased plant species richness and evenness. Abandonment increased soil microbial biomass, promoted litter decomposition and led to an increased soil organic carbon, C:N ratio, and inorganic N supply. Our findings also showed that abandoned grasslands dominated by grasses remained shrub- and treeless for several decades.  aPublisher supplied data  aHealthyAlpscAustrian Academy of Sciences 3aBrachypodium pinnatum 3aLaserpitium 3aUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 3aaboveground biomass 3aagroecosystems 3abotanical composition 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acase studies 3acommunity structure 3aconservation areas 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aherbs 3amicrobial biomass 3amowing 3anitrogen 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplant litter 3apopulation characteristics 3ashade tolerance 3ashrubs 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic carbon 3aspecies richness 3atea bags 3atopsoil 3aAlps region 3aAustria 3aSwitzerland1 aKarrer, Johannes1 aWalcher, Ronnie1 aBrandl, David1 aMichel, Kerstin1 aArnberger, Arne1 aFrank, Thomas1 aZaller, Johann G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7744-73780 tFolia geobotanica.g2019 Dec., v. 54, no. 3-4 p.211-225dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000071x1211-95207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-019-09355-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010500164300001600269520111600285592002801401650001301429650001401442650003401456650001101490650002101501650001201522650001401534650001301548650001601561650002101577650001601598653002201614653001401636653001401650653001301664700001601677700002001693700001401713700001601727700001701743773012401760856008301884852000901967655001201976IND60619548620221118123508.0190705e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061954862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2018.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Xiaoyan10aStructure characterization and pyrolysis behavior of organosolv lignin isolated from corncob residue  ap. 115-124.  aStructural features and pyrolysis behavior of organosolv lignin isolated from corncob residue by THF-H2O solvent were studied. The average molecular weight (Mw) of the organosolv lignin, mainly constituted of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S) and various substructures with β-O-4, β-β bonds, was mainly distributed between 10,000 and 600 g/mol, occupying about 81%. TG/DTG curves of the organosolv lignin showed three maximum weight loss peaks at about 120, 150 and 350 °C, respectively. The pyrolysis of organosolv lignin was performed through two ways, that is, one-step at different temperature (RT-120 °C, RT-150 °C, RT-350 °C) and stepwise (120–150 °C, 150–350 °C) pyrolysis over different temperature range. The results indicated that oligomers with molecular weight between 200 and 500 Da were the main products in bio-oil at the low temperature step, while high temperature step produced certain amount of monomers of phenols, guaiacols and syringols. The variation of structure and molecular weight distribution of pyrolyzed residues was further investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acorn cobs 3adifferential thermal analysis 3alignin 3amolecular weight 3aphenols 3apyrolysis 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3aweight loss 0aOrganosolv lignin 0aPyrolysis 0aOligomers 0aMonomers1 aLi, Qiuxing1 aJiang, Zhicheng1 aWang, Yue1 aLi, JinDong1 aHu, Changwei0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2018 Nov., v. 136 p.115-124dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2018.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245010600165300001800271520110700289592002801396650001401424650001301438650002101451650002101472650002201493650001701515650002001532650001801552650001401570650002501584650002201609650002001631650001301651700002501664700002601689700002501715700002301740700002101763700002101784773010801805856007501913852000901988655001201997IND60532789120171127000000.0160728e20130909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053278912DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400859z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitta, Danielly
L. A.10aCovalent Albumin Microparticles as an Adjuvant for Production of Mucosal Vaccines against Hepatitis B  ap. 3231-3237.  aCovalently modified albumin (BSA) microparticles were developed for potential use as an adjuvant in mucosal vaccines against hepatitis B. To synthesize consistent protein particles, a covalent approach was proposed to modify BSA. Our strategy was to bond maleic anhydride (MA) molecules to BSA structure by nucleophilic reaction for further radical cross-linking/polymerization reaction with N′,N′-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm). The presence of poly(N′,N′-dimethylacrylamide) in the protein network enables the microparticles to show well-defined, homogeneous forms. Cytotoxicity tests showed that the cytotoxic concentration for 50% of VERO cells (CC₅₀) was 216.25 ± 5.30 μg mL–¹ in 72 h of incubation. The obtained CC₅₀ value is relatively low for an incubation time of 72 h, suggesting an acceptable biocompatibility. Assay of total protein showed that the encapsulation efficiency of the microparticles with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 77.7 ± 0.2%. For the reference sample, which was incubated without HBsAg, the quantity of protein was below the limit of detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aalbumins 3abiocompatibility 3achemical bonding 3achemical elements 3acytotoxicity 3adetection limit 3aencapsulation 3ahepatitis 3ahepatitis B antigens 3amaleic anhydrides 3aprotein content 3avaccines1 aGuilherme, Marcos R.1 aGarcia, Francielle P.1 aCellet, Thelma S.

Studying vegetation structure and woody species composition is important in monitoring vegetation dynamics for efficient forest management. This study was carried out to characterize woody vegetation along a climatic gradient. Stratified sampling according to four vegetation types was conducted in 120 plots in two protected areas. The plot size was 30 m × 30 m in savannas and 50 m × 10 m in gallery forests. In each plot, all woody species with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm were systematically identified and measured. Diversity indices, structural parameters and species importance values were calculated and compared among the sites and vegetation types. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to characterize each vegetation type in each climatic zone. The species diversity, tree density and basal area of woody species increased significantly along the climatic gradient from north to south. Discriminant analysis identified two vegetation types: open vegetation (shrub savannas and tree savannas) with moderate species richness and structural characteristics and closed vegetation (woodland savannas and gallery forests) with higher species richness and structural characteristics. The size class distribution showed that irrespective of the climatic zone, each vegetation type has a stable structure. Compensation among species in different diameter classes does not allow the effect of the climatic gradient between the two sites on the diameter class size distribution to be observed. This study revealed that climate is the main driver influencing the diversity of woody species rather than the site-specific conditions at the two sites. In addition to climate, site ecological conditions affect the structural parameters. The results provide a rational basis for planning and management decisions to ensure the sustainable use of resources in the two protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic zones 3aconservation areas 3adiscriminant analysis 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest management 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3asavannas 3ashrubs 3aspecies richness 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3avegetation structure 3awoodlands 3awoody plants 3aBurkina Faso1 aBayen, Philippe1 aOuedraogo, Issaka,1 aDimobe, Kangbéni1 aThiombiano, Adjima0 tFolia geobotanica.g2019 Dec., v. 54, no. 3-4 p.163-175dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000071x1211-95207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-019-09340-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01002naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002100158245011400179300001200293520017400305592002800479650001000507650001100517650001600528773010300544856009200647852000900739655001200748IND60119466520221116181154.0141214e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011946652DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2002-3-3-interactions20012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurley, Andrew J10aErratum to: The trappist's approach to pathfinding: elucidating brain wiring using secretory-trap mutagenesis  ap. 307.  aAn erratum to The trappist's approach to pathfinding: elucidating brain wiring using secretory-trap mutagenesis by AJ Furley.

The model was integrated over the period of 1982 to 2001 using the NCEP Reanalysis data NNRP2 as boundary conditions. RegCM3 coupled with various cumulus parameterizations is evaluated firstly as for its ability to represent regional climatology and climate extreme indices, and the results show that simulated regional climate in China is sensitive to the option of cumulus parameterizations. All the cumulus schemes produce a northward expansion of heavy rain area and an underestimation of surface air temperature. For precipitation, the AK scheme simulates relatively better magnitude, while the EM scheme has more reliable performance on the spatial distribution. RegCM3 can represent the spatial distributions of extreme indices for both precipitation and temperature, as well as their decadal trends irrelevant to the cumulus parameterizations. However, the model underestimates the consecutive dry days and overestimates the three extreme wet indices, with the EM scheme giving the worst result. Slight underestimations of extreme temperature indices are detected in all cumulus parameterization scheme runs. The shapes of probability distribution functions for extreme indices are correctly produced, though the probabilities of extreme dry and warm events are underestimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aclimatology 3aprobability distribution 3arain 3aChina1 aTang, Jianping1 aWang, Shuyu1 aWu, Jian0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2015 Oct., v. 122, no. 1-2 p.315-335dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-014-1300-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010400163300001800267520093100285592002801216650004401244650001401288650002701302650001401329650001901343650001801362650001001380650001501390650001901405650001901424650004401443650001501487650001301502650002001515650001701535650001601552700001901568700002701587700001801614773010801632856007501740852000901815655001201824IND60532789320221120122741.0160728e20130909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053278932DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400864z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFumagalli, Matthieu10aVersatile Gas-Phase Reactions for Surface to Bulk Esterification of Cellulose Microfibrils Aerogels  ap. 3246-3255.  aAqueous suspensions of microfibrillated cellulose obtained by a high pressure homogenization process were freeze-dried after solvent exchange into tert-butanol. The resulting aerogels, which displayed a remarkable open morphology with a surface area reaching 100 m²/g, were subjected to a gas-phase esterification with palmitoyl chloride. Under these conditions, variations of the reaction temperature from 100 to 200 °C, of the reaction time from 0.5 to 2 h, and of the initial quantity of reagent, led to the preparation of a library of cellulose palmitates with DS varying from zero to 2.36. These products were characterized by gravimetry, FTIR, and ¹³C solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Of special interest were the cellulose palmitate samples of low DS in the range of 0.1–0.4, which corresponded to hydrophobic cellulose microfibrils exclusively esterified at their surface while keeping intact their inner structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3achlorides 3aesterification 3afreeze drying 3agases 3agravimetry 3ahomogenization 3ahydrophobicity 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apalmitates 3asolvents 3astable isotopes 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aOuhab, Djamila1 aBoisseau, Sonia Molina1 aHeux, Laurent0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 Sept. 09, v. 14, no. 9 p.3246-3255dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm400864z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012000167300002000287520114700307592002801454650001201482650002401494650001501518650001801533650002301551650002401574650001801598650001401616650001001630650001701640650001101657650001401668650001101682650001801693650001701711650001901728650000901747650001101756650002101767700002001788700002401808700002401832700001801856700001801874700002001892700002201912700005801934773014201992856007902134852000902213655001202222IND60620169520181220000000.0181106e20181017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062016952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b029702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijayaraj, Vinita10aTransfer and Ecotoxicity of Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles in Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems: A Microcosm Study  ap. 12757-12764.  aWith the advancement in nanotechnology, particularly the use of TiO₂ nanoparticles (NPs), there is a need to study their release into the environment and assess the related risk in an environmentally relevant contamination scenario. In the present study, the transfer and toxicity of TiO₂ NPs in microcosms mimicking terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems were evaluated. The contaminated soil was prepared by spiking natural soils, with these then used as the basis for all exposure systems including preparation of soil leachates for amphibian exposure. Results demonstrated significant reductions in bacterial (−45%) and archaeal (−36%) nitrifier abundance; significant translocation of Ti to M. truncatula leaves (+422%); significant reductions in plant height (−17%), number of leaves (−29%), and aboveground biomass (−53%); nonsignificant Ti uptake in snail foot and viscera, and excretion in feces; and genotoxicity to X. laevis larvae (+119% micronuclei).

Poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA, a known IRI active polymer was compared to a panel of mono and polysaccharides, with the aim of elucidating why some polyols are active and others show no activity. When corrected for total hydroxyl concentration all the carbohydrate-based polyols displayed near identical activity with no significant influence of molecular weight. Conversely, PVA was several orders of magnitude more active and its activity displays significant dependence on molecular-weight implying that its mechanism of action is not identical to that of carbohydrates. In a second step, the role of hydrophobicity was studied and it is observed that monosaccharide IRI activity is enhanced by alkylation. Dye-quenching assays demonstrated that PVA is able to present a hydrophobic surface without self-aggregation. Therefore, the ability to present a hydrophobic domain is hypothesised to be essential to obtain high IRI activity, which has many biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3acrystallization 3aglycoproteins 3ahydrophobicity 3aice 3amechanism of action 3amolecular weight 3apolyols 3apolysaccharides 3apolyvinyl alcohol1 aCongdon, Thomas1 aSahid, Mohammed A.1 aMorgan, Michael1 aVatish, Manu1 aMitchell, Daniel A.1 aNotman, Rebecca1 aGibson, Matthew I.0 tBiomaterials science.g2013 Apr. 2, v. 1, no. 5 p.478-485dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm00194f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03966naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245011000177300001600287500002000303500001500323520215500338592002802493650002102521650002502542650001502567650002202582650001502604650002602619650001902645650002302664650002002687650002202707650002302729650002202752650001502774650001602789650001202805650002202817650001702839650001402856650002302870650002202893650002402915651001302939651001302952653001202965653002602977653002203003700001803025700001903043700002203062700002003084700002303104773013003127852000903257856007403266655001203340IND4418170020221122221413.0180321e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441817002DNAL7 a193232002pmid7 a10.1890/08-0144.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, Takehiro10aManagement applicability of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis across Mongolian rangeland ecosystems  ap. 423-432.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aThe current growing body of evidence for diversity–disturbance relationships suggests that the peaked pattern predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) may not be the rule. Even if ecologists could quantify the diversity–disturbance relationship consistent with the IDH, the applicability of the IDH to land management has rarely been addressed. We examined two hypotheses related to the generality and management applicability of the IDH to Mongolian rangeland ecosystems: that the diversity–disturbance relationship varies as a function of landscape condition and that some intermediate scales of grazing can play an important role in terms of sustainable rangeland management through a grazing gradient approach. We quantified the landscape condition of each ecological site using an ordination technique and determined two types of landscape conditions: relatively benign and harsh environmental conditions. At the ecological sites characterized by relatively benign environmental conditions, diversity–disturbance relationships were generally consistent with the IDH, and maximum diversity was observed at some intermediate distance from the source of the grazing gradient. In contrast, the IDH was not supported at most (but not all) sites characterized by relatively harsh environmental conditions. The intermediate levels of grazing were generally located below the ecological threshold representing the points or zones at which disturbance should be limited to prevent drastic changes in ecological conditions, suggesting that there is little “conundrum” with regard to intermediate disturbance in the studied systems in terms of land management. We suggest that the landscape condition is one of the primary factors that cause inconsistencies in diversity–disturbance relationships. The ecological threshold can extend its utility in rangeland management because it also has the compatibility with the maintenance of species diversity. This study thus suggests that some intermediate scales of grazing and ecological thresholds are mutually supportive tools for sustainable management of Mongolian rangelands.  aPublisher supplied data 3arange management 3afunctional diversity 3arangelands 3aplant communities 3alandscapes 3abotanical composition 3asemiarid zones 3aecological balance 3aedaphic factors 3agrazing intensity 3agrazing management 3aspatial variation 3aecosystems 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aBiodiversity 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Development 2aPopulation Dynamics 3aMongolia 0aMongolia 0agrazing 0aenvironmental factors 0aspecies diversity1 aOkubo, Satoru1 aOkayasu, Tomoo1 aJamsran, Undarmaa1 aOhkuro, Toshiya1 aTakeuchi, Kazuhiko0 tEcological applications.g2009 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.423-432dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0144.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02221naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245008600204300001600290520108500306592002801391596002301419650002001442650000801462650002401470650001901494650002001513650001601533650001401549650001901563651002101582700002201603700002401625773011901649856008201768852000901850655001201859IND60688714120221121053735.0200416e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068871412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12224-019-09348-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoç, Murat,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0829-457112aA new species and five new combinations of Sabulina (Caryophyllaceae) from Turkey  ap. 279-289.  aThe genus Sabulina is represented by 26 taxa in Turkey. Some interesting specimens belonging to the genus, the main distribution area of which is the Mediterranean phytogeographical region, were collected in Erzurum province. These newly collected specimens and Sabulina rimarum var. rimarum were compared with each other in terms of their general morphology and seed micromorphology. Besides, by using DNA sequences of ITS genes, phylogenetic relationships between these collected species and the other species were investigated. As a result of the evaluation of molecular and morphological data together, it was decided that the specimens collected from Erzurum belong to a new species for the science world. This species was named Sabulina tortumensis, and its description, pictures, distribution, habitat preferences, degree of endangerment and phylogenetic relationships with closely related species are presented. Additionally, we propose new combinations for five taxa of Sabulina that did not have Sabulina names and provide a key to annual species of the genus in Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data  a113Z260cTÜBİTAK 3aCaryophyllaceae 3aDNA 3ahabitat preferences 3amicrostructure 3anew combination 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aphytogeography 3aTurkey (country)1 aHamzaoğlu, Ergin1 aAksoy, A.q(Ahmet),0 tFolia geobotanica.g2019 Dec., v. 54, no. 3-4 p.279-289dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000071x1211-95207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-019-09348-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010600167300001600273520126100289592002801550650002101578650001701599650001601616650001301632650001901645650002201664650002701686650001201713650001501725650001301740650001201753650001501765650001901780650001601799650001601815650001601831650001401847651001001861700001701871700001701888700001901905700001501924700001701939773011901956856008202075852000902157655001202166IND60688714220221121053742.0200416e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068871422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12224-019-09359-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingxue10aVariation in ploidy level and genome size of Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. along a latitudinal gradient  ap. 267-278.  aKnowledge of ploidy level and genome size in a germplasm collection is critical before studying genetic diversification of different environmental range in grasses and other plants. We assessed the geographic patterns in ploidy level and genome size of 216 individuals of Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (common bermudagrass) by flow cytometry of accessions sampled from 16 geographic sites along a latitudinal gradient from 22°35′ N to 36°18′ N across China. Flow cytometry histograms combined with mitotic chromosome observations results show that tetraploids were the most frequent ploidy level, constituting 44.91% of all individuals. Nuclear DNA contents were 2.384, 2.419, 2.437, 2.873 and 3.288 pg/2C for the diploid, triploid, tetraploid, pentaploid and hexaploid, respectively. Higher proportions of polyploid individuals were observed within populations at the highest and lowest latitudes. In addition, monoploid genome size of C. dactylon progressively increased with increasing ploidy level. Temperature and precipitation had the influence on ploidy level for all the sites. The relationship between ploidy level and geographic distribution for C. dactylon will facilitate the utilization of this species for biological and genetic research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3abiogeography 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm conservation 3agrasses 3ahexaploidy 3alatitude 3amitosis 3amonoploidy 3anuclear genome 3apentaploidy 3atemperature 3atetraploidy 3atriploidy 3aChina1 aWang, Miaoli1 aGuo, Zhipeng1 aGuan, Yongzhuo1 aGuo, Yuxia1 aYan, Xuebing0 tFolia geobotanica.g2019 Dec., v. 54, no. 3-4 p.267-278dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000071x1211-95207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-019-09359-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245012000161300001800281500001400299520119700313592002801510650002601538650002501564650002001589650002701609650001201636650001901648650001901667650001201686650001101698650002201709650001901731650001801750650001601768650003001784650001201814650002601826650001001852650001401862650002001876650001801896650000901914653002301923653002501946653002301971653002201994653002002016700003202036700003002068773015102098856007602249852000902325655001202334IND60710093820221119032751.0200908e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071009382DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-33062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Randhir10aHepatic lipidosis in transition buffaloes in relation to back fat thickness, hemato-biochemical and mineral profile  ap. 1031-1036.  aNAL-light  aThe study invoved 140 buffaloes, 125 (87.41%) with ultrasonography (USG) features of normal liver and 18 (12.58%) with features of hepatic lipidosis (HL).

Cellular Ca ²⁺ levels and their alterations can be monitored by genetically encoded reporter systems such as the bioluminescent protein, aequorin. Employment of proteinaceous Ca ²⁺ sensors is usually performed in transgenic lines that constitutively express the reporter construct. Such settings limit the usage of these Ca ²⁺ biosensors to particular reporter variants and plant genetic backgrounds, which can be a severe constraint in genetic pathway analysis. Here we systematically explored the potential of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf mesophyll protoplasts, either derived from a transgenic apoaequorin-expressing line or transfected with apoaequorin reporter constructs, as a complementary biological resource to monitor cytoplasmic changes of Ca ²⁺ levels in response to various biotic stress elicitors. We tested a range of endogenous and pathogen-derived elicitors in seedlings and protoplasts of the corresponding apoaequorin-expressing reporter line. We found that the protoplast system largely reflects the Ca ²⁺ signatures seen in intact transgenic seedlings. Results of inhibitor experiments including the calculation of IC ₅₀ values indicated that the protoplast system is also suitable for pharmacological studies. Moreover, analyses of Ca ²⁺signatures in mutant backgrounds, genetic complementation of the mutant phenotypes and expression of sensor variants targeted to different subcellular localizations can be readily performed. Thus, in addition to the prevalent use of seedlings, the leaf mesophyll protoplast setup represents a versatile and convenient tool for the analysis of Ca ²⁺ signaling pathways in plant cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aaequorin 3abiosensors 3abiotic stress 3acalcium 3aelicitors 3agenetic background 3agenetic complementation 3agenetically modified organisms 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aprotoplasts 3aseedlings 3asignal transduction 0aAequorin 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aCalcium signature • Elicitor 0aflg22 0aLanthanum chloride 0aStaurosporine 0aMesophyll protoplasts 0aTransfection1 aCavdar, Meltem1 aTamborski, Janina1 aKwaaitaal, Mark1 aHuisman, Rik1 aMeesters, Christian1 aKombrink, Erich1 aPanstruga, Ralph0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Oct., v. 55, no. 10 p.1813-1825dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245018900170500001400359520180400373592002802177650001602205650002002221650002402241650002502265650001702290650001102307650001402318650001302332650001002345650001302355650001602368650002702384650002602411650002102437650002202458650001302480650000702493650001402500650001502514650001402529650001502543650001402558653002402572653002302596653002302619700001702642700002102659700001502680700001502695700001702710773009102727856009002818852000902908655001202917IND60709357620221116142508.0201111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070935762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1282132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yimin10aAnalysis of the characteristics of phosphine production by anaerobic digestion based on microbial community dynamics, metabolic pathways, and isolation of the phosphate-reducing strain  aNAL-light  aAlthough phosphine is ubiquitously present in anaerobic environments, little is known regarding the microbial community dynamics and metabolic pathways associated with phosphine formation in an anaerobic digestion system. This study investigated the production of phosphine in anaerobic digestion, with results indicating that phosphine production mainly occurred during logarithmic microbial growth. Dehydrogenase and hydrogen promoted the production of phosphine, with a maximum phosphine concentration of 300 mg/m³. The abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Escherichia was observed to promote phosphine generation. The analysis of metabolic pathways based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and the MetaCyc pathway database revealed the highest relative abundance of replication and repair in genetic information processing; further, the cofactor, prosthetic group, electron carrier, and vitamin biosynthesis were observed to be closely related to phosphine formation. A phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on the neighbor-joining method. The results indicated the clear evolutionary position of the isolated Pseudescherichia sp. SFM4 strain, adjacent to Escherichia, with a stable phosphate-reducing ability for a maximum phosphine concentration of 26 mg/m³. The response surface experiment indicated that the initial optimal conditions for phosphine production by SFM4 could be achieved with nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus loads of 6.17, 300, and 10 mg/L, respectively, at pH 7.47. These results provide comprehensive insights into the dynamic changes in the microbial structure, isolated single bacterial strain, and metabolic pathways associated with phosphine formation. They also provide information on the molecular biology associated with phosphorus recycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia 3aRuminococcaceae 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3adatabases 3adynamics 3agenes 3ahydrogen 3ainformation 3ainformation processing 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial growth 3amolecular biology 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphine 3aphosphorus 3aphylogeny 3aprostheses 3arecycling 0aMicrobial community 0aMetabolic pathways 0aPhosphate-reducing1 aNiu, Xiaojun1 aZhang, Tongqing,1 aLin, Zhang1 aFu, Mingli1 aZhou, Shaoqi0 tChemosphere.g2021 Jan., v. 262 p.128213-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1282133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013600164300001600300520144900316592002801765650002101793650001101814650002501825650002501850650002501875650002501900650002201925650002001947650002501967650001201992650001102004650001902015650002202034650001402056650002602070650002602096650001402122653003602136653002602172653002202198653002502220653002502245700001702270700002102287700002202308773011302330856008502443852000902528655001202537IND60634694620221118060011.0190325e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063469462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFei, Fan10aMechanical biological treatment of municipal solid waste: Energy efficiency, environmental impact and economic feasibility analysis  ap. 731-739.  aMunicipal solid waste (MSW) is treated mainly via landfill and incineration in most countries. As the effectiveness of source-point waste classification always cannot be guaranteed especially in developing countries, the introduction of mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) systems is a possible solution, for MBT can separate the biodegradable fraction and recover recyclables from mixed waste streams. Using life cycle assessment, scenario analysis and other methods, the energy, environmental and economic performance of MBT and other mainstream MSW treatment technologies are analyzed and compared. The results showed that raw MSW landfill was the worst management option. Incineration had higher energy efficiency (20.5% energy recovery), but the large amounts of chemicals consumption for fly ash and exhaust treatment were also issues leading to relatively higher life cycle environmental impacts. MBT had the highest energy efficiency when connected with biogas purification systems (38.5% energy recovery), and could significantly avoid pollution than the other two technologies. Moreover, MBT was well-adapted to changing MSW composition, making it a promising supplementary to MSW source separation. However, MBT had weak economic performance and required an economic support policy. Our findings show that product revenue needs to be increased, and infrastructure sharing between MSW treatment facilities should also be encouraged.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abiogas 3abiological treatment 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomic feasibility 3aeconomic performance 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy recovery 3aenvironmental impact 3afly ash 3aincome 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3alandfills 3alife cycle assessment 3amunicipal solid waste 3apollution 0aMechanical biological treatment 0aLife cycle assessment 0aEnergy efficiency 0aEnvironmental impact 0aEconomic performance1 aWen, Zongguo1 aHuang, Shengbiao1 aDe Clercq, Djavan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 178 p.731-739dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245003100159300001600190520092100206592002801127650003001155650002501185650001101210650002201221651001501243651001401258651001101272651002201283653002101305653002501326653002401351653001401375653002001389773013901409856007801548852000901626655001201635IND60520430620221121060333.0160520e20150711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052043062DNAL7 a10.1515/pesd-2015-00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaia, Ion10aBlack Sea Baric Depression  ap. 189-198.  aThis work is meant to demonstrate that, in the special synoptic conditions, on the surface of the Black Sea, a baric depression is being formed. This depression is formed when the Black Sea's water temperature is higher than the surrounding continental ground's temperature. There are situations when the baric depression of the Black Sea occurs because of the consequences of the movement of another baric depression from the east of the Mediterranean Sea to its north-east side. Due to the high atmospheric pressure of the continental zone that's surrounding the Black Sea, the baric depression will get a retrograde movement, towards the north or northwest. Eventually, this depression occludes in the eastern continental zone of Europe or even near the Baltic Sea. During a retrograde movement of a baric depression, the atmospheric precipitations will fall in big quantities, in many situations, causing floods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aatmospheric pressure 3afloods 3awater temperature 3aBaltic Sea 3aBlack Sea 3aEurope 3aMediterranean Sea 0abaric depression 0aatmospheric pressure 0aretrograde movement 0aocclusion 0aprecipitations.0 tPresent Environment and Sustainable Development.g2015 July 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.189-198dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23164x2284-78207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pesd-2015-00143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245020500164300001800369520143500387592002801822650002901850650001701879650001501896650002201911650001801933650001501951650001701966650001301983650001401996650002102010650001102031650001602042650001302058650002502071650001902096650001202115700001802127700001902145700002602164773018102190856007902371852000902450655001202459IND60137854720221118030030.0150524e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013785472DNAL7 a10.1111/1567-1364.122182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolak, Natalia10aThiamine increases the resistance of baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae against oxidative, osmotic and thermal stress, through mechanisms partly independent of thiamine diphosphate‐bound enzymes  ap. 1249-1262.  aNumerous recent studies have established a hypothesis that thiamine (vitamin B₁) is involved in the responses of different organisms against stress, also suggesting that underlying mechanisms are not limited to the universal role of thiamine diphosphate (TDP) in the central cellular metabolism. The current work aimed at characterising the effect of exogenously added thiamine on the response of baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the oxidative (1 mM H₂O₂), osmotic (1 M sorbitol) and thermal (42 °C) stress. As compared to the yeast culture in thiamine‐free medium, in the presence of 1.4 μM external thiamine, (1) the relative mRNA levels of major TDP‐dependent enzymes under stress conditions vs. unstressed control (the ‘stress/control ratio’) were moderately lower, (2) the stress/control ratio was strongly decreased for the transcript levels of several stress markers localised to the cytoplasm, peroxisomes, the cell wall and (with the strongest effect observed) the mitochondria (e.g. Mn‐superoxide dismutase), (3) the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species under stress conditions was markedly decreased, with the significant alleviation of concomitant protein oxidation. The results obtained suggest the involvement of thiamine in the maintenance of redox balance in yeast cells under oxidative stress conditions, partly independent of the functions of TDP‐dependent enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abakers yeast 3acell walls 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aperoxisomes 3asorbitol 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athermal stress 3athiamin1 aKowalska, Ewa1 aKozik, Andrzej1 aRapala‐Kozik, Maria0 tFEMS yeast research.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 8 p.1249-1262dPublished by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx1567-13567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1567-1364.122183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001500157245011200172300001600284520165600300592002801956650002301984650002102007650002002028650001602048650003002064650001802094650001802112650002502130650001002155650001302165650001202178650001902190700002402209700001602233700002102249773011302270856009202383852000902475655001202484IND60536685120221122202203.0190412e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053668512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2013.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemmat, A.10aRelationships between rut depth and soil mechanical properties in a calcareous soil with unstable structure  ap. 147-155.  aFor proper management of soil-machinery interactions, it is essential to know the mechanical strength (i.e. pre-compaction stress, σpc) of agricultural soils. However, there is little information linked directly to soil sinkage in the field to σpc. This research was conducted to explore the relationships of rut depth (dR) with σpc, penetration resistance (CI) and dynamic drop-cone resistance (DCI) in a calcareous clay loam soil with unstable structure. The σpc, CI, DCI, and dR were determined before and after single or multiple wheelings with two tractors under different soil conditions. Average ground pressure (σg) applied by the tractors was also determined. The σpc was determined using large undisturbed soil samples which were taken from the 0–15 cm layer in the wheel track. The CI, DCI and dR were measured simultaneously along the tyre centreline. When σpc values before each wheeling were compared with dR values after wheeling, it was found that σpc was approximately a threshold value between reversible and irreversible deformations. The results indicated that when the σpc/σg is well above 1 (e.g. 1.6), soil sinkage is essentially negligible. However, for the ratios <1.6, soil sinkage is irreversible and significant. These findings and published documents show that some physico-empirical safety factor greater than 1 is needed as a criterion for field traffic in structurally-unstable soils. Similarly, two-region trends were also observed between dR and CI or DCI. As soil trafficability criteria, soil properties such as CI and DCI, which are easily and quickly measurable, might be used for practical purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3acalcareous soils 3aclay loam soils 3adeformation 3aresistance to penetration 3asafety factor 3asoil sampling 3astrength (mechanics) 3atires 3atractors 3atraffic 3atrafficability1 aYaghoubi-Taskoh, M.1 aMasoumi, A.1 aMosaddeghi, M.R.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Feb., v. 118 p.147-155dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2013.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01212naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245004200161300001600203500002000219520030700239592002800546650001500574650001100589650001200600650002000612650002300632651001000655651001800665773013200683856007400815852000900889655001200898IND60587832520221120121830.0180102e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058783252DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.121552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYonekura, Kōji,10a843.

The HFO was produced and stored for up to 86 wk. Periodically, Me²⁺ sorption was determined across the pH range of 2.5 to 12. In addition, the Me²⁺ ions were contacted with freshly produced HFO and stored at a pH that dictated that 80 to 100% of the Me²⁺ would be in the sorbed state; desorbability of the Me²⁺ was determined as a function of Me²⁺-oxide residence time. The change in the crystallinity of the HFO as a function of time was also monitored. The HFO aged without the Me²⁺ ions displayed no hysteresis between the adsorption-desorption curves and no substantial shifts in fractional Me²⁺ adsorption were observed with pH throughout 21 wk of aging. The HFO aged with the Me²⁺ ions displayed increasing desorption hysteresis with time for Co²⁺ and Cd²⁺, but not Pb²⁺. The magnitude of hysteresis followed the order Co > Cd > Pb, which is the inverse of the ionic radii of the metal sorbates. While oxalate-extractable Fe decreased with time during a 20-wk period, powder x-ray diffraction was unchanged during the same period. The data presented here suggest that Co and Cd are being incorporated into the metal oxide structure via recrystallization, but Pb remains associated with the surface and excluded from incorporation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3airon oxides 3alead 3acations 3acadmium 3ahysteresis 3adesorption 3aadsorption 0amineralogy1 aGassman, Paul L.1 aPilon, James L.1 aVan Der Sluys, William G.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1994 Nov., v. 58, no. 6 p.1615-1623dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1994.03615995005800060005x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02822naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011700164300001800281500001500299520125000314650001501564650004101579650001901620650001701639650001401656650001101670650000901681650001601690650001501706650001101721650004101732650001301773650005001786650001901836650001201855650002401867650001201891650001701903650001901920653001701939700002601956700002001982700001702002700002002019700001602039700001902055773016202074856004702236852000902283655001202292IND60556272720221119144805.0161101e20161019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055627272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b026042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Eun-Joo10aEffect of Oral Administration of 3,3′-Diindolylmethane on Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Acute Colitis in Mice  ap. 7702-7709.  a2019-12-06  aIn patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), inflammation is induced and maintained by lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis. 3,3′-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a natural product formed in acidic conditions from indole-3-carbinol in cruciferous vegetables, and it is known for its chemotherapeutic activity. This study evaluated DIM’s effects on angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and inflammation in a mouse colitis model. Experimental colitis was induced in mice by administering 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) via drinking water. DIM remarkably attenuated the clinical signs and histological characteristics in mice with DSS-induced colitis. DIM suppressed neutrophil infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, it significantly suppressed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2, indicating that the mechanism may be related to the repression of pro-angiogenesis activity. DIM also remarkably suppressed the expression of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGFR-3, and angiopoietin-2; thus, the mechanism may also be related to the suppression of lymphangiogenesis. Therefore, DIM is a possible treatment option for inflammation of the intestine and associated angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. 3avegetables 3avascular endothelial growth factor D 3asodium sulfate 3ainflammation 3acytokines 3amodels 3amice 3aneutrophils 3aintestines 3asodium 3avascular endothelial growth factor C 3apatients 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 3adrinking water 3acolitis 3aoral administration 3adextran 3aangiogenesis 3aangiopoietin-2 0adrug therapy1 aDavaatseren, Munktugs1 aHwang, Jin-Taek1 aPark, Jae Ho1 aHur, Haeng Jeon1 aLee, Ae Sin1 aSugn, Mi Jeong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Oct. 19, v. 64, no. 41 p.7702-7709dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b02604  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245007400165300001600239520181700255592002802072650002202100650001402122650001502136650002802151650001302179650001002192650001502202650001502217650001202232650001402244650004102258650000902299650001202308650000902320650001602329650003302345650001302378650001602391650001602407650001202423653002402435653001802459653001302477653004202490700001502532700002302547773013902570856007802709852000902787655001202796IND60520430820221120141846.0160520e20150711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052043082DNAL7 a10.1515/pesd-2015-00162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPruteanu, Silvea10aModern Procedures Used in Cleaning Old, Illegibly and Blackened Icons  ap. 219-236.  aIn order to restore the original aesthetic aspect, to improve the state of the age patina and of the gold halo, similar processes are required. The cleaning process is one of the most important aspects for an artwork and is considering a series of deteriorations and degradations, like dirt deposits (clogged or unclogged) opalescent varnish, colors blackening, burns, blisters, gaps (missing ground, painting layer or varnish). This step in the restoration process includes physical and mechanical proceedings like dusting (with a vacuum), brushing (with a brush), scraping (with a scalpel), removal or polishing etc. The scalpel and the milling process are rough unconventional means that are used only in exceptional cases. The wet cleaning of dirt includes classic washing processes, with water or other complex systems of organic solvents (emollients, surface additives or surfactants, mixtures of solvents). Cleaning the clogged dirt deposits with unconventional methods can be done by means of electronic laser, ion and thermal exchange or ultrasounds. Laser cleaning is often used in removing unwanted dirt deposits from different layers of the art piece. A lot of attention goes towards the controlled elimination of the exterior protection layer (varnish), which can be photo- degraded and oxidized by atmospheric exposure. Visual analysis, with enlargers (OM, SEM, AFM etc.) combined with transmission or penetration techniques (radiography, endoscopy, X-ray diffraction etc.) provides information on the superficial structures of the art work. In order to determine the modifications of the desiccant oils, SEM was used to observed the changes in the morphology of the oil painting layers. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) can be used to detrmine detergent residues on the painting layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadditives 3aaesthetics 3aatomic force microscopy 3acleaning 3acolor 3adesiccants 3adetergents 3adusting 3aendoscopy 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agold 3amilling 3aoils 3aradiography 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3aultrasonics 3awashing 0acleaning procedures 0awashing tests 0asolvents 0adeterioration and degradation effects1 aSandu, Ion1 aVasilache, Viorica0 tPresent Environment and Sustainable Development.g2015 July 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.219-236dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23164x2284-78207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pesd-2015-00163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245010300166520122200269592002801491650003501519650001801554650001901572650002401591650001901615650001501634650002401649650002301673650001501696650001701711650001601728650001101744651001101755700002901766700002401795700002701819700002701846700002101873700002501894773011901919856007302038852000902111655001202120IND60653367820221119070005.0190714e20180626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065336782DNAL7 a10.3390/w100708492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGad, Fragkiska-Karmela10aLong-Term Shoreline Displacements and Coastal Morphodynamic Pattern of North Rhodes Island, Greece  aShoreline evolution and seabed morphology changes depend on coastal geomorphology as well as hydrodynamics of the nearshore region. &Tau;his study investigates the morphological evolution of the northernmost headland of Rhodes Island, Greece, using a method that combines historical shoreline evolution analysis and numerical modelling of coastal processes. The satellite and aerial imagery analysis under a GIS platform reveals that, since 1982, the overall surface area of the backshore has slightly increased, though in shorter period times, large variations have been identified. The part of the beach that is most prone to extreme changes is the spit-like formation at the tip of the headland. Wind-generated waves and induced currents are the main forcing factors that affect the shape and orientation of the spit-like beach. This spit-like morphology changes seasonally due to variations in the dominant wave regime. West sector waves cause sediment deposition at the eastern sector of the spit-like formation, whereas strong southeast wave events during the winter favor accretion at the west sector, inducing an asymmetrical shape. Thus, the analysis results indicate an annual balance in sediment transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3amathematical models 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asediment deposition 3asediment transport 3ashorelines 3asurface area 3awater waves 3awinter 3aGreece1 aHatiris, Giorgos-Angelos1 aLoukaidi, Vassiliki1 aDimitriadou, Stavroula1 aDrakopoulou, Paraskevi1 aSioulas, Andreas1 aKapsimalis, Vasilios0 tWater.g2018 June 26, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100708493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245013000161300001600291500002000307520135700327592002801684650002301712650001501735650001901750650001101769650003001780650001001810650001101820650002401831650001401855650002601869650001001895650001101905650004201916650001001958650002001968650003001988650002102018650002302039650001402062650001102076651001902087700002002106700001602126773010902142856007302251852000902324655001202333IND60572021120221117095314.0170712e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057202112DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.009542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, William B.10aCharacterization of the gut microbiota of migratory passerines during stopover along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico  ap. 659-668.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough the gut microbiota is known to provide many beneficial functions to animal hosts, such as aiding in digestion, fat metabolism, and immune function, relatively little is known about the gut microbiota of passerines. Gut microbes may have both beneficial and detrimental impacts on the fitness of migratory passerines; however physiological and morphological changes associated with prolonged migratory flight may cause disruptions of the stable microbiota and potentially a loss of function. Fecal samples were collected from Swainson's thrushes Catharus ustulatus and gray catbirds Dumetella carolinensis immediately after crossing the Gulf of Mexico during spring migration and before crossing during fall, and microbiota communities were analyzed using next‐generation sequencing. Microbiota communities were generally dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, with potential pathogens as well as potentially beneficial bacteria identified in all birds. Energetic condition of migrants was not significantly related to overall microbiota community structure though it cannot be conclusively stated that migratory flight does not impact the microbiota. Spring and fall migrants showed clear differences in microbiota communities, indicating that environmental factors influence the gut microbiota of these species more than host genetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharus ustulatus 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aautumn 3abeneficial microorganisms 3abirds 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3adigestion 3aenvironmental factors 3afeces 3aflight 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3amigratory behavior 3apathogens 3aspring 3aGulf of Mexico1 aMoore, Frank R.1 aWang, Shiao0 tJournal of avian biology.g2016 Sept., v. 47, no. 5 p.659-668dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.009543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03643naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245014400184520189800328592002802226650001502254650001402269650004402283650000902327650002902336650002302365650001502388650001202403650001002415650002302425650004302448650002102491650003702512650002102549650001302570650001702583650003002600651001002630653002502640653002902665653002102694653001702715653002002732653003702752700006702789700002902856700003002885773010402915856008503019852000903104655001203113IND60734778020221118210933.0220929e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073477802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1111472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhakshinamoorthy, Madhankumar10aEndophytic fungus Diaporthe caatingaensis MT192326 from Buchanania axillaris: An indicator to produce biocontrol agents in plant protection  aThe study aims at the Isolation, screening and antibacterial evaluation of Camptothecin (CPT) and its derivatives, an anticancer molecule from endophytic fungus Diaporthe caatingaensis MT192326 of the medicinal plant, Buchanania axillaris. Plant parts were collected from Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve forest, Tamil Nadu. The fungus was isolated using DEKM07 medium was used as the screening medium for the presence of CPT. The strain with the highest yield of CPT was identified at the molecular level by 18S rDNA sequencing. CPT was isolated and analyzed by UV–Vis spectrophotometry, Thin layer chromatography, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, and Electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry. The compounds identified by ESI-MS from the fungal extract were studied for their antibacterial assays against procured MTCC bacterial pathogens. The maximum yield of 0.681 mg/L of CPT was produced by the fungus D.caatingaensis. CPT derivatives were identified at m/z of 305, 348 and 389 through ESI-MS analysis. Antibacterial studies revealed that the endophytic fungal extract compounds were studied for antibacterial activities of disc diffusion assay, exhibiting a growth inhibition range of 15–22 mm in nutrient agar plate medium. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration revealed the antibacterial potential at a lower concentration of 12.5–25 μg/ml with all bacteria studied. The relatively lower antimicrobial efficacy of partially purified bio-metabolites than the positive control streptomycin (3.125) concentration could be due to the presence of derivatives of the compounds that hinder the activity of the biometabolite. This is the first initiative to screen, isolate and analyze the antibacterial assays of CPT and derivatives from endophytic fungus D.caatingaensis of ethnopharmacologically important B.axillaris plant from STRF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBuchanania 3aDiaporthe 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3abiological control 3aendophytes 3aforests 3afungi 3agrowth retardation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aplant protection 3aresearch 3astreptomycin 3athin layer chromatography 3aIndia 0aBuchanania axillaris 0aDiaporthe caatinagaensis 0aEndophytic fungi 0aCamptothecin 0aAnticancer drug 0aMinimum inhibitory concentration1 aKilavan Packiam, Kannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6203-81491 aKumar, Ponnusamy Senthil1 aSaravanakumar, Tamilselvi0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 June, v. 197 p.111147-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1111473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011300172300001600285520092800301592002801229650001401257650003301271650002601304650001601330650001401346650002501360651001701385651001301402651001201415653001701427653000801444653001601452653001401468653002501482700002101507700002001528700002501548700002101573700003601594700003201630700001901662773012701681856008601808852000901894655001201903IND60573709520221118045825.0180607e20170903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057370952DNAL7 a10.1080/14772000.2016.12710592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSim-Sim, Manuela10aIntegrative taxonomy reveals too extensive lumping and a new species in the moss genus Amphidium (Bryophyta)  ap. 451-463.  aAn integrative taxonomic approach, including molecular phylogenetic reconstructions based on plastid rps4-trnF and nuclear ITS sequences, statistical analysis of morphological-anatomical characters, and classical taxonomy, indicates that the reduction of 13 Amphidium species to three in a recent morphological revision represents a case of too extensive lumping. Instead, six Amphidium species can be distinguished based on molecular and morphological data, the widespread Amphidium lapponicum, A. mougeotii, and A. tortuosum, as well as the Macaronesian endemic A. curvipes, the North American endemic A. californicum, and a newly discovered species from Central Asia (southern Siberia and northern Mongolia), A. asiaticum sp. nov. Diagnostic morphological characters for all six species are discussed. The present data confirm that species diversity of Amphidium is highest in the Holarctic, where all six species occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amosses and liverworts 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 3aCentral Asia 3aMongolia 3aSiberia 0aCentral Asia 0aITS 0aMacaronesia 0arps4-trnF 0aspecies delimitation1 aAfonina, Olga M.1 aAlmeida, Tereza1 aDésamoré, Aurélie1 aLaenen, Benjamin1 aGarcía Ubaque, César Augusto,1 aGonzález-Mancebo, Juana M.1 aStech, Michael0 tSystematics and biodiversity.g2017 Sept. 3, v. 15, no. 5 p.451-463dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000156x1478-09337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2016.12710593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245014600171300001800317520102200335650001601357650002201373650001201395650001701407650001001424650001301434650001001447650002001457650001001477650001901487650001201506650001001518650001601528650001901544650002701563650002401590650001201614650001301626650003701639700003701676700002201713700002101735700002601756700003401782773016201816856004701978852000902025655001202034IND60556272920221119143652.0161101e20161019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055627292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b032172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHornedo-Ortega, Ruth10aProtocatechuic Acid: Inhibition of Fibril Formation, Destabilization of Preformed Fibrils of Amyloid-β and α-Synuclein, and Neuroprotection  ap. 7722-7732.  aProtocatechuic acid (PCA) is the major metabolite of the anthocyanin known as cyanidin 3-glucoside. It is found in plasma and tissues, such as the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys, following consumption of a rich source of this flavonoid. The abnormal pathological assembly of amyloid-β (Aβ) and α-synuclein (αS) is an underlying mechanism involved in the formation of amyloid plaques and Lewy bodies in the brain, which are responsible for neuropathology symptoms in Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s diseases (PD), respectively. This research was performed to evaluate the protective effects of PCA, by establishing its potential role in inhibiting aggregation and fibril destabilization of Aβ and αS proteins. It has been found that PCA inhibits the aggregation of Aβ and αS and destabilizes their preformed fibrils. These results were confirmed by TEM images, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting experiments. Furthermore, PCA prevents the death of PC12 cells triggered by Aβ- and αS-induced toxicity. 3aLewy bodies 3aParkinson disease 3aamyloid 3aanthocyanins 3abrain 3acyanidin 3adeath 3aelectrophoresis 3aheart 3aimmunoblotting 3akidneys 3aliver 3ametabolites 3aneuropathology 3aneuroprotective effect 3aprotocatechuic acid 3atissues 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAlvarez-Fernandez, Maria Antonia1 aCerezo, Ana Belen1 aRichard, Tristan1 aTroncoso, Ana María,1 aGarcia-Parrilla, Maria Carmen0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Oct. 19, v. 64, no. 41 p.7722-7732dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b03217  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245013100166520169300297592002801990650002202018650001402040650002302054650002202077650001702099650002002116650001802136650001602154650003102170650001402201700002002215700002502235700002602260700002202286700002302308700001802331773012002349856007502469852000902544655001202553IND60751450320221122140821.0210925e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075145032DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110925512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetraccioli, Agnese 10aChromosome Diversity and Evolution in Helicoide a (Gastropoda: Stylommatophora): A Synthesis from Original and Literature Data  aWe performed a molecular and a comparative cytogenetic analysis on different Helicoidea species and a review of all the available chromosome data on the superfamily to provide an updated assessment of its karyological diversity. Standard karyotyping, banding techniques, and Fluorescence in situ hybridization of Nucleolus Organizer Region loci (NOR-FISH) were performed on fifteen species of three families: two Geomitridae, four Hygromiidae and nine Helicidae. The karyotypes of the studied species varied from 2n = 44 to 2n = 60, highlighting a high karyological diversity. NORs were on a single chromosome pair in Cernuella virgata and on multiple pairs in four Helicidae, representing ancestral and derived conditions, respectively. Heterochromatic C-bands were found on pericentromeric regions of few chromosomes, being Q- and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) negative. NOR-associated heterochromatin was C-banding and chromomycin A₃ (CMA₃) positive. Considering the available karyological evidence on Helicoidea and superimposing the chromosome data gathered from different sources on available phylogenetic inferences, we describe a karyotype of 2n = 60 with all biarmed elements as the ancestral state in the superfamily. From this condition, an accumulation of chromosome translocations led to karyotypes with a lower chromosome number (2n = 50–44). This process occurred independently in different lineages, while an augment of the chromosome number was detectable in Polygyridae. Chromosome inversions were also relevant chromosome rearrangements in Helicoidea, leading to the formation of telocentric elements in karyotypes with a relatively low chromosome count.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCernuella virgata 3aHelicidae 3achromosome banding 3achromosome number 3afluorescence 3aheterochromatin 3ahybridization 3akaryotyping 3anucleolus organizer region 3aphylogeny1 aCrovato, Paolo 1 aGuarino, Fabio Maria1 aMezzasalma, Marcello 1 aOdierna, Gaetano 1 aPicariello, Orfeo 1 aMaio, Nicola 0 tAnimals.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110925513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245014400160300001800304520083500322592002801157650001101185650001101196650002101207650002301228650002101251650002501272650001401297650001601311650002201327650001201349650001601361650002201377650001101399700001701410700001701427700001501444700005101459773013301510856007901643852000901722655001201731IND60604725220221118055050.0180717e20180511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060472522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b006172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bin10aReduction and Reductive Deuteration of Tertiary Amides Mediated by Sodium Dispersions with Distinct Proton Donor-Dependent Chemoselectivity  ap. 6006-6014.  aA practical and scalable single electron transfer reduction mediated by sodium dispersions has been developed for the reduction and reductive deuteration of tertiary amides. The chemoselectivity of this method highly depends on the nature of the proton donor. The challenging reduction via C–N bond cleavage has been achieved using Na/EtOH, affording alcohol products, while the use of Na/NaOH/H₂O leads to the formation of amines via selective C–O scission. Sodium dispersions with high specific surface areas are crucial to obtain high yields and good chemoselectivity. This new method tolerates a range of tertiary amides. Moreover, the corresponding reductive deuterations mediated by Na/EtOD-d₁ and Na/NaOH/D₂O afford useful α,α-dideuterio alcohols and α,α-dideuterio amines with an excellent deuterium content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3aamines 3achemical bonding 3achemical structure 3achemoselectivity 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adeuterium 3adispersions 3aelectron transfer 3aethanol 3amethodology 3aorganic chemistry 3asodium1 aLi, Hengzhao1 aDing, Yuxuan1 aYan, Yuhao1 aAn, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1521-009X0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2018 May 11, v. 83, no. 11 p.6006-6014dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b006173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245014500171520164900316592002801965650001801993650001502011650001202026650002102038650000902059650002102068650001702089650001002106650003002116650001502146650001602161650001702177650001702194650001202211650001702223650001802240650001602258653003202274653002102306653001902327700001802346700005402364700001402418700001602432700001702448700001702465773009102482856009002573852000902663655001202672IND60752438920221120143013.0220307e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075243892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1324142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Henghai10aLong-term chronic exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate induces obesity via disruption of host lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in mice  aNumerous epidemiological findings have shown that di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), one of industrial plasticizers with endocrine-disrupting properties, positively contributes to high incidence of obesity. However, potential pathogenesis of dietary DEHP exposure-induced obesity remains largely unknown. Chronic DEHP exposure at different doses (0.05 and 5 mg/kg body weight) to mice had been continuously lasted for 14 weeks through the diet. A combination of targeted quantitative metabolomics (LC/GC-MS) with global ¹H NMR-based metabolic profiling to explore the effects of dietary DEHP exposure with different doses on host lipid metabolism of mice. Metagenomics (16S rRNA gene sequencing) was also employed to examine the alterations of gut microbiota composition in the cecal contents of mice after dietary DEHP exposure. Dietary exposure to DEHP at both doses induced weight gain and hepatic lipogenesis of mice by promoting the uptake of fatty acids and disrupting phospholipids and choline metabolism. Dietary DEHP exposure altered the gut microbiota community with disruption of intestinal morphology and reduction of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in the cecal contents of mice. Furthermore, DEHP exposure activated gut microbiota fermentation process producing excess short chain fatty acids of mice. These findings provide systematic evidence that long-term chronic DEHP exposure induces obesity through disruption of host lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in mice, which not only confirm the epidemiological results, but also expand our understanding of metabolic diseases caused by environmental pollutants exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3acholine 3achronic exposure 3adiet 3adietary exposure 3afermentation 3agenes 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alipogenesis 3ametabolomics 3ametagenomics 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3aphospholipids 3aweight gain 0aDi-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate 0aLipid metabolism 0aGut microbiota1 aYuan, Peihong1 aLei, Hehua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5088-376X1 aZhang, Li1 aDeng, Dazhi1 aZhang, Limin1 aChen, Xiaoyu0 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 287 p.132414-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1324143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245011600208300001400324520112000338592002801458650000801486650001101494650001301505650001601518650002101534650001401555650002001569650002301589650002701612650002001639650002201659650001001681650001301691653002501704653001501729653002101744653001401765700001701779700001601796700001801812700002301830700002101853773009401874856008701968852000902055655001202064IND60755057420221120144128.0220502e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075505742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2021.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcay, Selim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2472-815710aPositive effect of autologous platelet rich plasma on Saanen buck semen cryopreservation in non-breeding season  ap. 45-48.  aThe objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) addition into soybean lecithin based extender on buck semen at post-thaw.

Here, we conducted ex situ and in situ manipulations to evaluate the role of temperature and light availability in the breakdown of detrital material. We examined degradation rates of two North Atlantic species with contrasting thermal affinities: the ‘warm water’ kelp Laminaria ochroleuca and the ‘cool water’ Laminaria hyperborea. Detrital fragments were exposed to different temperatures in controlled conditions and across an in situ gradient of depth, corresponding to light availability. Overall, degradation rates (i.e. changes in Fᵥ/Fₘ and biomass) were faster under lower light conditions and at higher temperatures, although responses were highly variable between plants and fragments. Crucially, as L. ochroleuca degraded faster than L. hyperborea under some conditions, a climate-driven substitution of the ‘cool’ for the ‘warm’ kelp, which has been observed at some locations, will likely increase detritus turnover rates and alter detrital pathways in certain environments. More importantly, ocean warming combined with decreased coastal water quality will likely accelerate kelp detritus decomposition, with potential implications for coastal food webs and carbon cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaminaria 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acoastal water 3adetritus 3amacroalgae 3aorganic matter 3aresearch 3atemperature 3awater quality 0aEcosystem change 0aBenthic processes 0aCarbon cycling1 aMulas, Martina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9228-786X1 aFoggo, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0280-08241 aSmale, Dan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4157-541X0 tMarine environmental research.g2022 Jan., v. 173 p.105529-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.1055293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245009000208300001400298520125700312592002801569650001201597650001601609650002101625650002001646650002401666650001201690650001601702650001801718653002701736653001801763653002701781653002101808653001801829653001101847653001101858653002101869700006201890700001601952700002001968700001901988700005702007700006002064773009402124856008702218852000902305655001202314IND60755057520221120144112.0220502e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075505752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2021.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstler, Tim,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9022-012710aVitrifying multiple embryos in different arrangements does not alter the cooling rate  ap. 22-31.  aVitrification is the most common method of cryopreservation of gametes in fertility clinics due to its improved survival rates compared to slow freezing techniques. For the Open Cryotop® vitrification device, the number of oocytes, or embryos, mounted onto a single device can vary. In this work, a mathematical model is developed for the cooling of oocytes and embryos (samples). The model is solved computationally, to investigate whether varying the number of samples mounted onto the Open Cryotop® affects the cooling rates, and consequently the survival rates, of vitrified samples. Several realistic spatial arrangements of samples are examined, determining their temperature over time. In this way we quantify the effect of spatial arrangement on the cooling rate. Our results indicate that neither the spatial arrangement nor the number of mounted samples has a large effect on cooling rates, so long as the volume of the cryoprotectant remains minimal. The time taken for cooling is found to be on the order of half a second, or less, regardless of the spatial arrangement or number of mounted samples. Hence, rapid cooling can be achieved for any number or arrangement of samples, as long as device manufacturer guidelines are adhered to.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3acryobiology 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3amathematical models 3aoocytes 3atemperature 3avitrification 0aMathematical modelling 0aVitrification 0aFinite element methods 0aCryopreservation 0aHeat transfer 0aOocyte 0aEmbryo 0aMultiple embryos1 aWoolley, Thomas E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6225-53651 aSwann, Karl1 aThomson, Andrew1 aPriddle, Helen1 aPalmer, Giles1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6125-53601 aKaouri, Katerina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9850-253X0 tCryobiology.g2021 Dec., v. 103 p.22-31dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2021.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009300166520125700259592002801516650001701544650001501561650001101576650001501587650001001602650002201612650001401634650001301648650001901661650001901680650002401699650001301723650002401736650002401760650001201784650001701796650002001813650002201833653002401855653002101879653002401900653001701924653002601941700001601967700001501983700001801998700005902016773010902075856008602184852000902270655001202279IND60675686420221121062817.0200804e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067568642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.1076602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yuntao10aDirect measurement of the in situ decomposition of microbial-derived soil organic matter  aSoil organic matter (SOM) is the dominant reservoir of terrestrial organic carbon and nitrogen, and microbial necromass represents a primary input to it. However, knowledge of stabilization mechanisms and direct measurements of the decomposition of microbial-derived SOM are lacking. Here we report a novel ¹⁵N isotope pool dilution approach using labeled amino sugars and muropeptides as tracers to quantify the decomposition of proteins and microbial cell walls, which allows to estimate in situ decomposition rates of microbial-derived SOM. Our results demonstrate that microbial cell walls are as recalcitrant as soil protein, exhibiting comparable turnover times across various ecosystems. The bacterial peptidoglycan in soils was primarily decomposed to muropeptides which can be directly utilized by microbes without being further depolymerized to free amino compounds. Moreover, bacterial peptidoglycan decomposition was correlated with soil microbial biomass while fungal chitin and soil protein decomposition were correlated with high soil pH and fine soil texture. This approach thereby provides new insights into the decomposition pathways and stabilization mechanisms of microbial-derived SOM constituents pertaining to SOM persistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino sugars 3acell walls 3achitin 3aecosystems 3afungi 3amicrobial biomass 3anecromass 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3apeptidoglycans 3aprotein degradation 3aproteins 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3asoil texture 3astable isotopes 3atracer techniques 0aSoil organic matter 0aOrganic nitrogen 0aMicrobial necromass 0aAmino sugars 0aIsotope pool dilution1 aZheng, Qing1 aNoll, Lisa1 aZhang, Shasha1 aWanek, Wolfgang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2178-82580 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2020 Feb., v. 141 p.107660-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.1076603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245011100163300001300274520101000287592002801297650002801325650003401353650002501387650001401412650001001426650002201436650001201458650002101470650001401491650001301505650002001518650002001538650002001558653003001578653001201608653001401620653001301634653001301647700001901660700001401679700001201693700001701705700001701722700001401739700001401753700001501767700001401782700001801796700001901814773011301833856008601946852000902032655001202041IND60099782020221121032902.0161019e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009978202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Lu10aAstragalus polysaccharide improves muscle atrophy from dexamethasone- and peroxide-induced injury in vitro  ap. 7-16.  aAstragalus polysaccharide (APS) is an important bioactive component of Astragalus membranaceus Bunge (Leguminosae) that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating muscle wasting, a serious complication with complex mechanism manifested as myofibers atrophy and satellite cells apoptosis. In this study, the anti-atrophy and anti-apoptotic activity of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) was characterized in C2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes and myoblasts. APS inhibited dexamethasone-induced atrophy by restoring phosphorylation of Akt, m-TOR, P70s6k, rpS6 and FoxO3A/FoxO1. The targets that protected C2C12 myoblasts from damage by H2O2 were promoting cells proliferation and inhibiting cells apoptosis. The protective mechanisms involved mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathway. Moreover, Antioxidant effect of APS was also detected in this work.

Here, gentrification scores were calculated for census tracts in the Atlanta metropolitan area, 2000–2016. Spatial autocorrelation of gentrification was assessed, and spatial cluster detection identified hotspots and coldspots of gentrification. Sub-analyses evaluated the impact of time period (before/after 2010) and conceptualization of gentrification (purely economic changes or a combination of changes in economic, racial, and age composition) on the size and location of clusters. Extreme gentrification occurred around downtown Atlanta, while southern and eastern reaches experienced economic decline and decreases in older and non-Hispanic White residents. Leveraging spatial statistical analysis and examining gentrification hotspots across metrics, this study establishes critical understanding of historic gentrification in Atlanta and lays the groundwork to further examine gentrification's impact on the wellbeing of residents and communities to inform urban planning decisions to advance equity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3ageography 3ametropolitan areas 0aGentrification 0aUrban change 0aCluster detection 0aSpatial autocorrelation1 aCurriero, Frank C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8252-06481 aLinton, Sabriya L.0 tApplied geography.g2021 Dec., v. 137 p.102597-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1025973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012800159300001800287500002000305520205700325592002802382650001702410650001902427650002402446650001102470650001802481650001202499650002602511650002102537650001302558650002202571650002302593650001802616650001502634650002302649650002202672651001402694700002302708700002002731700002302751700002002774773011002794856007302904852000902977655001202986IND60584671120221118070305.0171027e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058467112DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.126142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalaiduk, Ronen10aRegional‐scale environmental drivers of highly endemic temperate fish communities located within a climate change hotspot  ap. 1256-1267.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: We used modelled environmental data to identify important drivers of bioregional patterns of demersal fish assemblages characterized by a high proportion of endemic species. LOCATION: Of 1,600 km of coastal marine environment in south‐western Australia. METHODS: We compiled data from 1090 stereo‐BRUVs samples; a total of ~55,000 individuals belonging to 219 demersal fish species. Multivariate Regression Trees and Distance‐based Linear Models distinguished which biological and/or environmental variables, amongst an initial set of 49, were most correlated to observed patterns of demersal fish assemblage structure. Indicator species analysis identified fish species most representative of the assemblage types. RESULTS: The most parsimonious model (constrained by five benthic variables and one spatial variable) explained 42% of the variation in spatial patterns of fish community structure. Canopy‐forming seaweeds were the major benthic drivers, and, when found on structurally complex hard habitat, supported the highest diversity of species after sites dominated by hard coral cover. Indicator species analysis revealed that 28 of 35 significant species for this habitat type were endemics with fish assemblages associated with these habitats often spatially restricted to tens of kilometres. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Demersal fish assemblage composition and biogeographical ranges in south‐western Australia are strongly influenced by the presence of canopy‐forming macroalgae. Canopy‐dominated habitats have already been subject to catastrophic temperature‐related die‐offs in the northern part of this study, indicating its vulnerability to temperature‐driven climate change. These results highlight not only the crucial role of this habitat in supporting endemic fish communities in the region, and the tenuous nature of their existence, but also the challenges facing marine managers who, unable to manipulate the influence of climate change variables, can only focus on alleviating stresses operating on local scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3acorals 3ademersal fish 3adie-off 3aenvironmental factors 3afish communities 3ahabitats 3aindicator species 3aindigenous species 3alinear models 3amacroalgae 3amarine environment 3aspecies diversity 3aAustralia1 aHalford, Andrew R.1 aRadford, Ben T.1 aMoore, Cordelia H.1 aHarvey, Euan S.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2017 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.1256-1267dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.126143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014400170300001400314520130800328592002801636650001901664650002001683650003001703650002601733650002701759650001101786650002301797650001601820650002801836650001401864650001401878700002201892700002101914700002401935700001701959773011101976856008202087852000902169655001202178IND60112289320221121075038.0141110e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011228932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhamad, Noorzaid14aThe kinetic properties of the glutamate dehydrogenase of Teladorsagia circumcincta and their significance for the lifestyle of the parasite  ap. 71-77.  aLike other nematodes, both L₃ and adult Teladosagia circumcincta secrete or excrete NH₃/NH₄ ⁺, but the reactions involved in the production are unclear. Glutamate dehydrogenase is a significant source NH₃/NH₄ ⁺ in some species, but previous reports indicate that the enzyme is absent from L₃Haemonchus contortus. We show that glutamate dehydrogenase was active in both L₃ and adult T. circumcincta. The apparent Kₘs of the L₃ enzyme differed from those of the adult enzyme, the most significant of these being the increase in the Kₘ for NH₄ ⁺ from 18mM in L₃ to 49mM in adults. The apparent Vₘₐₓ of the oxidative deamination reaction was greater than that of the reductive reaction in L₃, but this was reversed in adults. The activity of the oxidative reaction of the L₃ enzyme was not affected by adenine nucleotides, but that of the reductive reaction was stimulated significantly by either ADP or ATP. The L₃ enzyme was more active with NAD⁺ than it was with NADP⁺, although the activities supported by NADH and NADPH were similar at saturating concentrations. While the activity of the oxidative reaction was sufficient to account for the NH₃/NH₄ ⁺ efflux we have previously reported, the reductive amination reaction was likely to be more active.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aTeladorsagia circumcincta 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadults 3aammonium compounds 3adeamination 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3alifestyle 3aparasites1 aSimcock, David C.1 aPedley, Kevin C.1 aSimpson, Heather V.1 aBrown, Simon0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2011 June, v. 159, no. 2 p.71-77dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2011.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245014700174300001400321520112200335592002801457650002501485650002101510650004401531650002201575650002101597650002901618650001201647650001901659650001601678650000901694650001801703650001901721650001801740650001501758650001801773650002301791650003301814650001101847653002801858653002001886653002401906653002601930653002301956700003001979700002002009773012102029856008902150852000902239655001202248IND60564050820221121230328.0190410e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056405082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamedi, Sepideh10aEvaluation of the catalytic, antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities of the Convolvulus arvensis extract functionalized silver nanoparticles  ap. 36-44.  aIn this study, a rapid green synthesis of the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using leaves extract of Convolvulus arvensis was investigated. UV–Visible spectra showed the SPR band at around 430nm which proved the AgNP formation. The reduction of silver ions to nanoparticles was completed within 150min. Particle size analysis verified the formation of AgNPs with average size of 28nm, while their PDI was 0.2. XRD patterns verified the crystalline nature of produced AgNPs. SEM images verified the presence of spherical nanoparticles with no evidence of aggregations. FTIR analysis verified the involvement of the phenolic compounds in AgNP formation. It was found that the biosynthesized AgNPs have the antibacterial activity against human pathogen E. coli. Also, nanoparticles exhibit biofilm degrading activity against both bacterial strains of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the synthesized AgNPs prevented the coagulation of blood samples. The accelerated reduction of methylene blue (MB) in the presence of AgNPs with rate constant of 0.108min−1, confirmed the catalytic potential of nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConvolvulus arvensis 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibacterial properties 3abiofilm 3ablood sampling 3acoagulation 3aions 3aleaf extracts 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aparticle size 3aphenolic compounds 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 0aConvolvulus arvensis L. 0aPhyto-synthesis 0aSilver nanoparticle 0aAnti-biofilm activity 0aCatalytic activity1 aShojaosadati, Seyed Abbas1 aMohammadi, Aref0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2017 Feb., v. 167 p.36-44dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008800172520140400260592002801664650001901692650001101711650001901722650001401741650001101755650002201766651001601788653003301804653002001837653001901857653002201876653002101898773009801919856008502017852000902102655001202111IND60756918520221120175451.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075691852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1026022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMashhoodi, Bardia10aWho is more dependent on gas consumption? Income, gender, age, and urbanity impacts  aA Dutch household is two times more dependent on gas than an average European Union household. The Dutch Climate Agreement targets phasing out households’ gas consumption before 2030. However, it is unclear who will be affected by this policy. Controlling for various building and climate factors, this study analyses the associations between socioeconomic characteristics of households, Gas-use, i.e. annual gas consumption per capita, and Gas-dependency, i.e. the share of gas from total household energy consumption, in the residential zones of the Netherlands in 2018. As a result, three types of socioeconomic groups are identified: (1) more gas-use and more gas-dependency, including low-incomes, high-incomes, the population age 65 or more; (2) more gas-use and less gas-dependency, including the population age 14 or younger; (3) less gas-use and less gas-dependency, including large households, the population age 15–24, immigrants, females, urban households, and tenants. It shows that Gas-use and Gas-dependency spatial patterns do not necessarily overlap, and the simultaneous study of the two variables is essential. It offers a series of policies for gas-intensive groups: progressive energy tax (high incomes), safety net against energy poverty (low incomes), Third Places and local communities (senior citizens), demand response management (population younger than 14 years old).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aenergy 3aenergy poverty 3ageography 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aNetherlands 0aHousehold energy consumption 0aGas consumption 0aGas dependency 0aEnergy transition 0aEnergy structure0 tApplied geography.g2021 Dec., v. 137 p.102602-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1026023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013000174520140700304592002801711650001501739650002301754650001301777650001401790650002601804650001301830650002001843650001801863650002401881650001101905653001701916653002301933653001601956653003101972700002202003773011402025856008602139852000902225655001202234IND60742314820221116205839.0211219e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074231482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1278602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPradhan, Gitanjali12aA greener and cheaper approach towards synthesis of glycerol carbonate from bio waste glycerol using CaO–TiO2 Nanocatalysts  aIn this work we focused on clean catalytic approach of efficient CaO/TiO₂ green nano particles derived from waste chicken eggshells with inorganic support TiO₂ for glycerol carbonate synthesis. The designed nano catalysts were characterized using several chemical and spectrochemical techniques like XRD, FE-SEM, TGA-DSC, FT-IR BET-BJH methods. The corelation between the basic strength and catalytic activity of synthesized catalyst was tested by Hammett indicator method and found to be one of the important factors for glycerol carbonate synthesis. Under optimized condition of reaction parameters (Temp- 90 °C, time – 180min, DMC: gly molar ratio 4:1 and catalyst loading 3 wt% of glycerol used in reaction in gram) 3:1 CaO/TiO₂ mixed oxide showed an excellent performance of 99.3% glycerol conversion and 93.7% of glycerol carbonate yield. The green metrics like Process mass intensity (PMI), and Environmental factor (E-factor), were well studied and obtained as 1.37 mg and 0.082 respectively for the transesterification process with 100% atom utilization (AU). The designed catalyst possessing ideal green chemistry metrics appreciate the manufacturing process of GLC both in industrial and lab scale. The utilization of waste eggshell not only a cheaper and green catalyst but also reduces the amount of waste and its treatment cost which is economically and ecologically friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3acatalytic activity 3achickens 3aegg shell 3aenvironmental factors 3aglycerol 3agreen chemistry 3ananocatalysts 3atransesterification 3awastes 0aBio glycerol 0aGlycerol carbonate 0aCaO/TiO2NPs 0aSolgel hydrothermal method1 aSharma, Yogesh C.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 315 p.127860-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1278603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002300163245012300186300001600309520116400325592002801489650002401517650002001541650001601561650000901577650001301586650001601599650001401615650002701629650003201656650001201688650002501700650002501725650003301750650002201783650006401805650001001869650002301879650002301902650003501925651001001960700003201970700002302002700002302025700002802048773008802076856008002164852000902244655001202253IND4468985820221119211228.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446898582DNAL7 a222653102pmid7 a10.1016/j.fm.2011.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacristán, Noelia10aTechnological characterization of Geotrichum candidum strains isolated from a traditional Spanish goats’ milk cheese  ap. 260-266.  aForty-one strains of Geotrichum candidum isolated from Armada cheese, Sobado variety, were screened for their enzymatic activities, including proteolytic and lipolytic activities and aminopeptidase activity.

It was observed that the polymer films were converted to a more soluble state under low exposure doses of e‐beam, possibly due to main‐chain scission. However, the films became insoluble with higher doses of e‐beam. Three hypotheses were proposed to explain the reduction in solubility, and we used data from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and nanoindentation to eliminate the less probable hypotheses. The results derived from e‐beam‐irradiated thin films of three PRFMAs showed that the radical‐related Norrish Type I and II pathways may not be the main decomposition routes. The data also suggested that sufficient scission reactions of the perfluorooctyl moieties of PRFMAs do not occur by e‐beam. We therefore assumed that the decrease in solubility of the fluorinated polymers results from intermolecular crosslinking reactions between the free radicals and reactive moieties generated on the perfluorooctyl groups by the e‐beam.

In this study, goslings were immunized with different combinations and dosages of several commercial ND vaccines including La Sota vaccine, Mukteswar vaccine, recombinant live vaccine against avian influenza (AI) and ND (rL-H5 strain), and inactivated ND oil-emulsion vaccine (La Sota strain). The protective effects were evaluated based upon the level of antibody response and the degree of protection against the goose-origin virulent NDV strain. The result showed that two doses (i.e., one more than that for chicken) of La Sota vaccine priming, followed by 2-5 doses of Mukteswar vaccine boosting 2-3 weeks later, not only induced higher HI antibody levels, but also conferred longer-lasting protection. This immunization procedure can be recommended for prevention of ND in geese. 3aNewcastle disease 3avaccines 3aantibody detection 3adisease control 3ageese 3adisease outbreaks 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aimmunization 3avaccine development 3astrains 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aGeese 2aImmunizationxveterinary 2aNewcastle Diseasexprevention & control 2aNewcastle disease virusximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aTime Factors 2aViral Vaccinesximmunology 2aVirulence 3aChina 0aChina 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aLiu, Mei1 aLi, Wenliang0 tAvian diseases.g2008 Sept., v. 52, no. 3 p.467-471dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/8239-013008-Reg.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/06  aOther US 7aarticle03222naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245012600171520171000297592002802007650004402035650002202079650003702101650001502138650002302153650004902176650000902225650001602234650002202250650001302272650001602285650001402301650000702315650001502322650001602337653001702353653000802370653002202378653002602400653002202426700001602448700001502464700001502479700001302494700001902507773009102526856009002617852000902707655001202716IND60752439620221121021032.0220307e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075243962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1324212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shuxuan10aFerrous oxalate covered ZVI through ball-milling for enhanced catalytic oxidation of organic contaminants with persulfate  aZero-valent iron (ZVI), with high reduction capacity and cost effectiveness, has been widely used as an activator for persulfate in remediation of organic pollutants. However, the existence of inherent iron oxide shell blocked the transfer of proton and further reduced its reactivity. In present study, a novel persulfate (PS) activator BZVI@OA was synthesized via ball milling ZVI with oxalic acid dihydrate. Scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy confirmed the original low proton conductive oxidation shell was replaced by a high proton conductive FeC₂O₄ shell. The generated shell significantly improved persulfate activated capacity, through which degradation rates of various contaminants were enhanced for 1.64 to 2.33 times. Dissolved oxalate was proved to form complexes with iron ions, dramatically reduced the potential difference and relieved the blocked cyclic conversion. Electron paramagnetic resonance and quenching experiments confirmed an inner sphere adsorption of PS on FeC₂O₄·2H₂O shell which facilitated the peroxide bonds cleavage, leading high efficiency of ROS generation. The accelerated proton transition was confirmed with AC impedance method, resulting in fast and elevated surface bound Fe²⁺ for persulfate decomposition into active species. Furthermore, BZVI@OA/PS system demonstrated high tolerance over wide initial pH range and promising reusability within 6 cycles. This work clarifies an effective strategy for developing efficient modified ZVI as a PS activator for organic pollutant degradation in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acost effectiveness 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3airon 3airon oxides 3amass spectrometry 3aoxalates 3aoxalic acid 3aoxidation 3apH 3apollutants 3aremediation 0aFeC2O4 shell 0aZVI 0aProton conductive 0aPersulfate activation 0aElectron transfer1 aDeng, Sheng1 aMa, Zhifei1 aLiu, Yuhui1 aYang, Yu1 aJiang, Yonghai0 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 287 p.132421-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1324213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014200169506011700311506007600428520122800504592002801732506003701760650003001797650001501827650002101842650001301863650001601876650001801892650001201910650001401922650001901936650000901955650000901964650001701973650002001990653001302010653001202023653001602035653001602051653001402067653003002081700001102111700001402122700001502136700001702151700001602168700001802184700001702202700001802219773010802237856008602345852000902431655001202440IND60756918820221207134838.0220531e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075691882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1188802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qizhen10aControlled release of dinotefuran with temperature/pH-responsive chitosan-gelatin microspheres to reduce leaching risk during application  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeonicotinoid-based pesticides are extensively used owing to their broad insecticidal spectrum and activity. We developed neonicotinoid dinotefuran (DIN)-loaded chitosan-gelatin microspheres using a spray-drying technology, resulting in a pH- and temperature-responsive controlled-release system. Upon introducing chitosan into the triple-helix structure of gelatin, the physically modified gelatin microspheres became smooth, round, and solid, improving their thermal storage stability. The spray-drying parameters were optimized using three-dimensional surface plots. When scaled up under optimal conditions, the corresponding loading content and encapsulation efficiency were 21.5% and 98.17%, respectively. Compared with commercial dinotefuran granules, our biodegradable composite carriers achieved the immobilization of dinotefuran to reduce pesticide leaching by 5.57–19.89% in soil, improved the soil half-life of DIN, and improved its cumulative absorption by plants. Therefore, the microspheres showed better efficacy against Trialeurodes vaporariorum. Our results confirm that this simple approach can improve the utilization efficiency of neonicotinoids, decrease leaching loss, and promote ecological safety.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 3aabsorption 3abiodegradability 3achitosan 3adinotefuran 3aencapsulation 3agelatin 3ahalf life 3amicroparticles 3arisk 3asoil 3aspray drying 3astorage quality 0aChitosan 0aGelatin 0aDinotefuran 0aMicrosphere 0aPesticide 0aTrialeurodes vaporariorum1 aDu, Yu1 aYu, Manli1 aRen, Lirui1 aGuo, Yongfei1 aLi, Qinghua1 aYin, Mingming1 aLi, Xiaolong1 aChen, Fuliang0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 277 p.118880-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1188803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245011600211300001600327506007600343520132300419592002801742506003701770650001501807650001601822650002601838650002301864650002601887650002501913650002001938653004401958653002002002653001502022653001702037653002002054653001802074653002502092653002602117700006102143773008302204856008102287852000902368655001202377IND60555159520221207045531.0180905s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055515952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2015.09.0042doi7 aPMC46251112pmcid7 a265873872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Paoli, Federico10aObtaining full contact for measuring polydimethylsiloxane mechanical properties with flat punch nanoindentation  ap. 374-378.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProcedure to establish full contact between the sample and the 1mm diameter cylindrical flat punch tip to measure polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mechanical properties using the Hysitron TriboIndenter is described. This procedure differs from the standard automated indentation because each indent has to be performed manually after establishing full contact with the sample surface. Incomplete contact happens because of the sample tilt with respect to the flat punch surface and results in incorrect elastic modulus values.•Automated indentation results in incorrect values of the elastic modulus due to initial incomplete contact between the flat punch and the PDMS sample surface, caused by the tilt, and using the unloading slope, which is affected by viscoelastic soft polymer deformation.•Correct procedure requires establishing the full contact between the tip and the sample. This is achieved by moving the tip into the sample in 1–2μm increments, up to 40–80μm maximum combined displacement, until the loading stiffness no longer increases.•The elastic modulus is calculated from the loading stiffness and the diameter of the flat punch, instead of the unloading stiffness, which is larger due to viscoelastic unloading.

Although established as invasive weed plant, the role Lantana camara as an important host plant as well as a food plant for the butterfly species is now well-known. The present study aims to interpret the role of morphological variables of the visitor butterflies in relation to their foraging behaviour on Lantana camara. Butterflies with longer proboscis were more efficient in foraging on flowers of Lantana camara than the butterflies with shorter ones, when the species containing proboscis same as or longer than their body length were excluded. Longer relative proboscis length (RPL) have selective advantage for foraging over Lantana camara up to a certain point (RPL = 0.881) and after that larger relative proboscis length often obstructs foraging behaviour as the handling time increases and these butterflies face more resistance against incoming nectar than the others.The residuals (body weight-wing span) also act as important factor.The handling time of the butterflies on Lantana camara shows a negative relationship with the residuals. The findings suggests that in case of Lantana camara as a nectaring plant butterfly species with longer proboscis have selective advantage for exploitation of the resource than the species with shorter ones and plantation of Lantana camara may be useful for conserving the long tongued butterfly species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLantana camara 3abody length 3abutterflies 3afood plants 3ahost plants 3ainvasive species 3anectar 3aproboscis 0aButterfly 0aLantana camara 0aForaging behaviour 0aConservation1 aHossain, Asif0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2022 June, v. 42, no. 3 p.143-148dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2020.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010700156300002000263520157100283592002801854650002401882650001701906650002301923650001901946650001201965650001901977650001701996650003102013650001302044650001402057650001302071650001802084650001902102650002202121700001802143700001602161700001402177700001502191773012402206856007402330852000902404655001202413IND60665019420221118155632.0190912e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066501942DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra02852j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Zheyu12aA thermally responsive cationic nanogel-based platform for three-dimensional cell culture and recovery  ap. 29146-29156.  aThermo-sensitive nanogels have attracted great interest due to their versatile biological applications, but little research has been carried out to study their abilities in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture and recovery. A new insight is reported into exploring a low-charged thermosensitive cationic nanogel, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (P(NIPAM-HEMA-DMAEMA) or PNHD), for 3D cell culture. The positively charged DMAEMA moieties of the PNHD nanogels facilitate cellular attachment, and the low charge density renders those nanogels minimally cytotoxic. The volume phase transition temperatures (VPTTs) of the synthesized PNHD nanogels can be tailored by adjusting monomer feeds during the course of polymerization. Dynamic rheological measurements confirm the fully reversible sol–gel transition for 50 mg mL⁻¹ PNHD nanogels. At room temperature, PNHD nanogels are in their dispersion states, allowing them to be thoroughly mixed with inoculated cells. Above their gelation temperatures, hydrogels containing a mixture of cells and nanogels are formed in situ. The increase in viable cells with culture time suggests that the in situ formed hydrogels support cell proliferation. Recovery of these cultured cells can be simply achieved by cooling the mixed hydrogels below their gelation temperature. The spherical shape of the released cells indicates their 3D growth in the absence of a physical scaffold. The released cells are not only alive, but also retain the capability of migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acell culture 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acooling 3acultured cells 3acytotoxicity 3agelatinization temperature 3agelation 3ahydrogels 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3athermosensitivity1 aMellati, Amir1 aBi, Jingxiu1 aZhang, Hu1 aDai, Sheng0 tRSC advances.g2014 July 04, v. 4, no. 55 p.29146-29156dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra02852j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010700158300001800265520134800283592002801631650001801659650002901677650001401706650001101720650001401731650001701745650000901762650001801771650001801789650001601807700001901823773012401842856007501966852000902041655001202050IND60534361920221119115241.0160802e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053436192DNAL7 a10.1021/es30089682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, Niklas10aComparison of Population Level and Individual Level Endpoints To Evaluate Ecological Risk of Chemicals  ap. 5590-5598.  aEcological risk assessments (ERA) of chemicals are often based on mortality and reproduction of individuals. To protect populations, fixed safety factors are applied to the data. However, the relationship between individuals and populations cannot easily be described by predefined numbers. The use of population models may reduce uncertainty and, hence, the risk for erroneous assessments. However, introducing models also introduces additional complexity. Therefore, it is desirable to keep the models as simple as possible. The objective of the present study was to determine whether simple risk equations or matrix models can improve ERA compared to traditional endpoints. To examine this, complex models that included environmental stochasticity and density dependence were used to simulate population level risk based on dose–response data for five chemicals. The risk, measured as probability for pseudo extinction and recovery time, was then compared to risk estimates based on individual level data (acute and chronic), risk equations, and simple matrix models. The results showed that the simple matrix models reduced uncertainty by more than 88% and 76% compared to acute and chronic data, respectively. Also the simple risk equation reduced uncertainty considerably (80% and 61% compared to acute and chronic data, respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 3adose response 3aenvironmental assessment 3aequations 3amodels 3amortality 3areproduction 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3asafety factor 3auncertainty1 aStark, John D.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 May 15, v. 46, no. 10 p.5590-5598dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes30089683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002600169245013300195300001800328500001500346520107700361592002801438650002301466650001801489650001601507650002801523650002501551650001601576650001901592650001501611650002501626650002301651650001101674650002001685650001501705650001501720650002501735650002501760650002501785650001501810650002301825650002801848650001301876650001601889653002201905700001501927700002801942700002401970700002701994773009702021856008602118852000902204655001202213IND4457040420221121120846.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445704042DNAL7 a214504602pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeiss-Blanquet, Senta10aEffect of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw on cell wall composition, hydrophobicity and cellulase adsorption  ap. 5938-5946.  a2019-12-06  aThe present study aimed to determine the impact of cell wall composition and lignin content on enzyme adsorption and degradability. Thioacidolysis analysis of residual lignins in wheat straw after steam-explosion or organosolv pretreatment revealed an increase in lignin condensation degree of 27% and 33%, respectively. Surface hydrophobicity assessed through wettability tests decreased after the pretreatments (contact angle decrease of 20–50%), but increased with enzymatic conversion (30% maximum contact angle increase) and correlatively to lignin content. Adsorption of the three major cellulases Cel7A, Cel6A and Cel7B from Trichoderma reesei decreased with increasing hydrolysis time, down to 7%, 31% and 70% on the sample with the highest lignin content, respectively. The fraction of unspecifically bound enzymes was dependent both on the enzyme and the lignin content. Adsorption and specific activity were shown to be inversely proportional to lignin content and hydrophobicity, suggesting that lignin is one of the factors restricting enzymatic hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aorganosolv pulping 3acontact angle 3awheat straw 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3awettability 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydrolysis 3acell wall components 3aTrichoderma reesei 3alignin 3aenzyme activity 3aadsorption 2aAdsorption 2aCell Wallxchemistry 2aCellulasexchemistry 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aHydrolysis 2aSurface Properties 2aTrichodermaxenzymology 2aTriticum 2aWettability 0aHypocrea jecorina1 aZheng, Dan1 aFerreira, Nicolas Lopes1 aLapierre, Catherine1 aBaumberger, Stéphanie0 tBioresource technology.g2011 May, v. 102, no. 10 p.5938-5946dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245015900198506007600357520094800433592002801381506003701409650002501446650001901471650002101490650002001511650001801531650001201549650002201561650001701583650002601600650001901626650001601645650001401661653001601675653002001691700002301711700001801734773011701752856007301869852000901942655001201951IND60690315420221207094002.0200426e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069031542DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.247122doi7 aPMC39089362pmcid7 a236568802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTossi, Vanesa10aPharmacological and genetical evidence supporting nitric oxide requirement for 2,4-epibrassinolide regulation of root architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBrassinosteroids (BRs) regulate various physiological processes, such as tolerance to stresses and root growth. Recently, a connection was reported between BRs and nitric oxide (NO) in plant responses to abiotic stress. Here we present evidence supporting NO functions in BR signaling during root growth process. Arabidopsis seedlings treated with BR 24-epibrassinolide (BL) show increased lateral roots (LR) density, inhibition of primary root (PR) elongation and NO accumulation. Similar effects were observed adding the NO donor GSNO to BR-receptor mutant bri1-1. Furthermore, BL-induced responses in the root were abolished by the specific NO scavenger c-PTIO. The activities of nitrate reductase (NR) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like, two NO generating enzymes were involved in BR signaling. These results demonstrate that BR increases the NO concentration in root cells, which is required for BR-induced changes in root architecture.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabiotic stress 3abrassinosteroids 3aenzyme activity 3alateral roots 3amutants 3anitrate reductase 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aplant response 3aroot growth 3aseedlings 0aArabidopsis 0aroot morphology1 aLamattina, Lorenzo1 aCassia, Raúl0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2013 July 1, v. 8, no. 7 p.e24712-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.247123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094024001900118040001800137100001800155245016900173300001600342520183900358592002802197650001702225650002502242650001702267650002302284650001402307650001002321650003102331650002802362650002102390650002002411650001102431650002402442650001802466650003402484650003302518650001002551650001402561700001402575700001602589700001702605700001702622700001802639700001902657700001802676773013702694856007002831852000902901655001202910IND60597636320221120072342.0180625e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059763632DNAL7 a10.1645/16-1462doi4 apara-103-06-27  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Hong-Wei10aIn Vitro, in Vivo, and Interaction Studies of Nematophagous Fungus Arthrobotrys thaumasia (Monacrosporium thaumasium) with the Larvae of Trichostrongylides of Sheep  ap. 692-698.  aIt is important to isolate potential candidates from the local isolates of nematophagous fungi and to investigate interaction between the fungal strains and gastrointestinal nematodes for the biological control of parasitic nematodes in livestock. In the present study, we assessed the in vitro predatory activity and the viability of isolates of Arthrobotrys thaumasia (Monacrosporium thaumasium) after passage through the gastrointestinal tract of sheep. The predatory process of a representative isolate selected against the larvae of trichostrongylids was prepared with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In vitro experiments tested the ability of 9 native isolates of A. thaumasia to prey on larvae of feces of sheep infected with natural mixed nematodes (Haemonchus contortus, Trichostongylus colubriformis, Marshallagia mongolica). These isolates of A. thaumasia decreased infectivity of third stage infective larvae (L3) by 75.54–99.97%; 7 isolates decreased infectivity by more than 90%. In vivo experiments also demonstrated significant reductions of L3 numbers in the feces treated with the 9 isolates after passing through the gastrointestinal tract of sheep, and these decreases ranged from 51.68 to 88.16%. The isolates tested were re-isolated in 5-g sub-samples of feces from sheep in each treatment group, indicating that these isolates had the capacity to prey upon larvae of trichostrongylids after the passage through gastrointestinal tract. SEM shows that at 6 hr after the larvae were added, including the second stage larvae (L2) and L3 of trichostrongylids, the isolate NBS 005 caught them; at 8 hr after being caught L2 was penetrated by the fungus while penetration of L3 occurred at 12 hr; at 78 hr post-capture L2 was completely destroyed by the fungus while complete digestion of L3 occurred at 84 hr.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobotrys 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aMarshallagia 3abiological control 3adigestion 3afeces 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3agastrointestinal system 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3alarvae 3anematophagous fungi 3apathogenicity 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asheep 3aviability1 aXu, Qiang1 aWang, Bo-Bo1 aJia, Xiao-Ye1 aWan, Xue-Mei1 aYang, Xue-Cai1 aCai, Kui-Zheng1 aLiu, Zhen-Bin0 tJournal of parasitology.g2017 Dec., v. 103, no. 6 p.692-698dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/16-1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011700170300001600287520194900303592002802252650001602280650001202296650001102308650001602319653002702335653002102362653002502383653002002408653001802428653001702446653002502463700001502488700002202503700001102525700001602536773010402552856008502656852000902741655001202750IND60609213220221123004559.0181002e20170720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060921322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhorashi, S.Sh.12aA stochastic computational method based on goal-oriented error estimation for heterogeneous geological materials  ap. 103-113.  aComputational modeling of geological materials is challenging. Firstly, they are heterogeneous with numerous uncertainties in the input parameters and secondly, the computational cost of modeling geological structures is time consuming due to the large and different length scales involved. In this article, we propose an efficient computational method for heterogeneous geological materials based on goal oriented error estimation and adaptive mesh refinement. Instead of estimating the error in a specific norm, the proposed novel error estimation approach which is called dual-weighted residual error estimation, approximates the error with respect to the quantity of interest. The dual-weighted residual error estimation is a dual-based scheme which requires an adjoint problem. The adjoint or dual problem is described by defining the quantity of interest in a functional form. Then by solving the primal and dual problems, errors in terms of the specified quantities are calculated. In many applications in engineering geology, the material is heterogeneous. In such cases, the material properties can be regarded as random fields. This variety of material properties leads to non-uniform distributions of the solution gradients, e.g. stresses. Therefore, it is vital to apply a reliable error estimation approach to be able to do efficiently the mesh-adaptivity procedure with regard to varying material parameters with pre-defined correlation lengths. Hence, the proposed error estimator is extended by accounting for a random field model to describe the material properties. Local estimated errors are exploited in order to accomplish the mesh adaptivity procedure. The goal-oriented mesh adaptivity controls the local errors in terms of the prescribed quantities. Both refinement and coarsening processes are applied to raise the efficiency. The performance of the proposed computational approach is demonstrated for several examples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3ageology 3amodels 3auncertainty 0aDual-weighted residual 0aError estimation 0aQuantity of interest 0aMesh adaptivity 0aGoal-oriented 0aRandom field 0aGeological materials1 aLahmer, T.1 aBagherzadeh, A.S.1 aZi, G.1 aRabczuk, T.0 tEngineering geology.g2017 July 20, v. 225 p.103-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008500173300001600258500001500274520189100289592002802180650001902208650001402227650001302241650000902254650002502263650002502288650001002313650002602323650003402349650004302383650002402426650001702450650001502467650001002482650002002492650001102512650002002523650001702543653001502560653001502575700002702590700001702617700002102634773012702655856005502782852000902837655001202846IND4468040720221122185641.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446804072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2011.00523.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGajewski, Marek,14aThe influence of controlled atmosphere storage on phytosterols in broccoli heads  ap. 722-728.  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to analyze changes in sterols content during storage of broccoli. Broccoli heads of “Marathon” and “Cezar” cultivars were stored for 6 weeks in a cold store, under normal (0% CO2 + 21% O2) and controlled atmosphere conditions (CA, 5% CO2 + 2% O2) at the temperature of 0–1C. Sterols, in the forms of free sterols and glucosides, were determined by high‐performance liquid chromatography. Color parameters of broccoli were determined spectrophotometrically using CIE L*a*b* system. Amount of free sterols in the freshly harvested heads reached 54.3 mg/100 g dw and was the highest in the heads of “Marathon.” The dominant free sterol was β‐sitosterol. During the storage of broccoli, sterol content decreased but was higher in the heads stored in CA. The broccoli showed smaller changes of color when stored in CA than in normal atmosphere. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Phytosterols are valuable components of human diet because of their high biological activity, and broccoli heads are rich in these compounds. For prolonged storage of broccoli heads, controlled atmosphere (CA) is recommended because of less visual quality degradation in such conditions. The influence of CA storage on sterol compounds is not explained up to now as well as relation of changes in sterol composition to heads senescence during postharvest of the broccoli. In the study, changes of sterol compounds in a cold store under CA conditions are analyzed and compared with the changes occurring under normal atmosphere conditions. Also, changes of CIE color parameters of broccoli heads during storage resulting from heads senescence are analyzed. Storage of broccoli in CA under gas composition of 5% CO2 + 2% O2 results in better preservation of sterol compounds and better keeping of the heads' green color than storage in a regular cold store.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acultivars 3abroccoli 3adiet 3afood nutrient losses 3abioactive properties 3agases 3apostharvest treatment 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3aglucosides 3acolor 3ahuman nutrition 3aoxygen 3abeta-sitosterol 3acold storage 0asenescence 0aatmosphere1 aPRZYBYŁ, JAROSŁAW L.1 aBAJER, MARTA1 aJARIENĖ, ELVYRA0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2011 Oct., v. 35, no. 5 p.722-728dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2011.00523.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245011200214520110100326592002801427650002001455650001501475650001001490650001501500650001101515650002301526650001601549650001501565650002101580650001501601650001701616650003901633650001301672650001601685653001601701653002901717653002101746653002301767653002301790700002501813700002301838700002001861773010001881856008701981852000902068655001202077IND60698358820221119052331.0201024e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069835882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1272522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColosimo, Raffaele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2418-696810aProtein bioaccessibility from mycoprotein hyphal structure: In vitro investigation of underlying mechanisms  aMycoprotein is a food ingredient from filamentous fungi rich in protein and fibre. This study investigated the protein bioaccessibility from the fungal cells by colourimetric assays in different mycoprotein formulations, following extraction methods and in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. The methods effects were further analysed by static laser light scattering, SDS-PAGE and optical-fluorescence microscopy. The extraction methods released a comparable proportion of protein (30 wt%) independent of sample concentration (10 wt% and 25 wt%), whereas the simulated digestions endpoints released a higher proportion of protein from the less concentrated (46 wt%). Furthermore, mechanical/physical processing had only a minor impact. Intestinal proteases promoted the most efficient protein release but without causing any apparent damage to the cell walls when viewed by microscopy. This suggested that the enzymes can diffuse through the cell walls, due to its porosity/permeability, and are the main factors responsible for the hydrolysis and bioaccessibility of protein from mycoprotein.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acell walls 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3ahyphae 3ain vitro digestion 3aingredients 3aintestines 3alight scattering 3amicroscopy 3apermeability 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aporosity 3aproteinases 0aMycoprotein 0aProtein bioaccessibility 0aFungal cell wall 0aCell wall porosity 0aIn vitro digestion1 aWarren, Frederick J.1 aFinnigan, Tim J.A.1 aWilde, Peter J.0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 330 p.127252-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1272523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245017400156300001800330500002000348500001500368520185800383592002802241650001702269650001302286650002002299650001002319650001302329650001302342650001402355650001602369650001102385650001202396650002702408650002302435650002202458650001802480650001202498650001202510650001002522650001202532653000902544700001502553700001202568700001502580773013402595856007302729852000902802655001202811IND60580357920221121013747.0170915e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058035792DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.126072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, R.

Casein and DDGS feeds consisted of soya bean feed in which 5% of the CP was replaced with casein‐ or DDGS‐derived CP respectively. Blood and chyme samples were collected from each piglet 2 h post‐feeding on days 0 and 28 of the feeding period. The DDGS feed decreased DMI (p = 0.024) and increased FCR (p = 0.025) due to lower nitrogen utilization (p = 0.078) than those of other feeds. Total amino acid content in chyme demonstrated that casein feed digested rapidly in the duodenum (p = 0.005), whereas DDGS feed was digested primarily in the distal jejunum (p = 0.003) and ileocecum (p = 0.002). However, polypeptide profiles in chyme exhibited a pattern different from those of amino acids. There were no differences in the polypeptide profiles in the stomachs of piglets fed soya bean or casein feeds (p > 0.05), but soya bean group had greater amounts of small polypeptides (mass under m/z 3000 Da) in the duodenum (p = 0.052) than other groups. In contrast, the DDGS feed group had more large polypeptides (m/z 3000–4000 Da) in the stomach than the other groups (p < 0.001). In addition, 10 pairs of polypeptides with matching masses were identified in the plasma and digesta, indicating that polypeptides may have been transported across the intestinal epithelial cells and into the blood. Taken together, substitution of 5% of the CP in soya bean meal‐based feed with DDGS‐derived CP decreased the growth performance of newly weaned piglets due to poor digestibility and N utilization of DDGS feed, as well as untimely digestion of casein feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolypeptides 3aduodenum 3ablood chemistry 3afeeds 3anitrogen 3asoybeans 3adigestion 3aamino acids 3acasein 3adigesta 3aamino acid composition 3agrowth performance 3aintestinal mucosa 3adigestibility 3ajejunum 3astomach 3ablood 3apiglets 0adiet1 aXia, J.

This study describes the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from uncomplicated malaria cases over a ten year period (2003–2013) in Ghana using the polymorphic antigenic marker, merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2). METHODS: Archived filter paper blood blots from children aged nine years and below with uncomplicated malaria collected from nine sites in Ghana were typed for the presence of the markers. A total of 880 samples were genotyped for msp2 for the two major allelic families, FC27 and 3D7, using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The allele frequencies and the multiplicity of infection were determined for the nine sites for five time points over a period of ten years, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2010 and 2012–2013 malaria transmission seasons. RESULTS: The number of different alleles detected for the msp2 gene by resolving PCR products on agarose gels was 14. Both of the major allelic families, 3D7 and FC27 were common in all population samples. The highest multiplicity of infection (MOI) was observed in isolates from Begoro (forest zone, rural site): 3.31 for the time point 2007–2008. A significant variation was observed among the sites in the MOIs detected per infection (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001) for the 2007 isolates and also at each of the three sites with data for three different years, Hohoe, P = 0.03; Navrongo, P < 0.001; Cape Coast, P < 0.001. Overall, there was no significant difference between the MOIs of the three ecological zones over the years (P = 0.37) and between the time points when data from all sites were pooled (P = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: The diversity and variation between isolates detected using the msp2 gene in Ghanaian isolates were observed to be profound; however, there was homogeneity throughout the three ecological zones studied. This is indicative of gene flow between the parasite populations across the country probably due to human population movements (HPM).  aPublisher supplied data  a980034cMultilateral Initiative in Malaria-WHO/TDR  aC0437_11_N3cGlobal Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aagarose 3aalleles 3aantimalarials 3ablood 3achildren 3acoasts 3aecological zones 3aepitopes 3aforests 3agels 3agene flow 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ahuman population 3amalaria 3amerozoites 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asurface proteins 3avaccine development 3aGhana1 aMatrevi, Sena A.1 aQuashie, Neils B.1 aAbuaku, Benjamin1 aKoram, Kwadwo A.0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.416-416dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1692-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010100153300001800254520112800272592002801400650001501428650001101443650001901454650001301473650001501486650002801501650001301529650001701542650001701559700001701576700001801593773014201611856007401753852000901827655001201836IND60687510420221121033435.0200401e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068751042DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta00154f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, You10aAdvanced porous graphene materials: from in-plane pore generation to energy storage applications  ap. 6125-6143.  aGraphene, a two-dimensional carbon sheet with a honeycomb arrangement, has demonstrated promise in energy storage applications owing to its fascinating features, such as a large specific surface area, high conductivity, and excellent mechanical flexibility. However, the slow ion transport kinetics and the reduced active surface area due to the restacking of graphene nanosheets during electrode preparation are still major obstacles in the fabrication of energy storage devices with high power/energy density. To deal with the above-mentioned problems, porosity engineering in graphene sheets (creating holes in graphene sheets) has become a highly efficient and promising approach to enabling porous graphene materials to possess the dual advantages of both graphene and porous materials. This review mainly focuses on the in-plane pore-generating approaches to the preparation of porous graphene materials and the recent research progress in the use of porous graphene materials for largely improving the performance of energy storage devices. Furthermore, their challenges for practical application are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3ananosheets 3aphysiological transport 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asurface area1 aSui, Zhu-Yin1 aHan, Bao-Hang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 8, no. 13 p.6125-6143dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta00154f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010100172300001600273520213600289592002802425650002902453650002302482650002002505650001002525650000902535650001302544650001802557650002202575650001502597650002702612650001402639650001002653650001302663773009002676856008402766852000902850655001202859IND60086839120221118050506.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008683912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2011.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, David A.10aCauses and ecological effects of resuspended contaminated sediments (RCS) in marine environments  ap. 230-243.  aSediments act as a net sink for anthropogenic contaminants in marine ecosystems and contaminated sediments may have a range of toxicological effects on benthic fauna and associated species. When resuspended, however, particulate-bound contaminants may be remobilised into the water column and become bioavailable to an additional assemblage of species. Such resuspension occurs through a range of natural and anthropogenic processes each of which may be thought of as pulsed disturbances resulting in pulsed exposures to contaminants. Thus, it is important to understand not only the toxicological responses of organisms to resuspended contaminated sediments (RCS), but also the frequency, magnitude and duration of sediment disturbance events. Such information is rarely collected together with toxicological data. Rather, the majority of published studies (>50% of the articles captured in this review) have taken the form of fixed-duration laboratory-based exposures with individual species. While this research has clearly demonstrated that resuspension of contaminated sediments can liberate sediment-bound contaminants leading to toxicity and bioaccumulation under controlled conditions, the potential for ecological effects in the field is often unclear. Monitoring studies suggest that recurrent natural disturbances such as tides and waves may cause the majority of contaminant release in many environments. However, various processes also act to limit the spatial and temporal scales across which contaminants are remobilised to the most toxic dissolved state. Various natural and anthropogenic disturbances of contaminated sediments have been linked to both community-level and sub-lethal responses in exposed populations of invertebrates and fish in the field. Together these findings suggest that resuspension of contaminated sediments is a frequently recurring ecological threat in contaminated marine habitats. Further consideration of how marine communities respond to temporally variable exposures to RCS is required, as well as research into the relative importance of various disturbances under field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aat-risk population 3abioaccumulation 3afauna 3afish 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3amarine ecosystems 3amonitoring 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atides 3atoxicity0 tEnvironment international.g2012 Apr., v. 40 p.230-243dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2011.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245017900167300001600346520134200362592002801704650004401732650001501776650001301791650001101804650002801815650001201843650002501855650001301880650003801893650002301931650003301954650002201987650001302009650000902022700002402031700002202055773011502077852000902192856008202201655001202283IND4407542720221119115848.0190314e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440754272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-007-0922-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasegawa, Daisuke10aMolecular complex of lignosulfonic acid/poly(vinyl pyridine) via ionic interaction: characterization of chemical composition and application to material surface modifications  ap. 143-152.  aPoly ion complexes of anionic lignosulfonic acid (LSA) with cationic poly(2-vinyl pyridine) or poly(4-vinyl pyridine) were prepared by mixing the polymer solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide or dilute hydrochloric acid. The complexes were formed as soon as the polymer solutions were mixed. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements for the complexes revealed the presence of strong ionic interactions between sulfonate anions of LSA and pyridinium cations of the vinyl pyridine (VPy) polymers. The strong interaction was supported by detection of a glass transition temperature (T g) much higher than pristine T g values of VPy polymers in differential scanning calorimetry. By using the ionic complexation, a coating of LSA onto VPy polymer films was undertaken to modify their original surface property. Formation of a thin complex film was confirmed by observation of absorption bands that are characteristic of the pyridinium cation in reflection FTIR spectra measurements, and by visualization of the attached LSA component in atomic force microscopy. This treatment resulted in the surface of the VPy polymer films becoming hydrophobic. An adhesion test was also conducted by pasting two veneered woods with the polymer complex, followed by shear-tearing them off. The adhesive strength of the complex was estimated to be 1.1 MPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aadhesion 3aanions 3aatomic force microscopy 3acations 3achemical composition 3acoatings 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrochloric acid 3apolymers 3awood1 aTeramoto, Yoshikuni1 aNishio, Yoshiyuki0 tJournal of wood science.g2008 Apr., v. 54, no. 2 p.143-152dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-007-0922-83Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03301naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013100168300001400299520202300313592002802336650001702364650001602381650002602397650001202423650001302435650001102448650001302459650001502472653001202487653001902499653001702518653003502535653001502570700006202585700002302647700002602670773010202696856008402798852000902882655001202891IND60609213420221123032948.0180822e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060921342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2017.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Luís,10aCharacterization and quality assessment of granitic building stone deposits: A case study of two different Portuguese granites  ap. 29-40.  aSeveral factors determine building stone exploration in order to maximize the extraction, processing and application of these natural materials. Some factors are intrinsic to stones, such as their physical-mechanical properties, while others are related to their exploitability, such as quarry reserves or fracturing density. During an exploration campaign, these factors are not always considered or properly weighed in terms of the negative consequences on quarry activities or rock behaviour under particular conditions. In this study, two well-known Portuguese granites are assessed to highlight the main factors. These granites have different characteristics, weathered and sound, and are exploited in quarries with different joint densities. The most relevant physical-mechanical properties were evaluated and related to the specific petrophysical features of each granite. The fracture patterns were identified in the quarries and then modelled in order to compute the quarry yield. The weathered granite shows an important microcrack network and a general alteration of the rock-forming minerals, which has an important impact on its physical-mechanical properties and on the resistance to environmental factors. Moreover, the extreme differences in the degree of weathering require careful choices for the possible applications. In both quarries, the joint sets are similar to the regional faulting, but some random joints can be found and, consequently, diminish the quarry yield. The development of horizontal sheet joints during the exploitation process could have a great influence on the quarry productivity if they are not used do delimitate the extracted blocks. The modelling of the natural fracture pattern allows us to determine the potential volume of blocks that could be exploited. However, the quality of the information gathered could lead to an over-estimation of the quarry production.This example shows the importance of the exhaustive researches during a building stone assessment campaign.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aengineering 3aenvironmental factors 3agranite 3aminerals 3amodels 3aquarries 3aweathering 0aGranite 0aBuilding stone 0aExploitation 0aPhysical-mechanical properties 0aFracturing1 aBarabasch, Jessica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5237-31461 aStein, Karl-Jochen1 aSiegesmund, Siegfried0 tEngineering geology.g2017 Apr. 20, v. 221 p.29-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2017.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008100160300001800241520127000259592002801529650001401557650001201571650001101583650001701594650001901611650001401630650001801644650001201662650001201674650002201686650001201708650001101720650001401731650002201745651001801767700001901785700001701804773012501821856007501946852000902021655001202030IND60534362220221119115121.0160802e20120605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053436222DNAL7 a10.1021/es20301422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaigneault, Adam10aEconomic Approach to Assess the Forest Carbon Implications of Biomass Energy  ap. 5664-5671.  aThere is widespread concern that biomass energy policy that promotes forests as a supply source will cause net carbon emissions. Most of the analyses that have been done to date, however, are biological, ignoring the effects of market adaptations through substitution, net imports, and timber investments. This paper uses a dynamic model of forest and land use management to estimate the impact of United States energy policies that emphasize the utilization of forest biomass on global timber production and carbon stocks over the next 50 years. We show that when market factors are included in the analysis, expanded demand for biomass energy increases timber prices and harvests, but reduces net global carbon emissions because higher wood prices lead to new investments in forest stocks. Estimates are sensitive to assumptions about whether harvest residues and new forestland can be used for biomass energy and the demand for biomass. Restricting biomass energy to being sourced only from roundwood on existing forestland can transform the policy from a net sink to a net source of emissions. These results illustrate the importance of capturing market adjustments and a large geographic scope when measuring the carbon implications of biomass energy policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3adynamic models 3aemissions 3aenergy policy 3aforests 3aimports 3aland use planning 3amarkets 3aprices 3aroundwood 3atimber production 3aUnited States1 aSohngen, Brent1 aSedjo, Roger0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 June 05, v. 46, no. 11 p.5664-5671dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes20301423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010800176300001400284520161500298592002801913650002201941650001101963650002701974650001102001650001202012650000902024650001302033650001402046650001302060650001002073650001202083650001202095650001402107650000702121650001402128650001102142650001302153650001502166651000902181651001102190700002102201700001802222700001802240700002102258773008802279856008402367852000902451655001202460IND60086839220221118050419.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008683922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2011.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuigueno, Mélanie F.10aDifferential exposure of alpine ospreys to mercury: Melting glaciers, hydrology or deposition patterns?  ap. 24-32.  aMercury (Hg) is a global contaminant impacting even remote environments. In alpine watersheds, glacial meltwater is a source of Hg, which accumulated in glaciers during the 1960–1980 cooling cycle. The considerable variation observed for Hg exposure of alpine animals in proximal watersheds could result from differences among those watersheds in Hg loading from glacial meltwater. Alternatively, variation may be the result of hydrology, atmospheric Hg deposition patterns, or food web characteristics. To examine those possibilities, we measured Hg in ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), apex predators in 15 watersheds in western Canada. Mercury levels in feathers of nestlings increased with increasing modeled atmospheric deposition rates and decreased with lake size. In eggs mercury decreased with δ¹³C, an indicator of food web structure, and with pH and elevation. Thus, Hg levels in chicks were strongly associated with local patterns relevant when the chicks were growing (e.g. the period post-snow melt: Hg deposition, lake size) while Hg levels in eggs were weakly associated with local patterns relevant during the snow melt (elevation, δ¹³C), with the remainder of the Hg variation in eggs determined by other factors such as possible Hg accumulation by the adult elsewhere. Modeled atmospheric deposition from prevailing upwind locations including Asia, followed by runoff into small lakes, were related to Hg patterns in osprey, with little apparent role for recent melting of glaciers. Our study highlights the importance of physical patterns to the environmental chemistry of top predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPandion haliaetus 3aadults 3aatmospheric deposition 3achicks 3acooling 3aeggs 3afeathers 3afood webs 3aglaciers 3alakes 3amelting 3amercury 3anestlings 3apH 3apredators 3arunoff 3asnowmelt 3awatersheds 3aAsia 3aCanada1 aElliott, Kyle H.1 aLevac, Joshua1 aWayland, Mark1 aElliott, John E.0 tEnvironment international.g2012 Apr., v. 40 p.24-32dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2011.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013900156300002000295520088100315592002801196650002301224650001801247650001301265650002101278650003501299700001901334700001601353700001701369700001601386700001701402700002001419773012401439856007401563852000901637655001201646IND60665019920221118155652.0190912e20140630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066501992DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra02857k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Yanghe10aResonance Rayleigh scattering detection of trace PDGF based on catalysis of an aptamer-modified nanogold probe in the Fehling reaction  ap. 28052-28055.  aGold nanoparticles (GN) were modified by a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) aptamer to obtain stable aptamer-nanogold probes (Apt-GN).

The probes exhibit strong catalysis of the Fehling reagent–glucose Cu₂O particle reaction that can be monitored by the RRS technique at 610 nm, but the cluster is very weak. When PDGF-AA concentration increased, the Apt-GN decreased, and the RRS intensity at 610 nm decreased.

This paper analyses the use of residential lead–acid energy storage coupled with photovoltaics and its possible interaction with the grid for different limits of feed-in power without any support policies. In the literature, these subjects are often treated independently and for very specific, non-optimised cases, thus motivating further research. Results show that reaching self-sufficiency values up to 40% is possible, close to grid parity values, and only with photovoltaics. Beyond 40%, energy storage must be used, strongly raising the cost of the electricity consumed and therefore the need for support policies for widespread adoption. Also, peak power consumption from the grid remains constant and load variability rises, suggesting that an increase in self-sufficiency would be accompanied by lower utilisation factors of power plants and, consequently, higher wholesale electricity prices during no sunshine hours. Limiting feed-in power attenuates the increased load variability and only slightly affects the economic viability of such installations. These results present a novel optimisation tool for developers and should be considered in future studies of distributed photovoltaics and energy storage as well as in energy policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3abuildings 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy policy 3ahouseholds 3apower plants 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 0aHome energy storage 0aDistributed energy storage 0aLead–acid battery energy storage 0aSelf-sufficiency 0aPhotovoltaics (PV) 0aLevelised Cost of Energy (LCOE)1 aHendrick, Patrick0 tApplied energy.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 178 p.856-867dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245011800206300001600324520130500340592002801645650001601673650001601689650001501705651001001720653005001730653002701780653003201807653003401839700001201873700001701885700005701902700001801959773010401977856008402081852000902165655001202174IND60609213620221123004425.0180822e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060921362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2017.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Qinglu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1799-174710aPrecedent long-term gravitational deformation of large scale landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir area, China  ap. 170-183.  aLarge scale landslides are common in the Three Gorges reservoir region due to steep slopes and complex geological conditions, fluctuations of reservoir level, etc. Many phenomena and formation mechanisms related to these landslides are not well understood and need more research. In this study, large scale landslide evolution and formation mechanisms are thoroughly investigated in terms of precedent long-term gravitational deformation (PLTGD). Three large scale landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir region, Huangtupo landslide (HTPL), Huanglashi landslide (HLSL), and Baotaping landslide (BTPL), are taken for example to discuss their phenomena and features of PLTGD, and to investigate the correlation between the PLTGDs and landslide. Many features associated with landslides are caused by slow, downslope gravitational processes before landslide failure, and three criteria for recognition of the PLTGD features are summarized. The investigation results reveal that the PLTGDs play an important role in landslide evolution and formation mechanism. Overall, this paper presents evidences for PLTGDs of large scale landslides and their correlation with landslide evolution, which is helpful to understand the formation mechanism of large scale landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir region.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aengineering 3alandslides 3aChina 0aPrecedent long-term gravitational deformation 0aLarge scale landslides 0aLandslide evolution process 0aThree Gorges reservoir region1 aFu, Min1 aRen, Xingwei1 aLiu, Fangzhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5600-40171 aTang, Huiming0 tEngineering geology.g2017 Apr. 20, v. 221 p.170-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2017.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245018600156300001800342520150200360592002801862650002301890650002101913650001901934650002301953650002101976650002401997650000902021650001502030650001802045650001902063650001302082650001902095700001702114700001502131700001802146700001802164773014202182856007402324852000902398655001202407IND60687510720221121023535.0200401e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068751072DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta00452a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanting13aAn effective strategy of constructing a multi-junction structure by integrating a heterojunction and a homojunction to promote the charge separation and transfer efficiency of WO₃  ap. 6256-6267.  aAdequate light absorption and effective charge separation and transfer are deemed to be the contributing factors to achieve high photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting on photoanodes. Herein, in this work, a Mo-WO₃/Fe-WO₃ homojunction was fabricated firstly by coating Fe doped WO₃ (Fe-WO₃) on Mo doped WO₃ (Mo-WO₃) via a two-step hydrothermal method, and then Bi₂S₃ nanoparticles (NPs) were further introduced onto the surface of Mo-WO₃/Fe-WO₃ to construct a multi-junction structure. In this Mo-WO₃/Fe-WO₃/Bi₂S₃ photoanode, the Bi₂S₃ NPs as the primary light absorber improve the light utilization efficiency. Moreover, the Fe-WO₃/Bi₂S₃ heterojunction is formed due to their well-matched bands, which could facilitate charge separation and transfer; meanwhile, the internal built-in electric field at the interface of the Mo-WO₃/Fe-WO₃ homojunction would hinder the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Notably, the homojunction can further promote carrier transfer because of its unique property of eliminating the lattice mismatch. As expected, the Mo-WO₃/Fe-WO₃/Bi₂S₃ photoanode yields a significantly enhanced photocurrent of 2.55 mA cm⁻² at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 8.23 times that of the WO₃ photoanode. Thus, constructing a multi-junction structure with a ladder staggered alignment by integrating a homojunction and a heterojunction is believed to be an effective strategy to improve the PEC performance of WO₃ photoanodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3aelectric current 3aelectric field 3aelectrical charges 3aelectrochemistry 3ahot water treatment 3airon 3amolybdenum 3ananoparticles 3aphotochemistry 3asulfides 3atungsten oxide1 aLiu, Zhifeng1 aLi, Junwei1 aRuan, Mengnan1 aGuo, Zhengang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 8, no. 13 p.6256-6267dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta00452a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245008600151300001800237500002000255520181600275592002802091650002302119650001602142650001002158650001302168650001802181650002002199650002202219650001302241650001002254650003102264650001002295650001202305650001002317650001302327650001002340650002002350700001202370700001302382700001402395700001302409700001202422773013402434856007302568852000902641655001202650IND60580358220221120230047.0170915e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058035822DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.126182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, W.10aEffect of dietary dry matter intake on endogenous nitrogen flows in growing lambs  ap. e383-e393.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of dietary dry matter intake (DMI) on endogenous nitrogen (N) flows at different part of the digestive tract of growing lambs was determined using a ¹⁵N isotope dilution technique. Three Kazakh male lambs (30 ± 2.75 kg of body weights and 4 months old, average daily gain 200 g/day) were fitted with ruminal, duodenal and ileal cannulae and raised in metabolic cage individually. The experiment was conducted in a 3 × 3 Latin square design with three lambs, three DMI levels (1100, 920 and 736 g/day respectively) and three periods. Each period lasted 18 days, consisting of 10 days for adaptation, 8 days for the continuous infusion of l‐[¹⁵N]leucine, during which the intestinal flow of N and ¹⁵N enrichment were determined. The total endogenous secretions in the forestomach (Sfₛ) were decreased (p = 0.0512) with increased level of DMI. On the contrary, endogenous nitrogen (EN) secretions into the small intestine (Sᵢ) increased (p = 0.0249) significantly with the high level of DMI (HI) group compared with that of low level of DMI (LI). Total absorption from forestomach was reduced (p = 0.0121) with increased level of DMI, whereas total absorption from small intestine for HI group increased (p = 0.0116) significantly compared with that of LI treatment. The real digestibility of N in the rumen accompanied with the increase in feed intake is decreased (p = 0.081). In contrast, there were no effects of DMI level on the computed real digestibility of N across both small intestine and whole tract. The results of this study indicate that the total flows of EN at duodenum may be unaffected by the level of DMI; however, the EN flow at ileal level increased from 12% to 37% with the increase in DMI level, corresponding to 33% of total N flow at ileum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acages 3acannulas 3adigestibility 3adigestive tract 3adry matter intake 3aduodenum 3aileum 3aisotope dilution technique 3alambs 3aleucine 3amales 3anitrogen 3arumen 3astable isotopes1 aGao, X.1 aChen, A.1 aZhang, F.1 aChen, D.1 aLiu, C.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2017 Oct., v. 101, no. 5 p.e383-e393dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.126183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012900165300001400294520136000308592002801668650001301696650002501709650001601734650001601750650001101766650001401777653002001791653003001811653002801841653001901869653001701888700001601905700001901921700001501940773010201955856008502057852000902142655001202151IND60609213920221123032942.0181002e20170720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060921392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhijun10aMicro-mechanical modeling of the macro-mechanical response and fracture behavior of rock using the numerical manifold method  ap. 49-60.  aA micro-mechanical based numerical manifold method (NMM) is proposed in this study to investigate the micro-mechanisms underlying rock macroscopic response and fracture processes. The Voronoi tessellation technique is adopted to create randomly-sized polygonal rock micro-grains. A rock micro-grain based broken criterion is proposed and a corresponding grain breaking technique is developed. To better represent the contact behavior of rock grain bonds, a cohesive fracture model that considers tensile, shear and compressive behaviors together, is adopted to interpret the failure of rock grain bonds. The developed program is first validated by reproducing biaxial tests of Transjurane sandstone. Finally, the influences of micro-parameters on the rock macroscopic response and failure modes are investigated. The results show that the developed micro-based model can mimic the deformation and failure characteristics of the test closely. A parameter study shows that the grain contact cohesion has significant effects on the model uniaxial compressive strength. The fracture process and failure mode of rock are dependent on the ratio of grain contact shear stiffness to normal stiffness. With the increase of the contact stiffness ratio, the failure mode of rock under uniaxial compression changes from a diffuse pattern to a concentrated shear band.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3acompression strength 3adeformation 3aengineering 3amodels 3asandstone 0aMicro-mechanism 0aNumerical manifold method 0aCohesive fracture model 0aMacro-response 0aFailure mode1 aFan, Lifeng1 aLiu, Quansheng1 aMa, Guowei0 tEngineering geology.g2017 July 20, v. 225 p.49-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245009300174500001900267520169200286592002801978650001302006650001502019650000902034650001302043650001402056650001402070653002102084653001702105653002302122653002102145653001002166700005902176773013302235856008402368852000902452655001202461IND60718648920221116173510.0210305e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071864892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2020.1002852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Fabiana M.10aDo metallic-coated cups affect the perception of specialty coffees? An exploratory study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe presence of a metallic surface or appearance of product packaging and servingware can impact both the sensory and hedonic perception of various different foods and beverages, including promoting the impression of quality, premiumness, and luxury. A total of 51 coffee experts and 132 consumers took part in the study. Metallic-coated ceramic cups were used to assess whether the outer coating of the cup would influence the perception of two distinct coffee profiles. Hedonic and sensory ratings were assessed. Given the known link between visual metallic surfaces and premium/luxury perception, we also assessed whether participants' impressions of elegance might be mediating between the cup and positive sensory and hedonic judgments. Interaction effects between coffee type and cup finish revealed that higher sensory and hedonic ratings were given to the Brazilian coffee when it was tasted from the bronze cup, and to the Kenyan coffee when sampled from the gold cup (as compared to all other cups). Interaction effects including ‘expertise level’ showed that experts (in contrast to consumers) gave higher ratings of sweetness for both Brazilian and Kenyan when tasted from the bronze cup. Moreover, ‘elegance’ was a predictor of positive judgments when the Brazilian coffee was served in the bronze cup (for both experts and consumers) and when the Kenyan coffee was served in the white cup (for experts only). Despite the preliminary nature of these results, they nevertheless merit consideration by the industry. In addition to innovation, it makes sense to create receptacles that convey some functional and/or perceptual benefit to the coffee drinking experience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3agastronomy 3agold 3aindustry 3asensation 3asweetness 0aSpecialty coffee 0aMetallic cup 0aFlavour perception 0aHedonic response 0aTaste1 aSpence, Charles1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2111-072X0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2021 Apr., v. 23 p.100285-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2020.1002853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245014700152300001500299500001100314520155700325592002801882650002401910650002301934650002501957650001901982650001602001650002602017650001002043650002402053650000902077650001302086650002302099650002002122650002102142650002102163650003002184650001202214650001502226650001202241700001202253700001102265700001402276773013102290856007302421852000902494655001202503IND60580358620221120230209.0170915e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058035862DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.126292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, C.14aThe Effect of Lactobacillus isolates on growth performance, immune response, intestinal bacterial community composition of growing Rex Rabbits  ap. e1-e13.  aREVIEW  aThe objective of this experiment was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus isolates on intestinal bacterial community composition of growing Rex Rabbits. A total of 120 weaned Rex Rabbits (30 days old, 30 per group) were used for the experiment, which started after an adaptation period of 7 days. The control group was fed with basal diet only, while the treatment I, II and III groups were fed with basal diet adding antibiotics, Lactobacillus zeae (LB1) and Lactobacillus casei (L3) respectively. Growth performance, immune response and intestinal flora have been examined. The results obtained were as follows: (i) F/G of the rabbits fed with Lactobacillus isolates was significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05). (ii) The concentration of ALT decreased significantly (p < 0.05) and that of IgG and IgM increased significantly (p < 0.05) after feeding rabbits with Lactobacillus isolates. (iii) Lactobacillus isolates had no influence on the number of mast cells in duodenum and jejunum, but increased the number of mast cells in caecum significantly (p < 0.05). (iv) The data from pyrosequencing‐based analysis suggested that the bacterial community in the rabbit's intestinal flora can be changed by Lactobacillus isolates and antibiotics, especially for the microbial diversity and abundance in the caecum. In conclusion, the application of proper Lactobacillus isolates can improve the growth performance, enhance the immunological function and adjust the intestinal micro‐ecosystem of growing Rex Rabbits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus zeae 3aalanine transaminase 3aanimal feeding 3aantibiotics 3abacterial communities 3acecum 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3aduodenum 3agrowth performance 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajejunum 3amast cells 3arabbits1 aZhu, Y.1 aLi, F.1 aHuang, L.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2017 Oct., v. 101, no. 5 p.e1-e13dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.126293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013200160300002000292520093300312592002801245650001301273650001301286650001101299650002101310650002101331650001901352650001801371650001901389650001901408700001801427700001701445700002101462700001701483773012401500856007401624852000901698655001201707IND60665020520221118160549.0190912e20140606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066502052DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra02868f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChae, Sang Youn10aSynthesis of Bi₂WO₆ photoanode on transparent conducting oxide substrate with low onset potential for solar water splitting  ap. 24032-24037.  aTo enable water splitting in photoelectrochemical cells, the conduction-band (CB) and valence-band edges must straddle the hydrogen-reduction and water-oxidation potentials; however, the CB edge potential of many photoanodic semiconductors is insufficient. Here, we demonstrate the nanostructured Bi₂WO₆ for photoanodic application, which has a high, flat-band potential of 0.15 V vs. RHE. Single-phase, orthorhombic Bi₂WO₆ nano-structures were successfully grown on an FTO substrate through a two-step hydrothermal synthesis with subsequent thermal treatment at 600 °C. The synthesized Bi₂WO₆ photoanode shows a lower onset potential and improved photocurrents which were enhanced further by a factor of three by coating the surface with Co-Pi. The low onset potential of the Bi₂WO₆/Co-Pi photoanode results in a higher operating photocurrent in a p/n photodiode cell combined with a p-Si/n-Si/Pt photocathode.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acoatings 3acobalt 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aheat treatment 3ananomaterials 3aphotochemistry 3asemiconductors1 aLee, Eun Seon1 aJung, Hyejin1 aHwang, Yun Jeong1 aJoo, Oh-Shim0 tRSC advances.g2014 June 06, v. 4, no. 46 p.24032-24037dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra02868f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245008600179500001900265520158400284592002801868650003101896650002901927650001701956650002401973650002001997650001702017650001702034650001902051650001802070650001902088650001402107650001502121650003702136650001902173653001802192653002702210653002502237700003902262700003902301700002902340700004202369700003502411700002702446700003002473700004102503773012202544856008302666852000902749655001202758IND60718649120221116173313.0210219e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071864912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1018792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValencia, Marcela Sarmento10aBioactivity and cytotoxicity of quercetin-loaded, lecithin-chitosan nanoparticles  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aQuercetin is a bioactive compound with potential application as an antioxidant in food matrices. However, the use of this flavonoid becomes a challenge due to its relative degree of hydrophobicity and low bioavailability. In order to improve its dispersibility in aqueous media, protection against degradation and the bioavailability of quercetin, this study aimed to develop quercetin-loaded, lecithin-chitosan nanoparticles (NPQ) and to characterize its physical, chemical and biological properties. The nanoparticles were characterized in terms of mean size, PDI, zeta potential, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, FT-IR, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermal analysis (TGA and DSC). Stability over shelf life at 4 and 30 °C, antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxicity activities were also determined. Quercetin was encapsulated in lecithin-chitosan nanoparticles (NP) with an efficiency of 98.31 ± 0.01%. NPQ presented a well-defined spherical morphology with a mean size of 240.81 ± 10.82 nm and a zeta potential of +38.9 ± 1.60 mV. Stability studies showed that NPQ are relatively stable over 28 days of storage at 4 °C and 30 °C. Regarding biological activities, NPQ were able to eliminate DPPH and ABTS radicals in the same way as free quercetin and showed antimicrobial activity, without presenting cytotoxicity against normal cells (L-929 and PBMC). These results suggest that quercetin-loaded, lecithin-chitosan nanoparticles have excellent potential for application in food matrices aiming at the development of new functional foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural biotechnology 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3abiocatalysis 3acytotoxicity 3adispersibility 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophobicity 3aquercetin 3ashelf life 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aDrug delivery 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aAntioxidant activity1 aFranco da Silva Júnior, Maurício1 aXavier Júnior, Francisco Humberto1 ade Oliveira Veras, Bruno1 aFernanda de Oliveira Borba, Elizabeth1 aGonçalves da Silva, Teresinha1 aXavier, Viviane Lansky1 aPessoa de Souza, Marthyna1 aCarneiro-da-Cunha, Maria das Graças0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2021 Jan., v. 31 p.101879-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1018793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245013900157300001600296500001500312520145000327592002801777650001601805650002101821650001801842650001001860650001501870650000901885650003501894650001301929650002601942650002601968650001501994650001002009650002402019650001102043650001902054650001702073650001502090651001302105653001902118700001902137700001302156700002102169700001902190700001402209700002002223773008902243856004802332852000902380655001202389IND4469066720221118030645.0120529e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446906672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-012-1077-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, L.13aTherole of environmental parameters in the structure of phytoplankton assemblages and cyanobacteria toxins in two hypereutrophic lakes  ap. 255-268.  a2019-12-06  aWe evaluated the variability of cyanotoxins, water chemistry, and cyanobacteria communities in two hypereutrophic drowned river mouth lakes (Spring Lake and Mona Lake; summer 2006) in west Michigan, USA. Even with considerable geographical and watershed similarity, local variations in nutrient concentrations and environmental factors were found to influence the differences observed in cyanobacteria assemblages and cyanotoxins levels between the two lakes. Limnothrix sp. dominated the phytoplankton community in Spring Lake (82% of biovolume) and was negatively correlated with total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. Although Spring Lake was treated with alum during the previous year, Limnothrix sp. was able to bloom in the lower P environment. In contrast, the N2-fixing cyanobacterium, Anabaena flos-aquae, dominated the phytoplankton in Mona Lake (64% of biovolume). N2-fixing cyanobacteria dominance in Mona Lake was correlated with higher TP lower dissolved nitrogen levels. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was found in both systems; however, the toxin-producing polyketide synthetase gene was not present in either population. The higher TP in Mona Lake appeared to account for the 3-fold increase in cyanobacteria biovolume. Restoration plans for both lakes should include assessments of internal loading and continued phytoplankton monitoring to track the temporal distribution of cyanobacteria species and cyanotoxin concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3anutrient content 3aphytoplankton 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aalum 3aCylindrospermopsis raciborskii 3anitrogen 3acyanobacterial toxins 3aenvironmental factors 3awatersheds 3agenes 3aAnabaena flos-aquae 3asummer 3ahydrochemistry 3abiogeography 3aphosphorus 3aMichigan 0aCyanobacterium1 aRediske, R.

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) also known as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is the best available tool to detect copy number variations in chromosomal make up. We have optimized several different protocols and introduce a high-throughput approach to perform a cost-effective, fast, high-throughput and high-quality CMA. We managed to reach to high quality arrays with 17±0.04 (mean±SD, n=90) Derivative Log Ratio (DLR) spread, a measure of array quality (<0.20 considered as excellent) for our arrays. High-throughput and high-quality arrays are gaining more attention and the current manuscript is a step forward to this increasing demand.•This manuscript introduces a low cost, fast, efficient, high throughput and high-quality aCGH protocol;•This protocol provides specific instructions and crucial detail for processing up to 24 slides which is equal to 48, 96, or 192 arrays by only one person in one day;•This manuscript is accompanied with a step-by-step video.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomparative genomic hybridization 3acopy number variation 3acost effectiveness 3amicroarray technology 3apoint mutation 3aprotocols 0aA high throughput approach chromosomal microarray analysis or comparative genomic hybridization method 0aCopy number variants 0aComparative genomic hybridization 0aChromosomal microarray analysis1 aGelowani, Violet1 aBeaudet, Arthur L.0 tMethodsX.g2016, v. 3 p.8-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2015.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002000117040001800137100002400155245009500179300001300274520141200287592002801699650001001727650002301737650001101760650001601771650002001787650001401807650000901821650001801830653002001848653001601868653002301884653001001907653001801917653001901935653002301954653001601977700002301993700002502016773011102041856006902152852000902221655001202230IND60597637120221120072313.0180625e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059763712DNAL7 a10.3119/16-152doi4 arhod-119-977-07  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanglois, Annabelle12aA simple germination protocol for ex situ propagation of the endangered Carex lupuliformis  ap. 1-15.  aPlant reintroductions have become an important component of species recovery strategies. To favor establishment and survival rates of reintroduced specimens, the use of mature individuals is often recommended. Producing individuals from seed can be challenging, because little is known about the germination requirements of many endangered species. Here, we investigated whether Carex lupuliformis achenes can be germinated at high rates under semi-controlled ex situ conditions. More specifically, we aimed to determine which simple stratification technique allows higher/faster germination rates, whether scarification speeds up the germination process, and which light intensity allows higher/faster germination rates. We found that a brief cold-wet stratification (one month in wet sand) increases the likelihood that C. lupuliformis achenes will germinate, but that a similar germination rate can be obtained by storing achenes at 4°C for six months in a plastic bag. Although scarification did not affect final germination rates, scarified achenes germinated significantly faster than unscarified ones. Finally, we found that a light intensity of 25% resulted in significantly higher final germination rates than lower light intensities. In conclusion, our experiments showed that C. lupuliformis is easy to propagate ex situ, as a variety of treatments resulted in relatively high germination rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex 3aendangered species 3afruits 3agermination 3alight intensity 3aprotocols 3asand 3asurvival rate 0aFalse hop sedge 0agermination 0aendangered species 0alight 0ascarification 0astratification 0aCarex lupuliformis 0apropagation1 aLetendre, Jacinthe1 aPellerin, Stéphanie0 tRhodora.g2017 Jan., v. 119, no. 977 p.1-15dNew England Botanical ClubwJournal:jnl44709x0035-49027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3119/16-153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245005000173300001300223520245000236592002802686650002302714650001202737650001702749650000902766650001602775650001002791650001302801650002402814650001102838650001302849650001402862650000702876650001502883650001902898650001302917650002302930650001402953650002002967650001202987651001802999653001803017653002303035653002203058653001403080653001603094653001603110700002003126700002403146700002303170773009903193856008503292852000903377655001203386IND60565274920221123035232.0190412e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056527492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2017.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, Nelson,10aComplexity of lakes in a latitudinal gradient  ap. 1-20.  aMeasuring complexity is fast becoming a key instrument to compare different ecosystems at various scales in ecology. To date there has been little agreement on how to properly describe complexity in terms of ecology. In this regard, this manuscript assesses the significance of using a set of proposed measures based on information theory. These measures are as follows: emergence, self-organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used in the data analysis with the aim to apply these proposed measures. This study systematically reviews the data previously collected and generated by a model carried out on four aquatic ecosystems located between the Arctic region and the tropical zone. Thus, this research discusses the case of exploring a high level of self-organization in terms of movement, distribution, and quality of water between the northern temperate zone and the tropics. Moreover, it was assessed the significance of the presence of a complex variable (pH) in the middle of the latitudinal transect. Similarly, this study explores the relationship between self-organization and limiting nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicates). Furthermore, the importance of how a biomass subsystem is affected by seasonal variations is highlighted in this manuscript. This case study seeks to examine the changing nature of how seasonality affects the complexity dynamics of photosynthetic taxa (lakes located in northern temperate zone) at high latitudes, and it also investigates how a high level of self-organization at the tropical zone can lead to increase the amount of planktonic and benthic fish which determines the dynamics of complexity. This research also compares the emerging role of how a biomass subsystem has a highest temporal dynamics compared to he limiting nutrients’ subsystem. In the same way, the results associated to autopoiesis reflect a moderate degree of autonomy of photosynthetic biomass.It is also discussed the case of how complexity values change in the middle of the latitudinal gradient for all components. Finally, a comparison with Tsallis information was carried out in order to determine that these proposed measures are more suitable due to they are independent of any other parameter. Thus, this approach considers some elements closely related to information theory which determine and better describe ecological dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiomass 3acase studies 3afish 3ahomeostasis 3alakes 3alatitude 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aplankton 3aseasonal variation 3asilicates 3atemperate zones 3atropics 3aArctic region 0aBiocomplexity 0aInformation theory 0aSelf-organization 0aEmergence 0aHomeostasis 0aAutopoiesis1 aAguilar, José,1 aPiña-García, C.A.1 aGershenson, Carlos0 tEcological complexity.g2017 Sept., v. 31 p.1-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2017.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245012000209520093900329592002801268650002001296650002101316650001201337650001901349650001201368650000901380650002001389651002201409653002701431653001801458653001901476653001601495700002201511700002701533773010001560856008701660852000901747655001201756IND60698359520221119052301.0200809e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069835952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1272672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilatou, Niki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3593-153710aMercury concentrations in reared Atlantic bluefin tuna and risk assessment for the consumers: To eat or not to eat?  aThis study determines the levels of total mercury in muscle tissue from 268 reared Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean Sea, detects variations on mercury concentrations in relation to biological parameters and rearing period and evaluates the health risk posed by fish consumption taking into consideration the size, age and rearing period.

A high performance multi-input multi-output feedback controller has been developed to minimize SOFC spatial temperature variations during changes in power demands for different flow patterns. Numerical results show that the controller would result in negligible temperature variations for the modified cross-flow arrangement proposed here, even for large changes in the power drawn. The combination of a high performance controller and design modification results in a more uniform temperature profile at steady state nominal conditions, and modest variations in temperature profile, from the nominal, for ±15% change in power. Similarly, non-uniform air flow rate decreases the temperature gradient as well as maximum temperature across the cell, though its effect is less pronounced in the closed loop response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3afuel cells 3ageometry 3amodels 3atemperature profiles 0aCross-flow SOFC 0aThermal control 0aChannel flow reversal 0aNonuniform air flow1 aMcLarty, Dustin F.1 aJabbari, Faryar0 tApplied energy.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 178 p.43-55dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111024002000148040001800168072000900186100001400195245013200209300001800341500002400359520172400383650002002107650001902127650001702146650001602163650002002179650001802199650001002217650002702227650001302254650002702267650002002294650001302314650002902327650001202356650004202368650001102410650001502421650000902436650006402445650001702509650001202526650002402538651002102562700002002583700001602603700001502619700001602634773012602650852000902776856008702785856011102872930003302983945002503016946001303041961001303054655001203067IND4366668120221119142621.0050118e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436666812DNAL7 a156667412pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-97.6.18912doi7 a10113/86832hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aBloem, S.10aEffect of rearing strategy and gamma radiation on field competitiveness of mass-reared codling moths (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)  ap. 1891-1898.  aIncludes references  aWe compared the field competitiveness of sterile codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), males mass-reared through diapause or standard production protocols and treated with either 150 or 250 Gy of gamma radiation. Evaluations were performed during spring and summer 2003 by using field release-recapture tests. Released males were recaptured using traps baited with synthetic pheromone or with virgin females. In addition, mating tables baited with virgin females were used in the summer to assess the mating competitiveness of the released moths. Field performance of released males was significantly improved by rearing through diapause and by lowering the dose of radiation used to treat the insects. These effects were observed during spring when evening temperatures were relatively cool and in summer when evening temperatures were high. These effects were observed regardless of the sampling method (i.e., capture in pheromone-baited traps, virgin female-baited traps, or in mating tables). There were significant interactions between larval rearing strategy and radiation dose with respect to day of recapture. The effect of rearing strategy on male performance was observed immediately after release, whereas the effect of dose of radiation was usually delayed by 2-3 d. In general, the best treatment for improving codling moth male field performance was a combination of rearing through diapause and using a low dose of radiation (150 Gy). The difference in performance when insects were treated with 150 or 250 Gy was greater when males had been reared using standard (nondiapause) rearing protocols, suggesting that diapause rearing may attenuate some of the negative effects of the higher doses of radiation. 3aCydia pomonella 3ainsect rearing 3amass rearing 3airradiation 3agamma radiation 3adose response 3amales 3amating competitiveness 3adiapause 3amark-recapture studies 3apheromone traps 3atrapping 3asterile insect technique 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aFemale 2aGamma Rays 2aMale 2aMothsxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aReproduction 2aSeasons 2aSex Characteristics 3aBritish Columbia1 aCarpenter, J.E.1 aBloem, K.A.1 aTomlin, L.1 aTaggart, S.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2004 Dec., v.  97, no.  6 p.1891-1898dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-97.6.18913Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/86833Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071226b20080102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/02/08  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03255naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245008000167300001600247520215100263592002802414650002402442650001602466650001302482650001602495650001202511650001902523650001602542650001102558650001802569650000702587650001502594650000902609650001602618650001302634650001602647651001802663773010702681856004802788852000902836655001202845IND4456839220221119115714.0121003e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445683922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-010-0576-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoux, Nicholas T.10aSimulating the Stability of Colloidal Amorphous Iron Oxide in Natural Water  ap. 157-172.  aConsiderable uncertainty exists as to whether existing thermodynamic equilibrium solid/water partitioning paradigms can be used to assess the mobility of insoluble manufactured nanomaterials in the aquatic environment. In this work, the traditional Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory of colloidal particle stability was examined by using three published expressions for estimating critical coagulation concentrations (CCCs; i.e., the minimum ionic strength needed to induce rapid self-aggregation) via incorporation of diffuse-layer potential estimates obtained from MINTEQA2 geochemical model implementations of an enhanced version of the MIT diffuse-layer model (DLM) and the historical triple-layer model (TLM). Amorphous iron oxide was selected as a test colloid in this assessment and its electrostatic properties were simulated over a pH range of 4 to 10 in 0.7 M seawater, 0.1 M diluted seawater, world average river water, US continental average groundwater and Midwestern US 50th percentile rainwater. Findings from the study included: (1) sources of variation in predictions of the onset of rapid colloidal particle self-aggregation were observed to occur in the following order: aquatic chemistry > selection of DLM vs. TLM diffuse-layer potentials > uncertainties in the Hamaker constant > selection of CCC equation ≈ the distance to the plane of shear (with the DLM), (2) the magnitude of the DLM diffuse-layer potential estimates exceeded that of the TLM estimates, (3) TLM diffuse-layer potential estimates were consistent with a conjecture by Loux and Anderson, Colloids and Surfaces A, 177, 123–131, (2001) that the magnitude of environmental interfacial potentials were likely to be less than RT/F (~25 mV) and DLM estimates were not, and (4) TLM estimates predict that amorphous iron oxide suspensions are likely to be relatively stable only in high pH rainwater; DLM estimates predict relative colloidal iron oxide suspension stability in rainwater and extreme pH river waters. These predictions of rapid aggregation are at least qualitatively in accord with data published in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3acoagulation 3acolloids 3agroundwater 3ahistory 3aionic strength 3airon oxides 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3apH 3aprediction 3arain 3ariver water 3aseawater 3auncertainty 3aUnited States0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2011 May, v. 217, no. 1-4 p.157-172dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0576-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245013400176520191700310592002802227650002202255650001902277650002402296650001602320650001102336650001902347650001302366650001502379650002002394650001602414650001202430650001502442650002102457650001502478650001302493650001302506650002202519650001502541650002002556650001502576650000902591651001002600653001902610653001902629653002702648653001202675653001802687653002502705700001702730700002202747700002902769700002102798700002102819700001902840773012502859856008302984852000903067655001203076IND60791350820221119220209.0221004e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079135082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2022.1081532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Quezada, Jorge F.10aHow do land cover changes affect carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus stocks and the greenhouse gas budget of ecosystems in southern Chile?  aAgricultural land use changes are expected to modify the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks compared to the native ecosystems they replace and result in changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. To quantify these effects, we measured C-N-P stocks in four land cover classes (cropland, grassland, native shrubland and invaded shrubland) together with their ecosystem-level CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O fluxes for one year using the closed-chamber technique, in three locations on Chiloé Island, southern Chile. As a reference, given that most of the original ecosystems were derived from forest clearance, we monitored CO₂ fluxes in a native forest site in the same area using the eddy covariance technique, and used published data of its C-N-P stocks and CH₄ and N₂O fluxes. We found that compared to the forest, the other land cover classes represented a 60 % loss of total ecosystem C, which was explained mainly by the loss of 98 % in above ground biomass and a 42 % reduction in soil C, but with a relatively unchanged N stock and an increase in soil P. While croplands were net GHG emitters (901 g CO₂-eq m⁻² year⁻¹), grasslands, native shrublands and invaded shrublands were net sinks (−1350, −1154 and −2088 g CO₂-eq m⁻² year⁻¹, respectively). The invaded shrublands (invaded by the N-fixing species Ulex europaeus and Cytisus scoparius) showed higher aboveground and root biomass compared to the other land cover classes, but somewhat lower C-N-P soil stocks, possibly because of lower litter decomposition, reduced root turnover/rhizodeposition and/or greater dissolved elemental losses, as the invasion occurred on degraded lands. Although the invasive shrublands acted as a stronger GHG sink, driven by their higher CO₂ fixation, this might change in the longer term through the additional accumulation of fixed N, with a potential increase in N₂O emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCytisus scoparius 3aUlex europaeus 3aaboveground biomass 3aagriculture 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acropland 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aenvironment 3aforests 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse gases 3aland cover 3aland use 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aphosphorus 3arhizodeposition 3ashrublands 3asoil 3aChile 0aAgroecosystems 0aCarbon dioxide 0aInvasive alien species 0aMethane 0aNitrous oxide 0aTemperate rainforest1 aCano, Silvia1 aIbaceta, Patricia1 aAguilera-Riquelme, David1 aSalazar, Osvaldo1 aFuentes, Juan P.1 aOsborne, Bruce0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 340 p.108153-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.1081533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011600204300001600320520109000336592002801426596005101454596009101505596007101596650002101667650001601688650001101704650002101715650001401736650001201750650001301762650003001775650002101805650001401826650001601840650002001856650003801876650002901914650001401943653002801957653002301985653002302008653003102031653002402062653003802086700001702124700001802141700001902159773015002178856008102328852000902409655001202418IND60687511520221121061325.0200401e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068751152DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-07-19-0187-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Wenyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1824-230210aAmino Acid Polymorphism in Succinate Dehydrogenase Subunit C Involved in Biological Fitness of Botrytis cinerea  ap. 580-589.  aSuccinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is an important respiratory enzyme which participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. A previous study of the baseline sensitivity of Botrytis cinerea against SDH inhibitors (SDHIs) showed that intrinsic sensitivity of the small population against the SDHIs exhibited significant differences. In the sequencing assay, we found five kinds of amino acid polymorphism in SDH subunit C (SdhC) of B. cinerea isolates which were never exposed to the SDHIs. To validate that amino acid polymorphism in the SdhC of B. cinerea confers intrinsic sensitivity against the SDHIs, the replacement mutants containing each kind of amino acid polymorphism of SdhC exhibited phenotype differences in intrinsic sensitivity to SDHIs, mycelial growth, sporulation, virulence, oxidative stress response, and carbon source utilization. These results indicated that SdhC of B. cinerea experienced positive selection during evolution and resulted in amino acid polymorphism which is involved in intrinsic sensitivity to SDHIs and biological fitness.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672065cNational Science Foundation of China  a201303023a201303025cSpecial Fund for Agro-Scientific Research in the Public Interest  aCX (14)2054aSXGC (2016)154cJiangsu Provincial Agricultural Plans 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aamino acids 3acarbon 3acarboxylic acids 3aevolution 3amutants 3amycelium 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3asporulation 3astress response 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3avirulence 0aamino acid polymorphism 0abiological fitness 0afungal development 0aplant antifungal responses 0apopulation genetics 0asuccinate dehydrogenase subunit C1 aSun, Jingtao1 aZhang, Xiaoke1 aChen, Changjun0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2020 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.580-589dMolecular Plant-Microbe InteractionswJournal:jnl43555x1943-77067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-07-19-0187-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01556naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245005500166300001600221520066500237592002800902650001000930650002000940650001400960650001300974650001000987650001700997650001801014650001601032773010301048856008201151852000901233655001201242IND4469743020221118030828.0141111e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446974302DNAL7 a10.1053/j.jepm.2012.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoset, Kimberly10aClinical Technique: Tube Feeding the Avian Patient  ap. 149-157.  aVeterinarians face many challenges when an avian patient is hospitalized for a prolonged period of time. Debilitated birds are often anorexic, which can quickly lead to severe weight loss and further deterioration of their clinical condition. For these patients, tube feeding becomes an essential part of a complete treatment plan. However, prolonged handling can amplify stress in these birds and a rapid delivery of nutrients is required as part of a treatment plan. To maximize the success of this treatment, a thorough knowledge of general avian restraint and the tube feeding process is necessary for the medical team responsible for treating the patient.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3afeed processing 3anutrients 3apatients 3ateams 3atube feeding 3aveterinarians 3aweight loss0 tJournal of exotic pet medicine.g2012 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.149-157dElsevier Inc.x1557-50637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2012.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006200188245012900250300001600379506007600395520137900471592002801850506003701878650001501915650002601930650002001956650002001976650003901996650002002035650001302055650001302068653000802081653001202089653000802101653005802109653002202167653001302189653001902202653003002221653001102251700002302262700002102285700002002306700002002326700002002346700002002366700002802386700001702414700002502431700002002456773008302476856008102559852000902640655001202649IND60555161020221207073602.0180905s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055516102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2015.11.0072doi7 aPMC47035852pmcid7 a268442122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugiyama, Yasunori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0520-301310aExpression and phosphorylation state analysis of intracellular protein kinases using Multi-PK antibody and Phos-tag SDS-PAGE  ap. 469-474.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein kinase expression and activity play important roles in diverse cellular functions through regulation of phosphorylation signaling. The most commonly used tools for detecting the protein kinase are protein kinase-specific antibodies, and phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were used for detecting activated protein kinase. Using these antibodies, only one kinase was analyzed at a time, however, a method for analyzing the expression and activation of a panel of protein kinases in cells is not established. Therefore, we developed a combined method using Multi-PK antibody and Phos-tag SDS-PAGE for profiling the expression and phosphorylation state of intracellular protein kinases. Using the new method, changes in the expression and phosphorylation state of various protein kinases were detected in cells treated with anticancer agent which inhibit multiple tyrosine kinase activities. Therefore, the new method is a useful technique for analysis of intracellular protein kinases.•Multi-PK antibody recognizes a wide variety of protein kinases in various species.•Using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, phosphorylated proteins are visualized as slower migration bands compared with corresponding non-phosphorylated proteins.•This combined method can be used for detecting changes in the expression and phosphorylation state of various intracellular protein kinases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3aantineoplastic agents 3aenzyme activity 3aphosphorylation 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein kinases 3aproteins 3atyrosine 0aErk 0aλPPase 0aPKA 0aKinase expression and phosphorylation state profiling 0aMulti-PK antibody 0aPhos-tag 0aProtein kinase 0aPhosphorylation Signaling 0aKinome1 aKatayama, Syouichi1 aKameshita, Isamu1 aMorisawa, Keiko1 aHiguchi, Takuma1 aTodaka, Hiroshi1 aKinoshita, Eiji1 aKinoshita-Kikuta, Emiko1 aKoike, Tohru1 aTaniguchi, Taketoshi1 aSakamoto, Shuji0 tMethodsX.g2015, v. 2 p.469-474dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245010300201300001600304520157900320592002801899596004501927596005901972596006802031596009502099596007102194650002302265650001802288650001302306650001402319650002302333650001002356650004202366650002102408650002302429650001302452650002102465650001402486650000702500650001402507650002002521650001602541650001602557650000902573650001802582653001302600653001202613653003402625700001402659700001502673700001702688700002902705700001202734700005502746773015002801856008102951852000903032655001203041IND60687511620221121061310.0200401e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068751162DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-07-19-0198-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Zechen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9697-023310aNitrate Stabilizes the Rhizospheric Fungal Community to Suppress Fusarium Wilt Disease in Cucumber  ap. 590-599.  aNitrogen forms can regulate soil-borne Fusarium wilt suppression, but the related mechanisms are largely unknown, especially possible action via the rhizospheric microbial community. Soil analysis, MiSeq high-throughput sequencing analysis, community diversity, and network analysis were used to characterize the impact of different nitrogen forms (nitrate and ammonium) on rhizospheric fungal communities and the contribution of nitrate to the suppression to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum compared with ammonium. Nitrate-grown cucumber showed a lower disease index and F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum abundance in the rhizosphere. In comparisons with ammonium nutrients, nitrate-fed plants maintained a higher soil rhizosphere pH, microbial biomass carbon content, microbial biomass nitrogen content, as well as fungal community richness and diversity following F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum incubation. All these factors were negatively related with disease index. Network analysis showed fewer nodes and edges in the ammonium treatments compared with nitrate treatments. The relative abundance of Pathotroph-Saprotroph, Pathotroph-Saprotroph-Symbiotroph, and Saprotroph fungi explained 82% of the variability of rhizosphere F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum abundance. In conclusion, after pathogen inoculation under nitrate nutrition, the less-affected microbial composition, community diversity, and community internal relations, which resulted from the more diverse and robust microbial population, potentially contributed to greater Fusarium wilt suppression.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0200300cNational Key R&D Program  a2015CB150505cNational Basic Research Program of China  a2018QNRC001cYoung Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST  aIRT_17R56cInnovative Research Team Development Plan of the Ministry of Education of China  aKYT201802cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3aammonium 3acucumbers 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobial carbon 3amicrobial nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3apH 3apathogens 3aplant nutrition 3arhizosphere 3asaprotrophs 3asoil 3asoil analysis 0acucumber 0anitrate 0arhizospheric fungal community1 aWang, Min1 aWang, Ying1 aZhu, Linxing1 aMur, Luis Alejandro Jose1 aHu, Jun1 aGuo, Shiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4154-27810 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2020 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.590-599dMolecular Plant-Microbe InteractionswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-07-19-0198-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245010700161520100600268592002801274653001801302653003101320653002301351653002501374653001501399700001501414700020501429700021001634700021101844700020902055773010902264856008402373852000902457655001202466IND60675682820221120102452.0191121e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067568282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2019.1003482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Hui10aEfficient phosphate removal from wastewater by MgAl-LDHs modified hydrochar derived from tobacco stalk  aThe MgAl-LDHs modified hydrochar composite was prepared through carbonization of tobacco stalk (TS) feedstock under hydrothermal conditions. Physical and chemical properties of the resultant composite were analyzed. Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that the adsorption could be completed within 1 h and the prepared composite possessed remarkably higher P adsorption capacity than the raw tobacco stalk. The experimental data obtained from kinetic and isotherm study more accurately agreed with the pseudo-second-order equation and the Freundlich model (R2 > 0.99), respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated from the Langmuir model were 30.69, 31.42 and 41.16 mg P/g at 25, 35 and 45 °C, respectively. Mechanism analysis revealed that ion exchange, ligand exchange and electrostatic attraction contributed to the process. Results from this work indicate that TS-LDHs composite could be a promising and novel carbon-based phosphate adsorbent for wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTobacco stalk 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aMg/Al modification 0aPhosphate adsorption 0aWastewater1 aZhang, Nan1 aChen, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6924-8379 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6924-8379 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6924-8379 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6924-8379 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6924-83791 aLei, Zhongfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0479-6179 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0479-6179 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0479-6179 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0479-6179 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0479-61791 aShimizu, Kazuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8274-0410 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8274-0410 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8274-0410 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8274-0410 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8274-04101 aZhang, Zhenya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2554-6168 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2554-6168 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2554-6168 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2554-6168 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2554-61680 tBioresource technology reports.g2019 Dec., v. 8 p.100348-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2019.1003483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012100157300001800278520152600296592002801822650002301850650002101873650002801894650001501922650001001937650001701947650001001964650001901974650001701993650001702010700001602027700001902043700001402062700001302076700001602089700001502105700001902120700001302139700001502152773013102167856007502298852000902373655001202382IND60785795420221118065806.0220728e20220726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078579542DNAL7 a10.1039/d2bm00480a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yujie10aCell-derived extracellular vesicles for CRISPR/Cas9 delivery: engineering strategies for cargo packaging and loading  ap. 4095-4106.  aGenome editing technology has emerged as a potential therapeutic tool for treating incurable diseases. In particular, the discovery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas systems and the design of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) have revolutionized genome editing applications. Unfortunately, compared with the rapid development of gene-editing tools, the progress in the development of delivery technologies is lagging behind and thus limiting the clinical application of genome editing. To overcome these limitations, researchers have investigated various delivery systems, including viral and non-viral vectors for delivering CRISPR/Cas and sgRNA complexes. As natural endogenous nanocarriers, extracellular vesicles (EVs) present advantages of biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, stability, and high permeability, making them one of the most promising drug delivery vehicles. This review provides an overview of the fundamental mechanisms of EVs from the aspects of biogenesis, trafficking, cargo delivery, and function as nanotherapeutic agents. We also summarize the latest trends in EV-based CRISPR/Cas delivery systems and discuss the prospects for future development. In particular, we put our emphasis on the state-of-the-art engineering strategies to realize efficient cargo packaging and loading. Altogether, EVs hold promise in bridging genome editing in the laboratory and clinical applications of gene therapies by providing a safe, effective, and targeted delivery vehicle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abiogenesis 3adrugs 3agene editing 3agenes 3aimmunogenicity 3ananocarriers 3apermeability1 aIqbal, Zoya1 aWang, Jianhong1 aXu, Limei1 aXu, Xiao1 aOuyang, Kan1 aZhang, Hao1 aLü, Jianping,1 aDuan, Li1 aXia, Jiang0 tBiomaterials science.g2022 July 26, v. 10, no. 15 p.4095-4106dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2bm00480a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010600162300001800268520053500286592002800821650001200849650002300861650002300884650001100907650001200918650001100930650001400941650002200955650002000977650000900997700002301006700002501029700002301054700001801077700005701095700005801152773013301210856007901343852000901422655001201431IND60604723020180906000000.0180717e20180321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060472302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b005512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJerome-Paul,10aCo(I)-Catalyzed [3 + 2] Annulation of o-Haloaryl Imines with Alkenes for the Synthesis of Indanamines  ap. 4078-4086.  aThe use of a CoBr₂/1,10-phenanthroline catalytic system together with Zn as the reductant was developed to prepare diversely substituted indanamines by a Co(I)-catalyzed [3 + 2] annulation of o-haloaryl imines with electron-deficient alkenes in good yields.

When gly²⁶⁸ in rabbit muscle-specific creatine kinase was substituted with asn²⁶⁸ as found in carp M1-CK, the rabbit muscle-specific CK G286N mutant specific activity at pH 8.0 and 10°C was more than 2-fold higher than that in the wild-type rabbit enzyme. Kinetic studies showed that Kₘ values of the rabbit CK G268N mutant were similar to those of the wild-type rabbit enzyme, yet circular dichroism spectra showed that the overall secondary structures of the mutant enzyme, at pH 8.0 and 5°C, were almost identical to the carp M1-CK enzyme. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the mutant enzyme crystal revealed that amino acid residues involved in substrate binding are closer to one another than in the rabbit enzyme, and the cysteine283 active site of the mutant enzyme points away from the ADP binding site. At pH 7.4–8.0 and 35–10°C, with a smaller substrate, dADP, specific activities of the mutant enzyme were consistently higher than the wild-type rabbit enzyme and more similar to the carp M1-CK enzyme.

The resulting exo-dienes were then subjected to a second one-pot tandem process involving a highly regioselective Diels–Alder reaction with alkynes, quinones or nitriles and a subsequent oxidation step to give a diverse library of C-1 amino-substituted indanes and tetralins in good overall yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aalkynes 3achemical structure 3anitriles 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxidation 3aquinones 3aregioselectivity 3aruthenium1 aFarrugia, Louis J.,1 aSutherland, Andrew0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 July 19, v. 78, no. 14 p.7199-7207dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo401182r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013800167520171100305592002802016650002802044650001402072650002002086650001102106650001202117650001902129650001102148651002502159653002402184653001502208653003302223653002502256653001802281653001302299700006002312700005402372700005202426700002202478700002302500700002002523700002502543700002202568700002002590773009602610856008702706852000902793655001202802IND60742312020221116205922.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074231202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1083132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaha, Sadi10aMeasuring management practices impact on hygiene practices of food handlers: The mediating role of commitment and training perception  aThe purpose of the study was to assess i) communication, employee involvement, commitment, training perception, and hygiene practices of food handlers working in restaurants in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and ii) impact of management practices through communication and employee involvement on food handler commitment and food safety training perception and eventually on hygiene practices. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted via reliable and validated questionnaire to collect data from food handlers (n = 995) working in restaurants (n = 317) in Dubai (UAE). Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, T-test, one-way ANOVA test and structural equation modeling were conducted. The proposed hypotheses were tested through SEM. The results (agree response percentages) depicted that food handlers had a good (>70%) commitment (80.3%), hygiene practices (77.8%), and employee involvement (71.3%), whereas communication (69.8%) and training perception (67.6%) were found to be moderate (<70%). The results also showed that employee communication and involvement positively (P˂0.05) affected employee commitment and food safety training perception. Employee commitment and training perception of food safety positively (P˂0.05) affected the hygiene practices of the food handlers. The relationship between hygiene practices and management practices is mediated partially by food handler commitment and the food safety training perception. The findings of this research could be helpful for food safety practitioners in the private and governmental sectors to concentrate more on human aspects of their work management in order to enhance the food handler attitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-sectional studies 3aequations 3afactor analysis 3ahumans 3ahygiene 3aquestionnaires 3at-test 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aFood establishments 0aManagement 0aStructural equation modeling 0aEmployee involvement 0aCommunication 0aMediator1 aOsaili, Tareq M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6166-13881 aVij, Mohit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2351-70401 aVij, Anu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4911-80451 aAlhogaraty, Eslam1 aAL-Utaibi, Ghassan1 aAlbloush, Ahmad1 aNassoura, Abdelrahim1 aBohra, Om Prakash1 aAltaher, Sultan0 tFood control.g2021 Dec., v. 130 p.108313-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1083133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009000166520128300256592002801539650001301567650001601580650001401596650001601610650002201626650001101648650001701659650001301676651001901689653001801708653002601726653002301752653002001775773010501795856008601900852000901986655001201995IND60745064220221120100251.0211123e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074506422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1266772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hua10aCharacterization of a multi-layer karst aquifer through analysis of tidal fluctuation  aInteraction between ocean tides and coastal aquifers is an important process influencing the quality and quantity of groundwater resources. In this study, high frequency groundwater fluctuation along two transects from the Gulf of Mexico to the Upper Floridan Aquifer (UFA) were analyzed to characterize the hydrogeologic structure of the multi-layer karst aquifer. Tidal efficiency and time lag of harmonic constants were calculated from groundwater and seawater level and aquifer diffusivity were estimated using the Jacob-Ferris equation. Measurable tidal signals were observed at a maximum inland distance of approximately 7–8 km due to the high conductivity of the unconfined karst aquifer. The largest tidal fluctuation was observed in the deeper unit of the aquifer (146–155 m below land surface), which indicate the hydraulic contact between seawater and the high permeability zone of Avon Park Formation. The estimated values of hydraulic diffusivities agreed well with the regional groundwater flow model despite the highly heterogeneous nature of karst aquifer. Our analysis suggested that tidal springs are important sea water/groundwater interfaces and the conduit networks of tidal creeks, caves, and fractures are preferential pathways of tidal propagation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3akarsts 3apermeability 3aseawater 3aGulf of Mexico 0aKarst aquifer 0aJacob-Ferris equation 0aTidal fluctuations 0aCoastal springs0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Oct., v. 601 p.126677-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1266773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012100156300001600277500002000293520098200313592002801295596002501323596005501348650001001403650000901413650001701422650001101439650002001450650003501470650001101505700002901516700002001545700001501565700001601580773011501596856007301711852000901784655001201793IND60620598520221123030544.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062059852DNAL7 a10.1111/age.127152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWypchło, M.10aPolymorphisms in selected genes and analysis of their relationship with osteochondrosis in Polish sport horse breeds  ap. 623-627.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this research was to evaluate the polymorphisms of selected genes and to find their potential effect on the occurrence of osteochondrosis in Polish Warmbloods (sport horse breeds). The study was conducted on a group of 198 horses subjected to official performance tests. Investigated joints—fetlock, hock and stifle—were X‐rayed twice, once before and again at the end of the tests (first and second examination), and on this basis the degree of disease was evaluated. Based on the results of previous research, 13 candidate genes potentially associated with the occurrence of osteochondrosis were selected and, among them, 32 polymorphisms were tested. Seven SNPs located in the MATN1, CPVL, HYAL1, XIRP2, FRZB, COL5A2 and IGF1 genes were found to be associated with occurrence of osteochondrotic lesions in different joints. These intragenic polymorphisms seem to provide valuable information about the genetic basis of osteochondrosis in sport horse breeds.  aPublisher supplied data  aN R12 0037 06cNCBiR  a2011/01/B/NZ2/00893cNational Science Centre (NCN) 3agenes 3ahock 3ahorse breeds 3ahorses 3aosteochondrosis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asports1 aKorwin‐Kossakowska, A.1 aBereznowski, A.1 aHecold, M.1 aLewczuk, D.0 tAnimal genetics.g2018 Dec., v. 49, no. 6 p.623-627dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl38565x0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.127153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245010800175300001600283520215800299592002802457650002002485650000902505650001302514650001502527650002002542650001002562650001402572650002102586650001602607650002502623651001002648651001302658700001902671700002502690700002102715700002902736700002802765700001902793773011802812856008302930852000903013655001203022IND60755053520221120154057.0211029e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075505352DNAL7 a10.1007/s13225-021-00492-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTennakoon, Danushka S.10aBiphasic taxonomic approaches for generic relatedness and phylogenetic relationships of Teichosporaceae  ap. 199-241.  aThe placement of the dothideomycetous family Teichosporaceae has been controversial. Recent phylogenetic investigations have used a taxonomic lumping approach with the Floricolaceae and its genera have been synonymized under the earlier family name, Teichosporaceae. Intergeneric relationships were therefore obscure and proper generic delimitation was needed in upcoming studies. We here taxonomically revised the family Teichosporaceae based on both morphological and phylogenetic evidence. Teichosporaceae species have immersed or semi-immersed, erumpent to superficial, ostiolate ascomata, cellular or trabeculate pseudoparaphyses, cylindrical to oblong or sub-clavate asci and ellipsoid to oblong or fusiform, cylindric-fusiform or oblong to elliptical, ovoid to clavate, symmetric or asymmetric, initially hyaline or pale brown to dark brown or yellowish brown, 1–3-septate or muriform ascospores. Asexual morphs are coelomycetous. Type or representative specimens of Teichosporaceae were loaned and fresh specimens were collected from China and Thailand. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of a combined ITS, LSU, SSU, tef1-α and rpb2 dataset were performed to clarify the phylogenetic affinities of taxa and examine monophyly of newly proposed genera. One new species (Floricola festucae), one new host record (Ramusculicola thailandica) and four new combinations (Aurantiascoma nephelii, A. quercus, Magnibotryascoma acaciae, M. melanommoides) are introduced. The broad genus concept of Teichospora is dismissed based on morphological dissimilarities and the monophyletic status of the proposed genera. We accept Asymmetrispora, Aurantiascoma, Floricola, Magnibotryascoma, Misturatosphaeria, Pseudoaurantiascoma, Pseudomisturatosphaeria, Ramusculicola and Teichospora as distinct genera in the Teichosporaceae. All recognized genera are phenotypically characterized and phylogenetically well-supported. The phylogenetic placements of three genera (Chaetomastia, Loculohypoxylon and Sinodidymella), which do not have molecular data cannot be conclusively clarified at present, but are still placed in Teichosporaceae for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aasci 3aascomata 3aascospores 3adata collection 3afungi 3amonophyly 3anew host records 3anew species 3astatistical analysis 3aChina 3aThailand1 aJeewon, Rajesh1 aThambugala, Kasun M.1 aGentekaki, Eleni1 aWanasinghe, Dhanushka N.1 aPromputtha, Itthayakorn1 aHyde, Kevin D.0 tFungal diversity.g2021 Sept., v. 110, no. 1 p.199-241dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000079x1560-27457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-021-00492-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245014700181520122700328592002801555650002201583650001401605650001501619650005001634650001701684650001301701650002601714653001001740653001801750653002101768653003801789700005801827700001701885700006601902700005601968773009102024856009002115852000902205655001202214IND60752437120221120224819.0220307e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075243712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1323942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSieira, Benigno José10aTransformation products of the high-volume production chemicals 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone and 2-piperazin-1-ylethanamine formed by UV photolysis  aThis work investigates the reaction of 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone (VP) and 2-piperazin-1-yletanamine (PPE) under UV radiation. Both substances are high-volume production chemicals (production >1000 tons/year) widely used in polymers, coatings and a wide array of applications, which have been classified as mobile chemicals and which can then lead to the formation of persistent and mobile transformation products (TPs). Thus, their reaction with UV light was studied by means of liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). Both compounds presented a high reactivity, the VP quantum yield was 0.28 mol/E; whereas, PPE had a quantum yield notably higher than 1 (16 mol/E). Five and 7 TPs were identified for VP and PPE, respectively. Some of them had been already reported in literature due to sunlight photodegradation or other oxidation processes, but most of them are reported here for the first time. Finally, the acute and chronical toxicity of precursors and TPs were estimated using two quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) software tools which led to some discrepancies in the estimations, pointing to the need for experimental toxicity assays for these compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aoxidation 3aphotolysis 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 0aPMOCs 0aPMT chemicals 0aPhotodegradation 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry1 aRodil, Rosario1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7100-723X1 aCela, Rafael1 aQuintana, José Benito1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2566-81331 aMontes, Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4154-35410 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 287 p.132394-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1323943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03962naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100005700158245008700215300001300302520237000315592002802685650001102713650001502724650001502739650001002754650000902764650001502773650001202788650001702800650001402817650001302831650000902844650001302853650002002866650001602886650002002902653000902922653000802931653002202939653002902961653002202990653002503012700001603037700001703053700002203070700001903092700001903111700001803130700006303148773009503211856009303306852000903399655001203408IND60756916420221120223620.0220103e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075691642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2021.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalchi, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0927-822010aIntrafollicular oocyte transfer (IFOT): Potential feasibility in the ovine species  ap. 7-13.  aIntra-follicular oocyte transfer (IFOT) is a promising and innovative technique for in vivo embryo production previously described for equines and bovines. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of IFOT in the ovine species. Two preliminary in vivo and in vitro trials were performed to test the optimal procedures and timing for IFOT. In the in vivo trial, follicular growth was monitored with transrectal ultrasonography in ten adult ewes to preliminarily determine the ovulation and ideal timing for IFOT. The in vitro trial assessed i) the optimal inner diameter of the injection needle and ii) the recovery rate and integrity of injected cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) after follicle aspiration. For IFOT and embryo collection, five ewes were synchronized by CIDR insertion. Forty hours after CIDR removal, in ewes under sedation and general anesthesia, the ovaries were exposed by laparotomy, and the preovulatory follicle was injected with COCs previously collected from ovaries obtained from an abattoir. At 4 h after surgery, fully recovered ewes were housed in a paddock with a ram of proven fertility. Crayon marking on ram's chest was used to detect mating. Ovulation was assessed 40 h after the transfer of oocytes by transrectal ultrasonography. On day 6 after IFOT, embryo collection was performed by uterine flushing. In the in vitro testing, injection of >5 mm follicles with a 28 G needle loaded with 30 COCs in a 5 μL volume resulted in higher recovery rates and better preservation of COCs integrity. In the in vivo trial, ultrasound scanning revealed that ovulation occurred between 60 and 72 h after CIDR removal in all animals. In one ewe subjected to IFOT, 22/24 oocytes were effectively injected into the preovulatory follicle, but no embryos were collected after flushing. In the remaining four animals, 85/102 oocytes were injected, and six cleaved embryos, 12 morulae and 1 blastocyst were collected, including native embryos. This preliminary investigation indicated that IFOT in ovine species resulted in ovulation, fimbrial capture, tubal transport of heterologous oocytes and in vivo embryo production. Further studies are needed to optimize the embryo recovery rate and develop less invasive techniques for oocyte injection and uterine flushing, such as through a laparoscopic or transcervical approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanesthesia 3ablastocyst 3achest 3aewes 3alaparotomy 3aoocytes 3aova transfer 3aovulation 3apastures 3arams 3asedation 3aslaughterhouses 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 0aIFOT 0aEwe 0aEmbryo production 0aCumulus-oocyte complexes 0aDominant follicle 0aFollicular injection1 aPivato, Ivo1 aLedda, Mauro1 aMelosu, Valentino1 aScanu, Antonio1 aPau, Salvatore1 aLedda, Sergio1 aZedda, Maria Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1504-82050 tTheriogenology.g2022 Feb., v. 179 p.7-13dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2021.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245011700168520166900285592002801954650002001982650001102002650001602013650001402029650001802043650001302061650001602074650001402090650001302104650001102117650001202128650001002140650000902150650001502159650002002174650002802194650001802222650001602240650001102256650001802267650002002285653000802305653001302313653001202326653002202338700001902360700001202379700001902391700001202410700001602422700001502438700001602453700001602469773009102485856009002576852000902666655001202675IND60752437220221120203746.0220307e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075243722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1323952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xuan10aEffects of glufosinate-ammonium on male reproductive health: Focus on epigenome and transcriptome in mouse sperm  aGlufosinate-ammonium (GLA) is a widely used herbicide with emerging concern over its neural and reproductive toxicity. To uncover potential effects of GLA on male reproductive health in mammals, adult male C57BL/6J mice were administered 0.2 mg/kg·d GLA for 5 weeks. After examination on fertility, testis histology and semen quality in the GLA group, we performed deep sequencing to identify repressive epigenetic marks including DNA methylation and histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3), together with mRNA transcript levels in sperm. Then, we integrated multi-omics sequencing data to comprehensively explore GLA-induced epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations. We found no significant difference either on fertility, testis histology or semen quality-related indicators. As for epigenome, the protein level of H3K27me3 was significantly increased in GLA sperm. Next generation sequencing showed alterations of these epigenetic marks and extensive transcription inhibition in sperm. These differential repressive marks were mainly distributed at intergenic regions and introns. According to results by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, both differentially methylated and expressed genes were mainly enriched in pathways related to synapse organization. Subtle differences in genomic imprinting were also observed between the two groups. These results suggested that GLA predominantly impaired sperm epigenome and transcriptome in mice, with little effect on fertility, testis histology or semen quality. Further studies on human sperm using similar strategies need to be conducted for a better understanding of the male reproductive toxicity of GLA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aadults 3aepigenetics 3aepigenome 3agene ontology 3agenomics 3aglufosinate 3ahistology 3ahistones 3ahumans 3aintrons 3amales 3amice 3amultiomics 3aprotein content 3areproductive toxicology 3asemen quality 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aGLA 0aH3K27me3 0aH3K9me3 0aMale reproduction1 aWang, Bingqian1 aLi, Zhe1 aDing, Xingwang1 aWen, Ya1 aShan, Wenqi1 aHu, Weiyue1 aWang, Xinru1 aXia, Yankai0 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 287 p.132395-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1323953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245012000168300001600288520121000304592002801514650001401542650001201556650002701568650002601595650001001621650001301631650001601644650002601660650002001686650001601706650001101722650001801733650002201751650001301773650002101786650001501807700002101822773012301843856008901966852000902055655001202064IND60564048920221120142434.0190410e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056404892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhil, K.10aEffect of humic acid on the toxicity of bare and capped ZnO nanoparticles on bacteria, algal and crustacean systems  ap. 136-149.  aZinc oxide nanoparticles are one of the most extensively used nanoparticles in various commercial products. Depending on the purpose, the particles are coated with various agents including poly vinyl pyrrolidone, poly vinyl alcohol, ethylene glycol etc. As the particles are heavily used, the chance of the particles to get run off into the environment is very high. The study explains the difference in toxicity of bare and capped zinc oxide nanoparticles under various environmental conditions including humic acid and visible light against bacterial, algal and crustacean system. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as model system for bacterial toxicity testing. Plate counting assay was employed for assessing the toxicity against bacteria. Chlorella pyrenoidsa was used for studying toxicity against algal system, which was evaluated using the chlorophyll estimation assay. Daphnia sp. was used for studying the toxicity in crustacean system. The particles had the ability to adsorb humic acid which further affected the stability of the particle. The study concludes that the presence of environmental factors including humic acid affects the toxicological nature of ZnO NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aDaphnia 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aalgae 3abacteria 3achlorophyll 3aenvironmental factors 3aethylene glycol 3ahumic acids 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3azinc oxide1 aSudheer Khan, S.0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2017 Feb., v. 167 p.136-149dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100001500195245006300210300001600273506007600289520155000365592002801915506003701943650001301980650001501993650001902008650000902027650002202036650002802058650002402086650001302110650000902123653003902132653002002171653000802191653002002199653002202219700006102241700001502302700001302317700002602330700001902356700005702375700005402432700002402486700006302510700002102573700002202594773012302616856008902739852000902828655001202837IND60564049020221207091428.0190410e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056404902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.12.0182doi7 aPMC53109702pmcid7 a280633002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ying12aA PSMA-targeted theranostic agent for photodynamic therapy  ap. 111-116.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProstate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is over-expressed in the epithelium of prostate cancer and in the neovasculature of many non-prostate solid tumors. PSMA has been increasingly used as a target for cancer imaging and therapy. Here we describe a low-molecular-weight theranostic photosensitizer, YC-9, for PSMA-targeted optical imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). YC-9 was synthesized by conjugating IRDye700DX N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester with a PSMA targeting Lys-Glu urea through a lysine-suberate linker in suitable yield. Optical imaging in vivo demonstrated PSMA-specific tumor uptake of YC-9 with rapid clearance from non-target tissues. PSMA-specific cell kill was demonstrated with YC-9in vitro through PDT in PSMA+ PC3-PIP and PSMA− PC3-flu cells. In vivo PDT in mice bearing PSMA+ PC3-PIP tumors at 4h post-injection of YC-9 (A total of four PDT sessions were performed, 48h apart) resulted in significant tumor growth delay, while tumors in control groups continued to grow. PDT with YC-9 significantly increased the median survival of the PSMA+ PC3-PIP tumor mice (56.5days) compared to control groups [23.5–30.0days, including untreated, light alone, YC-9 alone (without light) and non-targeted IRDye700DX PDT treatment groups], without noticeable toxicity at the doses used. This study proves in principle that YC-9 is a promising therapeutic agent for targeted PDT of PSMA-expressing tissues, such as prostate tumors, and may also be useful against non-prostate tumors by virtue of neovascular PSMA expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantigens 3aepithelium 3aimage analysis 3amice 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atoxicity 3aurea 0aProstate-specific membrane antigen 0aProstate cancer 0aPDT 0aOptical imaging 0aMolecular imaging1 aChatterjee, Samit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7783-181X1 aLisok, Ala1 aMinn, Il1 aPullambhatla, Mrudula1 aWharram, Bryan1 aWang, Yuchuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5111-65621 aJin, Jiefu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5318-11111 aBhujwalla, Zaver M.1 aNimmagadda, Sridhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6413-71911 aMease, Ronnie C.1 aPomper, Martin G.0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2017 Feb., v. 167 p.111-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008800171520217900259592002802438653002702466653002402493653001402517653001302531653001402544653002102558700002002579773013202599856008402731852000902815655001202824IND60675684320221120215152.0191227e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067568432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2019.1512702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Ronald J.,10aTethering mobile aquatic organisms to measure predation: A renewed call for caution  aTethering experiments are one of the few approaches available to ecologists to assess predation rates in aquatic environments, and they have provided important insights into the processes driving observed patterns in aquatic communities. The potential for experimental artefacts to arise when tethering mobile prey has been well recognised and was vigorously discussed in the literature around 20 years ago. However, we reviewed 128 published studies that tethered fish and mobile crustaceans and found a growing number since that time that we believe do not adequately consider these potential issues. The majority of studies recognise that tethering mobile prey can only provide a relative rather than absolute estimate of predation rates, yet 16% present and interpret their results as if they reflect absolute natural predation rates. Two thirds of published studies at least acknowledge other potential artefacts, less than half test for them, while one third seemingly give no consideration to potential artefacts or biases of the method. Our review also revealed the potential for a lack of independence between individual replicates. More than two thirds of studies deployed replicate tethered prey a minimum of no more than 5 m apart, with more than one quarter deploying them no more than 1 m apart. Eighty-five percent of studies considered missing prey to represent predation. We deployed 104 tethered fish prey in field trials and monitored them using remote underwater video to determine the causes of prey loss. These trials reinforced the simple but important point that prey missing from tether lines at the end of an experiment can be missing for a variety of reasons other than reflecting predation. They also highlight the potential for underwater video, where it is practical to use, to overcome many of the issues confronting field tethering experiments. Carefully designed tethering studies will continue to be an important tool for ecologists studying patterns of predation in aquatic systems. However, our findings suggest a re-emerging need for researchers to recognise and test for potential biases and artefacts inherent with the technique.  aPublisher supplied data 0aExperimental artefacts 0aSample independence 0aMortality 0aSurvival 0aPredation 0aUnderwater video1 aWaltham, Nathan0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2020 Feb., v. 523 p.151270-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2019.1512703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007400165300001600239520131600255592002801571650002601599650002501625650001601650650002101666650001901687650002501706650001901731650002001750650001401770650002001784650000901804650001801813650002201831650002101853650000701874650003901881650002601920650001301946650001101959650001201970650004001982700001802022700001702040700001902057700001902076700002002095700001602115773011302131856008202244852000902326655001202335IND60112287420221122214445.0141110e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011228742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2010.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Min-Jie10aPepsinogens and pepsins from Japanese seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus)  ap. 259-265.  aThree pepsinogens (PG1, PG2, PG3) were highly purified from the stomach of Japanese seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus) by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sephacel anion exchange column chromatography and Sephacryl S-200 gel-filtration. Two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) analysis revealed that the molecular masses of the three PGs were 35, 37, and 34kDa, and their isoelectric points were 5.3, 5.1, and 4.7, respectively. Zymography analysis showed that the three pepsinogens had different mobilities and enzymatic activities under native conditions. Pepsinogens converted into their active form pepsins under pH 2.0 by one-step pathway or stepwise pathway. All three pepsins were completely inhibited by pepstatin A, a typical aspartic proteinase inhibitor. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the three pepsinogens were determined to the 30th, 30th and 28th amino acid residue and those of their corresponding active form pepsins were also determined to the 19th, 18th and 20th amino acid residue, respectively. All amino acid sequences of Japanese seabass PGs revealed high identities to reported fish and mammalian pepsinogens. The effective digestion of fish and shrimp muscular proteins by pepsins indicated their physiological function in the degradation of food proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLateolabrax japonicus 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aammonium sulfate 3aanion exchange 3aaspartic proteinases 3achromatography 3adietary protein 3adigestion 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3afractionation 3aisoelectric point 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteins 3ashrimp 3astomach 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aChen, Wei-Qin1 aDu, Cui-Hong1 aYoshida, Asami1 aLan, Wei-Guang1 aLiu, Guang-Ming1 aSu, Wen-Jin0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2011 Apr., v. 158, no. 4 p.259-265dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2010.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011900156300001800275520150200293592002801795650002701823650001201850650002801862650002201890650001901912650001801931650001501949650001701964650001601981650003101997650001902028650001302047650001702060650001402077650000702091650001602098650001302114650001602127700001502143700001802158700001502176700001702191700001402208700001802222773013102240856007502371852000902446655001202455IND60785796320221118065832.0220728e20220726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078579632DNAL7 a10.1039/d2bm00643j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liao10aSynergistic size and charge conversions of functionalized PAMAM dendrimers under the acidic tumor microenvironment  ap. 4271-4283.  aDeveloping nanomedicine with highly adaptive behaviors has shown great effectiveness in cancer treatment. However, the multi-functional integration of nano-therapeutic systems inevitably leads to complexity in the structure and impairs the operational efficiency or performance. Herein, we describe a novel nano-therapeutic system, G4-AB, capable of simultaneous dual conversions of the size and charge while targeting the acidic tumor microenvironment. G4-AB, containing a hydrophobic inner cavity for doxorubicin (DOX) loading, was synthesized by modifying amine-terminated 4th-generation polyamidoamine (G4-PAMAM) dendrimers with acylsulfonamide betaine (AB). Due to the dipole–dipole interaction among the AB moieties, G4-AB self-assembles to form micellar clusters with a zwitterionic surface. Possessing an anti-fouling property and suitable size, G4-AB exhibits optimized blood circulation under physiological pH conditions. Moreover, the extracellular pH value of the tumor microenvironment (pH 6.5) can trigger the protonation of acylsulfonamide, resulting in the cationization of AB and dissociation of G4-AB into unimolecular micelles (∼12 nm) due to electrostatic repulsion. The synergistic dual conversions further ensure drug accumulation with enhanced tumor penetration and cell internalization. The in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the G4-AB-DOX nano-therapeutic system possesses better antitumor efficiency and lower toxicity than free DOX or PEGylated PAMAM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantifouling activities 3abetaine 3abiocompatible materials 3ablood circulation 3acancer therapy 3acationization 3adendrimers 3adissociation 3adoxorubicin 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3ananomedicine 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aprotonation 3atoxicity 3azwitterions1 aHu, Shumin1 aZhang, Leitao1 aWu, Wenlan1 aCheng, Qiuli1 aLi, Junbo1 aNarain, Ravin0 tBiomaterials science.g2022 July 26, v. 10, no. 15 p.4271-4283dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2bm00643j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245006700174500001900241520117200260592002801432650001501460650001901475650001201494650001401506650001301520650001101533650001801544653001501562653003701577653001001614773013201624856008401756852000901840655001201849IND60675684420221120215323.0191227e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067568442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2019.1512692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGravinese, Philip M.14aThe tolerance of juvenile stone crabs to hypoxia: Size matters  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOver the last fifty years, anthropogenic activities have increased nutrient loading into coastal habitats causing more frequent hypoxic events. Global climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of hypoxic conditions as temperatures continue to increase, which will pose physiological and metabolic limits on many coastal species. This study determined the survivorship and tolerance of the commercially important juvenile stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) during short-term hypoxic exposure under laboratory conditions. Small (2.0–3.0 mm carapace width) and large (5.0–18.0 mm carapace width) juveniles were gradually exposed to moderate hypoxic conditions (1.5 mg L−1 oxygen concentration) for 2 h and compared to individuals in normoxic conditions. Smaller juveniles were more sensitive than larger conspecifics and exhibited 80% mortality. Larger juveniles did not exhibit significant mortality (~12% total mortality); however, 35% of the larger crabs displayed immobile by the end of the experiment. These results indicate that juvenile stone crab tolerance to hypoxia is size-dependent and likely changes throughout ontogeny.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithodidae 3aclimate change 3ahypoxia 3ajuveniles 3aontogeny 3aoxygen 3asurvival rate 0aStone crab 0aMenippe mercenaria, survivorship 0aCrabs0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2020 Feb., v. 523 p.151269-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2019.1512693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245018600160300001800346520060300364592002800967650001600995650001401011650002101025650002301046650002301069650001301092650002201105650002201127650001101149650001401160650001401174700001301188700001701201700001801218700001301236700005701249773013401306856007901440852000901519655001201528IND60604724020221118055031.0180717e20180605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060472402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b005872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Quan14aThe Construction of C–N, C–O, and C(sp2)–C(sp3) Bonds from Fluorine-Substituted 2-Aryl Benzazoles for Direct Synthesis of N-, O-, C-Functionalized 2-Aryl Benzazole Derivatives  ap. 6363-6372.  aHerein, a general and practical route to 2-(2-aminophenyl)- and 2-(2-alkoxyphenyl)-substituted benzazoles by nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is described.

This Scientific briefing examines and clarifies the difference between the pressure wave displacement and the groundwater displacement, by stating the differences in their respective transit times and velocities. The pressure front pulse displacement is controlled by the diffusivity of the aquifer, whereas groundwater displacement is controlled by the pumping flow rate and the effective porosity of the aquifer. To calculate the transit time and velocity of each type of displacement, several equations are presented and compared. An example is provided to illustrate the differences in velocity between the pressure front pulse displacement and the groundwater displacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfined aquifer 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3agroundwater 3aporosity0 tHydrological processes.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 32, no. 24 p.3689-3694dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.132793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245009300179300001600272500001500288520151400303592002801817650002001845650001401865650001901879650002101898650002501919650002201944650002001966650001801986650001202004651001502016653001202031700002402043700002002067700002202087700002702109773011202136856008802248852000902336655001202345IND4378293020221119132627.0141029e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437829302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00117.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeMattia, Elizabeth A.10aEffects of Small Rodent and Large Mammal Exclusion on Seedling Recruitment in Costa Rica  ap. 196-202.  a2019-12-06  aWe examined whether the experimental exclusion of large mammalian and small rodent seed predators had differing effects on seedling recruitment under natural seed rain conditions. In both primary and late‐successional secondary forested areas, exclosure experiments using natural seed densities were designed to assess seedling recruitment. To assess the differences in seedling recruitment, we monitored three exclosure treatments (1.2 m radius/1.5 m height) in two forest types (primary vs. late‐successional secondary forest): (1) fenced exclosures that excluded large mammals; (2) fenced exclosures that excluded both large and small mammals; and (3) open controls. Within each exclosure treatment, we marked and identified all seedlings at the beginning of the experiment (February 2001), followed the marked seedlings' fate for a year, and then marked and identified all new seedlings after a year. Two preliminary findings were generated from these data: for some tree species, small rodents and large mammals have differential effects on seedling recruitment, and the effect of excluding mammals did not differ with habitat type (primary vs. late‐successional secondary forest). These preliminary results highlight the need to examine further how the effects of small rodent and large mammal exclusion may affect species‐specific seed predation and seedling recruitment in a variety of habitat/land use types (e.g., primary forest, late‐successional forest, and early‐successional forest).  aPublisher supplied data 3aprimary forests 3aseedlings 3aseed predation 3atropical forests 3anatural regeneration 3asecondary forests 3aforest habitats 3asmall mammals 3arodents 3aCosta Rica 0amammals1 aRathcke, Beverly J.1 aCurran, Lisa M.1 aAguilar, Reinaldo1 aVargas Ríos, Orlando,0 tBiotropica.g2006 Mar., v. 38, no. 2 p.196-202dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl45461x1744-74297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00117.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245010900170520079600279592002801075650001201103650001501115650001301130650002201143650001301165650001301178653002201191653002901213700001201242700001501254700001401269700001501283700001901298700001701317700001401334773009101348856009001439852000901529655001201538IND60752437720221120214125.0220404e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075243772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1324002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhe12aA novel biochar electrode for efficient electroreduction of nitrate: Selective and regulation of halogen  aA novel biochar electrode Bio-Fe₃O₄/CF used for electroreduction of nitrate was prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis method. The results showed that the growth of spherical Fe₃O₄ on the surface of smooth biochar can significantly increase the nitrate reduction rate. Besides, the presence of Cl and Br in the solution could promote the conversion of NH₄⁺ to N₂, thereby regulating the element nitrogen in the solution. Mechanistic analysis showed that the interconversion of Fe (II) and Fe (III) facilitates the transfer of electrons to nitrate.

Challenges remain in quickly quantifying the length, width, migration, and pattern changes of deltaic channels accurately and with a high frequency. Here, we develop a quantitative framework, which introduces a water occurrence algorithm based on Landsat time-series data and spatial morphological delineation methods, in order to measure DCN structures and associated changes. In examining the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Irrawaddy River Delta (IRD) as case studies, we analyze their conditions and trends between 1986 and 2018 at ten-year intervals. Both study areas have undergone various human interventions, including dam construction, sand mining, and land use change driven by urbanization. Our results show the following: (1) the use of a 0.5 water occurrence extraction based on Landsat time-series data, morphological delineation, and spatial change analysis methods can quantify the morphodynamics of DCNs effectively with a root-mean-square error of 15.1 m; (2) there was no evident channel migration in either PRD or IRD with average channel widths of 387.6 and 300.9 m, respectively. Most channels in the PRD underwent remarkable shrinkage, with average rates of 0.4–6.4 m/year, while there were only slight changes in the IRD, which is consistent with observed trends in sediment load variation. The results of this research have the potential to contribute to sustainable river management in terms of flood prevention, riparian tideland reclamation, and water and sediment regulation. Moreover, the proposed framework can be used to develop a new global delta channel network dataset and can be generalized to remotely sensed water discharge and river depth estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aflood control 3ahumans 3aland use change 3aremote sensing 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asand 3asediment contamination 3ashrinkage 3atime series analysis 3aurbanization 0aDelta channel network 0aLandsat time-series 0aChannel width 0aChannel migration1 aTian, Bo1 aSchwarz, Christian1 aZhang, Ce1 aGuo, Leicheng1 aXu, Fan1 aZhou, Yunxuan1 aHe, Qing0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Sept., v. 600 p.126688-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1266883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006000183245010800243506007600351520136000427592002801787506003701815650001401852650001501866650002601881650002301907650002501930650001301955650001201968700005801980773010802038856007602146852000902222655001202231IND60681147020221207052252.0200114e20191231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068114702DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/21545482doi7 aPMC69551402pmcid7 a319763162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerhan, Mireille1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9695-577014aThe Impact of Food Service Attributes on Customer Satisfaction in a Rural University Campus Environment  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this study was to determine different food service attributes that have an impact on customers’ overall satisfaction at a rural university cafeteria. Over 5 weeks, 676 cafeteria users, including academics, staff, and students, were selected through convenience sampling. They completed an anonymous-designed survey with closed questions (n=29) assessing quality of food and beverages, quality of service and setting, and satisfaction with food service attributes. In order to measure the existence and degree of significant relationships between different research variables, Pearson correlation coefficients were employed to analyse the data. Means of scores and frequencies were calculated. Results indicated that customers’ satisfaction with different service attributes was above average.

However, little is known about the ARM/HEAT repeat proteins in prokaryotes. Here we report the crystal structure of TON1937, a hypothetical protein from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus onnurineus NA1. The structure reveals a crescent-shaped molecule composed of a double layer of α-helices with seven anti-parallel α-helical repeats. A structure-based sequence alignment of the α-helical repeats identified a conserved pattern of hydrophobic or aliphatic residues reminiscent of the consensus sequence of eukaryotic HEAT repeats. The individual repeats of TON1937 also share high structural similarity with the canonical eukaryotic HEAT repeats. In addition, the concave surface of TON1937 is proposed to be its potential binding interface based on this structural comparison and its surface properties. These observations lead us to speculate that the archaeal HEAT-like repeats of TON1937 have evolved to engage in protein–protein interactions in the same manner as eukaryotic HEAT repeats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermococcus 3aconsensus sequence 3acrystal structure 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahydrophobicity 3aprokaryotic cells 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3asequence alignment 0aThermococcus onnurineus 0aARM/HEAT repeats 0aArchaea 0aMolecular evolution 0aCrystal structure1 aKim, Yi-Seul1 aRojviriya, Catleya1 aCha, Hyung Jin1 aHa, Sung-Chul1 aKim, Yeon-Gil0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2013 Oct., v. 61 p.433-438dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010900163300001600272520100600288592002801294650001701322650001901339650001301358650002401371650002001395650002101415650001901436650001601455700001401471700001501485700001201500773011301512856008201625852000901707655001201716IND60112287920221122190814.0141110e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011228792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2011.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Ning10aFunctional analysis of the chicken PPARγ gene 5′-flanking region and C/EBPα-mediated gene regulation  ap. 297-303.  aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) are the master regulators of adipogenesis. The regulatory mechanism of PPARγ and C/EBPα gene expression is clear in mammals, however, little is known in chicken. The aim of the present study was to characterize chicken PPARγ promoter and investigate whether PPARγ could be regulated by C/EBPα in chickens. A 2-kb nucleotide sequence upstream of the start codon of chicken PPARγ gene was cloned and characterized by using bioinformatics and experimental approaches. This 2-kb promoter region exhibited strong promoter activity in DF1 cells. The reporter gene assay showed that the chicken C/EBPα could activate PPARγ gene promoter. Further study by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and mutational analysis revealed that the chicken C/EBPα could directly bind to and regulate the PPARγ gene promoter. Our results demonstrate that PPARγ can be directly regulated by C/EBPα in chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3abioinformatics 3achickens 3agel electrophoresis 3agene expression 3apromoter regions 3areporter genes 3astart codon1 aGao, Yuan1 aWang, Ning1 aLi, Hui0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2011 Apr., v. 158, no. 4 p.297-303dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2011.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100002600185245015300211506007600364506003100440520144000471592002801911596007001939596007002009506003702079650002702116650002802143650002302171650001202194650001902206650002002225650001902245650002202264650001502286650002402301650001302325650002102338653001402359653001402373653001502387653001102402653001102413653002102424653002602445700005602471700005502527700001802582700001902600700006002619700001802679700001302697773012202710856008202832961001302914852000902927655001202936IND60675684920221207044909.0200121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067568492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1088052chorus7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1088052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerrios-Rodriguez, A.10aInactivation of Listeria monocytogenes on post-harvest carrot and tomato by gamma radiation, sanitizer, biocontrol treatments and their combinations  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aControl of foodborne pathogens on post-harvest produce may be improved by combined treatments. Hurdle applications may enhance the lethal effects of non-thermal interventions on pathogenic bacteria. We evaluated the effects of gamma radiation (0.5 kGy), nisin-based sanitizer (100%), and competitive biocontrol microbes (non-pathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens) on the survival of Listeria monocytogenes on post-harvest tomato and carrot. Produce storage temperatures (5 and 20 °C) and days (0 and 7), with single, two or three treatment combinations of radiation (R), sanitizer (S) and biocontrol (B) were investigated for pathogen survival. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in L. monocytogenes and subsequent pathogen reductions on produce by hurdle treatments were recorded. L. monocytogenes reductions on carrot and tomato varied, as R + S + B and S + R + B hurdle treatments (day 7) reduced Listeria survival by 2.5–5.0 and 2.4–5.0 log CFU/g of produce, respectively, at both temperatures. The sanitizer (S) treatment reduced Listeria on produce by 2.2–4.7 logs (day 7), while R or B treatments also reduced Listeria survival on produce. The treatment efficacies on pathogen survival were sanitizer > radiation > biocontrol. Inactivation of Listeria on post-harvest produce may be improved by treatment combinations as hurdle applications could enhance the safety of post-harvest carrot and tomato.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cUniversidad de Puerto Ricodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000086800 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abiological control 3acarrots 3afood pathogens 3agamma radiation 3amicroorganisms 3apathogen survival 3asanitizers 3astorage temperature 3atomatoes 3avirulent strains 0aRadiation 0aSanitizer 0aBiocontrol 0aTomato 0aCarrot 0aHurdle treatment 0aPathogen inactivation1 aOlanya, O.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7564-46691 aUkuku, D.O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8283-20081 aNiemira, B.A.1 aOrellana, L.E.1 aMukhopadhyay, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6941-51571 aCassidy, J.M.1 aBoyd, G.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Jan., v. 118 p.108805-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1088053Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245014300169520147100312592002801783650001601811650002001827650005901847650001701906650001301923650003101936650003001967650002101997650001502018650001202033650002802045650001902073650002502092650002602117650003102143650001402174650002602188653004602214653002202260653001602282653003702298700001502335700001402350700001602364700001602380700001602396700001802412773012102430856008802551852000902639655001202648IND60756917120221121232722.0220103e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075691712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1047072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xinxin10aTamarix hispida ThEIL1 improves salt tolerance by adjusting osmotic potential and increasing reactive oxygen species scavenging capability  aThe ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE (EIL) transcription factor (TF) family plays a key role in the ethylene signal transduction pathway. However, it is still unknown how EIL proteins mediate salt tolerance in Tamarix hispida. Here, we cloned and functionally characterized the TF ThEIL1 from T. hispida. ThEIL1 is a nuclear protein possessing transcriptional activation activity. In addition to binding to the PERE motif (GGATTCAA), a novel EIL protein-DNA interaction was identified, in which ThEIL1 binds to GCC-box (AGCCGCC). Gain- and loss-of-function analysis in T. hispida showed that ThEIL1 regulates the expression of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS), pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) to mediate the biosynthesis of proline and trehalose, respectively, thereby elevating osmotic potential. Additionally, ThEIL1 controls the activities of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by regulating the expression of genes encoding SODs and PODs, leading to increased reactive oxygen species scavenging capability. Moreover, overexpression of ThEIL1 in Arabidopsis significantly increased root length and fresh weight under salt treatment conditions. Furthermore, the physiological traits of T. hispida were consistent with those of Arabidopsis stably overexpressing ThEIL1. Thus, ThEIL1 serves as a TF that mediates salt tolerance by elevating osmotic potential and improving ROS scavenging capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aTamarix hispida 3aalpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase (UDP-forming) 3abiosynthesis 3aethylene 3aethylene signaling pathway 3aloss-of-function mutation 3aosmotic pressure 3aperoxidase 3aproline 3areactive oxygen species 3asalt tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3atrehalose 3atrehalose-phosphatase 0aEthylene insensitive transcription factor 0aOsmotic potential 0aSalt stress 0aTransient genetic transformation1 aHe, Yuting1 aWang, Rui1 aWang, Zhibo1 aLiu, Zhujun1 aGao, Caiqiu1 aWang, Yucheng0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2022 Feb., v. 194 p.104707-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1047073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014200173300001500315520102100330592002801351650001801379650002201397650002501419650001701444650002201461650002501483650002401508650000901532650001801541650002701559653001201586653001101598653003301609653002101642700002201663700002101685700001901706700001701725773011301742856008101855852000901936655001201945IND60552299920221122050212.0161020e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055229992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2015.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaharkova, Vladislava10aRat Humanin is encoded and translated in mitochondria and is localized to the mitochondrial compartment where it regulates ROS production  ap. 96-100.  aEvidence for the putative mitochondrial origin of the Humanin (HN) peptide has been lacking, although its cytoprotective activity has been demonstrated in a variety of organismal and cellular systems. We sought to establish proof-of-principle for a mitochondria-derived peptide (MDP) in a rat-derived cellular system as the rat HN sequence is predicted to lack nuclear insertions of mitochondrial origin (NUMT). We found that the rat HN (Rattin; rHN) homologue is derived from the mitochondrial genome as evidenced by decreased production in Rho-0 cells, and that peptide translation occurs in the mitochondria as it is unaffected by cycloheximide. Rat HN localizes to the mitochondria in cellular subfractionation and immunohistochemical studies. Addition of a HN analogue to isolated mitochondria from rat INS-1 beta cells reduced hydrogen peroxide production by 55%. In summary, a locally bioactive peptide is derived and translated from an open reading frame (ORF) within rat mitochondrial DNA encoding 16S rRNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acycloheximide 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3aopen reading frames 3arats 3aribosomal RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 0aHumanin 0aRattin 0aMitochondria-derived peptide 0aOxidative stress1 aAlvarez, Griselda1 aNakamura, Hiromi1 aCohen, Pinchas1 aLee, Kuk-Wha0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 413 p.96-100dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015400170520113600324592002801460650001701488650002001505650002801525650001101553650002401564650001501588650002101603650001101624650001501635650002101650650001001671651001001681653002101691653002301712653002801735653001801763700001801781700001401799700001401813700001601827700001801843773010501861856008601966852000902052655001202061IND60745065320221120100306.0211029e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074506532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1266992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Chongfeng13aAn improved interval multi-objective programming model for irrigation water allocation by considering energy consumption under multiple uncertainties  aIn order to multi objectives and uncertainties in the optimization allocation of irrigation water resources, this paper developed an improved interval multi-objectives programming method. The proposed model was then applied to a case study in Jinghuiqu irrigation district, Shaanxi Province, China. Maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption are regarded as planning objectives. A series of planting structure optimal schemes were obtained under different representative hydrological years. From the result, shortage of water resources has a negative effect on the development of Jinghuiqu irrigation district. Moreover, the remaining water resources prefer vegetable to wheat after meeting the minimum demand of the developed model, which characterized with high economic benefit and lower energy consumption. Moreover, due to the introduction of effective precipitation, a lot of irrigation water resources have been saved, such as 47.14% of total water consumption was saved when P = 25%. Furthermore, the desired optimal schemes can be obtained by the decision-makers based on the results of the developed model.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aeffective precipitation 3aenergy 3afinancial economics 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3amodels 3avegetables 3awater allocation 3awheat 3aChina 0aMulti-objectives 0aEnergy consumption 0aOptimization allocation 0aUncertainties1 aXie, Zhishuai1 aZhang, Yu1 aWei, Xing1 aWang, Yashi1 aSun, Dongyong0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Nov., v. 602 p.126699-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1266993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245013100174520174100305592002802046650001502074650001802089650001102107650002402118650002302142650001202165650001802177650002002195650001102215650002502226650001302251650001502264650001902279650002202298653002502320653002402345653003102369653002402400700001602424700001402440700001402454700001502468700001802483700006502501700001402566773009102580856009002671852000902761655001202770IND60752438020221120152739.0220307e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075243802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1324042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jianfeng10aGrass waste utilization to alter aggregate-related carbon chemical composition and fungal community structure in apple orchard  aThe grass-waste management model affects soil organic carbon (SOC) and the microorganism community structure; however, studies on the relationship between the fungal community structure and the SOC chemical component at the aggregate level are poor. Solid-state ¹³C NMR and 18 S rDNA methods were used to evaluate the relationship between the SOC chemical composition and fungal community abundance at the aggregate level. Grass mulching significantly increased the percentage of labile carbon O-alkyl C (5.19%–11.79%) and decreased the instability of SOC (1.38–0.69). Microaggregates contained higher alkyl C (33.77%) and lower aromatic C (18.31%), and the A/O-A ratio (1.03) was higher than that of macroaggregates (0.89–0.96). Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota dominated the fungal community at the phylum level, and their abundance increased after grass mulching. Microaggregates supported more microbial diversity and richness and were rich in the Ascomycota (36.69%–67.49%) phylum, while LM aggregates were rich in Basidiomycota (5.62%–39.84%). We proved that changes in the O-alkyl C, carbonyl C, aromatic C and alkyl C of SOC chemical components were closely connected to fungal community composition, which together explained the change in fungal composition by 63.81%–71.99% among aggregates. We concluded that alterations in the chemical form of organic carbon were closely related to a change in the soil fungal community. This connection has a positive impact on soil nutrient utilization and SOC conversion in fruit-grass composite ecosystems and promotes the understanding of the relationship between the soil microbial community and nutrient cycling during long-term grass waste utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiomycota 3aapples 3acommunity structure 3afungal communities 3agrasses 3alabile carbon 3amicroaggregates 3amodels 3anutrient utilization 3aorchards 3asoil fungi 3asoil nutrients 3awaste utilization 0aGrass mulching model 0aSolid-state 13C NMR 0aFungal community structure 0aSoil organic carbon1 aDuan, Yumin1 aGuo, Yaru1 aLi, Zelin1 aNi, Xinhua1 aZhang, Jiatao1 aAwasthi, Mukesh Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0879-184X1 aLi, Huike0 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 287 p.132404-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1324043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006400149245011200213520193300325592002802258650001902286650001402305650002902319650001202348650001202360650001402372650001202386650002202398650001102420650001802431650002102449650001502470650000902485651001002494653002302504653001702527653002402544653001902568653001102587653003502598700002602633700006602659773011302725856008402838852000902922655001202931IND60693646420221120215859.0220103e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069364642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e010802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMungi, Ninad Avinash1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6502-045710aExpanding niche and degrading forests: Key to the successful global invasion of Lantana camara (sensu lato)  aEstimating the distribution of invasive species and understanding the ecological reasons for their success is crucial for their management. Moreover, their ability to invade biogeographically distinct regions in short timespans poses interesting ecological questions. Lantana camara (sensu lato) is one such invasive species of global concern. In an unprecedented effort, we surveyed 207,100 km² of Indian forests by sampling 13715 grids of 5 × 5 km, each with 1–31 plots of 10 m diameter, to record the abundance of Lantana. For India, we modeled occupancy of Lantana in the sampled area by accounting for imperfect detection; and potential invasion outside the sampled area using MaxEnt with covariates of climate, soil, forest and human disturbance. Further, Lantana’s response in comparable areas of its native and global invaded range was modeled using MaxEnt to provide a better understanding of its changing relationship with environmental factors. Lantana invaded 154,837 km² of the surveyed area, and threatened 303,607 km² of total Indian forests (44%); with preference to warm, humid, fertile areas, degraded by extractive human use. By combining our large-scale ground surveys with published data, we show that Lantana has expanded its climatic niche worldwide, with >11 million km² suitable for its invasion. Niche comparison revealed that Lantana might have adaptive plasticity in its invaded range; where it was found to be more tolerant to higher temperatures, lower fertility and shade as compared to its native range. In light of Lantana’s introduction history that suggest excessive hybridization between previously allopatric populations, and its known genetic diversity in the invaded range, the existing adaptive plasticity is suggestive of contemporary evolution. This adaptive nature can increase area under its invasion and pose an ecological conundrum of managing an evolving neophyte.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLantana camara 3aallopatry 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3aecology 3aevolution 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3ainvasive species 3aplasticity 3asoil 3aIndia 0aLarge-scale survey 0aNiche change 0aOccupancy modelling 0aPlant invasion 0aMaxEnt 0aSpecies distribution modelling1 aQureshi, Q.q(Qamar),1 aJhala, Yadvendradev V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3276-13840 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2020 Sept., v. 23 p.e01080-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e010803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008000159300001800239520115200257592002801409650001301437650002301450650001401473650001201487650001901499650000701518650001501525650002001540650000901560650001601569650002001585650001801605650001301623651002201636700002301658773012401681856007501805852000901880655001201889IND60534360320221119115343.0160802e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053436032DNAL7 a10.1021/es300041f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Megan
M.10aDirect and Indirect Photolysis of the Phytoestrogens Genistein and Daidzein  ap. 5396-5403.  aGenistein and daidzein are two estrogenic compounds derived from plants, especially legumes. This research begins to explore their environmental fate, focusing on direct and indirect photolysis. UV–visible spectra for both compounds at varying pH values were taken, the pKₐ values for both compounds were measured, and UV–visible spectra for each protonation state were determined. The loss of both compounds in deionized water was observed upon exposure to natural sunlight, and the quantum yields were determined for each protonation state. In Mississippi River water, direct photolysis does not account for all of the loss of genistein and daidzein. The mechanism of indirect photolysis was probed using quenchers and sensitizers, and results suggest that daidzein is transformed mainly via direct photolysis and singlet oxygenation, while genistein is transformed mainly via reaction with triplet-state natural organic matter. The parameters determined in this study will allow for estimation of the concentration of genistein and daidzein in sunlit surface waters, which will allow for assessment of any risks posed to aquatic wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 3adaidzein 3aenvironmental fate 3agenistein 3alegumes 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphotolysis 3aplant estrogens 3arisk 3ariver water 3asolar radiation 3asurface water 3awildlife 3aMississippi River1 aArnold, William A.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 May 15, v. 46, no. 10 p.5396-5403dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes300041f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011200166300001400278520183200292592002802124650002602152650002002178650002302198650002202221650001702243650001702260650002102277650001002298650002802308650001502336650001102351650001202362650001102374651001002385653001402395653002302409653002402432700001402456700001402470700001302484700001502497700001402512700001802526700001602544773008602560856008602646852000902732655001202741IND60547372420221119145653.0160903e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054737242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Y.10aDiurnal and seasonal trends of carbonyl compounds in roadside, urban, and suburban environment of Hong Kong  ap. 43-51.  aSeasonal and diurnal variations of carbonyl compounds were investigated in roadside (MK), urban (TW), and suburban (UST) environments in Hong Kong. Thirteen carbonyls (C1–C6) were identified and quantified in the samples. The average total quantified carbonyl concentrations decreased in the order of roadside (12.16 ± 3.52 μg m−3), urban (10.45 ± 4.82 μg m−3), and suburban (5.14 ± 3.35 μg m−3). Formaldehyde was the most abundant species, accounting for ∼52%, ∼52%, and ∼46% of total measured carbonyls at MK, TW, and UST, respectively. At MK, the summer/winter ratios of most carbonyls were below one. The diurnal variations were associated with traffic flows, with high concentrations in daytime but low in nighttime. Good correlations were found between most carbonyls and carbon monoxide (CO), showing primary vehicular emission was the major source at the roadside location. In contrast, the summer/winter ratios of most carbonyls were larger than one at the urban site of TW and their carbonyls correlated well with secondary pollutant of ozone (O3), indicating photochemical reactions contributed significantly in the formation of carbonyls, especially in summer. Distinct diurnal variations of carbonyls were observed at TW on a hazy winter day of 28 Jan 2012. Most carbonyl concentrations reached the first peak at noontime and had the second peak in the evening. The first peak was ascribed to be the products of photochemical reactions as maximum concentrations of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and O3 occurred just before and after the carbonyl peak, respectively. The correlations among the carbonyl species were strong in summer but fair in winter at UST. Natural sources (e.g. biogenic) were usually the major source at the suburban, as far as its surrounding environment is concerned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbonyl compounds 3adiurnal variation 3aformaldehyde 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen content 3aozone 3aphotochemical reactions 3apollutants 3asummer 3atraffic 3awinter 3aChina 0aCarbonyls 0aDiurnal variations 0aSeasonal variations1 aLee, S.C.1 aHuang, Y.1 aHo, K.F.1 aHo, S.S.H.1 aYau, P.S.1 aLouie, P.K.K.1 aZhang, R.J.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 June, v. 89 p.43-51dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245010900209300001600318520223100334592002802565650001402593650001102607650001802618650001102636650002402647650001502671650002602686650002302712650002502735653002902760653003402789653001802823653003702841653002802878700002402906700001702930700001102947773009802958856008703056852000903143655001203152IND60607003320221120063010.0180830e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060700332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qinpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4839-951110aMeta-modeling of occupancy variables and analysis of their impact on energy outcomes of office buildings  ap. 166-180.  aOccupants interact with buildings in various ways via their presence (passive effects) and control actions (active effects). Therefore, understanding the influence of occupants is essential if we are to evaluate the performance of a building. In this paper, we model the mean profiles and variability of occupancy variables (presence and actions) separately. We will use a multi-variate Gaussian distribution to generate mean profiles of occupancy variables, while the variability will be represented by a multi-dimensional time series model, within a framework for a meta-analysis that synthesizes occupancy data gathered from a pool of buildings. We then discuss variants of occupancy models with respect to various outcomes of interest such as HVAC energy consumption and peak demand behavior via a sensitivity analysis. Results show that our approach is able to generate stochastic occupancy profiles, requiring minimum additional input from the energy modeler other than standard diversity profiles. Along with the meta-analysis, we enable the generalization of previous research results and statistical inferences to choose occupancy variables for future buildings. The sensitivity analysis shows that for aggregated building energy consumption, occupant presence has a smaller impact compared to lighting and appliance usage. Specifically, being accumulatively 55% wrong with regard to presence, only translates to 2% error in aggregated cooling energy in July and 3.6% error in heating energy in January. Such a finding redirects focus to the accurate estimation of lighting and appliance usage for a better prediction of aggregated energy consumption. Furthermore, it proves that accurate knowledge of the mean profiles is sufficient, that is, stochastic occupancy models do not play a significant role in the prediction of aggregated consumption in a conventional office building where the interaction between the operation of building systems and the spatial and temporal variability of occupancy is weak. When it comes to peak demand behavior, occupancy variability should be taken into account, as static profiles are not able to produce adequate estimates of power duration probabilities close to the power peak.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aenergy 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3anormal distribution 3aprediction 3astatistical inference 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 0aOccupancy representation 0aStochastic occupancy modeling 0aMeta-analysis 0aSensitivity analysis and ranking 0aTransfer function model1 aAugenbroe, Godfried1 aKim, Ji-Hyun1 aGu, Li0 tApplied energy.g2016 July 15, v. 174 p.166-180dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008400172500001900256520253200275592002802807650001302835650001602848650001102864650000902875650001502884650001602899651001102915653001602926653001802942653002602960653002102986653001903007700002103026700001503047773010703062856008703169852000903256655001203265IND60708919920221117035223.0201118e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070891992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1178572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrink, H.M. ten10aOn the equivalency of Black Smoke / British Smoke and historic Elemental Carbon  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aElemental Carbon (EC) is a good indicator for aerosol air quality and a main component in global warming; therefore data on its historic concentration would be highly valuable for an assessment of historic levels. There were already major sources of EC in Europe in the early 20th century, but the component has only been measured since the late 1980s when analysis procedures were developed and even until recently data are scarce. However, historic EC-concentrations may be deducible from the parameter British Smoke (BrS), respectively the equivalent parameter Black Smoke (BS; in continental Europe), monitored on a daily basis since the late 1940s. Values of the parameter were based on the light-absorptivity of aerosol filter samples and these should be a measure for EC, because it is/was the dominant light-absorbing species in the countries in which the method was used. We show here that BrS was a linear proxy for EC in the standardisation studies performed in the early 1960s, based on the approach of “proportional” sampling. In this procedure filter samples were collected in parallel sampling lines with increasing filter loadings of the same aerosol. The light-absorption as a function of mass loading, of a variety of aerosol types, followed a generic curve. This graph was normalised in the “BrS-curve” by setting BrS equal to the average mass loading of the urban aerosol in the tests. Because of the proportional sampling the mass-loading of the component EC followed, by necessity, the BrS-curve as a function of light-absorption. The proportionality factor between BrS and EC is not known because the latter parameter was not analysed then. When EC became measured, the major source of urban EC was diesel exhaust. We show that filter samples with urban aerosols containing EC deriving from diesel combustion and from domestic coal use give similar light-absorption signals when probed with the BrS/BS-method. This implies that the equivalency factor between EC and BS, as assessed in recent years, must also have applied in the past. In the intercomparison studies that we found in literature the correlation factor (R²) between EC and BS was on average 0.85, but the absolute EC values were quite different because of the different analysis methods used for EC. We converted the EC-data to values comparable to the new EU-standard “EUSAAR2-TOT”. We then arrive at an equivalency factor of 0.15 (±25%) respectively 0.18 (±25%) to translate historic BS or BrS data to concentrations of EC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3acarbon 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenvironment 3aEurope 0aBlack smoke 0aBritish smoke 0aProportional sampling 0aElemental carbon 0aLoading effect1 aHitzenberger, R.1 aKeuken, M.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 244 p.117857-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1178573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010500162300001800267520128300285592002801568650001901596650001501615650001701630650001701647650002101664650002501685650002001710650002301730650001501753650001901768650000901787700002001796700001901816700002101835700002101856700003101877700001701908773012401925856007502049852000902124655001202133IND60534360520200306000000.0160802e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053436052DNAL7 a10.1021/es300164p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHewitt, Belinda
M.10aNovel Fiber Optic Detection Method for in Situ Analysis of Fluorescently Labeled Biosensor Organisms  ap. 5414-5421.  aThis research presents a novel, time-resolved fiber-optic “Optrode” system for accurate real-time in situ detection of fluorescent proteins produced by biosensor organisms. The Optrode fluorescence detection system was able to identify, characterize, differentiate, and quantify red and green fluorescently labeled organisms, individually and in mixed aqueous cultures. Detection was also possible in sand systems, where a consistent reduction in signal intensity indicates that signal collection volume was reduced by one-third. The optrode was shown to be sensitive enough to detect fluorescently labeled cell concentrations of 1.9 × 10⁴ CFU/mL, indicating it is suitable for detecting typical concentrations of degrader organisms reported in bioremediation trials. The effect of fluorophore photobleaching was characterized for different fluorescent proteins and demonstrated a linear relationship to cell concentration, meaning the effect can be accounted for within methods of fluorescence collection and analysis. Proof of concept is provided for all aspects of this research, which represents an important step toward the goal of achieving a complete, nondestructive, in situ monitoring system to characterize all aspects of microbial activity and gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3abiosensors 3afiber optics 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorescent proteins 3agene expression 3amicrobial activity 3amonitoring 3aphotobleaching 3asand1 aSinghal, Naresh1 aElliot, Roy G.1 aChen, Andy Y.

The data used in the study were obtained from 59 187 cows in the Galicia region (Spain). BHB determination was performed using Fourier‐transformed infrared spectrometry from the milk samples collected from each cow on the first post‐partum test day. For statistical analysis, the following methods were applied: (i) ordinal regression to assess the effect of the length of the previous lactation, the dry period and the 305‐day normalized milk production on milk BHB, (ii) a Cox model to estimate the influence of the BHB concentration on risk of culling (overall and for a variety of reasons) and (iii) linear regression to assess the link between BHB and the milk yield and SCC obtained from each of the tests day performed throughout lactation. The probability of having higher BHB concentrations increased when the length of the previous lactation (p = 0.006), the dry period (p = 0.003) and the 305‐day normalized milk yield (p = 0.005) increased. However, the slight increase observed (especially for the case of the dry period and the 305‐day milk yield) would not justify that measures be implemented to reduce these traits. Higher concentrations of BHB led to an increased risk of culling due to ‘death’ (p ≤ 0.001) and ‘urgent slaughter’ (p ≤ 0.002) (both causes of involuntary culling). It also led to a reduction in milk production (p < 0.001) and an increase in SCC (p < 0.001) in the post‐partum; from that moment onward (including peak lactation), there were no differences in those two parameters depending on the BHB levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3acalving 3adairy cows 3aketosis 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asomatic cell count 3aspectroscopy 3aSpain1 aFouz, R.1 aCamino, F.1 aSanjuán, M.

The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) of these events ranged from 10 up to 6000 MW at 1 km resolution, and many of these fire episodes resulted in long-range transport of smoke over distances up to several hundred kilometers. Three different smoke episodes over Greece are analyzed here using real time hot-spot observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) satellite instrument as well as from MODIS hot-spots. Simulations of smoke dispersion are performed with the FLEXPART-WRF model and particulate matter emissions are calculated directly from the observed FRP. The modeled smoke plumes are compared with smoke stereo-heights from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument and the sensitivities to atmospheric and modeling parameters are examined. Driving the simulations with high resolution meteorology (4 × 4 km) and using geostationary satellite data to identify the hot spots allows the description of local scale features that govern smoke dispersion. The long-range transport of smoke is found to be favored over the complex coastline environment of Greece due to the abrupt changes between land and marine planetary boundary layers (PBL) and the decoupling of smoke layers from the surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acoasts 3aimage analysis 3ameteorological data 3ameteorology 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aparticulate emissions 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asmoke 3atroposphere 3aGreece 0aFire smoke 0aInjection height 0aSmoke dispersion modeling 0aFireHub1 aAmiridis, V.1 aZanis, P.1 aGerasopoulos, E.1 aSofiou, F.I.1 aHerekakis, T.1 aBrioude, J.1 aStohl, A.1 aKahn, R.A.1 aKontoes, C.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 Oct., v. 119 p.348-361dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.08.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245017400172300001600346500001900362520134100381592002801722650001901750650001601769650001701785650001801802650001901820650000901839650001701848650002101865650001301886650001401899650001601913650001701929650001301946650001601959650002601975650001402001653001802015653001502033653002602048653001302074700002002087773014202107856008502249852000902334655001202343IND60728028120221118014248.0210216e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072802812DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2020.18337642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeydari, Shabnam10aEfficiency of Funneliformis mosseae and Thiobacillus sp. on the secondary metabolites (essential oil, seed oil and mucilage) of Lallemantia iberica under salinity stress  ap. 249-259.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDragon’s head (Lallemantia iberica Fisch. & Mey), annual herb from the Lamiaceae family, is worldwide distributed. Lallemantia is a medicinal plant with a variety of uses, and all of its parts have economic applications, including leaves to extract essential oils, mucilage and oil for different purposes in food and medicine. This study evaluated the effects of inoculants (single and dual application of Funneliformis mosseae and/or Thiobacillus sp.) on the secondary metabolites of Lallemantia iberica under saline (6.72 dS/m) and non-saline conditions. The results indicated an increase in the percentage of essential and seed oils, along with a decrease in mucilage percentage and their yields under stress. Salinity increased the unsaturated fatty acids and unsaturated/saturated fatty acids, as well as the main components of the essential oil. However, the mucilage constituents were reduced by salt stress. Furthermore, mycorrhizal plants exhibited positively incremental effects on the components of secondary metabolites under salinity conditions. In some cases, the individual treatment of Thiobacillus had a greater effect on some fatty acids. In general, mycorrhiza and Thiobacillus can improve the yield and quality of secondary metabolites and thus compensate for the part of yield reduction in saline soil conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus mosseae 3aLallemantia 3aThiobacillus 3abiotechnology 3aessential oils 3ahead 3ahorticulture 3amedicinal plants 3amedicine 3amucilages 3amycorrhizae 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asecondary metabolites 3aseed oils 0aEssential oil 0afatty acid 0aFunneliformis mosseae 0amucilage1 aPirzad, Alireza0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 96, no. 2 p.249-259dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2020.18337643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245012800169520163600297592002801933650002201961650001701983650002202000650001902022650003502041650003702076650001302113650002202126650001602148650001002164650001302174650001902187650001502206650001102221650001102232650001902243650001302262650000702275650001902282650001902301650001502320650001502335650002202350650003302372650001702405650001802422650001302440650003702453650001302490653000802503653003102511653003402542653001202576700006302588700005602651773009102707856009002798852000902888655001202897IND60672157820221122051828.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067215782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1249812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAanchal, 10aComplete removal of endocrine disrupting compound and toxic dye by visible light active porous g-C3N4/H-ZSM-5 nanocomposite  aPhotocatalytic degradation of toxic pollutants is an efficient technique to completely remove the toxic pollutants from water bodies. In the present investigation, photocatalytic degradation of pollutants was studied over porous g-C₃N₄/H-ZSM-5 nanocomposite under visible light irradiation. The composite g-C₃N₄/H-ZSM-5 was synthesized by mixing an aqueous solution of H-ZSM-5 zeolite (increases surface area and provides active sites for degradation) with melamine (precursor of g-C₃N₄) for 10–12 h followed by calcinations at 550 °C. The photocatalyst was characterized by XRD, BET, HRTEM, FESEM, EDS and elemental mapping analysis. These techniques confirmed that, g-C₃N₄/H-ZSM-5 composite have layered and porous structure with uniform distribution of g-C₃N₄ on H-ZSM-5 surface. The BET N₂ adsorption-desorption analysis verified that the catalyst has high surface area (∼175 m²/g) having mesopores and micropores. The prepared catalyst was then used for the photodegradation of a model dye, Methylene Blue (MB) and an endocrine disrupting compound, Fipronil (FIP). Effects of various parameters such as pH, catalyst dose and scavengers were also studied. The % photocatalytic degradation of MB and FIP were around ∼92% and ∼84% with a high rate constants of 0.00997 and 0.00875 min⁻¹, respectively. From the scavenger study, OH (hydroxyl radical) and ▪ radical was found to be the major reactive species for MB and FIP degradation. From these studies it is revealed that, the catalyst is visible active, easy to prepare and an efficient photocatalyst for toxic pollutant degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nitride 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afipronil 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airradiation 3alight 3amelamine 3amethylene blue 3amicropores 3amixing 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3apollution control 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeolites 0aDye 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0ag-C3N4/H-ZSM-5 nanocomposites 0aZeolite1 aBarman, Sanghamitra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9189-50351 aBasu, Soumen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6419-13260 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 241 p.124981-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1249813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03659naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008300166300001800249500002000267520248700287592002802774650001802802650001502820650001502835650002102850650001202871650001502883650001402898650001202912650001302924650001402937650001402951650001202965650001102977650001202988651001203000651000903012773012803021856007903149852000903228655001203237IND60587337420221122042310.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058733742DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.128442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillson, John D.10aIndirect effects of invasive Burmese pythons on ecosystems in southern Florida  ap. 1251-1258.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSUMMARY: Invasive predators can dramatically alter ecosystems through both direct predation and indirect effects such as tropic cascades. However, most examples of top‐down effects of invasive predators in terrestrial systems stem from islands or similar low‐diversity ecosystems. Snakes are an emerging guild of damaging invasive predators, but demonstration of ecosystem‐level impacts of invasive snakes are limited to the single case of the brown treesnake on Guam. Invasive Burmese pythons are firmly established in southern Florida and have been linked to severe (80–100%) declines of several previously common mammal species (e.g. raccoons, opossums and rabbits). Specifically, spatiotemporal patterns of mammal declines in the Everglades mirror the spread of pythons and experimental reintroductions of rabbits to areas where they had been extirpated failed due to high (77% of mortalities) rates of predation by pythons. I evaluated the potential indirect effects of pythons on the nesting success of oviparous species by monitoring artificial turtle nests (N = 183) at 13 sites across the expanding range of the python population. I documented few mammals and low rates of nest predation (average score = 1·5 on a 1–5 scale) in the southern Everglades where pythons have been established the longest, intermediate (average score = 2·3) rates of nest predation at recently invaded sites, and very high (average score = 4·6) rates of nest predation at sites with few or no pythons. These findings represent the first documentation of potential indirect effects of pythons on non‐prey species, and suggest that loss or decline of mammals is resulting in trophic cascades that threaten the Everglades ecosystem. Synthesis and applications. My results suggest that an introduction of non‐native apex predators can result in trophic cascades that alter even complex, continental ecosystems. The Burmese python invasion of South Florida shows remarkable parallels with the catastrophic case of the brown treesnake in Guam, but in some ways is even more worrisome. Documentation of both strong direct impacts on prey and potential indirect effects on Everglades’ ecosystems within 15 years after being recognized as established emphasizes the need to integrate python management into restoration of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem. More broadly, non‐native snakes warrant significant attention for their potential to become damaging invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcyon lotor 3aPythonidae 3aecosystems 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3amonitoring 3amortality 3anesting 3aopossums 3apredation 3apredators 3arabbits 3asnakes 3aturtles 3aFlorida 3aGuam0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2017 Aug., v. 54, no. 4 p.1251-1258dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.128443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245013900169300001600308520121400324592002801538650002101566650001901587650002101606650002301627650001201650650001801662650001501680650002601695650001201721650001101733650001001744650001201754650001801766650001301784650002001797650001101817651001101828700002301839773009301862856004501955852000902000655001202009IND50069002820130904000000.0130904e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006900282DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2012002632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmmambux, M.

These include sorghum, millet species including pearl millet, finger millet, teff, and white and black fonio, and African rice as cereals; cowpea, Bambara groundnut, African yambean and West African locust bean as legumes; and Zulu round potato and the Livingstone potato as tubers. Many of these plants are considered as “lost crops of Africa.” This paper critically reviews the literature on the physical, chemical, and functionality of their starches. Information is essentially limited to the native starches of sorghum, some millets, and cowpea. Livingstone potato starch information is essentially absent. Notable characteristics of African starches include that teff and finger millet have compound starch granules. Some of the starches have unique properties which could be valuable. The very small granular size of teff and its functional properties can be exploited as a fat replacer. The high retrogradation of cowpea starch has potential in gluten‐free pasta and noodles. Nonfood applications for the African starches should be considered in the growing mining and oil industries in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDigitaria exilis 3aEragrostis tef 3aOryza glaberrima 3aPennisetum glaucum 3acowpeas 3afat replacers 3afood crops 3afunctional properties 3amillets 3amining 3apasta 3apeanuts 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3astarch granules 3atubers 3aAfrica1 aTaylor, John R.

This assignment of fire as a disturbance has potential economic and social implications across Canada, and influences plans and actions to achieve caribou conservation and recovery. Previous researchers have reported caribou avoid burned habitat, but these studies did not typically consider unburned residual patches within fire perimeters. Additionally, the implications of burned habitat on individual caribou survival is unclear. We examined resource selection by boreal woodland caribou of burns, and unburned residual patches, using global positioning system (GPS) locations for 201 caribou across 6 caribou populations in Alberta, Canada. We also examined if burned habitat affected the survival of adult female caribou. Caribou avoided burns and unburned residual patches. Increased use of burned habitats, however, did not lower the survival of adult caribou. Collectively, these results provide evidence to support current assertions that burns, and the embedded unburned residual patches are not preferred caribou habitat and increase our understanding of the implications of forest fire for caribou vital rates. Our investigation offers important information about the role of forest fire in caribou ecology and enhances the identification of disturbed habitat under recovery strategy guidelines to effectively address caribou population declines. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  cAlberta Environment and Parks—Fish and Wildlife Stewardship Branch  cRegional Industry Caribou Collaboration  cCMU Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aRangifer tarandus caribou 3aadults 3afemales 3aforest fires 3aforests 3ahabitats 3awildlife management 3aAlberta1 aDickie, Melanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2177-23521 aSerrouya, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5233-60811 aHervieux, Dave1 aBoutin, Stan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6317-038X0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2021 Nov., v. 85, no. 8 p.1685-1698dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.221113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015500168520115000323592002801473650003701501650001301538650001601551650001301567650001601580650002201596650002001618650001801638650001401656650002401670650001601694650001701710650001601727650001701743650001901760650002601779650001401805650001301819650002401832653003701856653002401893653002201917653003401939653001601973700001501989700001602004700001402020700001702034700001802051700001702069700001602086700001702102773009602119856008702215852000902302655001202311IND60724256220221119075158.0220606e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1078982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yiheng10aDevelopment of a colorimetric and fluorescence dual-mode immunoassay for the precise identification of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris in apple juice  aAlicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is the main hazardous factor leading to deterioration of commercialized fruit juices, as it can result in serious economic loss to the industry. Currently detection methods require high-end equipment with low specificity and sensitivity. To address these problems, we describe herein a monoclonal antibody with high specificity to A. acidoterrestris using a cell wall protein as antigen. A colorimetric and fluorescence dual-mode immunoassay system employing the prepared antibody was then developed based on the quenching effect of oxidized p-phenylenediamine on fluorescein. This approach could accurately differentiate between the target of interest and other bacteria species with enhanced limit of detection of 4.8 × 10² CFU/mL. Apple juice artificially contaminated with A. acidoterrestris at the concentration of 1 CFU/mL could be determined as positive after 24 h enrichment. The resulting immunoassay platform provided a rapid, convenient, sensitive, and selective way for detecting A. acidoterrestris, holding great potential as a robust tool for preventing spoilage in the fruit juice industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlicyclobacillus acidoterrestris 3aantigens 3aapple juice 3abacteria 3acolorimetry 3acommercialization 3adetection limit 3adeterioration 3aequipment 3afinancial economics 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3afood safety 3aimmunoassays 3ajuice industry 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aoxidation 3aspoilage 3astructural proteins 0aAlicyclobacillus acidoterrestris 0aMonoclonal antibody 0aCell wall protein 0aColorimetric and fluorescence 0aImmunoassay1 aSun, Yuhan1 aQu, Xiaowei1 aZhou, Lei1 aWang, Zhouli1 aGao, Zhenpeng1 aHu, Zhongqiu1 aYue, Tianli1 aYuan, Yahong0 tFood control.g2021 June, v. 124 p.107898-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1078983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013400173300001600307520104800323592002801371650001901399650002501418650002501443650002201468650001201490650001501502650001501517650001201532650002101544653004201565653002501607653002801632653002801660773013201688856008401820852000901904655001201913IND60121753620221118070408.0150324e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012175362DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7438822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohansson, Johanna10aWhy do forest companies change their CSR strategies? Responses to market demands and public regulation through dual-certification  ap. 349-368.  aCertification represents a comparatively new means of CSR, which is important in the forest industry. Forest companies and industries have previously certified their management and products in accordance with one of the competing systems (FSC: Forest Stewardship Council and PEFC: Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), but recently, important large-scale companies in several countries have started to certify under both schemes. This study explores the causes and effects of this change in strategies, drawing on semi-structured interviews with Swedish forest companies and industries and European retailers. The results show that public bodies, not the least in the EU, as well as ENGOs, have transformed customer demands, resulting in dual-certification. This change in strategies has the potential to alter corporate environmental practices throughout the supply chains. These results call for further research on the under-studied issue of the interaction between public regulation and private forest governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abusiness enterprises 3aforest certification 3aforest industries 3aforests 3agovernance 3ainterviews 3amarkets 3aprivate forestry 0acorporate social responsibility (CSR) 0aforest certification 0atimber trade regulation 0aresponsible procurement0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2014 Mar. 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.349-368dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2012.7438823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245013000202300001600332500002000348520127300368592002801641596005801669650002701727650002301754650003001777650002201807650000901829650001501838650002201853650001501875650002501890650002101915700006001936700006201996773013902058856007502197852000902272655001202281IND60771941220221120083429.0220330e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077194122DNAL7 a10.1002/saj2.203612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunahashi, Fumiaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3042-715514aThe effects of soil solarization and application of a Trichoderma biocontrol agent on soil fungal and prokaryotic communities  ap. 369-383.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil solarization and biological control are two management strategies that have been used globally to manage soil‐borne plant pathogens. However, the broader effects of these strategies on soil microbial communities have not been well described. Soil prokaryotic and fungal communities were investigated by environmental DNA amplicon sequencing as part of field trials conducted in San Rafael, CA, and in Corvallis, OR. We examined microbial community changes following soil solarization, amendment with the biocontrol agent Trichoderma asperellum (TA), or solarization followed by application of the biocontrol agent. Soil solarization caused significant changes to prokaryotic and fungal communities by reducing species richness and diversity. Soil water potential was determined to be a significant factor affecting the prokaryotic community. Application of TA to solarized or nonsolarized soil did not significantly alter the microbial communities. However, solarization resulted in diminished microbial densities that appeared to enhance subsequent establishment of the biocontrol agent. This study revealed how specific environmental variables of heat intensity and soil moisture contribute to changes in the abundance of individual taxa and taxonomic groups.  aPublisher supplied data  aFarm BillcAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service 3aTrichoderma asperellum 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aenvironmental DNA 3aheat 3asoil fungi 3asoil solarization 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3aspecies richness1 aMyrold, David D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6418-226X1 aParke, Jennifer L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2812-45420 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2022 Mar., v. 86, no. 2 p.369-383dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.203613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007400167300001400241520118300255592002801438650001201466650001301478650001501491650001201506650001801518651001001536651002501546653002101571653001501592653001001607653002101617653001701638653001301655700001901668773010501687856008501792852000901877655001201886IND60517702420221121153709.0160405e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051770242DNAL7 a10.1080/21580103.2015.10189612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProto, A.R.10aFirewood cable extraction in the southern Mediterranean area of Italy  ap. 16-23.  aThis research assesses the efficiency and the costs of different cable cranes used in harvesting, in the forests of the southern Mediterranean area of Italy. During the study process a total of 100 cycle times were recorded in order to obtain the average performance. The cable cranes were tested in six different sites. Machine costs make up an essential part of timber harvesting costs; it is necessary to analyze these costs in order to decide which methods or machine types to use. Costs have been calculated using a standard hourly method. The present investigation showed that the three cable cranes extracted inferior volumes of timber compared to their load potential; in fact, the average extracted volume was inferior compared to the load capacity of the carriage. Nevertheless, from the comparison between cost per m ³ and the market price of firewood, sufficient margins of value for the producer emerged. The level of productivity analyzed on these different sites showed that unproductive time influenced the extraction costs of wood. In fact, when the three cable cranes were productive the extraction cost of 1 m ³ of firewood varied from €20.89 to €27.84.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforests 3afuelwood 3aharvesting 3alogging 3amarket prices 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 0acable extraction 0atime study 0acosts 0aforest operation 0aproductivity 0afirewood1 aZimbalatti, G.0 tForest Science and Technology.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 12, no. 1 p.16-23dTaylor & Francisx2158-07157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21580103.2015.10189613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011800174300001600292520101000308592002801318650001801346650002201364650001301386650001701399650001501416650002501431651001301456653002601469653003001495653002501525653002601550653001901576700002301595700001601618700002701634773013201661856008401793852000901877655001201886IND60121753720221118070402.0150324e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012175372DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7453962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadis ʼAlamāyahu,10aWastewater management in Ethiopian higher learning institutions: functionality, sustainability and policy context  ap. 369-383.  aThis study investigates the existing wastewater management situation in Ethiopia, with particular emphasis on university campus wastewater. The investigation was carried out by reviewing literature, reports, policy documents and field visits integrated with laboratory assessment. It was established that from the seven universities only two have functional wastewater treatment plants, but none of them meet effluent standards. These mainly centrally prescribed systems lack sustainability because of problems related to technology choice, affordability and technical skills. This paper proposes feasible rehabilitation strategies for the existing wastewater systems. A combination of policy instruments and integrated wastewater management strategies are proposed. Although based on specific data from Ethiopia, the findings and recommendations of this study also apply to other, similar, low-income countries where the population is booming but overall wastewater management planning is lagging behind.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 3auniversities 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aEthiopia 0auniversity wastewater 0awaste stabilisation ponds 0aenvironmental policy 0awastewater management 0asustainability1 ade Geyter, Adriaan1 aSmets, Ilse1 aBruggen, Bart van der,0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2014 Mar. 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.369-383dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2012.7453963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245005700157520126900214592002801483650002201511650002601533650002201559650001301581650001301594650001701607700001901624773012601643856007301769852000901842655001201851IND60651784320221119123833.0190712e20160314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065178432DNAL7 a10.3390/su80302692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewman, Galen10aPriorities for Advancing the Concept of New Ruralism  aCivic expansion and land use migrations to urban peripheries can accelerate the conversion of agricultural land uses. Widespread trepidation concerning urban sprawl has led to innovative frameworks for conserving or enhancing farmland. New Ruralism is one such framework, linking farmland preservation with developmental plans to reduce farmland conversion and low density development. Although the concept is still evolving, recent support for New Ruralism has grown. One of the most important factors in creating a New Ruralism-based development is coherent policy for permanent agricultural preserves. These preserves require the simultaneous, careful planning of land preservation balanced with the location of future development. This paper discusses the current condition of farmland loss and reviews issues and challenges associated with farmland preservation with existing New Ruralism developments. The goal is to synthesize this information into recommendations for increasing farmland preservation opportunities in New Ruralism-based developments. A more comprehensive definition for New Ruralism is presented, accompanied by several priorities for maximizing the economic, environmental, and cultural viability of New Ruralism-based farmland preserves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3afarmland preservation 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3aplanning 3aurbanization1 aSaginor, Jesse0 tSustainability.g2016 Mar. 14, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80302693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006300145245017000208300001800378500002000396520109200416592002801508596002501536596006401561596005701625650000801682650001501690650002101705650001901726650001501745650001101760650001801771650003001789650002401819650001601843650001601859650001701875650001301892650001501905650002601920700006701946700005702013700006502070700006202135773013102197856008002328852000902408655001202417IND60775768920221120161202.0220428e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077576892DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.157762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbu Bakar, Nurlizah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9238-588910aProtein homeostasis, regulation of energy production and activation of DNA damage‐repair pathways are involved in the heat stress response of Pseudogymnoascus spp.  ap. 1849-1864.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProteome changes can be used as an instrument to measure the effects of climate change, predict the possible future state of an ecosystem and the direction in which is headed. In this study, proteomic and gene ontology functional enrichment analysis of six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolated from various global biogeographical regions were carried out to determine their response to heat stress. In total, 2122 proteins were identified with high confidence. Comparative quantitative analysis showed that changes in proteome profiles varied greatly between isolates from different biogeographical regions. Although the identities of the proteins that changed varied between the different regions, the functions they governed were similar. Gene ontology analysis showed enrichment of proteins involved in multiple protective mechanisms, including the modulation of protein homeostasis, regulation of energy production and activation of DNA damage and repair pathways. Our proteomic analysis did not show any clear relationship between protein changes and the strains' biogeographical origins.  aPublisher supplied data  cMajlis Amanah Rakyat  aIOES‐2014GcMinistry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia  aRP026A‐18SUScUniversiti Malaya Research Programme 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aPseudogymnoascus 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3agene ontology 3ageographical distribution 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3ahomeostasis 3amicrobiology 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis1 aLau, Benjamin Yii Chung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7211-82841 aSmykla, Jerzy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8228-66951 aKarsani, Saiful Anuar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1617-95541 aAlias, Siti Aisyah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6759-57450 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2022 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.1849-1864dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.157763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245005800197300001600255500002000271520187000291592002802161650000802189650001402197650001602211650001802227650001402245650001402259650001402273650001902287651001702306651001102323700005802334773010202392856007402494852000902568655001202577IND60787248420221116154442.0220808e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078724842DNAL7 a10.1002/tax.122832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoque, Nádia,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2103-917X10aVickia, a new genus of tribe Gochnatieae (Compositae)  ap. 668-678.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe tribe Gochnatieae is restricted to America. A recent molecular study including over 60% of the species of the tribe was carried out to untangle evolutionary relationships among the taxa. Eight supported clades were recovered as monophyletic genera, while Gochnatia s.l. was revealed as paraphyletic and currently restricted to the Central Andes. Gochnatia rotundifolia was not included in this phylogeny since extracted DNA from few and old collections from Brazil was unusuable. Since Cabrera's treatment of Gochnatia s.l., this species has received special attention due to its distinct morphological characters when compared with the other monophyletic genera of Gochnatieae. Therefore, this paper aims to provide new evidence that supports Gochnatia rotundifolia to be described as a separate monospecific genus based on a morphological study and a maximum parsimony (MP) analysis. A total of 21 species were studied. The leaf venation was analysed using digital X‐ray capture (VIVA–Varian Image viewing & Aquisition). Seventeen morphological characters obtained from vegetative and floral parts of the plants were included in the data matrix. Our results reinforce the placement of Gochnatia rotundifolia within the tribe Gochnatieae. Gochnatia rotundifolia is consistently recovered in a clade as sister to the Cnicothamnus‐Richterago group. The species differs from the other genera of the tribe by an actinodromous basal leaf venation with three primary veins, and pappus elements composed by (50–)60–75 bristles, sometimes almost flat setae, arranged in 2 or 3 series, unequal in length. Our results support Gochnatia rotundifolia as the sole species Vickia rotundifolia comb. nov. in a new genus of Gochnatieae, Vickia gen. nov. The new genus is described, illustrated, and a generic identification key for the tribe Gochnatieae is provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGochnatia 3aX-radiation 3aleaf venation 3amonophyly 3anew genus 3aparaphyly 3ataxonomic keys 3aAndes region 3aBrazil1 aSancho, Gisela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9323-65350 tTaxon.g2020 Aug., v. 69, no. 4 p.668-678dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:1964x0040-02627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tax.122833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011600173300001600289520109000305592002801395650002901423650001101452650001301463650001701476653001301493653001601506653001201522653001901534653001101553700002101564700002801585700002101613700002701634773013201661856008401793852000901877655001201886IND60121753820221118070352.0150324e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012175382DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7469362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendoza, Elsa R.H.10aRevisiting the knowledge exchange train: scaling up dialogue and partnering for participatory regional planning  ap. 384-402.  aIn an integrated world, knowledge exchange is becoming more important for empowerment to participate in planning processes. This is particularly the case in areas undergoing rapid change and with unequal stakeholder constituencies. The ‘knowledge exchange train’ (KET) model was designed to address knowledge inequalities and large-scale change by disseminating the results of new research rapidly and on a large scale. The KET involves two-way dissemination of knowledge as a means to support the formation of partnerships and participation in regional environmental planning. We compare three KET experiences in the southwestern Amazon: comparisons of KET I and II highlight adjustments in the model to amplify two-way exchange and to focus on key planning issues, and comparisons of KET II to III show how KET fosters partnerships for downstream environmental planning and management activities. KETs thus address knowledge inequalities and catalyse follow-on environmental management activities, both of which facilitate public participation in regional environmental planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3aplanning 3astakeholders 0aplanning 0aenvironment 0aclimate 0ainfrastructure 0aAmazon1 aPerz, Stephen G.1 aSouza da Silva, Sonaira1 aBrown, I.

Animals defecated 10–19 times hd⁻¹ day⁻¹, producing feces of 2.2–3.5 kg DM and 33–73 g N per animal per day. The DM and N concentrations of feces ranged from 157–207 g DM kg⁻¹ and 14.8−23.1 g (kg DM)⁻¹, respectively. Occurrence of defecation was spatially heterogeneous, with feces being concentrated mainly on areas for resting (forest roads, ridges and valleys) and moving (forest roads and along fence lines). Decomposition of dung pats was considerably slow, showing the rates of 1.37–3.05 mg DM (g DM)⁻¹ day⁻¹ as DM loss. Decomposition was further slower on the basis of N release, 0.51–1.63 mg N (g N)⁻¹ day⁻¹, resulting in steadily increased N concentrations of dung pats with time after deposition. The results show that introduction of livestock into a forest (i.e., forest grazing) may limit nutrient availability to plants, by redistributing nutrients into areas with no vegetation (bare land and streams) and by establishing a large N pool as feces due to an imbalance between deposition and slow release, though further studies are necessary for investigating the occurrence of slow dung decomposition in other forest situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChamaecyparis obtusa 3acattle manure 3aconifers 3adefecation 3afeces 3afences 3aforest roads 3aforests 3agrazing 3alivestock 3anitrogen content 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aplantations 3asilvopastoral systems 3astreams 3avalleys 3aJapan1 aHasegawa, Nobumi1 aNomura, Maki1 aIto, Haruko1 aNogami, Kangoro1 aSonoda, Tatsunobu0 tEcological research.g2009 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.119-125dSpringer Japanx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-008-0488-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005100144245015000195300001800345520153400363592002801897650001301925650001301938650002201951650003401973650001502007650001802022650001102040650001502051650001502066650001502081650002102096650001102117650001902128653002302147653003002170653001402200653002002214653003102234653001602265700001502281700001502296700005502311700001502366700001802381700001102399773013902410856007802549852000902627655001202636IND60680966020221120200838.0200110e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068096602DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b188232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Lu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4857-220610aDesign of an Ultrasensitive Flexible Bend Sensor Using a Silver-Doped Oriented Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Nanofiber Web for Respiratory Monitoring  ap. 1359-1367.  aWe propose a design strategy to fabricate a flexible bend sensor (BS) with ultrasensitivity toward airflow using all-poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofiber web-based sensing elements and electrodes to monitor human respiration. The unique electrospinning (rotational speed of collector of 2000 rpm and tip-to-collector distance of 4 cm) with silver nanoparticle interfacing was introduced to prepare a Ag-doped oriented PVDF nanofiber web with high β-phase content as a sensing element (AgOriPVDF, β-phase crystallinity ∼44.5%). After that, a portion of the prepared AgOriPVDF was processed into a flexible and electrically conductive electrode through an electroless silver plating technique (SP-AgOriPVDF). Interestingly, the encapsulated AgOriPVDF BS with the SP-AgOriPVDF electrode exhibited superior piezoelectric bending response (open-circuit peak-to-peak output voltage, Vₚ–ₚ ≈ 4.6 V) to injected airflow, which is more than 200 times higher than that of the unpackaged randomly aligned PVDF nanofiber web BS with a conductive tape electrode (Vₚ–ₚ ≈ 0.02 V). In addition, the factors influencing the bend sensitivity of the BS such as the β-phase content, nanofiber orientation, flexibility of the electrode, and so forth were thoroughly analyzed and then discussed. We also demonstrated that the AgOriPVDF BS has sufficient capability to detect and identify various respiratory signals, presenting a great potential for wearable applications, for example, smart respiratory protective equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aair flow 3acrystal structure 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aencapsulation 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3ananofibers 3ananosilver 3asafety equipment 3asilver 3athermoplastics 0abend sensor design 0apoly(vinylidene fluoride) 0ananofiber 0aelectrospinning 0aelectroless silver plating 0arespiration1 aZheng, Yan1 aLiu, Zekun1 aLi, Jiashen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7333-52801 aZhai, Heng1 aChen, Zhongda1 aLi, Yi0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 12, no. 1 p.1359-1367dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b188233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245012200205300001600327500002000343520159000363592002801953596003901981596003902020650002202059650001702081650001302098650001402111650001902125650001402144650001102158650000902169650001302178650001702191650002102208651001602229700002302245700001702268700006602285700001902351773013902370856007502509852000902584655001202593IND60771941320221120083447.0220330e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077194132DNAL7 a10.1002/saj2.203822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharyya, Amrita1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2685-069810aFast redox switches lead to rapid transformation of goethite in humid tropical soils: A Mössbauer spectroscopy study  ap. 264-274.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHumid tropical forest soils experience frequent rainfall, which limits oxygen diffusion and creates redox heterogeneity in upland soils. In this study we gauged the effect of short‐term anoxic conditions on Fe mineralogy of relatively Fe‐ and C‐rich surface soils (C/Fe mole ratio ∼5) from a humid tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Soils subjected to 4‐d oxic/anoxic oscillation were characterized by selective chemical extractions, Mössbauer spectroscopy (MBS), and X‐ray diffraction. Chemical extraction data suggested that rapidly switching redox conditions had subtle effects on bulk Fe mineralogy. Mössbauer, on the other hand, indicated that (a) the soil Fe is a mixture of goethites of varying characteristics with minor contributions from ferrihydrite (<5%) and Fe(III)‐organic matter (OM) phases (∼10%), and (b) anoxic conditions rapidly transformed all forms of goethite to relatively stable Fe oxides. Such fast changes in goethite features could be due to rapid depletion and sorption of bio‐released structural Al or sorbed OM onto residual soil components. The rapid temporal changes in MBS parameters and corresponding pore water nominal oxidation state of C values suggest that Fe‐C transformations in these upland tropical soils are complex and intricately coupled. A comprehensive understanding of the fate of Fe, Al, and OM (Fe‐organic moieties) during redox switches and concurrent changes in pore water chemistry is critical for development of robust transport models in humid tropical soils, which are subject to episodic low‐redox events.  aPublisher supplied data  aSCW1478cU.S. Department of Energy  aSCW1632cU.S. Department of Energy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aferrihydrite 3agoethite 3ahighlands 3ahydrochemistry 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3arain 3asorption 3aspectroscopy 3atropical forests 3aPuerto Rico1 aKukkadapu, Ravi K.1 aBowden, Mark1 aPett‐Ridge, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4439-23981 aNico, Peter S.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2022 Mar., v. 86, no. 2 p.264-274dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.203823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01250naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001100142245013600153300001600289500001500305520018400320592002800504650001600532650001700548651001000565651001000575653001100585653001700596653001400613653001500627653001500642700001800657700001700675773010900692856007800801852000900879655001200888IND60127340920221122051137.0151110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012734092DNAL7 a10.1653/024.095.04242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hu10aFirst Record of the Leafhopper Genus Igerna (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Megophthalminae) in China with a Description of a New Species  ap. 979-982.  a2019-12-04  aIgerna Kirkaldy is reported for the first time from China.

Particularly in cities, strategic interventions are made to support a transition towards sustainable mobility. Incumbent actors from the car industry are often invited to play a key role in such initiatives. The Stuttgart region is supported with public money to become a model region of sustainable mobility because it is base to key actors of the German car industry. This paper examines the locus of agency in such a “transition arena”. How do key actors frame the challenge of sustainable mobility? What role is attributed to public policy at various governance levels and to the “local” industry, respectively? In the case of the Stuttgart region, we find a high ability of key industry actors to reframe transition initiatives for sustainable mobility and align public policy with their interests—particularly in local, i.e., place-bound contexts. This underlines the need for transition studies to pay more attention to the agency of incumbent actors and their capacity to absorb sustainable alternatives without changing dominant industry structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3agovernance 3apublic policy 3asustainable technology 3atransportation industry1 aRohracher, Harald1 avon Radecki, Alanus0 tSustainability.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80302523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245013300205300001600338520122400354592002801578650002201606650002401628650001201652650001501664650001701679653003001696653001801726653002001744653003201764700001401796700001601810700001601826700001701842773010201859856008301961852000902044655001202053IND60644838020221117190724.0190718e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064483802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Xiaohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5221-539110aHighly efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution over edge-modified phosphorene quantum dot/prussian blue skeleton structure  ap. 401-408.  aFacile liquid precipitation method assisted by liquid phase stripping has been used to prepare phosphorene quantum dot modified prussian blue porous skeleton structure. In this structure, the CN– group in prussian blue has larger chemical electronegativity than phosphorus atom, which can not only passivate the edges of phosphorene nanostructure, but also desire the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum band edge positions of black phosphorus for hydrogen generation in electrocatalytic water splitting. Moreover, the prussian blue porous network can be used as the support for phosphorene quantum dot and the medium for electron transport. This prussian blue supported phosphorene quantum dot porous network exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance with an over-potential of 148 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 79 mV dec−1, which drastically surpass those of the black phosphorus. In addition, both the consecutive cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic test reveal the outstanding electrocatalytic stability of the composite. This construction based on edge-modified phosphorene nanostructure presents efficient electrocatalys activity for water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrogen production 3aliquids 3aphosphorus 3aquantum dots 0aEdge-modified phosphorene 0aPrussian blue 0aElectrocatalyst 0aHydrogen evolution reaction1 aLiu, Lang1 aLi, Xiaohui1 aGao, Shasha1 aYang, Tongyu0 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 June, v. 374 p.401-408dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007400170300001800244520129000262592002801552650001301580650001101593650001101604650001601615650001901631650001501650650001701665650001801682700001701700700001501717700001901732700001601751700001701767700001401784773008201798856008601880852000901966655001201975IND60085030320221119120747.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008503032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolland, S.A.10aBenchmark experiments for simulations of a vertical axis wind turbine  ap. 1183-1194.  aDriven by the need to verify a CFD model of a novel vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) device, a 1.6m diameter prototype was designed, built to a high specification and tolerance and then tested in the industry standard MIRA wind tunnel over the full wind range that might be expected in an urban environment. Although the original intention was simply to provide data to verify a CFD model of the specific device – documented separately – it was realised that given (a) the repeatability and quality of the experimental data, and (b) its utility for the authors in verifying their CFD simulations, the data itself might well form the basis for a requirement for a reliable benchmark for the wind engineering community in assessing CFD simulation technology against a specific VAWT device design with the complexity of a housing. The experiments cover a full range of operational conditions for a specific design including the variation of wind speed, wind direction, tip speed ratio and blade pitch angle, recorded in the experiments as well as the torque output and the pressure levels at a range of specific locations. Over 60 tests were carried out in such a way as to assess the repeatability of the measurements; the results showed an overall remarkable degree of consistency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aindustry 3amodels 3atorque 3aurban areas 3awind direction 3awind speed 3awind tunnels 3awind turbines1 aThatcher, M.1 aNewton, W.1 aWilliams, A.J.1 aCroft, T.N.1 aGethin, D.T.1 aCross, M.0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.1183-1194dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007000159300001800229520163100247592002801878650002601906650001101932650002601943650001001969650001601979650001101995650001502006650001802021650001402039650003102053650001302084650001202097650002202109700001902131700002102150700001502171700002602186773013502212856007502347852000902422655001202431IND60783277420221116203821.0220719e20220718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078327742DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cs01414a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinnane, Emily14aThe uptake of metal–organic frameworks: a journey into the cell  ap. 6065-6086.  aThe application of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in drug delivery has advanced rapidly over the past decade, showing huge progress in the development of novel systems. Although a large number of versatile MOFs that can carry and release multiple compounds have been designed and tested, one of the main limitations to their translation to the clinic is the limited biological understanding of their interaction with cells and the way they penetrate them. This is a crucial aspect of drug delivery, as MOFs need to be able not only to enter into cells but also to release their cargo in the correct intracellular location. While small molecules can enter cells by passive diffusion, nanoparticles (NPs) usually require an energy-dependent process known as endocytosis. Importantly, the fate of NPs after being taken up by cells is dependent on the endocytic pathways they enter through. However, no general guidelines for MOF particle internalization have been established due to the inherent complexity of endocytosis as a mechanism, with several factors affecting cellular uptake, namely NP size and surface chemistry. In this review, we cover recent advances regarding the understanding of the mechanisms of uptake of nano-sized MOFs (nanoMOFs)s, their journey inside the cell, and the importance of biological context in their final fate. We examine critically the impact of MOF physicochemical properties on intracellular trafficking and successful cargo delivery. Finally, we highlight key unanswered questions on the topic and discuss the future of the field and the next steps for nanoMOFs as drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3adesign 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aendocytosis 3afields 3aguidelines 3ananoparticles 3aparticles 3aphysicochemical properties 3asurfaces 3atesting 3auptake mechanisms1 aHaddad, Salame1 aMelle, Francesca1 aMei, Zihan1 aFairen-Jimenez, David0 tChemical Society reviews.g2022 July 18, v. 51, no. 14 p.6065-6086dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs01414a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009700174300001400271520178800285592002802073650002302101650001702124650001602141650001102157650000902168650001402177650001202191650001502203650001002218650001202228650002002240650001402260650001402274650001102288650002202299650002102321650001402342653002402356653002302380653001102403653002102414653001202435653001702447653002102464700003202485700002302517700002902540700003102569700002802600773011602628856008202744852000902826655001202835IND60628942220221120040723.0190318e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062894222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2018.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValverde-Garcia, Pablo10aSublethal effects of mixed fungal infections on the Moroccan locust, Dociostaurus maroccanus  ap. 61-69.  aThe effects of single and mixed infections with Beauveria bassiana (EABb 90/2-Dm) and Metarhizium acridum (IMI 330189) strains on survival, feeding and reproduction of thermoregulating Dociostaurus maroccanus were evaluated. Adult locusts (2–3 days post fledging) were treated with low dosages of both fungal pathogens alone and in mixture (total dosage for single treatments and combinations = 1 × 102 and 1 × 103 spores per insect). M. acridum IMI 330189 was more virulent than B. bassiana EABb 90/2-Dm at both dosages. In the mixed infections, in which half of the infective units of the more virulent pathogen were replaced by the less virulent pathogen, the analysis of the cumulative insect mortality after 30 days suggested additive interaction in the lethal effects between the two strains. All fungal treatments, except EABb 90/2-Dm at 1 × 102 spores per insect showed reduction in per capita feeding, as indicated by fecal production per insect per day when insects were maintained at 27 ± 2 °C (32–51% of reduction compared with the control); but only IMI 330189 caused significant reduction in per capita feeding (50%) when those insects were allowed to thermoregulate. Both strains and their mixtures caused a significant reduction of locust fecundity, with a 21–53% reduction in the number of egg-pods per female, and 30–65% reduction in the number of fertile eggs per female. In both sublethal effects (feeding and fecundity) a potential antagonistic interaction between the fungal strains was detected. Locust fecundity (egg-pods per female) and per capita feeding were positively correlated (r = 0.783). Implications of these findings on the potential use of both strains to control D. maroccanus populations are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aDociostaurus 3aMetarhizium 3aadults 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3afledglings 3afungi 3alocusts 3amixed infection 3amortality 3apathogens 3aspores 3asublethal effects 3athermoregulation 3avirulence 0aMetarhizium acridum 0aBeauveria bassiana 0aLocust 0aMixed infections 0aFeeding 0aReproduction 0aThermoregulation1 aSantiago-Álvarez, Cándido1 aThomas, Matthew B.1 aMaranhao, Elizabeth A.A.1 aGarrido-Jurado, Inmaculada1 aQuesada-Moraga, Enrique0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2019 Feb., v. 161 p.61-69dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2018.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011100163300001600274520078900290592002801079596005901107650002601166650002301192650002301215650001001238650002501248650002201273650001401295650001801309650001701327700002001344700001801364700002101382700001801403773013201421856008201553852000901635655001201644IND60608910720221123044953.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060891072DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-017-0830-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li-Ru14aThe complete chloroplast genome sequence of an endangered species, Dendrobium pendulum Roxb.

D. pendulum is 153,248 bp in length. The complete cp genome sequence has a typical quadripartite structure, comprising a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions of 26,398 bp, a large single-copy (LSC) region of 85,852 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 14,600 bp. The chloroplast genome contains 131 genes (124 unique), including 78 protein-coding genes, 8 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and 38 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. The overall GC content of the whole genome is 37.5%. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the D. pendulum is mostly related taxa with Dendrobium officinale which forms a sister group to the Dendrobium.  aPublisher supplied data  a31670299cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aDendrobium officinale 3achloroplast genome 3aendangered species 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aornamental plants 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3atransfer RNA1 aWang, Shi-Qiang1 aNiu, Jun-Feng1 aWang, Shangbing,1 aWang, Zhe-Zhi0 tConservation genetics resources.g2018 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.383-385dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000001672x1877-72527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-017-0830-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012300167300001600290520094400306592002801250650001901278650001901297650002101316650001801337651001001355653003801365653001001403653001501413653002301428653001701451773013201468856008401600852000901684655001201693IND60121754120221118070400.0150324e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012175412DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7502362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jinshan10aAssessing China's discriminative tax on Clean Development Mechanism projects. Does China's tax have so many functions?  ap. 447-466.  aIn the practice of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), many CDM host countries heavily rely on high Global Warming Potential (GWP) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) projects. Among them, China might be unique in that it imposes a discriminative tax on projects dealing with high GWP GHGs. The Chinese government takes 65% of the carbon credits from HFC-23 (trifluoromethane) projects, 30% from N ₂O (nitrous oxide) projects, but only 2% from other types of projects. Previous studies have expected that this tax has multiple effects: rent-seeking effect, a deterrent effect on the HFC-23 and N ₂O projects, a channelling effect that switches the investment from HFC-23 and N ₂O projects to other types of projects, and a market distortion effect. However, with the positive analysis and empirical evidence, the present study shows that this tax only has rent-seeking effect, thus China's discriminative tax has been over read.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon markets 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3anitrous oxide 3aChina 0aClean Development Mechanism (CDM) 0aChina 0acarbon tax 0adiscriminative tax 0awindfall tax0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2014 Mar. 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.447-466dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2012.7502363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013400173300001600307520094800323592002801271650001801299650001601317650002101333650003501354650001601389650002201405650001101427650001601438650002001454650002201474651001001496653002701506653000801533653002101541653001101562653001101573653001101584700001901595700001901614700002401633700002201657773013201679856008401811852000901895655001201904IND60121754220221118070415.0150324e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012175422DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7506002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehera, Sailesh N.13aAn approach for evaluation of proposed air pollution control strategy to reduce levels of nitrogen oxides in an urban environment  ap. 467-494.  aIn this study, an atmospheric dispersion model along with a systematic emission inventory was used to explore the possible control strategy to reduce ambient levels of nitrogen oxides (NO ₓ) in Kanpur city, India. A GIS based emission inventory of NO ₓ was developed for the base, 5th and 10th years. It was observed that the 5th and 10th years will experience increased emissions by factors of 1.7 and 2.5 of the base year if no control policy is implemented. Seventeen control options (i.e. introduction of Euro 6 to vehicles, banning of 15-year old private vehicles etc.) were considered for evaluation through the dispersion modelling. A control scenario comprising the following control options (1) implementation of Euro 6 for vehicles, (2) compressed natural gas (CNG) for commercial and public vehicles, etc. was found to be most effective in reducing the ambient NO ₓ levels and attaining a 24-hour average air quality standard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aemissions factor 3ageographic information systems 3ainventories 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anatural gas 3anitrogen oxides 3apollution control 3aIndia 0aair quality management 0aNOx 0acontrol scenario 0aEuro 6 0aArcGIS 0aISCST31 aSharma, Mukesh1 aNayak, Pranati1 aShukla, Sheo Prasad1 aGargava, Prashant0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2014 Apr. 1, v. 57, no. 4 p.467-494dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2012.7506003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245015300162300001600315500001900331520153400350592002801884650001901912650001501931650002401946650001001970650002201980650001402002650001302016650002402029650001302053650001102066650002002077650001702097650001502114651001002129653001602139653002102155653002402176653004002200653001102240700001702251700001902268700001802287700001802305700002502323773017702348856007802525852000902603655001202612IND60711029920221120223051.0200915e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071102992DNAL7 a10.21273/JASHS04896-202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKou, Jingjing10aComparative Study of Ripening Related Gene Expression and Postharvest Physiological Changes between Astringent and Nonastringent Persimmon Cultivars  ap. 203-212.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a‘Mopan’ persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) is a traditional astringent cultivar of persimmon and ‘Yoho’ persimmon (D. kaki) is a newly introduced Japanese nonastringent type of cultivar in northern China. Studies were conducted to investigate the physiological changes and expression of ripening-related genes in the postharvest process at different periods under the effects of endogenous ethylene in both cultivars. Persimmons were harvested and stored under room temperature for 20 days. An analysis of physiological changes showed significant differences between the two cultivars. Total soluble solids declined in ‘Mopan’ fruit, whereas those in ‘Yoho’ fruit increased during storage. Firmness, color, index of absorbance difference, total and soluble tannin contents, ethylene production, and respiration rates showed the same trend, but these values vary by cultivar. ‘Mopan’ fruit softened rapidly after harvest and attained edible quality in 20 days, with an increased rate of softening accompanied by increased expression of ripening-related genes. In contract, ‘Yoho’ fruit softening occurred slowly and did not soften even after 20 days, with minimal accumulation of the ripening-related genes. The information obtained from this study demonstrates that cell wall-hydrolyzing enzymes, the de-astringent process, and endogenous ethylene have critical roles in postharvest ripening, gene expression, and physiological property changes of ‘Mopan’ and ‘Yoho’ persimmon fruit during storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiospyros kaki 3aabsorbance 3aambient temperature 3acolor 3acomparative study 3acultivars 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afruits 3agene expression 3ahorticulture 3apersimmons 3aChina 0aastringency 0acell wall enzyme 0apostharvest quality 0areal-time polymerase chain reaction 0aRT-PCR1 aZhao, Zhihui1 aWang, Wenjiang1 aWei, Chuangqi1 aGuan, Junfeng1 aFerence, Christopher0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2020 May, v. 145, no. 3 p.203-212dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS04896-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01699naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245009300172300001600265520072700281592002801008650001301036650002001049650002001069650001801089650002201107700001601129700002101145700001801166700001601184773010701200856005701307852000901364655001201373IND4468831420221121053154.0120907e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446883142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1991.tb05321.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRAMASWAMY, H.10aFeed‐back Temperature Control System for Microwave Ovens Using a Shielded Thermocouple  ap. 550-552.  aA dynamic system was developed and evaluated to continuously monitor product temperature in ovens using an aluminum shielded thermocouple. The signal was processed by a computer controlled feedback relay to turn the magnetron on or off relative to a preselected setpoint. Results indicated the temperature of water (> 100 mL) could readily be maintained within 1°C of the setpoint. Temperatures for small samples (∼5 mL) could also be controlled, however, they required use of an additional microwave heat‐sink in the oven cavity to prevent temperature overshooting. The thermocouple based feed‐back temperature control system worked well and provided a simple way to control sample temperature in a microwave oven.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3amicrowave ovens 3aprocess control 3athermocouples 3awater temperature1 aVOORT, F.R.1 aRAGHAVAN, G.S.V.1 aLIGHTFOOT, D.1 aTIMBERS, G.0 tJournal of food science.g1991 Mar., v. 56, no. 2 p.550-552dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1991.tb05321.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010300167300001600270520119300286592002801479650001401507650001501521650001801536650002101554650001401575650002101589650001101610650001701621650001501638653002501653653002401678653001601702653001201718653002101730700001701751700001601768700001601784700001701800773011401817856008601931852000902017655001202026IND60611945720221121034937.0201125e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061194572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.08.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhuqiu10aEnhanced removal of gaseous 1,3-dichlorobenzene in biotrickling filters by rhamnolipid and Mg (II)  ap. 571-577.  aIn this study, the effect of rhamnolipid and Mg (II) on microbial growth and 1,3-dichlorobenzene removal was investigated in two identical lab-scale biotrickling filters (named BTF1 and BTF2). The contact angle and Henry’s constant were detected at various concentrations of rhamnolipid and the results indicated that rhamnolipid is able to effectively improve the solubility of 1,3-dichlorobenzene in medium. The results of the experiments in BTFs showed that the optimal concentrations of rhamnolipid and Mg (II) were 170 mg/L and 2 mg/L, respectively. The removal efficiency (RE) of 1,3-dichlorobenzene decreased from 100% to 57.13% for BTF1 that was not fed with rhamnolipid and Mg (II) and from 100% to 86.26% for BTF2 that was fed with rhamnolipid and Mg (II) when the inlet loading rate increased from 2.87 to 83.83 g/(m³ h) at an empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 60 s. The dissolved oxygen (DO) was analyzed throughout the entire period and the results showed that the two additives can significantly promote oxygen transfer.

The general mechanism of action of the T6SS is similar to the injection of DNA by contractile bacteriophages. The cytoplasmic portion of the T6SS is evolutionarily, structurally and functionally related to the phage tail complex. It is composed of an inner tube made of stacked Hcp hexameric rings, engulfed within a sheath and built on a baseplate. This sheath undergoes cycles of extension and contraction, and the current model proposes that the sheath contraction propels the inner tube toward the target cell for effector delivery. The sheath comprises two subunits: TssB and TssC that polymerize under an extended conformation. Here, we show that isolated TssB forms trimers, and we report the crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of TssB. This fragment comprises a long helix followed by a helical hairpin that presents surface-exposed charged residues. Site-directed mutagenesis coupled to functional assay further showed that these charges are required for proper assembly of the sheath. Positioning of these residues in the extended T6SS sheath structure suggests that they may mediate contacts with the baseplate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3acrystal structure 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3apolymerization 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atype VI secretion system 3aviral morphology 0aT6SS 0aEAEC 0aPCR 0aPDB 0aprotein secretion 0astructure 0aX-ray 0acontractile injection system 0asheath1 aLogger, Laureen1 aSpinelli, Silvia1 aBlangy, Stéphanie1 aCambillau, Christian1 aCascales, Eric0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2018 Feb. 02, v. 430, no. 3 p.297-309dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2017.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245007900204300001800283500002000301520136700321592002801688596008001716596011501796596006501911596005501976650001302031650001802044650002002062650001802082650001402100650001402114650001502128650001602143650001502159650001702174650001402191650001302205650001302218650001102231650002202242700005602264700006402320700006902384700006002453700006002513700006402573700005602637700005702693700006202750773013102812856008002943852000903023655001203032IND60775769720221121205057.0220428e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077576972DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.158382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetz, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3353-886210aFreshwater protists: unveiling the unexplored in a large floodplain system  ap. 1731-1745.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProtists play a fundamental role in all ecosystems, but we are still far from estimating the total diversity of many lineages, in particular in highly diverse environments, such as freshwater. Here, we survey the protist diversity of the Paraná River using metabarcoding, and we applied an approach that includes sequence similarity and phylogeny to evaluate the degree of genetic novelty of the protists' communities against the sequences described in the reference database PR². We observed that ~28% of the amplicon sequence variants were classified as novel according to their similarity with sequences from the reference database; most of them were related to heterotrophic groups traditionally overlooked in freshwater systems. This lack of knowledge extended to those groups within the green algae (Archaeplastida) that are well documented such as Mamiellophyceae, and also to the less studied Pedinophyceae, for which we found sequences representing novel deep‐branching clusters. Among the groups with potential novel protists, Bicosoecida (Stramenopiles) were the best represented, followed by Codosiga (Opisthokonta), and the Perkinsea (Alveolata). This illustrates the lack of knowledge on freshwater planktonic protists and also the need for isolation and/or cultivation of new organisms to better understand their role in ecosystem functioning.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT 2016‐0465cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica  aMYXOTROPIC VI (PGC2018‐094660‐B‐I00)cConsejería de Educación, Juventud y Deporte, Comunidad de Madrid  cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aSAD 2019 “PlastPerk” N°1537cRégion Bretagne 3aCodosiga 3aDNA barcoding 3aMamiellophyceae 3aPedinophyceae 3aPerkinsea 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3afloodplains 3afreshwater 3amicrobiology 3aphylogeny 3aplankton 3aprotists 3arivers 3asequence homology1 aHuber, Paula1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5411-77361 aAccattatis, Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6342-20381 aLopes dos Santos, Adriana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-49371 aBigeard, Estelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2256-89861 aUnrein, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8592-18581 aChambouvet, Aurélie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3932-00981 aNot, Fabrice1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9342-195X1 aLara, Enrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8500-522X1 aDevercelli, Melina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0464-29970 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2022 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.1731-1745dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.158383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245010300172300001400275520144800289592002801737650002701765650002101792650001501813650001301828650001901841650001601860650002801876650001501904650000901919650001101928650001501939650001601954650002001970650001301990653002702003653002902030653001602059653001002075700001102085700001802096700002102114700001502135700001802150773012802168856009002296852000902386655001202395IND60541158720221122220616.0190318e20150817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054115872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Yan-Xia10aActivation of the chromosomally encoded mazEFBif locus of Bifidobacterium longum under acid stress  ap. 16-22.  aToxin–antitoxin (TA) systems are distributed within the genomes of almost all free-living bacteria. Although the roles of chromosomally encoded TA systems are still under debate, they are suspected to be involved in various stress responses. Here, we provide the first report of a type II TA system in the probiotic bacterium Bifidobacterium longum. Bioinformatic analysis of the B. longum JDM301 genome identified a pair of linked genes encoding a MazEF-like TA system at the locus BLJ_811–BLJ_812. Our results showed that B. longum mazEFBif genes form a bicistronic operon. The over-expression of MazFBif was toxic to Escherichia coli and could be neutralized by the co-expression of its cognate antitoxin MazEBif. We demonstrated that MazEFBif was activated during acid stress, which would most likely be encountered in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, we found that the protease ClpPXBif, in addition to MazEFBif, was induced under acid stress. Furthermore, we examined antitoxin levels over time for MazEFBif and observed that the antitoxin MazEBif was degraded by ClpPXBif, which suggested that MazEFBif was activated through the hydrolysis of MazEBif by ClpP1XBif and ClpP2XBif under acid stress. Our results suggest that the MazEFBif TA module may play an important role in cell physiology and may represent a cell growth modulator that helps bacteria to cope with acid stress in the gastrointestinal tract and environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium longum 3aEscherichia coli 3aantitoxins 3abacteria 3abioinformatics 3acell growth 3agastrointestinal system 3ahydrolysis 3aloci 3aoperon 3aprobiotics 3aproteinases 3astress response 3atoxicity 0aBifidobacterium longum 0aToxin–antitoxin system 0aAcid stress 0aClpPX1 aYe, Lu1 aLiu, Dian-Bin1 aZhang, Zhuo-Yang1 aLiu, Chang1 aGuo, Xiao-Kui0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 Aug. 17, v. 207 p.16-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245015600163300001800319500001500337520125900352592002801611650001501639650001101654650002001665650001201685650002101697650003001718650004301748653001401791653003001805653002401835653003501859653002301894700002301917700001901940700001801959700001701977773011101994856007802105852000902183655001202192IND60127341620221120083941.0151110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012734162DNAL7 a10.1653/024.095.04312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrille, Gabriela10aParasitoid Niches of Encarsia formosa and Encarsia Lycopersici (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) Exploiting Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)  ap. 1024-1030.  a2019-12-04  aEncarsia formosa Gahan (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) is an aphelinid endoparasitoid of the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). Encarsia lycopersici (De Santis) is a parasitoid of the same host, but it is not known if both parasitoids occupy the same niche. In this study, the duration of development of the parasitoids, and the ability of both species to parasitize the 4 preimaginal instars of T. vaporariorum were determined. Results indicate that both E. formosa and E. lycopersici can parasitize all preimaginal instars of T. vaporariorum, and thus effectively occupy the same parasitoid niches, and they are part of the same parasitoid guild. However, variations in parasitism of the different preimaginal instars were observed. Encarsia lycopersici showed a higher parasitism rate on the first instar than on the third and fourth instars of T. vaporariorum. In contrast to E. formosa, which exhibited a lower parasitism rate on the first instar than on the fourth instar. In addition, E. lycopersici showed higher parasitism rate than E. formosa on the first instar of this host. This suggests that E. lycopersici may have a competitive advantage in exploiting the host, as it is the first to occupy it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasitism 3aniches 3aendoparasitoids 3ainstars 3aEncarsia formosa 3aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aHemiptera 0astage-specific parasitism 0agreenhouse whitefly 0apreimaginal developmental time 0abiological control1 aLorenzo, María E.1 aBurla, Juan P.1 aFranco, Jorge1 aBasso, Cesar0 tFlorida entomologist.g2012 Dec., v. 95, no. 4 p.1024-1030dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F024.095.04313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012100171300001600292520097300308592002801281650000801309650002001317650001401337650002301351650001901374650001401393650001101407650001301418653003401431653001701465653001901482653002601501653001701527700001801544700001701562700002201579773010201601856008301703852000901786655001201795IND60644838520221117190748.0190830e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064483852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Si Bui Trung10aDefective Nb2O5-supported Pt catalysts for CO oxidation: Promoting catalytic activity via oxygen vacancy engineering  ap. 124-134.  aWe introduced oxygen vacancies into Nb2O5 via thermal treatment at 700 °C under oxygen-deficient conditions for different lengths of time.

Moreover, increasing the number of oxygen vacancies was found to increase the catalytic activity. At 150 °C, the TOF calculated for the catalyst with the most oxygen vacancies was 0.36 s−1, which was much higher than that obtained from the catalyst possessing the fewest oxygen vacancies (0.05 s−1).

In order to assess the natural variability linked to the type of casing used in production, the ingredients, as well as ripening conditions, were identical in both productions. The aim of the study was to understand the contribution of casing microflora during sausage ripening by identifying the dominant species and strains. The bacterial ecology of casings and salami at different ripening stages, as determined by plating, revealed higher staphylococci and enterococci counts for Gentile casing and for the entire ripening period of the salami studied. After molecular identification of 219 Lactobacilli and 225 cocci gram positive catalase positive (GPCP) isolates, the species most frequently isolated were Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Some L. sakei and S. saprophyticus strains, coming from casing, were also found in the salami at different times of ripening. A richer biodiversity was only detected at the beginning of maturation. We also report the first detection, by PCR–DGGE method, of Arcobacter marinus and Brochothrix thermosphacta species in casings and Kokuria salsicia in fresh sausage. Results suggesting that casing can be an important source of bacteria during natural fermentation when starter cultures are not used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArcobacter 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3aEnterococcus 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aLactobacillus curvatus 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aStaphylococcus saprophyticus 3aStaphylococcus xylosus 3abiodiversity 3acatalase 3afermentation 3aingredients 3ameat 3ameat aging 3asalami 3asausages 3astarter cultures 3aswine 0aFermented sausages 0aNatural casing 0aStaphylococcus 0aLactobacillus 0aMolecular methods 0aMicrobial ecology1 aCallegari, Maria Luisa1 aPuglisi, Edoardo1 aDallolio, Giuliano1 aRebecchi, Annalisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0109-43630 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 Aug. 17, v. 207 p.57-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245009900177300001400276520122900290592002801519650001301547650002401560650002301584700002301607700002301630773008801653856005501741852000901796655001201805IND4501514320221119042239.0150416e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450151432DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00396.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKüchenhoff, Helmut,12aA General Method for Dealing with Misclassification in Regression: The Misclassification SIMEX  ap. 85-96.  aWe have developed a new general approach for handling misclassification in discrete covariates or responses in regression models. The simulation and extrapolation (SIMEX) method, which was originally designed for handling additive covariate measurement error, is applied to the case of misclassification. The statistical model for characterizing misclassification is given by the transition matrix Π from the true to the observed variable. We exploit the relationship between the size of misclassification and bias in estimating the parameters of interest. Assuming that Π is known or can be estimated from validation data, we simulate data with higher misclassification and extrapolate back to the case of no misclassification. We show that our method is quite general and applicable to models with misclassified response and/or misclassified discrete regressors. In the case of a binary response with misclassification, we compare our method to the approach of Neuhaus (1999, Biometrika86, 843–855), and to the matrix method of Morrissey and Spiegelman (1999, Biometrics55, 338–344) in the case of a misclassified binary regressor. We apply our method to a study on caries with a misclassified longitudinal response.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiometry 3aregression analysis 3astatistical models1 aMwalili, Samuel M.1 aLesaffre, Emmanuel0 tBiometrics.g2006 Mar., v. 62, no. 1 p.85-96dBlackwell Publishingx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00396.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04105naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002100186245017300207300001800380506007600398520205200474592002802526506003702554650002502591650001802616650001202634650001902646650002102665650001802686650001102704650004302715650001102758650001602769650002702785650002002812650002402832650001902856650001802875650001002893650001202903650002702915650002702942650003202969650003703001650003303038650002603071650004203097650004203139650006603181650006403247700001903311773011603330856004803446852000903494655001203503IND4474175120221207110234.0121003e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447417512DNAL7 a223994452pmid7 aPMC33246852pmcid7 a10.1007/s12010-012-9622-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzopa, Agnieszka10aIn Vitro Cultures of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.)

Baill. (Chinese magnolia vine) at different stages of organogenesis, cultured in vitro on a few variants of Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, containing different concentrations of plant growth regulators 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (from 0.1 to 3.0 mg/l) and in extracts from overground parts of plants growing in vivo. Six of 12 analysed compounds were detected in all extracts: chlorogenic, p-coumaric, p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, salicylic and syringic acids. Total contents of the examined metabolites in biomass of shoot-differentiating callus culture cultivated on six MS medium variants were dependent on concentrations of growth regulators in the media and ranged from 14.90 to 60.05 mg/100 g d.w. Total contents of the compounds in biomass extracts from undifferentiating callus culture maintained only on two of six MS medium variants were higher and amounted to 74.54 and 78.24 mg/100 g d.w. Maximum total contents of phenolic acids in both types of in vitro cultures were greater than in fruits (55.73 mg/100 g d.w.) and leaves (4.55 mg/100 g d.w.) of plants gowning in vivo. Chlorogenic acid and salicylic acid were the main compounds identified in biomass extracts of shoot-differentiating callus cultures (max 22.60 and 21.17 mg/100 g d.w., respectively), while chlorogenic acid (max 38.43 mg/100 g d.w.) and protocatechuic acid (max 20.95 mg/100 g d.w.) prevailed in the extracts from undifferentiating callus cultures. Other compounds dominated in fruits, namely p-coumaric acid (23.36 mg/100 g d.w.) and syringic acid (14.96 mg/100 g d.w.). This is the first report on biochemical potential of cells from S. chinensis in vitro cultures to produce the biologically active phenolic acids. These are the first results on the analysis of this group of metabolites in overground parts of plants growing in vivo, too.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSchisandra chinensis 3abenzyladenine 3abiomass 3acallus culture 3achlorogenic acid 3acinnamic acid 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3ap-coumaric acid 3aprotocatechuic acid 3asalicylic acid 3asyringic acid 3avines 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCinnamatesxmetabolism 2aCulture Techniquesxmethods 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHydroxybenzoatesxmetabolism 2aKinetinxpharmacology 2aNaphthaleneacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Shootsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSchisandraxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aEkiert, Halina0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2012 Apr., v. 166, no. 8 p.1941-1948dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-012-9622-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245005700167300001400224520121500238592002801453650001301481650001201494650000901506650002501515650001401540650001101554650002601565650001001591650002601601650001501627650001401642650001401656650001301670650002901683650001701712653002101729653001501750653002201765653001301787653002301800700002101823700002101844700001701865700002001882700002101902700002001923700002001943700001801963700002101981700001702002700002002019700001902039700001802058700002302076700001402099700002302113700002302136700001902159700002402178700001802202773007002220856008502290852000902375655001202384IND60545084620221119152753.0161019e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054508462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItoi, Shiro10aLarval pufferfish protected by maternal tetrodotoxin  ap. 35-40.  aMarine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin. All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries, although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat them out promptly. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS) analysis revealed that the pufferfish larvae contain a small quantity of TTX, which is not enough to be lethal to the predators. Immunohistochemical analysis with anti-TTX monoclonal antibody revealed that the TTX is primarily localized in the body surface of the larvae as a layer of protection. Our study showed the female parent of the Takifugu pufferfish vertically transfers TTX to the larvae through its accumulation in the ovaries, and subsequent localization on the body surface of the larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTakifugu 3afemales 3afish 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apheromones 3apredation 3apredators 3aspawning 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atetrodotoxin 0aChemical defense 0aPufferfish 0aSurvival strategy 0aTakifugu 0aTetrodotoxin (TTX)1 aYoshikawa, Saori1 aAsahina, Kiyoshi1 aSuzuki, Miwa1 aIshizuka, Kento1 aTakimoto, Narumi1 aMitsuoka, Ryoko1 aYokoyama, Naoto1 aDetake, Ayumi1 aTakayanagi, Chie1 aEguchi, Miho1 aTatsuno, Ryohei1 aKawane, Mitsuo1 aKokubo, Shota1 aTakanashi, Shihori1 aMiura, Ai1 aSuitoh, Katsuyoshi1 aTakatani, Tomohiro1 aArakawa, Osamu1 aSakakura, Yoshitaka1 aSugita, Haruo0 tToxicon.g2014 Feb., v. 78 p.35-40dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01282naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245005800174300001600232520052400248592002800772650001300800650001000813650001500823700002000838773009400858856005500952852000901007655001201016IND4501442220221117160904.0150416e199906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450144222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00603.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFollmann, Dean A.10aBayesian Monitoring of Event Rates with Censored Data  ap. 603-607.  aA Bayesian approach to monitoring event rates with censored data is proposed.

Here, we characterized an orthologous Ric8 (AoRic8) in Arthrobotrys oligospora by multi‐omics analyses. The Aoric8 deletion (ΔAoric8) mutants lost an ability to produce traps essential for nematode predation, accompanied by a marked reduction in cAMP level. Yeast two‐hybrid assay revealed that AoRic8 interacted with G‐protein subunit Gα1. Moreover, the mutants were compromised in mycelia growth, conidiation, stress resistance, endocytosis, cellular components and intrahyphal hyphae. Revealed by transcriptomic analysis differentially upregulated genes in the absence of Aoric8 were involved in cell cycle, DNA replication and recombination during trap formation while downregulated genes were primarily involved in organelles, carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Metabolomic analysis showed that many compounds were markedly downregulated in ΔAoric8 mutants versus the wild‐type strain. Our results demonstrated a crucial role for AoRic8 in the fungal growth, environmental adaption and nematode predation through control of cell cycle, organelle and secondary metabolism by G‐protein signalling.  aPublisher supplied data  a202001BB050004cApplied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province  a31960556cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1402265cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArthrobotrys oligospora 3aDNA replication 3aG-proteins 3aNematoda 3aamino acid metabolism 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acell cycle 3acholinesterase 3aconidiation 3aendocytosis 3afungal growth 3aguanine nucleotide exchange factors 3ahyphae 3ametabolomics 3amultiomics 3amycelium 3aorganelles 3apredation 3astress tolerance 3atranscriptomics 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aZhang, Guosheng1 aWang, Wenjie1 aFeng, Huihua1 aYang, Xuewei1 aZheng, Yaqing1 aYang, Le1 aXie, Meihua1 aZhang, Ke‐Qin1 aYang, Jinkui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3106-21890 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2022 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.1714-1730dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.157353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245007300168300001400241520096400255592002801219650002601247650001301273650001801286650001701304650001301321650001301334650001301347650001001360650002001370650001601390650002001406653002601426653001601452653001301468653001301481653000901494700001601503700001701519700001301536700001401549773012801563856009001691852000901781655001201790IND60541159220221122220600.0190318e20150803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054115922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Qing10aEnhancing vitamin B12 content in soy-yogurt by Lactobacillus reuteri  ap. 56-59.  aMore attention from the aged and vegetarians has been paid to soy-product due to its taste, easy digestibility, as well as the association with health. However, soy-product has a defect of low vitamin content, mainly the water-soluble vitamin B12. This study was to investigate co-fermentation of glycerol and fructose in soy-yogurt to enhance vitamin B12 production by Lactobacillus reuteri. After a serial combination experiments, the co-fermentation was confirmed to enhance the production of vitamin B12 up to 18μg/100mL. Both supplementations induced the expression of cobT and cbiA and functioned to balance the redox reaction. Meanwhile, high content of fructose supplementation reduced the production of vitamin B12 and suppressed expression of cobT in bacteria. It was proved that the vitamin B12 content of this soy-yogurt is higher than other fermented soybean based food and thus can be served as an alternative food for the aged and vegetarians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus reuteri 3abacteria 3adigestibility 3afermentation 3afructose 3aglycerol 3asoybeans 3ataste 3avegetarian diet 3avitamin B12 3avitamin content 0aLactobacillus reuteri 0aVitamin B12 0aGlycerol 0aFructose 0acobT1 aZhang, Chen1 aSong, Dafeng1 aLi, Ping1 aZhu, Xuan0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 Aug. 03, v. 206 p.56-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03772naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245011000207300001600317500002000333520230800353592002802661650001802689650001102707650001902718650002002737650001802757650001502775650002302790650001202813650001402825650002102839651001402860651001602874651001802890700006102908700006002969700006003029700006403089773010203153856007403255852000903329655001203338IND60787249520221117022513.0220808e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078724952DNAL7 a10.1002/tax.123202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercado‐Díaz, Joel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2193-002310aElucidating species richness in lichen fungi: The genus Sticta (Ascomycota: Peltigeraceae) in Puerto Rico  ap. 851-891.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTraditional taxonomic studies provide only a limited understanding of species richness within a group. Their usefulness for assessing species diversity could also be limited as many lack sufficient sampling and/or fail to integrate different data types for assessing species boundaries. To explore the challenges and limitations of estimating species richness in lichens, we employed an integrative taxonomic approach to elucidate diversification patterns of the genus Sticta (Peltigeraceae) in Puerto Rico. Specimens were collected throughout the island, and a six‐locus dataset was generated to infer phylogenetic relationships among Puerto Rican Sticta and their continental counterparts. Phylogenetic analysis was combined with species delimitation methods and analysis of morpho‐anatomical characters to assess diversity patterns and clarify species‐level taxonomy. We found that Sticta is represented by 16 species in Puerto Rico and that at least 11 (69%) of them are potentially endemic to the island. We describe eight of these in this work: S. borinquensis sp. nov., S. corymbosa sp. nov., S. densiphyllidiata sp. nov., S. guilartensis sp. nov., S. harrisii sp. nov., S. parvilobata sp. nov., S. riparia sp. nov., and S. tainorum sp. nov. These species do not cluster in a monophyletic assemblage but are scattered over the broader Sticta phylogeny, indicating at least eight separate dispersal events. Putative endemic species were found to have close allies occurring in South America. Careful re‐examination of material revealed phenotypical characters that separate most species, suggesting low levels of cryptic diversity. We highlight that integrating molecular methods and other sources of information in species discovery along with comprehensive sampling efforts can greatly enhance our knowledge about diversity patterns in poorly studied groups and regions. Furthermore, species and ecosystems in the Caribbean are being threatened by substantial human‐driven changes (e.g., deforestation, climate change). Consequences of these impacts include reduction in already restricted habitats and potential extinction. We argue that studies analyzing species diversity within a phylogenetic framework could better inform conservation efforts aimed at addressing these challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPeltigeraceae 3aSticta 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adeforestation 3aextinction 3aindigenous species 3alichens 3amonophyly 3aspecies richness 3aCaribbean 3aPuerto Rico 3aSouth America1 aLücking, Robert,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3431-46361 aMoncada, Bibiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9984-29181 aWidhelm, Todd J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6453-34291 aLumbsch, H.

CTM was synthesized by using the emerging electrochemiluminescent (ECL) material (4,4′,4″,4‴-(porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzoic acid) as the organic ligand and Ce(III) as the metal node. We found that CTM not only has the remarkable ability to emit light but also has a uniform “sandwich biscuit” shape and suitable nanoscale size, which are promising for further applications. We also applied CTM to construct a novel ECL immunosensor and achieve sensitive detection of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a biomarker related to cardiovascular diseases. To further amplify the ECL signal of CTM, a novel dual-amplified signal strategy was established by inducing a polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Importantly, we first proved that the ECL signal of the CTM/S₂O₈²– system could be enhanced by the PAMAM electric field. As the electron transfer rate was accelerated by the AuNP layer, this ECL signal was further enhanced in AuNP-modified electrodes. The ECL immunosensor showed desirable performance for PCSK9 analysis within a detection range of 50 fg mL–¹ to 10 ng mL–¹ and a low limit of detection of 19.12 ± 2.69 fg mL–¹. Real sample detection suggested that the immunosensor holds great potential for analyzing clinical serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzoic acid 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acardiovascular diseases 3acoordination polymers 3adendrimers 3adetection limit 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aimmunosensors 3aligands 3ananogold 3asubtilisin 0aCe-based luminescent metal−organic framework 0aproprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 0a4,4′,4″,4‴-(porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzoic acid) 0apolyamidoamine dendrimer1 aHe, Junlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6375-35901 aZhang, Chengli1 aLi, Jia1 aFu, Xiaoxue1 aMao, Weiran1 aLi, Wenming1 aYu, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8391-40800 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 03, v. 12, no. 1 p.338-346dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b192463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245018500162520206600347592002802413650001902441650003002460650002502490650002302515650001302538650001702551700001802568773012602586856007302712852000902785655001202794IND60651785720221119123339.0190712e20160318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065178572DNAL7 a10.3390/su80302832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTourais, Patrícia10aWhy, How and What do Organizations Achieve with the Implementation of Environmental Management Systems?—Lessons from a Comprehensive Review on the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme  aThe Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) was established in 1993 in the European Union as a voluntary instrument facilitating the implementation of organisational environmental policies and management of environmental aspects. We present a comprehensive literature review on EMAS research, organized according to three broad questions: Why do organisations choose EMAS? How is the scheme implemented and adapted to organisational characteristics? And what results are achieved? We have built analysis matrices to critically review 80 articles published over the past two decades and to identify the recurrent research themes addressing each question. We found that the decision to adopt EMAS is motivated by a set of internal and external factors, compounded by the potential of an organisation to combine the scheme with other EMS standards and environmental management tools. These themes are the ones most extensively covered by existing literature. To answer the question on how organisations implement and adapt to the scheme, two themes have been identified covering EMS planning and operation issues and sectoral approaches. Results show that the focus has been put on development of methods for assessing the significance of environmental aspects, implementing environmental policies and developing indicators for tracking performance and elaborating environmental statements. The development of sectoral approaches that adapt EMAS to characteristics of different economic activity sectors is also emerging as a critical research development. Finally, the themes addressing results achieved with EMAS implementation have only recently surfaced in the literature. The achievement of sustained environmental performance improvements through EMAS adoption is both contested and supported in the reviewed studies. On the other hand, improvements in the relationships with stakeholders arise as one of the most important intangible outcomes of the scheme. We conclude our review by advancing a systematic set of future research opportunities in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aenvironmental performance 3aenvironmental policy 3amanagement systems 3aplanning 3astakeholders1 aVideira, Nuno0 tSustainability.g2016 Mar. 18, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80302833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245014100209300001600350520137700366592002801743650001401771650002301785650002001808650001901828650001101847650002801858650001301886650001201899650000901911650001001920650001301930653002001943653001901963653001301982653001901995653001002014653003302024700002002057700002102077700001902098700002102117773007202138856008502210852000902295655001202304IND60545084920221119152855.0161019e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054508492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorii, Yasushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5706-516110aComparison of the immunogenicity of botulinum toxin type A and the efficacy of A1 and A2 neurotoxins in animals with A1 toxin antibodies  ap. 114-120.  aOne issue with botulinum toxin type A products is a reduced therapeutic response in patients that have been injected with frequent dosing over a prolonged period. A possible cause of this is hemagglutinin, found in progenitor toxins, displaying adjuvant activity, enhancing antibody production against the toxin. We investigated whether there is any difference in immunogenicity between the LL toxin-derived subtype A1 (A1LL) and the neurotoxin-derived subtypes A1 and A2 (A1NTX and A2NTX, respectively), and investigated whether A2NTX is effective in animals which produce antibodies against A1LL.Neutralizing antibodies were detected in the A1LL-administered group; however, they were not detected in swine and rabbits administered multiple doses of A2NTX. These results indicate that A2NTX has a lower immunogenicity than A1LL. In rats with neutralizing antibodies, produced by the administration of A1LL, that were administered either A1NTX or A2NTX, A2NTX showed more potent inhibitory neuromuscular transmission than A1NTX. In human sera immunized with the botulinum toxoid vaccine (containing LL, L, and M toxoid derived subtype A1) reacted with either A1NTX or A2NTX, A2NTX showed more potent inhibitory neuromuscular transmission than A1NTX. This suggests that A2NTX has a greater therapeutic value in humans who have neutralizing antibodies against the A1 toxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aantibody formation 3abotulinum toxin 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apatients 3arabbits 3arats 3aswine 3avaccines 0aBotulinum toxin 0aImmunogenicity 0aAntibody 0aNeutralization 0aELISA 0aRat CMAP neutralization test1 aGoto, Yoshitaka1 aNakahira, Shinji1 aKozaki, Shunji1 aGinnaga, Akihiro0 tToxicon.g2014 Jan., v. 77 p.114-120dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013800162300001600300520146900316592002801785650001701813650002301830650002001853650000901873650001901882650001301901650001801914650001801932650001201950650001601962653001001978653002101988653001302009653002102022653001802043653001402061700005602075700001302131700001902144700001602163700002002179700005702199700001802256700005502274773013702329856007802466852000902544655001202553IND60680967320221120200655.0200110e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068096732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b192872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhenglong10aIn Situ Introduction of Li₃BO₃ and NbH Leads to Superior Cyclic Stability and Kinetics of a LiBH₄-Based Hydrogen Storage System  ap. 893-903.  aLiBH₄ is a high-capacity hydrogen storage material; however, it suffers from high dehydrogenation temperature and poor reversibility. To tackle those issues, we introduce a new LiBH₄-based system with in situ formed superfine and well-dispersed Li₃BO₃ and NbH as co-reactants. Those are synthesized by the addition of niobium ethoxide [Nb(OEt)₅] to LiBH₄, heat treatment of the mixture, and then hydrogenation, where Li₃BO₃ and NbH are generated from the reaction of Nb(OEt)₅ and LiBH₄. After optimization, the system with a normalized composition of LiBH₄-0.04(Li₃BO₃ + NbH) in molar fraction shows superior hydrogen storage reversibility and kinetics. The initial and main dehydrogenation temperatures of the system are 200 and 90 °C lower than those of the pristine LiBH₄, respectively, and 8.2 wt % H₂ is released upon heating to 400 °C. A capacity of 7.2 wt % H₂, corresponding to a capacity retention of 91%, is sustained after 30 cycles in an isothermal cyclic regime of dwelling at 400 °C for 60 min for dehydrogenation and dwelling at 500 °C and 50 bar H₂ pressure for 20 min for hydrogenation. Such a high cyclic stability for a LiBH₄-based system has never been reported to date. The in situ introduced Li₃BO₃ and NbH have a synergistic catalysis effect on the improvement of the hydrogen storage performance of LiBH₄, showing highly effective bidirectional action on both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aborohydrides 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amole fraction 3aniobium 3atemperature 0aLiBH4 0ahydrogen storage 0akinetics 0acyclic stability 0areversibility 0acatalysis1 aGao, Mingxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4719-67471 aGu, Jian1 aXian, Kaicheng1 aYao, Zhihao1 aShang, Congxiao1 aLiu, Yongfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4002-82651 aGuo, Z.

Water shortages can cause significant challenges in electricity production and thereby a direct socioeconomic impact on the surrounding region. Our paper presents a new, comprehensive quantitative model that examines the electricity–water–climate change nexus. We investigate the impact of a joint water and carbon tax proposal on the operation of a transmission-constrained power network operating in a wholesale power market setting. We develop a competitive Markov decision process (CMDP) model for the dynamic competition in wholesale electricity markets, and solve the model using reinforcement learning. Several cases, including the impact of different tax schemes, integration of stochastic wind energy resources, and capacity disruptions due to droughts are investigated. Results from the analysis on the sample power network show that electricity prices increased with the adoption of water and carbon taxes compared with locational marginal prices without taxes. As expected, wind energy integration reduced both CO₂ emissions and water usage. Capacity disruptions also caused locational marginal prices to increase. Other detailed analyses and results obtained using a 30-bus IEEE network are discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3adrought 3adynamic models 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alearning 3amarket power 3aprices 3ataxes 3awater shortages 3awater utilization 3awind power 3aUnited States1 aSaavedra-Antolínez, Ivan0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.186-198dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010300162500002200265520083800287592002801125650001201153650001901165650001101184650001401195653002401209653002401233653002101257700001701278700001501295700001301310700001401323700001401337700005801351773008201409856008201491852000901573655001201582IND60661505920221119081308.0190830e20190828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066150592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1168022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Si-si10aBK channels regulate calcium oscillations in ventricular myocytes on different substrate stiffness  aPre-press version  aSubstrate stiffness is essential for cell functions, but the mechanisms by which cell sense mechanical cues are still unclear. Here we show that the frequency and the amplitude of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations were greater in chick cardiomyocytes cultured on the stiff substrates than that on the soft substrates. The spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations were increased on stiff substrates. However, an eliminated dependence of the Ca2+ oscillations on substrate stiffness was observed after applying blocker of the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels. In addition, the activity of BK channels in cardiomyocytes cultured on the stiff substrates was decreased. These results provide compelling evidences to show that BK channels are crucial in substrate stiffness-dependent regulation of the Ca2+ oscillation in cardiomyocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acardiomyocytes 3achicks 3apotassium 0aSubstrate stiffness 0aVentricular myocyte 0aCa2+ oscillation1 aGao, Xiaohui1 aWu, Xiaoan1 aYu, Yang1 aYu, Zhang1 aZhao, Sui1 aZhao, Hu-cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3897-36040 tLife sciences.g2019 Aug. 28, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1168023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245007200178300001600250520126200266592002801528650001101556650001301567650002001580650000901600650002301609650001701632650001401649650001301663650000701676650002201683650002001705650001901725650001201744650001401756653001201770653002301782653002001805653003101825700006401856700002801920773011401948856008602062852000902148655001202157IND60611946620221121102143.0181015e20190105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061194662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.08.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPujol Pozo, Alberto A.10aDecontamination of radioactive metal surfaces by electrocoagulation  ap. 357-366.  aThe decontamination of noncompactable radioactive wastes, such as tools and equipment, aims to reduce the waste volume to be conditioned and stored. The electrocoagulation (EC) application in the decontamination of noncompactable radioactive waste from stainless steel containing uranium, was studied to evaluate its technical viability. The first studies were carried out with stainless steel plates coated with WO3 to simulate a fixed contamination and to determine the best tungsten removal conditions via EC considering pH, electrolyte support, distance between the electrodes, cell potential and counter-electrode material. The best removal conditions for WO3 were applied to plates contaminated with UO2(NO3)2 to evaluate the viability of the EC decontamination process. Uranium removal efficiencies of 90% were obtained in 1 h, at pH of 1, 2.4 V and 1 cm of distance between anode / cathode in a circular array. The EC process, under the previously obtained conditions, was applied to two metallic pieces contaminated with U. It proved feasible to decontaminate metallic pieces through the EC process, thus being able to obtain up to 90% U removal efficiency; however, it is important that the surfaces of the parts are free of grease and dust.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3adecontamination 3adust 3aelectrocoagulation 3aelectrolytes 3aequipment 3anitrates 3apH 3aradioactive waste 3astainless steel 3atungsten oxide 3auranium 3aviability 0aUranium 0aElectrocoagulation 0aDecontamination 0aRadioactive metal surfaces1 aBustos Bustos, Erika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0955-76841 aMonroy-Guzmán, Fabiola0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Jan. 05, v. 361 p.357-366dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.08.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017700168300001600345520134100361592002801702650002801730650001201758650001301770650003401783650002201817650002101839650001301860653003501873653003601908653001301944653001501957700001501972700001601987700001402003700001902017700001402036700006002050773011502110856008502225852000902310655001202319IND60644839120221117190332.0190725e20190913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064483912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chaoyue10aLarge-scale separation of baicalin and wogonoside from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi by the combination of pH-zone-refining and conventional counter-current chromatography  ap. 266-273.  aThe combined use of pH-zone-refining counter-current chromatography (CCC) and conventional CCC was successfully employed for the preparative separation and purification of baicalin and wogonoside from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi. A more environmentally friendly biphasic solvent system composed of n-butanol-ethyl acetate-water (2:3:5, v/v) was used for pH-zone-refining CCC, in which trifluoroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10 mmol L−1 in the organic phase and ammonia was added to a final concentration of 10 mmol L−1 in the aqueous phase while a two-phase solvent system composed of ethyl acetate-ethanol-3 mmol L−1 hydrochloric acid (10:1:10, v/v) was used for the conventional CCC. Two elution modes including reverse displacement mode and normal displacement mode were investigated for pH-zone-refining CCC. The first run provided 186.7 mg of baicalin with a purity of 95.3% and 143.4 mg of a mixture of baicalin and wogonoside from 500 mg of the crude extracts of Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi by pH-zone-refining CCC with reverse displacement elution mode. The mixture was further separated by means of a second run in conventional CCC, yielding 64.3 mg of baicalin with a purity of 98.2% and 46.1 mg of wogonoside with a purity of 98.9%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScutellaria baicalensis 3aammonia 3abaicalin 3acountercurrent chromatography 3ahydrochloric acid 3amedicinal plants 3asolvents 0aCounter-current chromatography 0apH-Zone-refining chromatography 0aBaicalin 0aWogonoside1 aSun, Wenyu1 aWang, Xiang1 aJin, Yang1 aZhao, Shanshan1 aLuo, Meng1 aTong, Shengqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5867-73540 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Sept. 13, v. 1601 p.266-273dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245009600168300001600264520136300280592002801643650002401671650002901695650001701724650001601741650001701757650002301774650002001797650001101817650002501828650002101853700002001874700002501894773009301919856004502012852000902057655001202066IND50069002520130904000000.0130904e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006900252DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2012002462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObadina, Adewale O.10aEffect of fermentation periods on chemical and physicochemical properties of cocoyam starch  ap. 747-752.  aThe effect of fermentation time on chemical and physiochemical properties of two varieties of cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta (white) and Xanthosoma sagittifolium (pink)) starch were evaluated. The cocoyam were fermented (24, 48, 72, and 96 h) and dried in cabinet dryer at 60°C for 24 h and subsequently milled into starch. The pasting properties, functional properties and chemical composition of the fermented starch were determined and compared with unfermented starch. Result showed that fermentation increased the peak viscosity of both varieties at 96 h with starch from white cocoyam having higher peak viscosity (6301), pink (5052). The pasting temperatures of fermented starch were not significantly different from unfermented starch for both pink and white cocoyam starch (84.0–82.0°C). White cocoyam starch had higher swelling power than pink starch (9.97–9.92) at 96 h. There were no significantly differences in the dispersibility value, bulk density, fat, crude fiber and carbohydrate for both varieties of control and fermented samples. Water solubility index (WSI) for white starch at control level was higher than that of pink (7.5, 4.5) but at 96 h, the pink variety was higher (3 and 1.5) and water absorption capacity increased markly due to fermentation period. Protein content was observed to increase during fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColocasia esculenta 3aXanthosoma sagittifolium 3abulk density 3acrude fiber 3afermentation 3apasting properties 3aprotein content 3astarch 3aswelling (materials) 3awater solubility1 aFegha, Grace D.1 aOlugbile, Adetola O.0 tStärke =.g2013 Sept., v. 65, no. 9‐10 p.747-752dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.201200246  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008400167300001400251520090500265592002801170650001201198650002101210650001001231650001701241650001101258650001801269650001501287650001301302650002401315650001401339650001801353773010301371856008201474852000901556655001201565IND60623985920221116142831.0181129e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062398592DNAL7 a10.1177/0260106090007001042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, G.D.10aSporadic Clinical Human Mycotoxicosis—bA Widespread New Unitarian Pathology?  ap. 21-33.  aOver hundreds of years, huge losses of human life have resulted from the ingestion of plant mycotoxins. These virulent. toxins are manufactured at times by certain fungi which speedily infest cereals stored at moisture levels of more than 15%, a situation that is very common in subsistence farming. As these toxins can withstand both boiling, and gastric acid and they can pass the placental barrier, it is fair to say that huge numbers of humans are exposed to them from intra-uterine life to the very grave. It would be strange thus were they not responsible for wide-spread sporadic (non-epidemic) disease, either as a sole agent or one that conditions humans to the ill effects of other agents, especially when compared with effects upon animals.

A number of differences observed in the gel network can be linked to differences in milk composition. The microstructure of buffalo yoghurt, as assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and cryo scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM), was interrupted by large fat globules and featured more serum pores. These fat globules have a lower surface area and bind less protein than the homogenised fat globules in bovine milk. These microstructural differences likely lead to the higher syneresis observed for buffalo yoghurt with an increase from 17.4 % (w/w) to 19.7 % (w/w) in the weight of whey generated at days 1 and 28 of the storage. The higher concentration of total calcium in buffalo milk resulted in the release of more ionic calcium during fermentation. Gelation was also slower but the strength of the two gels was similar due to similar protein and total solids concentrations. Buffalo yoghurt was more viscous, less able to recover from deformation and less Newtonian than bovine yoghurt with a thixotropy of 3,035 Pa.s⁻¹measured for buffalo yoghurt at the end of the storage, at least four times higher than the thixotropy of bovine yoghurt. While the titratable acidity, lactose consumption and changes in organic acid concentrations were similar, differences were recorded in the viability of probiotic bacteria with a lower viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus of 5.17 log (CFU/g) recorded for buffalo yoghurt at day 28 of the storage. Our results show that factors other than the total solids content and protein concentration of milk affect the structural properties of yoghurt. They also illustrate the physicochemical reasons why buffalo and bovine yoghurt are reported to have different sensory properties and provide insight into how compositional changes can be used to alter the microstructure and properties of dairy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3abuffalo milk 3abuffaloes 3acalcium 3acattle 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afat globules 3afermentation 3alactose 3amicrostructure 3amilk 3amilk composition 3aprobiotics 3aprotein content 3arheological properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensory properties 3asurface area 3atitratable acidity 3atotal solids 3awhey 3ayogurt1 aOng, Lydia1 aLefèvre, Christophe1 aKentish, Sandra Elizabeth1 aGras, Sally Louise0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2014 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.937-953dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-013-1082-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007600172300001800248520186300266592002802129650001802157650001102175650002002186650001202206650001002218650001102228650002602239650001902265650002502284650002902309700002102338700002002359773012002379856008502499852000902584655001202593IND60125856320221120202654.0150428e20150418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012585632DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2015.10248962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamsoddini, Ali10aPaired-data fusion for improved estimation of pine plantation structure  ap. 1995-2009.  aIntegration of optical, lidar, and radar data for estimating forest structural parameters has been extensively investigated in recent decades. While evidence in the literature reveals that a common fusion method, where all attributes derived from different types of remotely-sensed data are used directly in stepwise multiple-linear regression, is not able to increase the accuracy of the structural parameter estimations in all cases, it is possible to determine the ratio of the attributes (called the pseudo -attribute hereafter) derived from two different datasets for the modelling process. In this study, the performance of WorldView-2 (WV-2) and Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre-5 (SPOT-5) multispectral images, small foot-print lidar data, and multi-date dual-polarized Advanced Land Observing Satellite phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (ALOS–PALSAR) data in paired-data fusion have been assessed using the two methods of common and ratio fusion for estimating forest structural parameters over a Pinus radiata plantation. For this purpose, grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) indices with different orientations and window sizes were calculated for the WV-2 and SPOT-5 multispectral data. The backscatter derivatives and statistical metrics were extracted from multi-date dual-polarized ALOS-PALSAR data and lidar-derived canopy height model (CHM), respectively. After applying stepwise multiple-linear regression, the results showed that the ratio fusion method provided more accurate models than the common fusion method. Finally, statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference between results derived when SPOT-5 and WV-2 data were each fused with lidar data, resulting in estimation of structural parameters with less than 20% error, which is consistent with the quality of field inventories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus radiata 3acanopy 3adata collection 3aforests 3alidar 3amodels 3amultispectral imagery 3aremote sensing 3astatistical analysis 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aTrinder, John C.1 aTurner, Russell0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Apr. 18, v. 36, no. 8 p.1995-2009dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10248963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010200157300002000259520172400279592002802003650002102031650002202052650001302074650001902087650001902106650001902125650002202144650001702166700002102183700001602204700001702220700001502237700002002252700001602272773013702288856007502425852000902500655001202509IND60759877420221123045328.0211214e20211213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075987742DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cs00506e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Baoying10aPiezo-phototronic effect on photocatalysis, solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes  ap. 13646-13691.  aThe piezo-phototronic effect (a coupling effect of piezoelectric, photoexcitation and semiconducting properties, coined in 2010) has been demonstrated to be an ingenious and robust strategy to manipulate optoelectronic processes by tuning the energy band structure and photoinduced carrier behavior. The piezo-phototronic effect exhibits great potential in improving the quantum yield efficiencies of optoelectronic materials and devices and thus could help increase the energy conversion efficiency, thus alleviating the energy shortage crisis. In this review, the fundamental principles and challenges of representative optoelectronic materials and devices are presented, including photocatalysts (converting solar energy into chemical energy), solar cells (generating electricity directly under light illumination), photodetectors (converting light into electrical signals) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs, converting electric current into emitted light signals). Importantly, the mechanisms of how the piezo-phototronic effect controls the optoelectronic processes and the recent progress and applications in the above-mentioned materials and devices are highlighted and summarized. Only photocatalysts, solar cells, photodetectors, and LEDs that display piezo-phototronic behavior are reviewed. Material and structural design, property characterization, theoretical simulation calculations, and mechanism analysis are then examined as strategies to further enhance the quantum yield efficiency of optoelectronic devices via the piezo-phototronic effect. This comprehensive overview will guide future fundamental and applied studies that capitalize on the piezo-phototronic effect for energy conversion and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric current 3aenergy conversion 3alighting 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3asimulation models 3asolar energy1 aBiesold, Gill M.1 aZhang, Meng1 aZou, Haiyang1 aDing, Yong1 aWang, Zhong Lin1 aLin, Zhiqun0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Dec. 13, v. 50, no. 24 p.13646-13691dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cs00506e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245010300188300001600291500001900307520130100326536009501627592002801722596007101750650002201821650002001843650002801863650001801891650001401909650001701923650001201940650002501952650003001977651001102007700002302018700003702041700003302078700002202111700003402133700002002167773011602187856008502303852000902388655001202397IND60728025320221118014440.0210216e20210207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072802532DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2020.17506622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Antonio Augusto Claudio14aThe Correlation between Hand Grip Strength and Nutritional Variables in Ambulatory Cancer Patients  ap. 221-229.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmong the methods used in the nutritional assessment of cancer patients, handgrip strength (HGS), an important indicator of malnutrition, was chosen in this study. An observational cross-sectional study with the prospective collection. We analyzed 100 patients from the Oncology Department of Santa Rita Hospital, in Maringá city, Paraná, Brazil. To determine the clinical-pathological staging was used the Cancer Staging Manual. In the objective nutritional assessment, data to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI), arm muscle circumference (AMC), corrected arm muscle area (cAMA) and measurement of HGS were measured. In connection with the subjective method used, a Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) has been selected. Arm Circumference (AC) presents a significant association with the left hand HGS classification. The right hand HGS does not show a significant correlation with the analyzed variables. However, the results showed that patients with higher left hand HGS tend to present lower PG-SGA and higher AMC. HGS, as a predictor of nutritional vulnerability, has proved superiority for predicting clinical results in cancer patients. However, it requires more studies that investigate other nutritional variables to determine the nutritional risk in this population.  aThe study was funded by Cesumar Institute of Science, Technology and Innovation – ICETI.  aPublisher supplied data  cCesumar Institute of Science, Technology and Innovation – ICETI. 3aarm circumference 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3ahand strength 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3amuscles 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition risk assessment 3aBrazil1 aZaia, Rebecca Dias1 aSouza, Gustavo Henrique Gandolfo1 aLuizeti, Bárbara Okabaiasse1 aAndreola, Ricardo1 aJunior, Alvo Orlando Vizzotto1 aFerrari, Ariana0 tNutrition and cancer.g2021 Feb. 7, v. 73, no. 2 p.221-229dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2020.17506623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100009900150245011200249500001900361500002200380520173900402592002802141650001102169650002002180650002002200650002102220650001602241650001902257650001302276650001302289650001302302650001402315650001102329651001502340651002202355653001202377653003702389700009602426700002202522700002302544773008102567856008502648852000902733655001202742IND60672155120221122025943.0191010e20191004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067215512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.1151612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinshaw, Sarra E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4976-4549 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4976-454910aExcess N2 and denitrification in hyporheic porewaters and groundwaters of the San Joaquin River, California  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPre-press version  aThe San Joaquin River (SJR) in California is purported to receive high nitrate loadings from surrounding agricultural lands through both surface and groundwater inputs. To investigate the potential removal of nitrate (NO3−) from surface and ground water sources, the spatial variations in dinitrogen (N2) gas concentrations and direct measurements of sediment denitrification potential (DNP), with amended NO3− and carbon (C) treatments, were investigated in the summer along a 95-km reach of the San Joaquin River. Excess N2 in hyporheic porewaters ranged from <0.1 to 8.65 mg L−1 and was significantly higher in porewaters from the 1.3 m (ground water source) versus 0.3 m (mixed surface and ground water) depths. In deep groundwater wells (3–7 m), median excess N2 concentration was 5.39 mg L−1 (range = <0.1–14.6 mg L−1). Excess N2 concentrations were inversely correlated with dissolved oxygen and NO3− concentrations suggesting denitrification as an important process in the dominantly anaerobic sediments. Hyporheic porewater NO3− concentrations exceeded the detection limit of 0.01 mg L−1 in only 20% of the hyporheic porewaters, in spite of high NO3− concentrations measured in both surface waters (mean = 2.25 mg N L−1) and surrounding groundwaters. Sediment DNP rates averaged 253 and 297 μg N kg−1 hr−1 for NO3− amended, and NO3− + C amended sediments, respectively, supporting the prevalence of denitrification in hyporheic sediments. Our results indicate that the hyporheic/riparian zones act as an anoxic barrier to nitrate transport from regional groundwater and as a location to remove NO3− from surface waters exchanging with the hyporheic zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3adetection limit 3adissolved oxygen 3agroundwater 3ahyporheic zone 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aresearch 3asediments 3asummer 3aCalifornia 3aSan Joaquin River 0aNitrate 0aMembrane inlet mass spectrometer1 aZhang, Taiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7084-6082 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7084-60821 aHarrison, John A.1 aDahlgren, Randy A.0 tWater research.g2019 Oct. 04, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.1151613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013900163500001400302520165100316592002801967650003401995650001702029650002002046650001402066650002202080650001102102650001302113653001502126653001902141653002902160653004302189653002002232653001802252653001002270653000902280653001002289653000802299653001102307653000902318653000802327653000802335653000802343653000802351653000802359653000802367653000702375700001502382700001702397700001802414700001702432700001502449700001302464700001402477773009402491856008502585852000902670655001202679IND60724253120221119075252.0210312e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1534672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yuan14aThe effects of KaiXinSan on depression and its association with lipid profiles: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial  aNAL-light  aTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) KaiXinSan (KXS) has been used to treat depressed patients for a long time, but its potential underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood.KXS could mitigate symptoms of patients with atypical depression at least partly via regulating lipid equilibrium.Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for mild or moderate depression were assigned into placebo (N = 68) or KXS 3.2 g/day (N = 66) groups in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial to investigate the anti-depressive efficacy of KXS and its association with serum lipid profile.The HAMD score and SDS score at 8 weeks were significantly improved in KXS-treated patients the N-BACK accuracy rate was also increased after 8 weeks of KXS treatment compared with baseline. These results indicated that KXS not only improved the specific symptoms of depression, but also had a beneficial effect on cognitive function related working memory. More importantly, KXS treatment improved patients’ lipid profile by reducing the ratios of LDL/HDL and ApoB/ApoA1 (p < 0.05), as well as ApoC3 level. Moreover, subgroup analysis found that HAMD score was significantly higher in patients with high lipid profile than in those with normal lipid profile, and lipid improvement after 8 weeks of KXS treatment was more obvious in depressed patients with high lipid profile than with normal lipid profile.KXS could mitigate symptoms of patients with minor and modest depression at least partly via regulating lipid equilibrium. Its might shed light that KXS may likely contributes to depressed patients with other cardio-metabolic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3ablood lipids 3aclinical trials 3acognition 3alipid composition 3amemory 3aplacebos 0aRandomized 0adouble-blinded 0aplacebo-controlled trial 0atraditional Chinese medicine KaiXinSan 0aanti-depression 0alipid profile 0aApoA1 0aApoB 0aApoC3 0aCVD 0aDSM-IV 0aHAMD 0aHDL 0aHPA 0aKXS 0aLDL 0aSDS 0aTCM 0aTG1 aChen, Chao1 aWang, Yichen1 aYang, Wenshan1 aWang, Yuanbo1 aZhu, Weiyu1 aYan, Can1 aLiu, Ping0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Mar., v. 83 p.153467-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1534673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013100169520208700300592002802387650002702415650002202442650002202464650002102486650001802507650002702525650002402552650001702576650000902593650002902602650001502631650002102646650001402667650001702681650002102698653002202719653001402741653002602755700002002781700001502801700001702816700002202833700001802855773011702873856008602990852000903076655001203085IND60743012520221120201414.0220207e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074301252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1137622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aP., Keerthana10aBiogenesis of ZnO nanoparticles for revolutionizing agriculture: A step towards anti -infection and growth promotion in plants  aCurrent intensive agricultural practices to improve the yield in food crops have kindled new research formulations towards novel fertilizers and natural pesticides, specifically involving nanomaterials. Biogenesis of ZnO nanoparticles has been performed using Citrus medica peel extract as a primary agent to support the quality of ladies finger seeds as well as the yield of the ladies finger pods for the first time. The obtained results by different analyses of physico-chemical properties indicate the formation of ZnO nanoparticles. Antimicrobial efficiencies of plant pathogenic organisms such as Streptomyces sannanesis, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger were calculated using agar well method. Foliar applications of biogenesis based ZnO nano-fertilizer of various concentrations were collectively performed for Abelmoschus esculentus. Among the concentrations, plant acquired 20 mg/L proved to have the highest biochemical contents compared to the control. Increase of the growth parameters such as seed germination (89 %), Total plant height (34 cm), Shoot height (18 cm), Root height (7.8 cm), Total fresh weight (22 gm), Shoot fresh weight 914 gm), Root fresh weight (1.8 gm), Total dry weight (5.24 gm), Shoot dry weight (4.76 gm), Root dry weight (0.39 gm), Number of branches (7), Leaf area (7.8 cm), Number of pods (7) and Length of pods (13 cm) compared to hydro-primed seeds under this category were identified. From this study we concluded that biogenesis of ZnO nanoparticles has been successfully accomplished and is a safe, non-toxic, environmentally compatible material. Synthesized ZnO nanoparticles proved to have excellent antimicrobial activity against disease causing pathogens in plants. In addition, ZnO nano-fertilizer exhibited amazing results to improve the growth and yield of Abelmoschus esculentus. Therefore, the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles exhibiting excellent antimicrobial activities along with a nanofertilizer potential can be recommended for agriculture applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aAspergillus niger 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCandida albicans 3aCitrus medica 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella enterica 3aStreptomyces 3aagar 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiogenesis 3agrowth promotion 3aleaf area 3aplant height 3aseed germination 0aZnO nanoparticles 0aNanoprime 0aSeedlings germination1 aS., Vijayakumar1 aE., Vidhya1 aV.N, Punitha1 aM., Nilavukkarasi1 aPK, Praseetha0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 170 p.113762-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1137623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011700164500001400281520162200295592002801917650003401945650001401979650002301993650001102016650001202027650001902039650001902058650001202077650001702089650001602106650001102122650001702133650001502150650000902165653001402174653002102188653002002209653000802229653001002237653001002247653000802257653001402265653000802279653000902287653000902296653000702305653000802312653000702320653000902327653000702336700001802343700001402361700001502375700001602390773009402406856008502500852000902585655001202594IND60724253220221119075233.0210312e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1534682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Min10aGinsenoside Rb1 ameliorates cardiotoxicity triggered by aconitine via inhibiting calcium overload and pyroptosis  aNAL-light  aAconitine-induced cardiotoxicity limits the clinical treatment of cardiotonic, cancers and immune-related diseases. Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) is an active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine with cardioprotective effect.This study aims to study the mechanism of aconitine cardiotoxicity and the detoxification mechanism of Rb1.Study Design:The regulatory effect of Rb1 on aconitine was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by myocardial enzyme indicators, pathological analysis, CardioECR detection, calcium transient analysis, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.Rb1 (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) alleviated apoptotic myocardial damage caused by aconitine in rats. Furthermore, Rb1 (25, 50, 100 μM) restored the contractile function and field potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) by regulating calcium channels and reduced myocardial cell damage by inhibiting the calcium transients of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs). Rb1 significantly reduced calcium levels in hiPSC-CMs, directly indicating that aconitine-induced calcium overload was alleviated by Rb1. Further, aconitine caused calcium overload by changing the expression of calcium pathway proteins, while Rb1 effectively restored calcium homeostasis. In addition, Rb1 also had a cardioprotective role by inhibiting cell pyroptosis. These results suggested that the maintenance of calcium homeostasis helped to suppress the inflammatory response related to pyroptosis of the heart.Aconitine-induced cardiotoxicity can be alleviated by Rb1 via restoring calcium homeostasis and inhibiting apoptosis and pyroptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aaconitine 3aactive ingredients 3aadults 3acalcium 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiotoxicity 3aenzymes 3aginsenosides 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3apyroptosis 3arats 0aapoptosis 0acalcium overload 0aginsenoside Rb1 0aAST 0aARVMs 0aCK-MB 0aECC 0ahiPSC-CMs 0aLDH 0aLTCC 0aMAPK 0aNC 0aRb1 0aSD 0aVPBs 0aVT1 aWang, Ruiying1 aSun, Hong1 aSun, Guibo1 aSun, Xiaobo0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Mar., v. 83 p.153468-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1534683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245013200210300001600342520140300358592002801761650001501789650001301804650001101817650001301828650001401841650001401855650001301869650002701882650002201909650000901931650002001940650001501960650001501975650001401990650001002004653001402014653001402028653002002042653002202062653002002084700003302104700003202137773013202169856008402301852000902385655001202394IND60539656320221118022657.0190219e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053965632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2015.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendes, Thiago C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9959-064X13aAn experimental evaluation of macroalgal consumption and selectivity by nominally herbivorous fishes on subtropical rocky reefs  ap. 146-152.  aHerbivory is of great importance to reef system dynamics and structures because of the role primary consumers play in shaping benthic communities at various scales. In this work, the consumption and the feeding selectivity of the fish assemblage towards a set of macroalgae was evaluated through remotely filmed multiple-choice feeding assays. Macroalgal species showed a variable susceptibility to consumption, with Spyridia hypnoides and Amphiroa sp. being the most consumed and Plocamium brasiliense and Codium intertextum the least consumed among the 11 options. Eighteen herbivorous and omnivorous fish species were recorded taking bites from the feeding trial and only six were responsible for about 90% of the total number of mass standardized bites. Nominally herbivorous species (mainly Sparisoma tuiupiranga and Acanthurus chirurgus), as well as omnivorous species like Stephanolepis hispidus and Diplodus argenteus, were important in terms of macroalgal consumption. These observed patterns are likely to be driven by different food processing modes employed by fishes and nutritional and defensive properties of algae. Moreover, these results evidence a great potential for macroalgae consumption on subtropical rocky reefs and suggest the existence of elements of both redundancy and complementarity on macroalgal selectivity by herbivorous and omnivorous fishes in these environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthurus 3aAmphiroa 3aCodium 3aDiplodus 3aPlocamium 3aSparisoma 3aSpyridia 3aStephanolepis hispidus 3abenthic organisms 3afish 3afood processing 3aherbivores 3amacroalgae 3aomnivores 3areefs 0aReef fish 0aHerbivory 0aFunctional role 0aSubtropical reefs 0aTrophic ecology1 aCordeiro, Cesar Augusto M.M.1 aFerreira, Carlos Eduardo L.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2015 Oct., v. 471 p.146-152dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011000167300001600277520083500293592002801128650001501156650002101171653002301192653001701215653002701232653003001259653003201289653001701321700001901338700001901357773012201376856008201498852000901580655001201589IND60610018820221116170429.0180824e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061001882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2016.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasoudi, Ehsan10aApplication of imperialist competitive algorithm to find minimax and standardized maximin optimal designs  ap. 330-345.  aFinding optimal designs for nonlinear models is complicated because the design criterion depends on the model parameters. If a plausible region for these parameters is available, a minimax optimal design may be used to remove this dependency by minimizing the maximum inefficiency that may arise due to misspecification in the parameters. Minimax optimal designs are often analytically intractable and are notoriously difficult to find, even numerically. A population-based evolutionary algorithm called imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) is applied to find minimax or nearly minimax D-optimal designs for nonlinear models. The usefulness of the algorithm is also demonstrated by showing it can hybridize with a local search to find optimal designs under a more complicated criterion, such as standardized maximin optimality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3anonlinear models 0aApproximate design 0aD-optimality 0aEvolutionary algorithm 0aFisher information matrix 0aGeneral equivalence theorem 0aLocal search1 aHolling, Heinz1 aWong, Weng Kee0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2017 Sept., v. 113 p.330-345dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2016.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013900171300001600310500001900326520145700345536012801802592002801930596007301958650003402031650001902065650001502084650001202099650001502111650002302126650001602149650002102165650001102186650001902197650001502216700002102231700001702252773011602269856008502385852000902470655001202479IND60728025520221118014517.0210216e20210207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072802552DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2020.17640662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuman, İbrahim10aEffects of Vitamin D Analogs Alfacalcidol and Calcitriol on Cell Proliferation and Migration of HEC1A Endometrial Adenocarcinoma Cells  ap. 273-281.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEndometrial carcinoma is the most diagnosed among infiltrating tumor of the female genital tract. Vitamin D has antiproliferative and immunomodulatory properties besides its classical effect on calcium and phosphate. We aimed to demonstrate whether alfacalcidol and calcitriol have any effect on proliferation and migration. Endometrial adenocarcinoma HEC1A was used as a cancer cell line. The effect of alfacalcidol (1α-hydroxyvitamin D₃) and calcitriol (1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃) on proliferation was demonstrated by real-time cell analysis device and migration was shown by a wound healing model. 10⁻¹¹–10⁻⁹M alfacalcidol and calcitriol reduced both proliferation and migration. In contrast, the high concentration of alfacalcidol and calcitriol (10⁻⁸–10⁻⁶M) increased proliferation and migration. The proliferative effects of alfacalcidol (0–12 h) immediately started earlier than calcitriol (12–48 h). In contrast, the antiproliferative effects of calcitriol (12–24 h) have begun earlier than alfacalcidol (48–60 h). While the high concentrations of alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the migration relatively earlier (12–24 h), low concentrations decreased the migration at late times (24–48 h). Lower concentrations of vitamin D prevent proliferation and migration in endometrial adenocarcinoma HEC1A cells. In contrast, high concentrations of vitamin D increase proliferation and migration.  aThis study was supported by the Mersin University Scientific Research Projects Center, grant project number: 2015-TP2-1172.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-TP2-1172cMersin University Scientific Research Projects Center 3a1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol 3aadenocarcinoma 3acalcitriol 3acalcium 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3aendometrium 3afemale genitalia 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphates1 aTiftik, R.

In this study, a multi-stage collapsed building detection method, using bi-temporal (pre- and post-earthquake) VHR images and post-earthquake airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data, is proposed. Ground objects that are intact and significantly different from collapsed buildings, such as intact buildings, pavements, shadows, and vegetation, were first extracted using the post-event VHR image and lidar data and masked out. Collapsed buildings were then extracted by classifying the combined bi-temporal VHR images and texture images of the remaining area using a one-class classifier, the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM). A post-processing procedure was adopted to refine the obtained result. The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated and compared to two existing methods in Port au Prince, Haiti, which was heavily hit by an earthquake in January 2010. In the two comparative methods, data for the whole study area were directly used. In the first method, collapsed buildings were extracted directly using the OCSVM, while in the second method, buildings and pavements were removed from the extraction result of the first method. The results showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed the existing methods, with increases of 21% and 40%, respectively, in the kappa coefficient. The proposed method provides a fast and reliable method to detect collapsed urban buildings caused by earthquake disasters, and could also be applied to other study areas using similar data combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3adisasters 3aearthquakes 3alidar 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3asupport vector machines 3atexture 3avegetation 3aHaiti1 aLi, Peijun0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Apr. 18, v. 36, no. 8 p.2163-2183dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10348903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004000151245017700191300001800368520129200386592002801678650001301706650001701719650001701736650002301753650001701776650001501793650001601808650001401824650001801838650000701856650001101863650001601874650001301890653001501903653003501918653002101953653002701974653002902001653004002030700002602070700003202096700003002128700007202158700001802230700005902248773014302307856008502450852000902535655001202544IND60685823520200410000000.0200309e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068582352DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b057962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeldemhret, Teklebrahan Gebrekrstos10aTyrosinase-Catalyzed Phenol-Mediated Immobilization of β-Agarase on l-Lysine-Coated Magnetic Particles for the Production of Neoagarooligosaccharides from Gelidium amansii  ap. 3573-3582.  aCross-linked enzyme aggregates of β-agarase (Aga2) were immobilized on l-lysine-coated magnetic nanoparticles (Lys@Fe₃O₄) for the production of neoagarooligosaccharides (NAOSs) from Gelidium amansii. The support Lys@Fe₃O₄ was prepared in a one-pot aqueous medium, whereas Aga2 was engineered to carry five tyrosine residues at its N-terminus (Aga2Y5N). Cross-linked immobilization of Aga2Y5N on Lys@Fe₃O₄ was effectively catalyzed by tyrosinase but its efficiency was further improved with phenol addition, affording the best biocatalyst, Aga2Y5N-TP@Lys@Fe₃O₄. Although its kinetic properties were slightly reduced, the overall results show that Aga2Y5N-TP@Lys@Fe₃O₄ performed remarkably better than free Aga2Y5N, as reflected by its excellent stability at wider pH and temperature ranges. Moreover, Aga2Y5N-TP@Lys@Fe₃O₄ can be effectively collected and recycled through magnetization, unlike the free Aga2Y5N, which cannot be easily retrieved from the reaction mixture after use. Hydrolysis results demonstrate the capability of Aga2Y5N-TP@Lys@Fe₃O₄ to effectively and selectively produce NAOS as a mixture of neoagarotetraose and -hexaose. The proposed route could be useful for the immobilization of other enzymes in various biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGelidium 3abeta-agarase 3abiocatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrosslinking 3ahydrolysis 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aphenol 3atemperature 3atyrosine 0aβ-agarase 0across-linked enzyme aggregates 0aGelidium amansii 0amagnetic nanoparticles 0aneoagarooligosaccharides 0atyrosinase-catalyzed immobilization1 aNisola, Grace Masbate1 aRamos, Kristine Rose Medina1 aBañares, Angelo Bautista1 aValdehuesa, Kris Niño Gomez1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4472-548X1 aLee, Won-Keun1 aChung, Wook-Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2503-40500 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 8, no. 9 p.3573-3582dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b057963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015000174300001600324500001100340520152100351592002801872596002601900596002401926596002101950596002101971650002701992650002502019650001402044650001902058650001102077650002502088650001002113650001102123650001502134650001702149650000702166650001202173650002002185650001302205650002702218650001602245700002802261700002002289700003302309700003602342700002502378700003402403700003402437773012802471856008102599852000902680655001202689IND60606207620221119213737.0180724e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060620762DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-018-2692-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Mara Rose10aAnti-Hypertensive Peptides Derived from Caseins: Mechanism of Physiological Action, Production Bioprocesses, and Challenges for Food Applications  ap. 884-908.  aReview  aThis review is focused on the state-of-art of peptides with inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) — thus, with anti-hypertensive potential — derived from enzymatic hydrolysis of caseins. Firstly, molecular characteristics of caseins relevant to a better understanding of this subject were concisely commented. Next, a brief description of the pathophysiology of hypertension was explained, focusing on the ACE role in regulation of blood pressure in human body. Then, casein-derived peptides with ACE inhibitory capacity were specifically addressed. The main in vitro and in vivo bioassays often reported in literature to assess the anti-hypertensive potential of peptides were presented, illustrated with recently published studies, and discussed in terms of advantages and limitations of both approaches. Characteristics related to amino acid composition and sequence of peptides with high ACE-inhibitory potential were also commented. Process parameters of enzymatic hydrolysis (types and origins of casein substrates, types of enzymes, pH, temperature, and times of reactions) were discussed. Patents dealing with casein-derived anti-hypertensive peptides were examined not only in terms of amino acid sequences, but also regarding their novelty claims in hydrolysis process parameters. Finally, some trends, challenges, and opportunities inferred from this literature analysis were commented, emphasizing the importance of this research topic in food products development.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPQ-00857-12cFAPEMIG  a472458/2011-6cCNPq  ascolarshipcCNPq  ascolarshipcCNPq 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acid sequences 3abioassays 3ablood pressure 3acasein 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afoods 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ahypertension 3apH 3apatents 3apathophysiology 3apeptides 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3atemperature1 aSilva, Thaís Jordânia1 aBarros, Edvaldo1 aGuimarães, Valéria Monteze1 aBaracat-Pereira, Maria Cristina1 aEller, Monique Renon1 ados Reis Coimbra, Jane Sélia1 ade Oliveira, Eduardo Basílio0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 185, no. 4 p.884-908dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-2692-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008300176300001800259520131600277592002801593650001301621650001001634650001001644650001901654650001101673650000901684650004401693650001201737650002001749650002501769653001501794653002701809653001701836653001401853653002601867653002201893653002601915653002301941653001801964653002501982700002402007700002102031700006402052700002202116700006702138773014302205856008502348852000902433655001202442IND60685823620200410000000.0200309e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068582362DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b059752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZea-Garcia, Jesus D.10aHydration Activation of Alite-Belite-Ye’elimite Cements by Doping with Boron  ap. 3583-3590.  aThe hydration behavior of two alite-belite-ye’elimite (ABY) cements has been studied. The production of these materials releases into atmosphere ∼17% less CO₂ compared to Portland cement. The ABY cement contains alite, β-C₂S, and ye’elimite as main phases, while dABY (activated by adding borax) contains not only these three phases but also α′H-C₂S. The role of boron in these systems is 2-fold: (i) acting as a retarder at early hydration ages since the precipitation of AH₃ gel has been delayed from over 4 h in ABY to over 24 h in dABY; and (ii) as an activator at late hydration ages by stabilizing highly reactive β- and α′H-belites. The degree of hydration of β-C₂S in ABY is 42% at 28 days, while that of β-C₂S and α′H-C₂S in dABY at the same age is 80 and 88%, respectively. Moreover, the main hydration products in both systems are ettringite and C–S–H gel. The local structure of these hydrated products has been studied by ²⁷Al and ²⁹Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS–NMR) and found to be similar in both cements. However, the amount of C–S–H gel is 63% of all silicon-bearing phases in ABY after 28 days while it is 76% (determined by ²⁹Si MAS–NMR) in dABY, which justifies the higher mechanical strengths of dABY mortars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aborax 3aboron 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3agels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asilicon 3astable isotopes 3astrength (mechanics) 0aecocements 0acalcium sulfoaluminate 0aboron effect 0aretardant 0asynchrotron radiation 0aX-ray diffraction 0asolid-state MAS−NMR 0acalorimetric study 0aC−S−H gel 0acompressive strength1 aSanfelix, Susana G.1 aVallcorba, Oriol1 aAranda, Miguel A.

Oils with high levels of saturated fatty acids are in demand for structured lipid elaboration, whereas ω-7 fatty acids like palmitoleic or asclepic acids are of interest for other applications, such as in oleochemistry and biolubricant production. Several strategies have been followed to increase the levels of saturated and ω-7 fatty acids in the camelina plant in this work, including silencing the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (CsKASII) condensing enzyme responsible for the elongation of palmitate to stearate, the expression of exogenous thioesterases, and the overexpression of the endogenous stearoyl-ACP desaturase. The silencing of CsKASII produces an important increase in palmitate in the oil seed, whereas the expression of different alleles of sunflower FatA thioesterases favors the accumulation of both palmitate and stearate. The increase in intraplastidial desaturase activity through CsSAD co-expression forced the desaturation of palmitate, inducing the accumulation of important amounts of ω-7 fatty acids. The phenotypes of the different transformants produced were characterized by profiling the different glycerolipid classes accumulated in their seeds. These oils displayed altered physical properties that were investigated by differential calorimetry studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelina sativa 3aHelianthus annuus 3aagronomic traits 3abiolubricants 3abiotechnology 3acalorimetry 3aenzymes 3aoils 3aoilseeds 3apalmitates 3astearic acid 0aVLCFA 0aKAS II 0aSAD 0aFAS 0aTAG 0aPE 0aP 0aPo 0aPl 0aS 0aO 0aAs 0aL 0aLn 0aA 0aG 0aB 0aE 0aN 0aOilseed biotechnology 0aLipid composition 0aPalmitoleic acid 0aMelting profile 0aFat A thioesterase 0aRNA interference1 aMoreno-Pérez, A.J.1 aMakni, S.1 aTroncoso-Ponce, M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3169-09861 aAcket, S.1 aThomasset, B.1 aSánchez, R.1 aVenegas-Calerón, M.1 aGarcés, R.1 aMartínez-Force, E.1 aSalas, J.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3259-25870 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 170 p.113765-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1137653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009100177300001600268520134000284592002801624650002701652650002601679650002301705650001501728650002601743650001501769650002001784650001001804650001701814650001701831650002101848650002301869653002401892653003601916653002601952653002301978700002602001773012602027856008502153852000902238655001202247IND60689219920221117024445.0200420e20170217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068921992DNAL7 a10.3109/07388551.2016.11413932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDullah, Elvina Clarie10aCurrent trends in endotoxin detection and analysis of endotoxin–protein interactions  ap. 251-261.  aEndotoxin is a type of pyrogen that can be found in Gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxin can form a stable interaction with other biomolecules thus making its removal difficult especially during the production of biopharmaceutical drugs. The prevention of endotoxins from contaminating biopharmaceutical products is paramount as endotoxin contamination, even in small quantities, can result in fever, inflammation, sepsis, tissue damage and even lead to death. Highly sensitive and accurate detection of endotoxins are keys in the development of biopharmaceutical products derived from Gram-negative bacteria. It will facilitate the study of the intermolecular interaction of an endotoxin with other biomolecules, hence the selection of appropriate endotoxin removal strategies. Currently, most researchers rely on the conventional LAL-based endotoxin detection method. However, new methods have been and are being developed to overcome the problems associated with the LAL-based method. This review paper highlights the current research trends in endotoxin detection from conventional methods to newly developed biosensors. Additionally, it also provides an overview of the use of electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and docking programs in the endotoxin–protein analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abiochemical compounds 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abiosensors 3achemical interactions 3aendotoxins 3aenergy transfer 3afever 3afluorescence 3ainflammation 3alight scattering 3asepsis (infection) 0aendotoxin detection 0aendotoxin–protein interaction 0aendotoxin aggregation 0alipopolysaccharide1 aOngkudon, Clarence M.0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2017 Feb. 17, v. 37, no. 2 p.251-261dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/07388551.2016.11413933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008800172520141600260592002801676650003201704650000801736650001801744650001201762650001301774650001901787650003601806650002801842650002201870650001301892650001601905653001301921653000901934653001101943653000801954653000801962653001201970653001101982653001301993653000902006653000802015653000802023653000802031653000702039653000802046653000702054653000702061653001102068653000802079653000802087653000702095653000902102653000802111653001102119653001902130653001902149653002002168653000802188653000902196653001002205653002002215700001702235700002402252773009802276856008702374852000902461655001202470IND60777174520221119145104.0220621e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077717452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1113122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonwal, Sarvesh10aRegulation of photosynthetic light reaction proteins via reversible phosphorylation  aThe regulation of photosynthesis occurs at different levels including the control of nuclear and plastid genes transcription, RNA processing and translation, protein translocation, assemblies and their post translational modifications. Out of all these, post translational modification enables rapid response of plants towards changing environmental conditions. Among all post-translational modifications, reversible phosphorylation is known to play a crucial role in the regulation of light reaction of photosynthesis. Although, phosphorylation of PS II subunits has been extensively studied but not much attention is given to other photosynthetic complexes such as PS I, Cytochrome b6f complex and ATP synthase. Phosphorylation reaction is known to protect photosynthetic apparatus in challenging environment conditions such as high light, elevated temperature, high salinity and drought. Recent studies have explored the role of photosynthetic protein phosphorylation in conferring plant immunity against the rice blast disease. The evolution of phosphorylation of different subunits of photosynthetic proteins occurred along with the evolution of plant lineage for their better adaptation to the changing environment conditions. In this review, we summarize the progress made in the research field of phosphorylation of photosynthetic proteins and highlights the missing links that need immediate attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aRNA 3ablast disease 3adrought 3aimmunity 3aphotosynthesis 3apost-translational modification 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aprotein transport 3asalinity 3atemperature 0aABC1K1/3 0aCKII 0acpCKII 0aCPK 0aCSK 0aCyt b6f 0aFd-Trx 0aLHC I/II 0aMAPK 0aNPQ 0aOEC 0aBCP 0aPC 0aPEP 0aPG 0aPQ 0aPSI/II 0aPTM 0aROS 0aSA 0aSIG1 0aSNP 0aSTN7/8 0aPhotosynthesis 0aLight reaction 0aPhosphorylation 0aPSI 0aPSII 0aLHCII 0aPhotoinhibition1 aVerma, Neetu1 aSinha, Alok Krishna0 tPlant science.g2022 Aug., v. 321 p.111312-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1113123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245019400164300001600358520087600374592002801250596005501278650002101333650001701354650002201371650001501393650001101408650002501419650000701444700002001451700001501471700001901486700002001505700005601525700001901581700002001600773012801620856008101748852000901829655001201838IND60606207720221119213628.0180724e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060620772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-018-2696-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Jihyun10aCharacterization of a Whole-Cell Biotransformation Using a Constitutive Lysine Decarboxylase from Escherichia coli for the High-Level Production of Cadaverine from Industrial Grade L-Lysine  ap. 909-924.  aCadaverine is used for the synthesis of the novel bio-polyamides 54, 56, and 510. Here, we examine the feasibility of using a lysine decarboxylase (LdcC) from Escherichia coli for high-level production of cadaverine. After sequential optimization of whole-cell biotransformation conditions, recombinant E. coli-overexpressing LdcC (EcLdcC) could produce 1.0 M cadaverine from 1.2 M crude L-lysine solution after 9 h. EcLdcC retained a higher cadaverine yield after being reused 10 times at acidic and alkaline pH values than that of a recombinant E. coli strain overexpressing an inducible lysine decarboxylase (CadA), a conventional cadaverine producer (90 vs. 51% at pH 6 and 55 vs. 15% at pH 8). This study reveals that EcLdcC is a promising whole-cell biocatalyst for the bio-based production of cadaverine from industrial grade L-lysine in comparison to EcCadA.  aPublisher supplied data  a10047910cthe Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy 3aEscherichia coli 3abiocatalysts 3abiotransformation 3acadaverine 3alysine 3alysine decarboxylase 3apH1 aJoo, Jeong Chan1 aLee, Eunji1 aHyun, Sung Min1 aKim, Hyun Joong1 aPark, Si Jae1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9735-45821 aYang, Yung-Hun1 aPark, Kyungmoon0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 185, no. 4 p.909-924dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-2696-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04443naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008600168500001400254520216500268592002802433650002102461650002102482650003102503650001402534650001402548650001002562650001902572650003502591650004202626650003602668650001702704650001602721650002402737650001702761650001902778650003102797650002702828650001302855650002802868650002102896650001702917650003602934653002702970653001602997653002003013653002203033653001003055653001003065653001003075653001003085653000903095653000903104653000903113653000903122653001003131653000803141653001103149653001103160653000703171653000903178653000903187653000803196653001103204700001603215700001903231700001803250700005503268700001503323700001803338700005203356700001703408773009403425856008503519852000903604655001203613IND60724253520221119075325.0210219e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1534722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Pengfei10aShizukaol A exerts anti-inflammatory effect by regulating HMGB1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway  aNAL-light  aSarcandra glabra (Thunb.) Makino (Chloranthaceae) has a long history of being used in Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) to treat painful joints, fractures, arthritis, and other diseases caused by inflammation. It has been reported that lindenane-type sesquiterpenoid dimers are main anti-inflammatory ingredient of S. glabra. Meanwhile, shizukaol A, the precursor of these sesquiterpene dimers, possesses a good inhibitory effect on nitric oxide (NO) in our previous study. But its anti-inflammatory mechanism is still unclear.This study aimed to explore the possible anti-inflammatory mechanism and potential targets of shizukaol A in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells.The release of NO and inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were measured by Griess reagent and ELISA, respectively. The relevant proteins including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65, High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were detected by western blot. Nuclear translocation of p65, HMGB1 and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were examined by immunofluorescence. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was tested by flow cytometry. The target of shizukaol A was investigated by molecular docking and Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS).Shizukaol A had a good inhibitory effect on NO with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of 13.79 ± 1.11 μM. Shizukaol A could down-regulate the expression of iNOS and COX-2. Further studies demonstrated that shizukaol A can significantly inhibit phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Meanwhile, shizukaol A decreased the level of ROS and enhanced the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Furthermore, shizukaol A up-regulated the expression of Nrf2 and its nuclear translocation. More importantly, shizukaol A could inhibit activation of HMGB1 by targeting HMGB1.Shizukaol A inhibited inflammation by targeting HMGB1 to regulate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Thus, shizukaol A may be an attractive therapeutic candidate for inflammatory diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcandra glabra 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarthritis 3acytokines 3adrugs 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3aingredients 3alipopolysaccharides 3anitric oxide 3anucleoproteins 3aphosphorylation inhibition 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aquinones 3areactive oxygen species 3asesquiterpenoids 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aSesquiterpenoid dimers 0aShizukaol A 0aHMGB1/Nrf2/HO-1 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aCCK-8 0aCOX-2 0aDARTS 0aHMGB1 0aHO-1 0aIC50 0aiNOS 0aIL-6 0aKeap1 0aLPS 0aL-NMMA 0aNF-κB 0aNO 0aNQO1 0aNrf2 0aROS 0aTNF-α1 aLi, Qiurong1 aLiao, Shanting1 aWei, Shanshan1 aCui, Letian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0842-20351 aXu, Wenjun1 aZhu, Dongrong1 aLuo, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7892-011X1 aKong, Lingyi0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Feb., v. 82 p.153472-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1534723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006900150245013000219300001600349520158600365592002801951650001501979650001301994650001702007650001202024650001202036650001202048650001902060650001502079650002402094650001102118650002202129650001502151650002302166650001402189650001102203650001502214650001402229650001302243650001902256650002302275650001802298650001902316650002102335650001802356651001002374653002902384653002502413653002702438653001602465653002602481653001702507700002702524700001702551700002402568700002902592773008702621856008502708852000902793655001202802IND60635155620221121043225.0190425e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063515562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristensen, Jeppe Aagaard1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7168-940514aThe combined effect of termite bioturbation and water erosion on soil nutrient stocks along a tropical forest catena in Ghana  ap. 307-312.  aIn the tropical moist semi-deciduous forests of West Africa, soil catenas with extremely gravel-rich soil horizons at the summits and upper slopes and largely gravel-free profiles at the lower slope are common. Previous investigations have suggested that these gravel layers are the result of macro-invertebrates mining of fine-grained soil material from the subsoil leaving behind the gravel, to build galleries at the surface subsequently exposing it to water erosion transport downslope. We examined the indirect effect of this process on the distribution along a soil catena of crucial base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) and plant available phosphorous (P), which is often growth-limiting in these tropical ecosystems. We found that the export of fine-grained soil material at the top of the catena reduces the soil stocks (to 1 m) of these elements by up to 60%, while the soil fertility downslope did not change significantly. This important long-term (100–1000 yr scale) reduction in soil fertility at the top of slopes resulting from bioturbation and water erosion is overlooked in contemporary literature, which primarily focus on the beneficial impact termites and ants have on ecosystem functioning in more level savannah landscapes. As the type of catena studied is widespread across tropical environments, this effect is likely ecologically substantial. Future research should aim at understanding such long-term consequences of bioturbation on landscape ecology as well as soil heterogeneity and fertility, so we do not overlook potential negative ecosystem effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aIsoptera 3abioturbation 3acalcium 3acatenas 3acations 3achemical bases 3aecosystems 3afine-textured soils 3agravel 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3amacroinvertebrates 3amagnesium 3amining 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asavannas 3asoil fertility 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil horizons 3asoil nutrients 3atropical forests 3awater erosion 3aGhana 0aNutrient stock depletion 0aTermite bioturbation 0aTropical forest catena 0aWest Africa 0aEcosystem functioning 0aSoil erosion1 aBoëtius, Susan Helene1 aAbekoe, Mark1 aAwadzi, Theodore W.1 aMadsen, Henrik Breuning,0 tCatena.g2019 July, v. 178 p.307-312dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012200164300001600286520117300302592002801475650004401503650002201547650001601569650001901585650002501604650002101629650001601650650001901666650001801685650001401703650001301717650002101730650003701751700001301788700001801801700001401819700001601833700001501849773010001864856008001964852000902044655001202053IND60083070620221118184407.0141101e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008307062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2012.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Guozhen10aHighly selective capture of phosphopeptides using a nano titanium dioxide–multiwalled carbon nanotube nanocomposite  ap. 210-217.  aIn this study, a titanium dioxide–multiwalled carbon nanotube (TiO₂–MWNT) nanocomposite was first used to enrich phosphopeptides as a binding agent. The TiO₂–MWNT nanocomposite was synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction process and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The results demonstrated that the anatase phase TiO₂ nanoparticles had been successfully linked by MWNTs. The TiO₂–MWNT nanocomposite was applied as a sorbent to enrich phosphopeptides, and the results showed that the performance of the TiO₂–MWNT nanocomposite was better than 5μm TiO₂, as confirmed by the analysis of phosphopeptides from a tryptic digest of a standard protein (β-casein and bovine serum albumin) using high-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS). The use of lactic acid in the loading buffer significantly enhances the selectivity of the TiO₂–MWNT nanocomposite. This nanocomposite material was further applied to enrich the phosphopeptides in a protein digest obtained from nonfat milk successfully.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abeta-casein 3abinding agents 3abovine serum albumin 3acarbon nanotubes 3alactic acid 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3askim milk 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aGao, Wei1 aDeng, Qiliang1 aQian, Kun1 aHan, Haitao1 aWang, Shuo0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 423, no. 2 p.210-217dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2012.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04120naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245018300163300001400346520216200360592002802522650002202550650001502572650001702587650001202604650002002616650002002636650001202656650001602668650001502684650002102699650001302720650005002733650003102783650001902814650001502833650001502848650002202863650002402885650002102909650002202930650002302952650002502975651001003000653003903010653004403049653003003093653003203123653003103155700001403186700001703200700001603217700001503233700001803248700002103266700001603287773008503303856008503388852000903473655001203482IND60635155720221121043332.0190509e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063515572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Bin10aEstimating Soil Organic Carbon Density in the Otindag Sandy Land, Inner Mongolia, China, for modelling spatiotemporal variations and evaluating the influences of human activities  ap. 85-97.  aAccurate quantitative estimates of Soil Organic Carbon Density (SOCD) can effectively represent regional carbon cycle processes and regulation mechanisms, and can serve as reference data when making land management decisions. Limited research, however, has been carried out in arid or desert zones covered with sparse vegetation, despite the fact that these cover wide areas of the earth and play a significant role in global carbon cycles. In this study, the Otindag Sandy Land and its surroundings (OSLAIS) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China was selected as the study area. The study introduces a useful technique for making high spatial coverage SOCD estimates for drylands by utilizing GF-1 WFV optical satellite images and a time series of MODIS satellite remote sensing datasets, and using these to optimize parameters for simulation models in conjunction with other technical procedures that are described. The results showed that the resulting model's accuracy was 77.87%, R2 = 0.8627, and so the SOCD estimates modelled by soil basal respiration (SBR) could be used for SOCD estimation and for analyzing the spatial distribution patterns across the OSLAIS. The average SOCD was 1.22 kgC/m2 for the whole of the OSLAIS, and it had a heterogenous distribution pattern. The SOCD was closely related to the way the land was used in each area, and the average SOCD for the main land use types were: forest land = 2.88 kgC/m2, farmland = 1.63 kgC/m2, shrub land = 1.41 kgC/m2, and grassland = 1.08 kgC/m2. In conclusion, we believe that the proposed method, based on high-resolution GF-1 WFV data and optimized estimation models constructed by integrating climate and vegetation characteristic data, can effectively describe the spatial distribution patterns of SOC and SOCD in the OSLAIS area, in depth and in detail, especially for the areas where the SOCD values are high. We expect this research to provide useful technical support and scientific reference data for land management and for land degradation/desertification assessments, for the study area monitored, as well as across the whole dryland area of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aarid lands 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adesertification 3adeserts 3aforest land 3agrasslands 3aland degradation 3aland use 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3apopulation characteristics 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3ashrublands 3asimulation models 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil respiration 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aSoil Organic Carbon Density (SOCD) 0aOtindag Sandy Land and its surroundings 0aImproved Van't Hoff model 0aSpatiotemporal distribution 0aHuman activities influence1 aWang, Yan1 aLi, Zengyuan1 aGao, Wentao1 aWu, Junjun1 aLi, Changlong1 aSong, Zhangliang1 aGao, Zhihai0 tCatena.g2019 Aug., v. 179 p.85-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010200169300001800271520118000289592002801469650001201497650002601509650002201535650001901557650001001576653002701586653003901613653002801652700001801680700001901698700001901717773011301736856008001849852000901929655001201938IND60616621220221122012805.0181018e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061662122DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175124529452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSankaran, Vignaesh12aA novel processing solution for the production of spatial three-dimensional stitch-bonded fabrics  ap. 1531-1544.  aSpatial three-dimensional (3D) stitch-bonded preforms offer a huge potential and an optimal utilization of the fiber mechanical properties for their usage in various technical applications. These preforms form an efficient alternative to the existing two-dimensional textile preforms due to their load-bearing fiber orientation offered by their geometrical configuration. The fundament of this research activity, based on the stitch-bonded technology, is the development of a new processing solution for producing 3D spatial open stitch-bonded textile preforms with minimal processing stages. Based on a newly developed concept with variable warp yarn delivery and differential doffing, this technology is principally enhanced so that various helical, circular and curved grid structures, along with 3D spatial structures, could be produced on a single machine with minimal setup, which hitherto has not been realized with any other existing processing technique. These novel form-based textile preforms are found to be suitable for application as reinforced components in complex spatial composites with a mineral or a plastic-based matrix, wooden composites and elastomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3amechanical properties 3aprocessing stages 3atextile fibers 3ayarns 0astitch-bonded textiles 0athree-dimensional spatial preforms 0anovel production method1 aYounes, Ayhem1 aEngler, Thomas1 aCherif, Chokri0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 82, no. 15 p.1531-1544dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175124529453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003000155245008800185520186800273592002802141650002002169650002002189650002402209650001502233650001102248650001802259653002102277653001902298653002802317653001902345653002902364653002102393653001902414700001902433700002402452700001702476700002002493700002202513773011002535856009002645852000902735655001202744IND60777174920221119145024.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077717492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.1044662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdóñez Barona, Camilo,10aDiversity in public perceptions of urban forests and urban trees: A critical review  aAcross the world, planning and decision-making for urban forests increasingly seeks to include diverse perspectives. Yet, research on people’s perceptions of urban forests and urban trees is fragmented. To integrate and critically analyse this body of research, we conducted a review of empirical studies about people’s perceptions of urban forests and urban trees. We analysed 178 relevant studies with a focus on the diversity of places, methods, people, and perception response, using text analysis algorithms in Leximancer and established epistemological and methodological content assessment frameworks. The mixed-methods-assessment-tool (MMAT) was also used to assess method quality. Findings show current literature inadequately considers diversity of places, methods, people, and perception responses. Although multiple countries are represented, studies are usually limited to a single city and address perceptions of urban trees generally or trees in parks. Convenience sampling dominates, through predetermined, survey- and intercept-based data collection techniques. Few studies have investigated the perceptions of demographically, ethnically, or culturally diverse people. Most studies focused on the positive perceptions people hold (i.e., perceptions of benefits; beliefs about the positive consequences of urban trees), rather than the diversity of perceptions that may exist. The exception is studies that focused on values, which do report more diverse perception responses. Studies often lack conceptual clarity about the specific type of perception response being investigated. Future research must consider what is being perceived, how is it being perceived, and who is perceiving it, with more clarity. There should be more emphasis on incorporating diversity in study design to better inform urban forest sustainability and resilience.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aexperimental design 3alandscapes 3apeople 3aurban forests 0aEcosystem values 0aUrban forestry 0aEnvironmental attitudes 0aUrban greening 0aSocio-ecological systems 0aResearch methods 0aPublic opinion1 aWolf, Kathleen1 aKowalski, Janina M.1 aKendal, Dave1 aByrne, Jason A.1 aConway, Tenley M.0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2022 Oct., v. 226 p.104466-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.1044663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013800182300001600320500001900336520116400355592002801519650001601547650002701563650002501590650001201615650001701627650002101644650001601665650001201681650001301693650001801706650004301724650001601767650001301783650001301796650001901809650002101828650001801849650002001867650001701887650001201904650001501916653002601931653001801957653002901975653002602004653002402030653003202054700003502086700003102121700003202152700003302184700003202217700002402249773015402273856008502427852000902512655001202521IND60728026320221118014249.0210216e20210219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072802632DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2019.16668332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardes, Alan Nascimento10aOrganic acids and alcohols quantification by HPLC/RID in sugarcane vinasse: analytical method validation and matrix effect assessment  ap. 325-336.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe composition of sugarcane vinasse varies according to the substrate of alcoholic fermentation, e.g. if it is sugarcane juice and/or molasses. Regardless of the origin, the main organic compounds found in sugarcane vinasse are organic acids, alcohols and a low amount of carbohydrates. To access the organic composition of such wastewater, the present paper describes a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation method coupled to a Refractive Index Detector (RID) in order to quantify the organic acids (C1 to C6) and alcohols in sugarcane vinasse. The analysed substances were acetic acid, butyric acid, caproic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, valeric acid, butanol, ethanol, glycerol and methanol. A validation study of the method was performed taking into account the matrix effect exerted by vinasse samples in natura. In conclusion, it was proved that the method is suitable for assessing the organic composition of vinasse: able to separate 12 analytes, with excellent linearity (R² > 0.999), with adequate working ranges, high precision (recovery ranging from 83% to 102%), and low matrix effects (<5%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aalcoholic fermentation 3aanalytical chemistry 3abutanol 3abutyric acid 3achemical species 3acitric acid 3aethanol 3aglycerol 3ahexanoic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alactic acid 3amethanol 3amolasses 3apropionic acid 3arefractive index 3asuccinic acid 3asugarcane juice 3avaleric acid 3avinasse 3awastewater 0aLiquid chromatography 0aorganic acids 0astandard addition method 0aanalytical validation 0avinasse composition 0awastewater characterisation1 aGodoi, Leandro Augusto Gouvêa1 aCamiloti, Priscila Rosseto1 aGomes, Absai da Conceição1 aSanchez, Bruna Larissa Sandy1 aTorres, Ana Paula Rodrigues1 aBotta, Lívia Silva0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 19, v. 101, no. 3 p.325-336dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12218x1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2019.16668333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007100170300001600241520119800257592002801455650001601483650001001499650002001509650001801529650002701547650001301574650001301587650000901600650002301609650001201632653002701644653001901671653001901690653002601709653001301735700001401748700001701762700002101779700001701800773012501817856008501942852000902027655001202036IND60689220520221117024339.0200420e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068922052DNAL7 a10.3109/07388551.2016.11633212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Changsheng10aBioprinting: an assessment based on manufacturing readiness levels  ap. 333-354.  aOver the last decade, bioprinting has emerged as a promising technology in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. With recent advances in additive manufacturing, bioprinting is poised to provide patient-specific therapies and new approaches for tissue and organ studies, drug discoveries and even food manufacturing. Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) is a method that has been applied to assess manufacturing maturity and to identify risks and gaps in technology-manufacturing transitions. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is used to evaluate the maturity of a technology. This paper reviews recent advances in bioprinting following the MRL scheme and addresses corresponding MRL levels of engineering challenges and gaps associated with the translation of bioprinting from lab-bench experiments to ultimate full-scale manufacturing of tissues and organs. According to our step-by-step TRL and MRL assessment, after years of rigorous investigation by the biotechnology community, bioprinting is on the cusp of entering the translational phase where laboratory research practices can be scaled up into manufacturing products specifically designed for individual patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioprinting 3adrugs 3afood processing 3amanufacturing 3amaximum residue limits 3amedicine 3apatients 3arisk 3atissue engineering 3atissues 0aAdditive manufacturing 0abiofabrication 0aorgan printing 0aregenerative medicine 0ascaffold1 aWang, Ben1 aZhang, Chuck1 aWysk, Richard A.1 aChen, Yi-Wen0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 37, no. 3 p.333-354dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/07388551.2016.11633213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014800172300001600320520209600336592002802432650002302460650001802483650001602501650001102517650001602528650001602544650001702560650001002577650001602587650001702603651001402620651001202634653001802646653002302664653001902687653001702706653002302723653002002746700001902766700002202785700002002807773013202827856008402959852000903043655001203052IND60539657120221118022658.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053965712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2015.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzello, Derek P.10aCoral growth patterns of Montastraea cavernosa and Porites astreoides in the Florida Keys: The importance of thermal stress and inimical waters  ap. 198-207.  aThe calcification and extension rates of two species of scleractinian coral (Montastraea cavernosa, Porites astreoides) were measured in corals experimentally transplanted to paired inshore and offshore locations in the Upper, Middle, and Lower Florida Keys from 2010 to 2011. Growth rates were compared with respect to 1) shelf location, 2) species, 3) region, and 4) temperature. Transplanted corals on inshore reefs generally calcified less than those at paired offshore sites, but these differences were only significant in a few cases. This difference in growth is likely because of two thermal stress events that occurred inshore, but not offshore, as growth records from cores of P. astreoides revealed significantly higher extension and calcification inshore from 2001–2013. The core data confirmed that the years 2010–2012 were a period of depressed growth inshore. Calcification and extension rates of the experimental corals were not statistically different between M. cavernosa and P. astreoides within a given site. The only exceptions were that calcification was higher in M. cavernosa at the Middle Keys inshore site. The Middle Florida Keys sites had the lowest rates of calcification, supporting the hypothesis that the influence of Florida Bay waters in this region contributes to poor reef development. Mean calcification rates negatively correlated with metrics of cold stress in M. cavernosa and heat stress in P. astreoides. The lack of a significant correlation between heat stress and mean calcification in M. cavernosa may help explain this species persistence on today's reefs. Maximum calcification and mean extension, however, were negatively correlated with maximum running 30-day mean temperature, showing that the growth of M. cavernosa is not completely insensitive to warm water stress. The ‘weedy’ life-history strategy of P. astreoides may compensate for the sensitivity of calcification rates to heat stress reported here, allowing this species to maintain the stable populations that have been observed throughout Florida and the wider Caribbean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorites astreoides 3acalcification 3acold stress 3acorals 3acorrelation 3aheat stress 3alife history 3areefs 3atemperature 3awater stress 3aCaribbean 3aFlorida 0aCalcification 0aSkeletal extension 0aBuoyant weight 0aFlorida Keys 0aFlorida Reef Tract 0aCoral bleaching1 aEnochs, Ian C.1 aKolodziej, Graham1 aCarlton, Renée0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2015 Oct., v. 471 p.198-207dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013300158300002000291520173400311592002802045650001802073650002502091650001402116650000902130650002002139650003102159650001802190650001102208650001302219650002002232650001402252650001202266650002102278650001102299650001602310650001802326650001302344650001602357650000902373650002102382650001702403650001302420650001402433650001502447650002902462650001302491700001802504700001802522700001602540700001302556700001902569700001702588700001702605773012802622856007502750852000902825655001202834IND60759878520221122074236.0211214e20211213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075987852DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo01595h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shishuai10aLycopene improves maternal reproductive performance by modulating milk composition and placental antioxidative and immune status  ap. 12448-12467.  aPlacental health and milk quality are important for maternal reproductive performance during pregnancy and lactation. Lycopene plays an important role in antioxidation, anti-inflammation and regulating lipid metabolism. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of dietary lycopene supplementation in the pig model on reproductive performance, placental health and milk composition during maternal gestation and lactation. In the present study, the litter size of live piglets was increased and the litter size of dead piglets was decreased by lycopene supplementation of the diet of sows. The litter weight at birth and weaning were increased in the lycopene group. Through placental proteomics, we enriched differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), gene ontology (GO) terms, and Kyoto encyclopedia of proteins and genomes (KEGG) pathways involved in immunity, anti-inflammation, antioxidants, and lipid metabolism and transport. Furthermore, in terms of placental health, we analyzed the levels of related enzymes, metabolites and mRNA expression in the placenta. Lycopene was shown to reduce mRNA expression and the levels of placental inflammatory factors, increase the content of immunoglobulin, improve the antioxidant capacity, and improve lipid metabolism and lipid transport in the placenta. In terms of sow milk composition, lycopene increased the levels of immunoglobulins in colostrum and lactose in colostrum and milk. Overall, the results of the present study demonstrate that dietary lycopene supplementation of sows during gestation and lactation improves the reproductive performance to a certain extent; this may be due to lycopene improving the placental health and milk composition of sows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3acolostrum 3adiet 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenome 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulins 3alactation 3alactose 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3alitter size 3alitter weight 3alycopene 3ametabolites 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk quality 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3aproteomics 3areproductive performance 3asow milk1 aMeng, Qingwei1 aBai, Yongsong1 aCao, Chunyu1 aLi, Jibo1 aCheng, Baojing1 aShi, Baoming1 aShan, Anshan0 tFood & function.g2021 Dec. 13, v. 12, no. 24 p.12448-12467dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo01595h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245011500206300001600321520148500337592002801822650001101850650002301861650002201884650002401906650001501930653003001945653001801975653003101993653001802024653003302042653002802075700001602103700001402119773008802133856008502221852000902306655001202315IND60635156220221121043411.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063515622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhaofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4556-664110aSimulation and evaluation of actual evapotranspiration based on inverse hydrological modeling at a basin scale  ap. 160-168.  aReliable estimation of actual evapotranspiration (AET) is essential for hydrological, ecological, and land-surface models. The water balance method is a useful tool for estimating AET. However, it usually neglects soil moisture (SM), which is a dominant factor in AET simulation. Based on field observations, an inverse hydrological modeling method was proposed for regional AET simulation. The method can be applied to estimate AET in other basins, where observations of SM are available. A nonlinear relationship between AET and potential evapotranspiration, a soil water constraint factor, was developed and calibrated for the studied basin. Results of the AET evaluation indicated this relationship was able to estimate AET accurately for both monthly and two-week series, as the Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) was 0.903 and 0.613, respectively. The meteorologically based complementary relationship (CR) method was also able to estimate monthly AET accurately, in particular the revised CR method. But it showed poor performance when estimating AET at a shorter timescale. The performance of the revised CR method with a calibrated parameter was better than that of the initial CR method, as the NSE improved from 0.52 to 0.70. Overall, the performance of the nonlinear relationship with calibrated parameters was better than that of the CR method. In conclusion, monthly AET can be accurately estimated using the CR method based only on meteorological data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3ameteorological data 3asoil water 0aActual evapotranspiration 0aWater balance 0aComplementary relationship 0aSoil moisture 0aPotential evapotranspiration 0aQinghai-Tibetan Plateau1 aYao, Zhijun1 aWang, Rui0 tCatena.g2019 Sept., v. 180 p.160-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245010600167300001600273500002000289520153800309592002801847650001801875650001301893650001101906650002001917650001601937650002101953650002501974650000901999650001302008650001202021650001502033650001002048651001002058700002102068700001702089700002102106700002002127700002102147700001802168773011402186856007402300852000902374655001202383IND60587335920221122051515.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058733592DNAL7 a10.1111/gwat.125082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicot, Jean‐Philippe10aMethane Occurrences in Aquifers Overlying the Barnett Shale Play with a Focus on Parker County, Texas  ap. 469-481.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClusters of elevated methane concentrations in aquifers overlying the Barnett Shale play have been the focus of recent national attention as they relate to impacts of hydraulic fracturing. The objective of this study was to assess the spatial extent of high dissolved methane previously observed on the western edge of the play (Parker County) and to evaluate its most likely source. A total of 509 well water samples from 12 counties (14,500 km²) were analyzed for methane, major ions, and carbon isotopes. Most samples were collected from the regional Trinity Aquifer and show only low levels of dissolved methane (85% of 457 unique locations <0.1 mg/L). Methane, when present is primarily thermogenic (δ¹³C 10th and 90th percentiles of −57.54 and −39.00‰ and C1/C2+C3 ratio 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of 5, 15, and 42). High methane concentrations (>20 mg/L) are limited to a few spatial clusters. The Parker County cluster area includes historical vertical oil and gas wells producing from relatively shallow formations and recent horizontal wells producing from the Barnett Shale (depth of ∼1500 m). Lack of correlation with distance to Barnett Shale horizontal wells, with distance to conventional wells, and with well density suggests a natural origin of the dissolved methane. Known commercial very shallow gas accumulations (<200 m in places) and historical instances of water wells reaching gas pockets point to the underlying Strawn Group of Paleozoic age as the main natural source of the dissolved gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaleozoic era 3aaquifers 3acarbon 3adissolved gases 3agroundwater 3ahorizontal wells 3ahydraulic fracturing 3aions 3aisotopes 3amethane 3aoil fields 3ashale 3aTexas1 aMickler, Patrick1 aLarson, Toti1 aClara Castro, M.1 aDarvari, Roxana1 aUhlman, Kristine1 aCostley, Ruth0 tGround water.g2017 July, v. 55, no. 4 p.469-481dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl49631x0017-467X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gwat.125083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245016900161300002000330520163400350592002801984650002202012650002502034650000902059650001802068650002302086650001202109650002102121650002002142650001702162650001902179650001802198650001402216650002502230650001602255651000902271700001702280700001902297700002102316700002102337700001702358700001802375773012802393856007502521852000902596655001202605IND60759878620221122074209.0211214e20211213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075987862DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo01621k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Cheng-Pei10aSuppression on allergic airway inflammation of dehulled adlay (Coix lachryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen Stapf) in mice and anti-degranulation phytosterols from adlay bran  ap. 12788-12799.  aAdlay (Coix lachryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen Stapf) seeds have been used in Asia for thousands years to treat warts, chapped skin, rheumatism, and neuralgia. The anti-allergic activity of dehulled adlay (DA) seeds was identified, and the bran (AB) is regarded as the main functional constituent in the edible part. However, no study has focused on in vivo acute anti-allergic airway inflammation. In the present report, we investigated DA methanolic extract (DAM) reversed ovalbumin (OVA)/methacholine (Mch)-induced airway hypersensitivity, decreased interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels from splenocytes, suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β, and IL-13 levels and reduced eosinophil counts and eotaxin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which imply that the modulatory effects of DA should involve allergic degranulation. Further, seven phytosterols were isolated from AB ethanolic extract (ABE); among them, 3-O-caffeoyl-5β-sitostan-3-ol, β-sitosterol 3-O-glucopyranoside and β-sitosterol inhibited β-hexosaminidase release from A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells with percentages of 54.1%, 52.0% and 48.5%, respectively, at 50 μM. In addition, β-sitosterol reduced immunoglobulin (Ig)E-stimulated degranulation on RBL-2H3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The phytosterols were the predominant components based on gas chromatography (GC) analysis. This is the first study to demonstrate that DA suppressed OVA/Mch-induced acute airway inflammation. The phytosterols in AB showed significant anti-degranulation activities, and may be regarded as the indicative components of AB for anti-allergy effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoix lacryma-jobi 3aanti-allergic agents 3abran 3adose response 3agas chromatography 3ahulling 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-5 3aovalbumin 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asplenocytes 3aAsia1 aLee, Ming-Yi1 aHsia, Shih-Min1 aChiang, Wenchang1 aKuo, Yueh-Hsiung1 aHsu, Hsin-Yi1 aLin, Yun-Lian0 tFood & function.g2021 Dec. 13, v. 12, no. 24 p.12788-12799dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo01621k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245009300176506011700269506007600386520143400462592002801896506003701924650001501961650001601976650001501992650001602007650001602023650002802039650001202067650001902079653002302098653001902121653002102140653001402161700002102175700002102196700002402217773011002241856009002351852000902441655001202450IND60777175320221207113336.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077717532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.1044702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFjellstad, Wendy10aPlanning the first view: Establishing a landscape monitoring scheme based on photography  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe visual impacts of landscape change are important for how people perceive landscapes and whether they consider changes to be positive or negative. Landscape photographs and photographs of landscape elements may capture information about the visual qualities of landscapes and can also be used to illustrate, and even to quantify, how these visual qualities change over time. We developed a methodology for a monitoring scheme, based on taking photographs from exactly the same locations at different points in time. We tested two methods: one where fieldworkers chose freely the location and direction of photographs, and one where photo locations and four out of five directions were predefined. We found that the method using predefined locations provided a representative sample of the visual qualities present in the landscape and was relatively person-independent but missed rare landscape components. The method using free selection of photo locations and directions captured rarities, but the content of the photos varied from photographer to photographer. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, we recommend a method that combines aspects of both when establishing a monitoring scheme based on repeat photography, with predefined locations to ensure that the entire area is covered, and additional freely chosen photo locations to capture special subject matter that would otherwise be missed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3amonitoring 3aphotographs 3aphotography 3arepresentative sampling 3atesting 3aurban planning 0aRepeat photography 0aVisual quality 0aLandscape change 0aViewpoint1 aEiter, Sebastian1 aPuschmann, Oskar1 aKrøgli, Svein Olav0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2022 Oct., v. 226 p.104470-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.1044703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010700164500001900271520137900290592002801669650002601697650001501723650001601738650002301754650001301777650001401790650001801804653002301822653001401845653001801859653000901877653001801886653001501904700001201919773011201931856008302043852000902126655001202135IND60724254420221119075152.0210212e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2020.1129012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haomin12aA critical review: Recent advances in “digital” biomolecule detection with single copy sensitivity  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDetection of a single biomolecule, ranging from nucleic acids, proteins, viruses to bacteria, is of paramount importance in various fields including biology, environment, food and agriculture industry, public health, and medicine. With the understanding of the biological functions of these biomolecules (or bioparticles) and their impacts on public health, environmental pollution, and food safety, advanced detection techniques are unprecedentedly demanded for their early and/or sensitive detection. In this critical review, a series of elegant research about digital detection of biomolecules with potential single copy sensitivity is reviewed and summarized with the focus on the design principle and the innovation of how to accomplish the “digital” detection concept. Starting with a brief introduction on the importance of digital detection, recent advances in “digital” biomolecule detection with single copy sensitivity are grouped and discussed based on the difference of signal reporting systems, including surrogate signal development for “digital” detection, direct visualization for “digital” detection, and nucleic acid amplification enabled “digital” detection. Interdisciplinary combination and integration of different cutting-edge techniques are also discussed with details. The review is closed with the conclusion and future trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3abiosensors 3afood safety 3agene amplification 3amedicine 3apollution 3apublic health 0aSingle biomolecule 0aBiosensor 0aDigital ELISA 0adPCR 0aMicrofluidics 0aLabel-free1 aLei, Yu0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 177 p.112901-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.1129013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012500157520148700282592002801769650001701797650002101814650002401835650001301859650001301872650001701885650001301902651001001915700001901925773012601944856007302070852000902143655001202152IND60651782620221119123339.0190712e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065178262DNAL7 a10.3390/su80302552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Pengjun14aThe Role of Villages and Townships in Informal Land Development in China: An Investigation on the City Fringe of Beijing  aThe past decades have witnessed a number of informal land developments on the urban fringe in China although many strict state regulations have been made to control this. The dual urban rural land system is widely believed to be one major determinant of informal developments in the existing literature. However, the important role of local villages and townships are often neglected. This paper aims to shed light on this by looking at the gated informal housing communities in Beijing as a case study. It investigates the role of villages and townships in informal land development and the conflicts of interest that arise with state regulations in the context of political decentralization. The results of analysis show that township governments have an ambivalent attitude or even give tacit approval to informal land development in villages since these informal developments actually bring economic benefits to local villagers and themselves. The situation seems to be worse as townships have poor fiscal capacity and a growing administrative responsibility for improvement of local development in the context of decentralization. Villages are keen to capture economic benefits from informal land development with help from private developers. As a result, a local, informal coalition between townships, villages, and private developers emerged at the grass roots level. This presents a major challenge to the state regulations designed for sustainable urban growth management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecentralization 3afinancial economics 3aland use 3apolitics 3aurbanization 3avillages 3aChina1 aZhang, Mengzhu0 tSustainability.g2016 Mar. 09, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80302553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007200139245010800211300001800319500002000337520145700357592002801814650001501842650002201857650001601879650001901895650001601914650001301930650002301943650000901966650001201975650001501987650002002002650001302022650001502035700007302050700006902123700006502192700008102257700006002338700007002398773012302468856007402591852000902665655001202674IND60783275320221116203906.0220719e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078327532DNAL7 a10.1111/are.159432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Ana Caroliny Cerdeira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7136-026010aDaily rhythm of some blood parameters in two Amazonian fish, Astronotus ocellatus and Brycon amazonicus  ap. 4460-4471.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe evaluated the effect of the light–dark (LD) cycle on energy expenditure indicators for two species of Amazonian fish of commercial interest, oscar (Astronotus ocellatus) and matrinxã (Brycon amazonicus). Fish were exposed to a 12:12 h LD cycle, with lights on at ‘zeitgeber time’ (ZT) = 0 h. Six animals were used for blood collection every 4 h for 24 h (six time points, three in the light period and three in the dark period). Most haematological parameters exhibited daily rhythms with the acrophase at the end of the dark phase or the beginning of the light period for both species, which may be related to the greater energy demand of these species during the day. For A. ocellatus, triglycerides and total protein showed acrophases at ZT = 13:32 ± 2:45 h and ZT = 23:42 ± 1:55 h, respectively, while the other plasma parameters showed no significant daily differences. In B. amazonicus, significant rhythms were observed for glucose levels (acrophase at ZT = 04:16 ± 2:47 h), triglycerides (ZT = 6:51 ± 4:06 h) and total cholesterol (ZT = 23:22 ± 3:45 h). However, total protein and cortisol levels did not show rhythmicity in this species. Our results highlight the importance of the evaluation of biological rhythms for plasma physiological parameters related to energy expenditure in species with commercial interest and susceptible to stressful situations in farming conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstronotus 3aBrycon amazonicus 3aaquaculture 3ablood sampling 3acholesterol 3acortisol 3aenergy expenditure 3afish 3aglucose 3aphotophase 3aprotein content 3aresearch 3ascotophase1 ade Souza Gonçalves, Jhomaxon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4404-69111 ade Mattos, Bruno Olivetti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8341-84231 aMarcon, Jaydione Luiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5141-78161 aSánchez‐Vázquez, Francisco Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2366-97141 ade Alba, Gonzalo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3749-98991 aCarvalho, Thaís Billalba,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2495-57200 tAquaculture research.g2022 Aug., v. 53, no. 12 p.4460-4471dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.159433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007000161300001600231500002000247520182100267592002802088596007902116650002502195650001502220650001202235650001702247650001802264650001602282650001502298650001702313650001302330650001002343650001702353650001002370650001602380700001602396700002302412700001702435773011302452856007402565852000902639655001202648IND60771939620221116140936.0220330e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077193962DNAL7 a10.1111/wre.125232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehnhoff, Erik A.10aElectricity as an effective weed control tool in non‐crop areas  ap. 149-159.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhile weed management is often thought of as an agricultural issue, weeds are also problematic for homeowners, public space managers and utilities. In these situations, weeds are typically hand‐pulled, mechanically treated or managed via herbicides. Hand pulling and mechanical treatments are labour‐intensive, and all control methods may have unintended off‐target impacts, necessitating new alternatives for weed control. We have developed a method of using electricity to effectively manage unwanted plants. A series of experiments was conducted with the aim of developing operating protocols with consideration to specific scenarios: we tested a system on Morus alba (mulberry) and Ulmus pumila saplings, determined the response of Tamarix spp. (tamarisk) to different electricity doses, evaluated electricity as pre‐emergent weed control in xeriscaping, and tested the ability of electricity to prevent climbing growth by the vine Convolvulus arvensis (field bindweed). Tests on M. alba and U. pumila demonstrated that low doses of electricity applied over several days are effective in killing trees up to 20 cm in diameter. The Tamarix experiment showed that the plants displayed typical dose–response characteristics with higher doses leading to less plant growth. Results of the pre‐emergent weed control experiment demonstrated the excellent ability of electricity to prevent weed growth, with treated plots having a mean weed cover of 4% compared to 94% in control plots after 4 months. Finally, electricity was shown to be 100% effective in preventing C. arvensis from climbing poles. Our results indicate that electricity is a viable alternative to manual, mechanical or chemical methods for small tree control, pre‐emergent weed control in xeriscaping, and prevention of climbing weeds.  aPublisher supplied data  cWestern Integrated Pest Management Center, University of California, Davis 3aConvolvulus arvensis 3aMorus alba 3aTamarix 3aUlmus pumila 3adose response 3aelectricity 3amulberries 3aplant growth 3aresearch 3avines 3aweed control 3aweeds 3axeriscaping1 aNeher, Paul1 aIndacochea, Andres1 aBeck, Leslie0 tWeed research.g2022 Apr., v. 62, no. 2 p.149-159dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44597x0043-17377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.125233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012500174300001600299520265700315592002802972650001503000650002903015650002203044650001103066650001403077650001103091650001503102650001603117650002103133650002003154650002403174650001603198700002303214773008003237856008603317852000903403655001203412IND60085028120221120022518.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008502812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo Brano, Valerio13aAn efficient analytical approach for obtaining a five parameters model of photovoltaic modules using only reference data  ap. 894-903.  aExploiting the equivalent one-diode circuit of a photovoltaic (PV) module, this paper proposes a novel and fully analytical model to predict the electrical performance upon solar irradiance intensity and PV module temperature. The model refers essentially to an equivalent circuit governed by five parameters and the extraction of them permits to describe the current–voltage curve of the PV panel and consequently permits to assess the energy output of PV modules. The proposed model extracts the five characteristic parameters using only exact analytical relationship and tabular data always available such as short-circuit current, open circuit voltage and the Maximum Power Point (MPP). The difference with other models consists in the complete absence of mathematical simplifications or other physical assumptions. All used equations were obtained with a transparent analytical procedure. A new resolution procedure for solving the equation that describes the equivalent one diode circuit system is also described. The procedure is based upon the Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) algorithm and transforms the extraction of the five parameters into a constrained non-linear optimization problem. The purely analytical model, the absence of data to be obtained from graphic methods or not always available in data-sheets, and a new optimized procedure to solve the system of equations lead to obtain values of the five parameters that perfectly fit the official tabular data. The suggested procedure of numerical solution of a local minimum problem allows converging towards the solution with the desired accuracy in a fast and effective way. Although in the scientific literature there are several models able to determine the value of these five parameters, these procedures are always affected by inevitable inaccuracies linked to various simplifications or due to the use of non-tabular data such as some graphic characteristics of the experimental I–V curve (moreover not always available). The model, as opposed to those already known in the literature, is exclusively based on analytical relationships and is free of any simplifications that may affect the reliability of the results. The proposed model allows a more accurate modeling of the PV modules based solely on reference data and the availability of decision support tools that may reliably predict the energy produced by a photovoltaic panel is essential in the design phase of the plant to avoid future problems related to incorrect sizing. Furthermore, reliable energy predictions lead to more correct economic analyses that can stimulate the diffusion of the PV technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adecision support systems 3aeconomic analysis 3aenergy 3aequations 3amodels 3aprediction 3areliability 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3asystem optimization 3atemperature1 aCiulla, Giuseppina0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.894-903dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016200168300001500330520093000345592002801275650002501303650001601328650002501344650002701369650002601396650001401422651001001436653002001446653002201466653002401488700002101512700002201533773013101555856008401686852000901770655001201779IND60121752120221118070337.0150324e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012175212DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7359912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIraldo, Fabio13aAn application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a green marketing tool for agricultural products: the case of extra-virgin olive oil in Val di Cornia, Italy  ap. 78-103.  aIn recent years, the interest in environmental issues has increased, along with the idea that consumer choices can actually improve the performance of the production system.

The results of LCA were used to set the environmental requirements of a local product qualification scheme defined according to the National Protocol (QUAM – Qualità Ambientale), signed by two Italian Ministries and four Regional Governments, on the environmental qualification of cluster products.

Assessing the efficiency and cost‐effectiveness of different reintroduction strategies may help identify and promote efficient practices. Captive‐breeding is widely used in animal reintroductions, although concerns have been raised about relatively high failure rates and economic costs. Here, we compared the effectiveness of two simultaneously used strategies in the reintroduction of the Bonelli’s eagle on the island of Mallorca: The release of captive‐bred chicks and wild‐reared, translocated non‐juveniles. To do so, we estimated the main vital rates for individuals released by both strategies and used these to perform population simulations to assess their overall performances. The use of wild‐reared non‐juveniles showed a trend with higher numbers of breeding pairs 10 years after the end of releases (14.75 pairs, 95% CI 4–25 vs. 11.21 pairs, 95% CI 2–24) and was the only strategy that prevented extinction in the long term. Following that, based on cost estimations of every strategy and different reintroduction budgets, we assessed the cost‐effectiveness of releasing wild‐reared non‐juveniles compared with two captive‐breeding alternatives: Releasing chicks either originally from breeding programmes or extracted from nests in natural populations. Again, releasing wild‐reared non‐juveniles was the only strategy that prevented long‐term extinction in all economic scenarios (i.e. low‐budget scenario 21.49 pairs, 95% CI 2–25). The use of chicks sourced from captive‐breeding programmes did not guarantee long‐term persistence even in high‐budget scenarios (14.50 pairs, 95% CI 0–25). Releasing wild‐reared non‐juveniles boosts early recruitment to the breeding population and early reproduction, which can be key for reintroduction success. However, in some scenarios, post‐release effects can be stronger in wild‐reared individuals, especially because of high translocation stress and post‐release dispersal. Hence, we recommend undertaking careful evaluation of the pros and cons of every strategy and embracing adaptive management to choose best strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  cRed Eléctrica de España  aLIFE12NAT/ES/000701cLIFE Bonelli 3aadaptive management 3aartificial rearing 3acost effectiveness 3aeagles 3aextinction1 aHernández‐Matías, Antonio1 aViada, Carlota1 aReal, Joan0 tAnimal conservation.g2022 Apr., v. 25, no. 2 p.170-181dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774058x1367-94307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acv.127293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009000170300001800260520146300278592002801741650002001769650001501789650001201804650001301816650001501829650002701844650000901871650002101880650001401901650001401915650000901929700001701938700002401955700001901979700001901998700001702017700001802034700001802052700001702070773008202087856008602169852000902255655001202264IND60085028420221120022519.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008502842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaethanom, A.12aA low-cost pyrogas cleaning system for power generation: Scaling up from lab to pilot  ap. 1080-1088.  aAn effective pyrogas cleaning system is necessary for downstream application of biomass pyrolysis technology for power generation. Particularly, tar must be lowered to a satisfying level in order to avoid the problem of tar blockage for preventing damage to the engine and to prolong the engine lifetime. This research was carried out from previous successful research on oil scrubbers and char adsorption for tar removal. Further lab scale experimentation was done to find the appropriate quantity of oil to be used in the scrubber; the results were used for scaling up and showed that the optimum system needed for 0.045m³/h pyrogas the quantity of 1l, during a test lasted 30min. The 1l oil scrubber was combined with a 41g char adsorption bed and 97.6% gravimetric tar removal efficiency was obtained. The combination of the oil scrubber and the char adsorption bed was scaled up and installed into the IPRP (Integrated Pyrolysis Regenerated Plant) at the University of Perugia, with chestnut wood (Castanea Sativa Miller) as feedstock, and connected to a 6kWe Lombardini engine with a power generator and electric load. Pyrogas was sampled at 0.7m³/h and connected to the cleaning system, consisting of a 15l oil scrubber combined with a 922g char adsorption bed. The demonstrating test was successfully accomplished with 98.7% gravimetric tar removal at the exit of the char adsorption bed. The engine ran smoothly and the electric load was constant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea sativa 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3acleaning 3afeedstocks 3agenerators (equipment) 3aoils 3apower generation 3apyrolysis 3ascrubbers 3awood1 aBartocci, P.1 aD’ Alessandro, B.1 aD’ Amico, M.1 aTestarmata, F.1 aMoriconi, N.1 aSlopiecka, K.1 aYoshikawa, K.1 aFantozzi, F.0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.1080-1088dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245011600179300001600295520161900311592002801930650001601958650001601974650002801990650001202018700002902030700003202059700002602091700002802117700002002145773011102165856008102276852000902357655001202366IND50089175220221116165502.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008917522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-014-0400-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Domínguez, Elisa10aDevelopment and validation of a standard area diagram set to aid assessment of severity of loquat scab on fruit  ap. 413-422.  aA standard area diagram set (SAD) to aid visual assessment of loquat scab (caused by Fusicladium eriobotryae) severity on fruit was developed and evaluated for improving accuracy, precision and reliability of visual estimates. The SAD set contains eight black and white diagrams of diseased fruit with severity values from 2 % to 98 %. To evaluate the SADs, a group of 20 raters (comprising 10 ‘experienced’ and 10 ‘inexperienced’ raters) assessed the same set of 50 images three times, the first without SADs and the second and third using the SADs as an aid. Only for the group of inexperienced raters did SADs significantly improve accuracy (bias correction factor, Cb = 0.93 without SADs and 0.98 with SADs), precision (correlation coefficient, r = 0.88 without SADs and r = 0.96 with SADs) and overall agreement (Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, ρc = 0.82 without SADs and ρc with SADs = 0.95) of the estimates. Accuracy and precision of the estimates by inexperienced raters were significantly higher than those obtained by the experienced raters, especially for the second assessment with SADs. Inter-rater reliability was improved when SADs were used by inexperienced raters, whereas a high degree of intra-rater reliability was obtained by both experienced and inexperienced raters when using SADs. The SADs developed in this study were useful for obtaining more accurate, precise and reliable assessments of loquat scab for inexperienced raters, and should be used as an aid for assessing scab in epidemiological studies or monitoring for decision-making purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusicladium 3acorrelation 3aepidemiological studies 3aloquats1 aMartins, Ricardo Brainer1 aDel Ponte, Emerson Medeiros1 aMichereff, Sami Jorge1 aGarcía-Jiménez, José1 aArmengol, Josep0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2014 June, v. 139, no. 2 p.413-422dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0400-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009100170300001600261520149700277592002801774650001701802650001501819650001201834650001801846650001101864650003001875650001101905650001101916650001101927650001101938650001401949650001701963650001301980653002501993653001202018653003202030653002102062700001602083700001302099700005602112773011402168856008602282852000902368655001202377IND60611943820221120211946.0201125e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061194382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Zhengyang10aEffects of oxygen functional complexes on arsenic adsorption over carbonaceous surface  ap. 436-444.  aThe adsorption mechanism of As₂O₃ on carbonaceous surface modified with oxygen functional complexes was studied using density functional theory to understand the effect of oxygen functional complexes on arsenic adsorption. Full-parameter geometrical optimization and single point energy were calculated on B3LYP/def2-SVP and B3LYP/def2-TZVP level. Results showed that As₂O₃ adsorption on bare carbonaceous surface took place in physical as well as chemical way. The adsorption energies were between −2.07 kJ/mol to −480.20 kJ/mol. Compared to armchair model, zigzag model was more suitable as a carbonaceous sorbent. The participation of oxygen functional complexes greatly promoted the surface activity of carbonaceous surface and its adsorption capacity on arsenic. The adsorption energies of arsenic on carbonaceous surface with oxygen functional complexes were between −111.56 kJ/mol to −669.46 kJ/mol. The promotion order of oxygen functional complexes on surface activity was: phenol > lactone > carbonyl > semiquinone > carboxyl. Oxygen functional complexes promoted adsorption capacity of carbonaceous surface through enhancing the activities of neighboring carbon atoms rather than directly providing active sites. Mayer bond order was a reliable way to understand the adsorption process of arsenic on carbonaceous surface.

The addition of NaNO2 during the oxidation of myoglobin significantly reduced the content of carbonyl and disulfide bonds and protected the sulfhydryl groups from hydroxyl radical oxidation (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the secondary structure of myoglobin between the control group and the SN treatment group(P > 0.05). At the same time, NaNO2 had an inhibitory effect on the expansion of the hemoglobin center size and the transition of Fe from a low spin state to a high spin state caused by radical-oxidized. These findings suggest that NaNO2 has potential for treatment effects in a hydroxyl radical-oxidized myoglobin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adisulfide bonds 3ahemoglobin 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3ameat 3amoieties 3amyoglobin 3aoxidation 3asodium nitrite 3asulfhydryl groups 3ayaks 0aNaNO2 0aHydroxyl radical 0aSecondary structure1 aChen, Hao1 aZhang, Qing1 aMa, Jibing1 aYu, Qunli1 aHan, Ling1 aChen, Cheng1 aSong, Rende0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Aug. 26, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1085563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006900152245008500221300001400306520194500320592002802265650002802293650002002321650001102341650001502352650001902367650002002386650001702406650001602423653001602439653002502455653003102480653003302511653002102544653001002565773009402575856008702669852000902756655001202765IND60644836620221117190720.0190705e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064483662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWadoux, Alexandre M.J.-C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7325-971610aUsing deep learning for multivariate mapping of soil with quantified uncertainty  ap. 59-70.  aDigital soil mapping (DSM) techniques are widely employed to generate soil maps. Soil properties are typically predicted individually, while ignoring the interrelation between them. Models for predicting multiple properties exist, but they are computationally demanding and often fail to provide accurate description of the associated uncertainty. In this paper a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is described to predict several soil properties with quantified uncertainty. CNN has the advantage that it incorporates spatial contextual information of environmental covariates surrounding an observation. A single CNN model can be trained to predict multiple soil properties simultaneously. I further propose a two-step approach to estimate the uncertainty of the prediction for mapping using a neural network model. The methodology is tested mapping six soil properties on the French metropolitan territory using measurements from the LUCAS dataset and a large set of environmental covariates portraying the factors of soil formation. Results indicate that the multivariate CNN model produces accurate maps as shown by the coefficient of determination and concordance correlation coefficient, compared to a conventional machine learning technique. For this country extent mapping, the maps predicted by CNN have a detailed pattern with significant spatial variation. Evaluation of the uncertainty maps using the median of the standardized squared prediction error and accuracy plots suggests that the uncertainty was accurately quantified, albeit slightly underestimated. The tests conducted using different window size of input covariates to predict the soil properties indicate that CNN benefits from using local contextual information in a radius of 4.5 km. I conclude that CNN is an effective model to predict several soil properties and that the associated uncertainty can be accurately quantified with the proposed approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3amodels 3aprediction 3asoil formation 3asoil properties 3asoil surveys 3auncertainty 0aPedometrics 0aPrediction intervals 0aUncertainty quantification 0aConvolutional neural network 0aMachine learning 0aLUCAS0 tGeoderma.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 351 p.59-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016600170300001600336520127400352592002801626650003101654650002401685650002001709650002101729650001101750653003601761653002201797653004301819700002401862773013201886856008402018852000902102655001202111IND60121752620221118073107.0150324e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012175262DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2012.7381902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColombo, Sergio10aSocial preferences for agricultural policy instruments: joint consideration of non-attendance to attributes and to alternatives in modelling discrete choice data  ap. 215-232.  aThis paper uses the choice experiment method to analyse social preferences towards a set of agricultural policy instruments that are likely to play a key role in the post-2013 design of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. It contributes to the choice experiment literature by incorporating different attribute processing strategies into stated choice models. By comparing models that consider attribute non-attendance for individual choice tasks and for the whole sequence of choices, we demonstrate the impact of different ways of accounting for attribute non-attendance on model performance and preferences. In addition, we test whether ‘non-attendance to alternatives’, which describes the elimination of alternatives due to the presence of attribute levels deemed unacceptable to a respondent, is a relevant information processing strategy in a choice experiment context. The results clearly show that individuals allocate attention over a reduced array of information and jointly apply decision strategies that involve attribute non-attendance and non-attendance to alternatives. The joint consideration of these information processing strategies results in a significant improvement of model fit to data, and a better description of respondents’ preferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aagricultural policy 3adecision making 3amodel validation 3amodels 0aattribute processing strategies 0achoice experiment 0aCommon Agricultural Policy instruments1 aGlenk, K.q(Klaus),0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2014 Feb. 1, v. 57, no. 2 p.215-232dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2012.7381903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003100154245009900185520146000284592002801744650003001772650002701802650002301829650002001852650001901872650001201891650001201903650001601915650001401931650001701945650002601962653004001988653002202028653004002050653004902090653001702139700003202156700002002188700001902208773012302227856008902350852000902439655001202448IND60743716820221118224301.0210723e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074371682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2021.1113942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Gordones, María C.12aA store-operated Ca2+-entry in Trypanosoma equiperdum: Physiological evidences of its presence  aThe Trypanosomatidae family encompasses many unicellular organisms responsible of several tropical diseases that affect humans and animals. Livestock tripanosomosis caused by Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T. brucei), Trypanosoma equiperdum (T. equiperdum) and Trypanosoma evansi (T. evansi), have a significant socio-economic impact and limit animal protein productivity throughout the intertropical zones of the world. Similarly, to all organisms, the maintenance of Ca²⁺ homeostasis is vital for these parasites, and the mechanism involved in the intracellular Ca²⁺ regulation have been widely described. However, the evidences related to the mechanisms responsible for the Ca²⁺ entry are scarce. Even more, to date the presence of a store-operated Ca²⁺ channel (SOC) has not been reported. Despite the apparent absence of Orai and STIM-like proteins in these parasites, in the present work we demonstrate the presence of a store-operated Ca²⁺-entry (SOCE) in T. equiperdum, using physiological techniques. This Ca²⁺-entry is induced by thapsigargin (TG) and 2,5-di-t-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ), and inhibited by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB). Additionally, the use of bioinformatics techniques allowed us to identify putative transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, present in members of the Trypanozoon family, which would be possible candidates responsible for the SOCE described in the present work in T. equiperdum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrypanosoma brucei brucei 3aTrypanosoma equiperdum 3aTrypanosoma evansi 3aanimal proteins 3abioinformatics 3aborates 3acalcium 3ahomeostasis 3alivestock 3aparasitology 3asocioeconomic factors 0aStore operated calcium entry (SOCE) 0aThapsigargin (TG) 0a2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB) 0a2, 5-di-t-butyl-1, 4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) 0aCa2+-channel1 aRamírez-Iglesias, José R.1 aBenaim, Gustavo1 aMendoza, Marta0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2021 July, v. 244 p.111394-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32344x0166-68517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2021.1113943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245012500157300001800282500002000300520098400320592002801304650001601332650001401348650002301362650001101385650002101396650001901417650001301436650001301449700001901462700001901481773016101500852000901661856007501670655001201745IND4434385720221122180459.0210324e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443438572DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.239402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Nga H.10aSET‐LRP of N,N‐dimethylacrylamide and of N‐isopropylacrylamide at 25 °C in protic and in dipolar aprotic solvents  ap. 1752-1763.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe single‐electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET‐LRP) of water‐soluble monomers, N,N‐dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and N‐isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), initiated with 2‐methylchloropropionate (MCP) in dipolar aprotic and protic solvents is reported. The radical polymerization of acrylamides is characterized by higher rate constants of propagation and bimolecular termination than acrylates. Therefore, the addition of CuCl₂ is required to mediate deactivation in the early stages of the reaction. Through the use of Cu(0)‐wire/Me₆‐TREN catalysis, conditions were optimized to minimize the amount of externally added CuCl₂ required to maintain a linear evolution of molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution. By using less CuCl₂ additive, the amount of soluble copper species that must ultimately be removed from the reaction mixture is reduced. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here, we use the early colonization pattern of 23 epiphytic lichen species in a former tree‐less heathland landscape (170 km²) to test three hypotheses on how a landscape is colonized: A) mainly by long‐distance dispersal (LDD), B) by rare LDD events followed by limited local dispersal, and C) mainly by limited dispersal, resulting in a colonization front. The study system consisted of a chronosequence of 94 habitat patches constituting 0.4% of the landscape area, with a minimum inter‐site distance of 0.2 km. We used generalized linear mixed models with Bayesian inference to test predictions from the hypotheses. When age of sites and habitat area were accounted for, additional effects of geographical position of sites (distance from old sites, distance‐dependent relative propagule pressure, and distance from border of study area) on the probability of colonization by lichen species were small. Furthermore, species richness of sites did not depend on geographical position, either. Our results support a colonization process mainly governed by LDD at landscape scale, and that local stepwise colonization was not important. We argue that passively dispersed species with numerous small propagules tend to exhibit patchy populations with extensive dispersal at the landscape scale, rather than behaving like classical metapopulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3abiogeography 3achronosequences 3aepiphytes 3ahabitats 3aheathlands 3alandscapes 3alichens 3amodels 3apopulation 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aspecies diversity1 aBlom, Hans H.1 aHeegaard, Einar1 aSætersdal, Magne0 tEcography.g2015 Sept., v. 38, no. 9 p.939-948dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.010473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245010200183300001400285520100100299592002801300650002201328650002301350650001701373650001201390650001101402650002601413650001101439650000901450650001801459650001401477650002001491650001901511650002001530650000901550650001601559650002901575650002101604650002001625650002001645650003001665651001001695651001001705653001001715653002201725653002501747653001901772653002601791700001901817700001301836700001701849700001701866773008601883856008401969852000902053655001202062IND60086733020221120143058.0160903e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673302DNAL7 a234162692pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Lili10aStatus of metal accumulation in farmland soils across China: From distribution to risk assessment  ap. 55-62.  aIncreasing metal pollution has drawn broad public attention in China due to severe environmental quality deterioration. However, so far, there has been no study to survey metal accumulation in Chinese farmland soil at the national scale. In this study, we determined 11 metals in farmland soils across the Mainland China. Our results indicated the concentrations of Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu (10.1–184.2, 0.082–1.31, 20.2–321.9, 8.2–515.9 mg/kg, respectively) were elevated above their reference values. Moreover, these metals followed a similar geochemical distribution pattern. The accumulation of Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu in soils may be associated with human activities for soil fertility. Cadmium had the highest pollution index (PI) of 5.28, and the average hazard quotients (HQs) for all the metals were below 1. Hence, except for Cd, the metals in Chinese arable soils are comparatively safe. Results from this study may provide valuable information for agricultural soil management in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3aarable soils 3acadmium 3acopper 3aenvironmental quality 3ahumans 3alead 3anormal values 3apollution 3arisk assessment 3asoil fertility 3asoil management 3azinc 2aAgriculture 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aRisk Assessment 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina 0aMetal 0aAgricultural soil 0aSpatial distribution 0aPotential risk 0aSource identification1 aYang, Fangxing1 aXu, Chao1 aYang, Huayun1 aLiu, Weiping0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 May, v. 176 p.55-62dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04011naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100002200190245013400212300001800346500002400364500001500388520219100403650002802594650002102622650001702643650001002660650002302670650002202693650002602715650002502741650001802766650001002784650002302794650002302817650002302840650001602863650001902879650001802898650001902916650001202935650000902947650002102956650002302977650001603000651001903016651001903035653002403054700002103078773011903099852000903218856007503227930003303302945002503335946001303360655001203373IND4441417720221123022119.0100820e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444141772DNAL7 a221271642pmid7 a10.1603/EN100042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL001 0aK001 0aP0101 aRowles, Alexei D.10aArgentine Ant Invasion Associated with Loblolly Pines in the Southeastern United States: Minimal Impacts but Seasonally Sustained  ap. 1141-1150.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInvasive ants are notorious for directly displacing native ant species. Although such impacts are associated with Argentine ant invasions (Linepithema humile) worldwide, impacts within natural habitat are less widely reported, particularly those affecting arboreal ant communities. Argentine ants were detected in North Carolina mixed pine-hardwood forest for the first time but were localized on and around loblolly pines (Pinus taeda), probably because of association with honeydew-producing Hemiptera. We explored the potential impacts of L. humile on arboreal and ground-foraging native ant species by comparing interspersed loblolly pines invaded and uninvaded by Argentine ants. Impacts on native ants were assessed monthly over 1 yr by counting ants in foraging trails on pine trunks and in surrounding plots using a concentric arrangement of pitfall traps at 1, 2, and 3 m from the base of each tree. Of floristics and habitat variables, higher soil moisture in invaded plots was the only difference between plot types, increasing confidence that any ant community differences were caused by Argentine ants. Overall patterns of impact were weak. Composition differed significantly between Argentine ant invaded and uninvaded trunks and pitfalls but was driven only by the presence of Argentine ants rather than any resulting compositional change in native ant species. Native ant abundance and richness were similarly unaffected by L. humile. However, the abundance of individual ant species was more variable. Although numbers of the arboreal Crematogaster ashmeadi (Myrmicinae) declined on and around invaded pines, epigeic Aphaenogaster rudis (Myrmicinae) remained the most abundant species in all plots. Argentine ant densities peaked in late summer and fall, therefore overlapping with most native ants. Unexpected was their continued presence during even the coldest months. We provide evidence that Argentine ants can invade and persist in native North Carolina forests, probably mediated by pine-associated resources. However, their localized distribution and minimal impact on the native ant fauna relative to previously described invasions requires further resolution. 3ainterspecific variation 3ainvasive species 3ainsect pests 3afauna 3aLinepithema humile 3atemperate forests 3abotanical composition 3aspatial distribution 3aAphaenogaster 3aflora 3aseasonal variation 3apopulation density 3aindigenous species 3aPinus taeda 3ainsect ecology 3aCrematogaster 3aforest ecology 2aAnimals 2aAnts 2aFeeding Behavior 2aIntroduced Species 2aPinus taeda 3aNorth Carolina 0aNorth Carolina 0aspecies differences1 aSilverman, Jules0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2010 Aug., v. 39, no. 4 p.1141-1150dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN100043Available from publisher's Web site  a20101110b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/30  aOther US 7aarticle04050naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013000170300001600300520228300316592002802599650001602627650002102643650002402664650002202688650001102710650002602721650001202747650001902759650002602778650002202804650001502826650002202841650001902863650002102882650001802903650002102921650001402942650001902956650002002975650001402995650001903009650002003028650002603048650001003074650002603084653001603110653002103126653001403147653002103161653001603182700002003198700002003218773011603238856008503354852000903439655001203448IND60542600420221123002418.0190403e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054260042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmolander, Aino10aResponse of soil nutrient content, organic matter characteristics and growth of pine and spruce seedlings to logging residues  ap. 117-125.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effects of different amounts of logging residues on soil properties and growth of Scots pine and Norway spruce seedlings 10years after clear-felling. The field experiments consisted of two Scots pine and four Norway spruce experiments. The treatments, on three replicate 8m∗8m plots in all field experiments, were whole-tree harvesting, i.e. harvesting all the above-ground biomass with no logging residue left on the site (R0), stem-only harvesting, leaving logging residues on the site (R1), and stem-only harvesting with double the amount of logging residues left on the site (R2). In the R1 treatment the amount of logging residue in the spruce stands was 39–54Mgha−1 dry mass and in the pine stands, 11–18Mgha−1 dry mass. Over all sites, logging residues had no consistent effects on seedling growth, amounts of soil carbon and nutrients or organic matter characteristics. In some spruce experiments, however, logging residues increased the average diameter, height and height growth (last three years), as well as the number of seedlings, stem volume and biomass. In pine experiments, logging residues had no effect on tree or stand characteristics. In one pine experiment the amounts of exchangeable base cations increased, and there were also changes in the quality of organic matter: the C/N ratio decreased, and NH4–N, microbial biomass N and C mineralization increased due to residues. In the spruce experiments and the other pine experiment, the effect of logging residues on the soil properties measured was slight. Logging residues did not affect NO3–N concentrations or rates of net nitrification, which in most soils were both negligible. Seedling height and height growth correlated strongly and positively with net N mineralization and its ratio to microbial biomass N. All in all, logging residues improved tree and stand characteristics generally in spruce stands, but the effects on soil properties and processes, if any, occurred mostly in one pine stand. This poor correspondence may point to other changes brought on by the logging residues, such as changes in physical environment or decreased competition with ground vegetation, being more important for seedling growth than nutrient status was.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aaboveground biomass 3aammonium nitrogen 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acations 3achemical bases 3afield experimentation 3aground vegetation 3aharvesting 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrification 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asoil nutrients 3asoil properties 3astand characteristics 3atrees 3awhole tree harvesting 0aForest soil 0aLogging residues 0aNutrients 0aNitrogen cycling 0aTree growth1 aSaarsalmi, Anna1 aTamminen, Pekka0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 357 p.117-125dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245008600153300001500239520067200254592002800926650001800954650001700972650001500989650001301004650000901017650001001026700002001036700002701056700002101083700001701104700002201121700001801143700002301161700001701184700001901201773015101220856006901371856009901440990002301539852000901562655001201571IND60694125220221119031220.0200510e20200509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069412522DNAL7 a10.3791/611982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Dmitry10aInduction of diffuse axonal brain injury in rats based on rotational acceleration  ap. e61198.  aTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is the predominant mechanism of injury in a large percentage of TBI patients requiring hospitalization. DAI involves widespread axonal damage from shaking, rotation or blast injury, leading to rapid axonal stretch injury and secondary axonal changes that are associated with a long-lasting impact on functional recovery. Historically, experimental models of DAI without focal injury have been difficult to design.

To clarify the effect of long-term straw incorporation in microbial abundance and carbon metabolism, a long-term field experiment was initiated in May 2005 (rice-planting season). Soil bacterial communities were revealed by high-throughput sequencing technology. After ten cycles of annual rice–wheat rotation (2005–2015), 2 M (straw incorporation) and 2 M + NPK (high straw incorporation + chemical fertilizer) treatments had significantly more bacterial phyla compared with CK (non-fertilization) and NPK (chemical fertilizer) treatments. Taxonomic analysis revealed that 2 M and NPK + 2 M treatments had a significantly greater abundance of microbial communities, especially the Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. In the NPK versus 2 M, 2 M treatment had a significantly greater abundance of Rozellomycota (P < 0.05). In the NPK + 2 M versus NPK, NPK + 2 M treatment also had significantly greater abundance of Ascomycota (P < 0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis showed that 2 M treatment was separate from other treatments. Using biolog-ECO method, the metabolic diversity and functional characteristics of microbial communities were used to indicate the ability of microorganisms to utilize carbon source. The carbon utilization ability of soil microorganisms in 2 M + NPK treatment was significantly higher than that of CK treatment (P < 0.05). The utilization ability of carboxylic acids, polymers, and other mixtures of carbon sources in 2 M treatment was higher than those of other treatments. These findings suggest that long-term straw incorporation affects the abundance and carbon utilization ability of soil microorganisms within 0–20 cm soil depths, among which, Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria may play crucial roles in bacterial communities and carbon source utilization capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aAscomycota 3aFirmicutes 3aGemmatimonadetes 3acarbon 3acarbon metabolism 3afield experimentation 3amineral fertilizers 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil bacteria 3astraw 3aChina1 aLi, Yong1 aMo, Rongli1 aDeng, Wen1 aZhu, Zhixian1 aLiu, Dongbi1 aHu, Xingming0 tArchives of microbiology.g2020 Sept., v. 202, no. 7 p.1915-1927dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-01899-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03897naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007100172300001400243520237200257592002802629650001902657650001502676650001602691650001602707650002102723650001002744650001002754650001302764650001302777650002102790650001102811650002302822650001502845650001402860650001102874650001302885650001902898650001402917653002202931653001602953653002002969653001202989653001503001653003003016700002203046700002003068700002203088700002503110773011403135856008503249852000903334655001203343IND60542600520221123002559.0190403e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054260052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFill, Jennifer M.10aUpdating models for restoration and management of fiery ecosystems  ap. 54-63.  aScientific models that guide restoration/management protocols should be reviewed periodically as new data become available. We examine ecological concepts used to guide restoration of pine savannas and woodlands, historically prominent but now rare habitats in the southern North American Coastal Plain. For many decades, pine savanna management has been guided predominantly by a biome-centric succession model. Pine savannas have been considered early-successional communities that, in the absence of fire, transition rapidly toward closed-canopy hardwood forests. Recurrent fires have been viewed as exogenous disturbances that maintain savanna ecosystems as a sub-climax, blocking succession to an equilibrium steady state (closed-canopy forests). Over recent decades, a vegetation-fire feedback model has emerged in which pine savannas are conceptualized as persistent, non-equilibrium communities maintained by endogenous, co-evolutionary vegetation-fire feedbacks. Endemic plant species are resistant to fires and specialized for post-fire conditions generated by frequent lightning fires, primarily within a distinct fire season. These species produce pyrogenic fine fuels that are easily ignited. The resulting fire regimes, entrained by these vegetation-fire feedbacks, are predicted to result in persistent pine savannas. Local variation over space and time in evolutionary feedback mechanisms between pyrogenic vegetation and fire regimes produces heterogeneous landscapes. Disturbances of these feedbacks, such as human fire suppression, are postulated to result in rapid transition to communities lacking feedback elements, such as closed-canopy forest and those without pyrogenic species. Succession-based management focuses on reversing the transition to forest, primarily by removing hardwoods and reintroducing fire as a disturbance. However, we advocate restoration and management approaches that target reinstitution of functional vegetation-fire feedbacks. Such approaches should favor native pyrogenic plant species and reinstitute fire regimes that mimic historical, evolutionarily derived fire regimes. Vegetation-fire feedback concepts should be useful in addressing resistance and resilience of fiery ecosystems worldwide to inherent changes in feedback mechanisms, constituting a framework useful in addressing global management challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal plains 3aecosystems 3afire regime 3afire season 3afire suppression 3afires 3afuels 3ahabitats 3ahardwood 3ahardwood forests 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3alightning 3amodels 3asavannas 3aspace and time 3awoodlands 0aAlternative state 0aDisturbance 0aEcosystem model 0aSavanna 0aSuccession 0aVegetation-fire feedbacks1 aPlatt, William J.1 aWelch, Shane M.1 aWaldron, Jayme L.1 aMousseau, Timothy A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 356 p.54-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04177naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245008700178300001600265520230000281592002802581650002002609650001702629650002402646650003202670650001502702650001202717650002102729650001002750650001102760650001402771650001602785650001802801650001602819650002702835650002802862650003602890650002902926650002602955650002302981650001503004650001803019650001203037650001503049650002103064650001703085653001503102653001503117653001603132653002603148653002903174700003103203700003003234700002703264700002803291700002203319773010303341856008603444852000903530655001203539IND60535896120221120042932.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053589612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesquita, Sofia Raquel10aN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activity in feral Carcinus maenas exposed to cadmium  ap. 225-232.  aCadmium is a priority hazardous substance, persistent in the aquatic environment, with the capacity to interfere with crustacean moulting. Moulting is a vital process dictating crustacean growth, reproduction and metamorphosis. However, for many organisms, moult disruption is difficult to evaluate in the short term, what limits its inclusion in monitoring programmes. N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase) is an enzyme acting in the final steps of the endocrine-regulated moulting cascade, allowing for the cast off of the old exoskeleton, with potential interest as a biomarker of moult disruption. This study investigated responses to waterborne cadmium of NAGase activity of Carcinus maenas originating from estuaries with different histories of anthropogenic contamination: a low impacted and a moderately polluted one. Crabs from both sites were individually exposed for seven days to cadmium concentrations ranging from 1.3 to 2000μg/L. At the end of the assays, NAGase activity was assessed in the epidermis and digestive gland. Detoxification, antioxidant, energy production, and oxidative stress biomarkers implicated in cadmium metabolism and tolerance were also assessed to better understand differential NAGase responses: activity of glutathione S-transferases (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) glutathione reductase (GR), levels of total glutathiones (TG), lipid peroxidation (LPO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Animals from the moderately polluted estuary had lower NAGase activity both in the epidermis and digestive gland than in the low impacted site. NAGase activity in the epidermis and digestive gland of C. maenas from both estuaries was sensitive to cadmium exposure suggesting its usefulness for inclusion in monitoring programmes. However, in the digestive gland NAGase inhibition was found in crabs from the less impacted site but not in those from the moderately contaminated one. Altered glutathione levels were observed in cadmium-treated crabs from the contaminated site possibly conferring enhanced tolerance to these animals through its chelator action. Investigation of enhanced tolerance should thus be accounted for in monitoring programmes employing NAGase as biomarker to avoid data misinterpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarcinus maenas 3aantioxidants 3aaquatic environment 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3achelating agents 3acrabs 3aenergy 3aestuaries 3aexoskeleton 3aferal animals 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolism 3ametamorphosis 3amolting 3amonitoring 3aoxidative stress 3areproduction 0aShore crab 0aChitobiase 0aGlutathione 0aAnti-oxidant defences 0aEnvironmental monitoring1 aErgen, Şeyda Fikirdeşici1 aRodrigues, Aurélie Pinto1 aOliva-Teles, M.

The fundamental understanding of the structure–property relationships of sensitizers provides the insight to increase the efficiency of such devices. Here, unsymmetrical squaraine derivatives (ABSQs) with donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D′) architectures having N,N-dimethyl amino anthracene and benzothiazole (ABSQ-H) halogenated with fluoride (ABSQ-F), chloride (ABSQ-Cl), and bromide (ABSQ-Br) were synthesized to understand the effect of halogen on the photophysical properties and intermolecular interaction dynamics with phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which is used widely as an electron acceptor in bulk heterojunction-based devices. Interestingly, ABSQ-H exhibited intense absorption (ε ∼ 6.72 × 10⁴ M–¹ cm–¹) spectra centered at ∼660 nm. Upon halogen substitution, a bathochromic shift in the absorption spectra with an increase of molar absorptivity was observed (ε ∼ 8.59 × 10⁴ M–¹ cm–¹), which is beneficial for NIR light harvesting. The femtosecond transient absorption spectra of ABSQs revealed that the polarity of the solvent controlled the excited-state relaxation dynamics. Upon addition of PCBM, the fluorescence intensity and dynamics of halogenated ABSQs were quenched, and the formation of a squaraine radical cation was observed, reflecting the occurrence of intermolecular charge-transfer dynamics between ABSQs and PCBM. Thus, the observation of a bathochromic shift with intense absorption and an efficient intermolecular interaction with PCBM upon halogenation of ABSQs provide a design strategy for the development of unsymmetrical squaraine derivatives for bulk heterojunction-based optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data  aMLP-0061cCouncil for Scientific and Industrial Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001332  aBT/PR24173/BRB/10/1604/2017cDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001407  aNAcUniversity Grants Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001501 3aabsorption 3aabsorptivity 3aanthracenes 3acations 3achemical interactions 3achlorides 3afluorescence 3afluorides 3ahalogens 3aphotochemistry 3asolvents1 aPaul, Megha1 aGovind, Chinju1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7751-48731 aMathew, Ranimol1 aKarunakaran, Venugopal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8482-09000 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 June 09, v. 126, no. 24 p.4509-4519dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c108403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01644naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245006900175300001600244520077300260592002801033650001701061650001701078650001601095650001801111700002201129773008901151856008201240990002301322852000901345655001201354IND60092898820221122191553.0141103e20131003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009289882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2013.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardo, Maria Ester10aMesenchymal Stromal Cells: Sensors and Switchers of Inflammation  ap. 392-402.  aIn addition to their stem/progenitor properties, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) possess broad immunoregulatory properties that are being investigated for potential clinical application in treating immune-based disorders.

In this study, low density polyethylene passive samplers were deployed in urban-influenced and background nearshore freshwaters of northwestern Lake Ontario and analyzed for a broad range of both legacy halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). Non-targeted analysis was conducted for screening additional halogenated substances. For most compounds, concentrations were greatest in the industrialized Hamilton Harbour and more generally at sites that have stronger influences of wastewater effluent discharges and stormwater run-off through rivers and creeks. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remain the dominant class of HOCs in water, with dissolved-phase concentrations ranging from 10 to 4100 pg/L (ΣPCBs), followed by polybrominated diphenylethers (ΣPBDEs; 14–960 pg/L) and the organochlorine pesticides (OCPs; 22–290 pg/L). Several non-PBDE brominated flame retardants (nBFRs) and chlorinated Dechlorane-related compounds were detected, with hexabromocyclododecanes (ΣHBCDD; sum of 3 diastereoisomers) the most abundant (1.0–21 pg/L). Non-targeted screening of samples by high resolution mass spectrometry using Kendrick mass defect plots for data analysis indicated that several other halogenated compounds were present in waters at relatively high abundances compared to the flame retardants, based on semi-quantitative estimates. These included methyl-triclosan, four halogenated anisoles (2,4,6-tribromoanisole, dimethyl-trichloroanisole, pentachloroanisole, and pentachlorothioanisole), and pentachloro-aniline. Dissolved-phase methyl-triclosan was estimated to contribute up to approximately 40% of the summed target HOC concentrations. Polyethylene passive samplers provided an excellent medium for both non-targeted screening of HOCs not currently included in monitoring programs and tracking brominated and chlorinated chemicals slated for reductions in uses and emissions through international (Stockholm Convention) and binational (Great Lakes) agreements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromination 3adiastereomers 3ahexabromocyclododecane 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrialization 3amass spectrometry 3apollution 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolyethylene 3astormwater 3awastewater 3aCanada 3aLake Ontario 0aFlame retardants 0aGreat Lakes 0aPolyethylene passive sampler 0aMethyl-triclosan 0aHalogenated anisoles1 aRobson, Matthew1 aJobst, Karl1 aPena-Abaurrea, Miren1 aMuscalu, Alina1 aChaudhuri, Sri1 aMarvin, Chris1 aBrindle, Ian D.1 aReiner, Eric J.1 aHelm, Paul0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Sept., v. 264 p.114733-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1147333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01293naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006400168300001600232520039300248592002800641650001800669650001800687650001400705650001200719650000900731650001500740700002100755773008900776856008200865990002300947852000900970655001200979IND60092898920221122151542.0141103e20131107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009289892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2013.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCope, Elise C.10aCytokines Make an Indelible Impression on Neural Stem Cells  ap. 507-508.  aInfections during pregnancy have been associated with increased risks of neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring, although the underlying mechanisms have not been determined.

However, the initial features of skull fractures were mostly lost when the forensic pathologists involved in the case 5 months later because of injury healing and craniocerebral surgery. Therefore, we aimed to reconstruct the original skull fracture features by utilizing the digital reconstruction technologies in terms of CT (computed tomography) scanning, 3D (3-dimentional) reconstruction, and virtual surgical tools. The original fracture skull was assembled by using Mimics 13.0 based on the CT slices of postoperative head and the removed craniotomy skull flaps, which revealed fracture features of focal and overall skull deformation. Based on the assembly skull model and the contrecoup cerebral contusions, we conclude that the man suffered a tumble after being drunk and the serious craniocerebral trauma occurred. The case demonstrated that the digital reconstruction technologies can serve as effective approaches for forensic investigation in case of survived craniocerebral trauma patients without direct evidences interpreting the original trauma patterns, which could potentially be helpful in exploring the injury mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputed tomography 3acontusions 3adeformation 3aforensic sciences 3ahead 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3apatients 3askull 3asurgery 0aAssembled 3D reconstruction 0aVirtopsy 0aCraniocerebral trauma 0aInjury mechanism1 aZou, Donghua1 aZhang, Jianhua1 aShao, Yu1 aHuang, Ping1 aChen, Yijiu0 tForensic science international.g2015 Oct., v. 255 p.106-111dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009600175300001400271520098700285592002801272650002501300650002301325650001001348650001201358650001101370650001701381650001801398650001101416650001601427650001501443650001501458700002501473700002101498700002301519773008701542856008601629852000901715655001201724IND50067573320221118011748.0141111e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006757332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnouar, El Hassane10aUV/Visible spectra of natural polyphenols: A time-dependent density functional theory study  ap. 79-89.  aIn addition to their numerous biological activities, natural and hemisynthetic polyphenols contribute to the large variety of colours (from red to violet) in nature (e.g., fruit, vegetables, leaves and petals). In order to understand the colour variation attributed to the multitude of chemical structures of this wide class of compounds, time-dependent density functional quantum-chemical calculations at the B3P86/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory appears as a relevant and efficient tool. The UV/Vis properties of 33 polyphenols were systematically investigated, including mainly flavonoids, isoflavonoids and flavonolignans. On the basis of molecular orbital analysis we established the structure–property relationship, inter alia showing the role of π orbital (de-)localisation, mesomeric (+M) effects of hydroxyl groups and structural modification of the molecular backbone. The results might help in the future, for example, for the prediction of novel hemisynthetic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3achemical structure 3acolor 3acorolla 3afruits 3agroup effect 3aisoflavonoids 3aleaves 3apolyphenols 3aprediction 3avegetables1 aGierschner, Johannes1 aDuroux, Jean-Luc1 aTrouillas, Patrick0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 131, no. 1 p.79-89dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245010300160300001600263500002000279520174500299592002802044596005402072596001702126650002002143650001102163650001202174650002302186650001602209650001002225650001402235650001702249650001102266650002402277650001102301700001702312700002002329700002402349773013302373856007602506852000902582655001202591IND60786388820221118204713.0220803e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078638882DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.16004072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugiyama, Anna14aThe use of soil pollen to determine the sex of overhead individuals of a temperate dioecious shrub  ap. 632-638.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: In dioecious species, determining the sex of individual plants from one‐time phenological observations is rarely feasible when some individuals capable of reproducing are not flowering or fruiting at the time of observation. Currently, sexing those individuals requires long‐term phenological data on individuals and populations, but such data are rarely available or feasible to collect. We tested the hypothesis that differences in soil pollen concentrations beneath the crowns of female and male plants would exist and be sufficient to reliably determine the sex of the individual plant overhead in a dioecious species. We predicted that soil pollen concentrations beneath male plants would be significantly higher than beneath female plants because only males produce pollen and pollen should accumulate in the soil underneath the male plants over repeated flowering events. METHODS: We collected samples from surface soil under both sexes of the insect‐pollinated dioecious shrub, Aucuba japonica (Garryaceae). KEY RESULTS: Pollen grains were present in surface soil in both Oe and A horizons, and mean pollen concentration under males was significantly higher than under females. Pollen concentrations beneath males were positively correlated with male plant height, potentially reflecting greater pollen production by larger individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the small plant size and relatively low pollen production of A. japonica, this method may hold promise for sexing other dioecious species in the absence of direct phenological data. Our phenology‐free and relatively low‐cost method for sexing dioecious plants may be especially useful in tropical forests where many species are dioecious.  aPublisher supplied data  cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  cJSPS KAKENHI 3aAucuba japonica 3adioecy 3afemales 3ainsect pollination 3amale plants 3amales 3aphenology 3aplant height 3apollen 3apollen productivity 3ashrubs1 aShichi, Koji1 aMasaki, Takashi1 aHubbell, Stephen P.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Apr., v. 104, no. 4 p.632-638dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.16004073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04101naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011500171300001200286520259900298592002802897650001102925650001702936650002202953650001602975650002702991650002603018650001403044650001003058650002203068650001403090650001303104650001503117650002203132650002203154650001303176651002103189653002403210653001703234653002203251653002203273653003403295653003503329700001903364700001603383773010003399856008703499852000903586655001203595IND60552619920221120101506.0161021e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055261992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulhan, Oznur12aA new computer-tomography-based method of sex estimation: Development of Turkish population-specific standards  ap. 2-8.  aThe identification of victims involved in mass fatality incidents has become an increasingly important issue nowadays, and identification of unknown individuals is an important aspect in criminal cases and Disaster Victim Identification scenarios. Therefore, the sex estimation is one of the most important biological attributes towards establishing personal identity. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that metric sex determination methods of the skeleton are population-specific due to variation in size and patterns of sexual dimorphism. Unfortunately, the modern Turkish population still lacks wide and representative population standards for identification. Previous research has shown that modern technologies, such as CT scanning appear to offer promising means for the establishment of new standards for contemporary populations. The main aim of this project is to examine the application of measurements taken from the femur in order to assess sex, as well as to contribute to the establishment of discriminant function equations for the Turkish population for forensic applications.The sample population was composed of CT images taken from 200 adult hospital patients. The images of the femora were segmented from the surrounding bones to ensure correct usage of landmarks as accurately as possible. The 3D reconstructions were then created using the volume-rendering function in OsiriX (v.5.6.). Thirteen measurements were acquired using a 3D viewer and were located and marked on each of the CT reconstructed femora.Thirteen anthropometric parameters were measured and analysed by basic descriptive statistics and discriminant analysis methods using the SPSS 21.0 software package. The intra-observer variation was assessed by obtaining the inter-cross correlation coefficient in order to evaluate the accuracy of the linear measurements taken. The accuracy of sex prediction ranged from 63.5 to 88% with single variables. In stepwise analysis, Epicondylar Breadth, Femur Vertical Diameter of Neck and Medial Lateral Subtrochanteric Diameter were found to be the most discriminating variables providing an accuracy of 91%.Ultimately, it is envisaged that this research study will produce data and interpretations that will inform on and improve standards of sex estimation from postcranial osteometric landmarks. Additionally, this research will consider how this data provides value for a developing discipline of forensic anthropology and how it integrates within the existing systems of criminal investigation and Disaster Victim Identification practices in Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanthropology 3acomputer software 3acorrelation 3adescriptive statistics 3adiscriminant analysis 3aequations 3afemur 3aforensic sciences 3ahospitals 3apatients 3aprediction 3asex determination 3asexual dimorphism 3askeleton 3aTurkey (country) 0aComputed tomography 0aSegmentation 0a3D reconstruction 0aSex determination 0aPopulation-specific standards 0aDisaster victim identification1 aHarrison, Karl1 aKiris, Adem0 tForensic science international.g2015 Oct., v. 255 p.2-8dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011900161300001600280520160900296592002801905650002301933650001201956650001801968650001101986650002201997650000902019650001402028650000902042650001702051650002402068650001402092650001302106650002702119651001502146651001802161700002502179700001302204700002402217773012002241856008102361852000902442655001202451IND60701232920221122035922.0200708e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070123292DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452200300172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkter, M.10aReproduction, Growth, Mortality and Yield of the Goatfish Upeneus sulphureus in Northern Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh  ap. 441-452.  aInformation on stock condition and reproductive biology are important for fisheries conservation and management planning. This study examined reproduction, growth, mortality and yield of sulphur goatfish (Upeneus sulphureus Cuvier 1829), which is a low-value food fish abundantly caught as bycatch in artisanal and industrial fishing from the southeast coast of Bangladesh at northern Bay of Bengal. Data were collected monthly obtaining samples from local fish landing center. The gonadosomatic index indicated that U. sulphureus spawns twice a year during January–May and August–October. Fecundity of the fish was positively correlated with the body and gonad weight, and varied from 15 128–97 274 eggs with fish weight 11.30–58.73 g. Monthly length–frequency distribution was analyzed through FISAT software, thus the estimated seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L∞ = 21.80 cm, K = 0.54 per year, C = 0.5, WP = 0.1 and Rn = 0.300, respectively. Moreover, the value of seasonalized total mortality coefficient Z (2.24) was smaller than that of the non-seasonalized Z (4.16). The instantaneous natural mortality and fishing mortality, calculated for non-seasonalized total mortality, were 1.31 and 2.86, respectively. Furthermore, the high exploitation rate (E = 0.69) was close to maximum exploitation level (Eₘₐₓ = 0.75) in yield-per-recruit analysis, suggesting that U. sulphureus is being exploited at the MSY (maximum sustainable yield) level. Therefore, further increase in fishing effort may reduce U. sulphureus stocks in the coastal waters of Bangladesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUpeneus sulphureus 3abycatch 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3acomputer software 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afish 3afood animals 3agonadosomatic index 3amortality 3aplanning 3atraditional technology 3aBangladesh 3aBay of Bengal1 aSharifuzzaman, S.

Herein, the porous air-dried nanocomposite aerogels containing reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and chitosan (CS) are fabricated by self-assembling an aqueous dispersion of graphene oxide and chitosan with the addition of hydroiodic acid (HI) followed by recasting the hybrid hydrogel with an ice-template method. The strong cross-linked composite aerogels obtained have reversible compressibility, exceptional elasticity, and high electrical conductivity, which are derived from the restacking inhibition and steric hindrance of the polymer chains. What’s more, the successive soaking–drying experiments indicate that the as-prepared graphene-based aerogels exhibit excellent environmental stability and reuseability. The regenerated electrical conductivity remains almost the same and more than 90% of its maximum compressive stress at a strain of up to 92% is retained after five cycles. This makes them ideal candidates for potential applications in areas of supercapacitors and energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3aair drying 3achitosan 3acompressibility 3acrosslinking 3adurability 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogels 3ananocomposites 3apolymers 3aporosity 0aair-dried 0ananocomposite aerogel 0aelasticity 0aelectrical conductivity 0aenvironmental stability1 aZhang, Li1 aZhang, Gongzheng1 aLi, Huanjun0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 June 04, v. 10, no. 25 p.21565-21572dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b046893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001700140245012500157300001600282500002400298500002700322520150400349650002101853650002201874650003001896650001301926650001601939650001801955650001201973650001601985650001402001650002202015650001202037650001602049650001402065700001802079700002102097773010902118852000902227856008002236655001202316IND4462675420221116150047.0120131s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446267542DNAL7 a10.1653/024.094.04292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, C.F.14aThe Impact of Temperature on Biological Aspects and Life Table of Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)  ap. 923-932.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Portuguese.  aThe impacts of temperature on Harmonia axyridis and its potential as a control agent of Cinara atlantica, the Carolina conifer aphid, were evaluated. The experiments were conducted with eggs from field-collected adults. Each egg batch was kept at 15 °C, 20 °C and 25 ° C, 70% RH and 12:12 h. L:D. After hatching, the larvae were reared individually until adult emergence and all insects were kept under the same conditions. The mean period of egg incubation, total developmental time and egg viability were longer at 15 °C that than at the other 2 temperatures. Survival was 100% for all the larval, pre-pupal and pupal stages. The longevity was longer at 15 °C and 20 °C than 25 °C The mean number of eggs produced was significantly higher at 15 °C than at the other 2 temperatures. The post-oviposition period increased with increasing temperature. The highest specific fertility was recorded at 15 °C, followed by 25 °C and 20 °C, respectively. The net reproductive rate was higher at 15 °C than at the 2 higher temperatures. The time interval between each generation (T) decreased with increasing temperature and the population doubling time (DT) was higher at 15 °C than at 20 °C and 25 °C. The intrinsic rates of increase (rm) were very similar at the 3 temperatures, but the finite rate of population increase (λ) was higher at 25 xi C than at the 2 lower temperatures. The results indicate that H. axyridis shows great potential as a biological control agent of C. atlantica. 3aCinara atlantica 3aHarmonia axyridis 3abiological control agents 3ahatching 3ainsect eggs 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3alife tables 3alongevity 3apopulation growth 3arearing 3atemperature 3aviability1 aAlmedia, L.M.1 aPenteado, S.R.C.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2011 Dec., v. 94, no. 4 p.923-932dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.094.04293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02089naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007100169300001600240520095900256592002801215650001801243650002001261650001401281650001501295650001501310650001001325650001201335650001701347651001101364653002301375653001901398653001701417653001801434700002101452700002001473773010401493856008501597852000901682655001201691IND60593297420221116153415.0190131e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059329742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖgren, Mikael10aRoad traffic noise abatement scenarios in Gothenburg 2015 – 2035  ap. 516-521.  aExposure to high levels of road traffic noise at the most exposed building facade is increasing, both due to urbanization and due to overall traffic increase. This study investigated how different noise reduction measures would influence the noise exposure on a city-wide scale in Gothenburg, a city in Sweden with approximately 550,000 inhabitants. Noise exposure was estimated under several different scenarios for the period 2015–2035, using the standardized Nordic noise prediction method together with traffic flow measurements and population statistics. The scenarios were based on reducing speed limits, reducing traffic flows, introducing more electrically powered vehicles and introducing low-noise tires and pavements. The most effective measures were introducing low-noise tires or pavements, which in comparison to business as usual produced between 13% and 29% reduction in the number of inhabitants exposed above 55 dB equivalent level.  aPublisher supplied data 3anoise control 3anoise pollution 3apavements 3aprediction 3astatistics 3atires 3atraffic 3aurbanization 3aSweden 0aRoad traffic noise 0aNoise exposure 0aUrbanization 0aNoise mapping1 aMolnár, Péter,1 aBarregard, Lars0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 July, v. 164 p.516-521dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008600171300001500257520228400272592002802556650001402584650000802598650001802606650001302624650002602637650000902663650000902672650001602681650001702697650002002714650002502734650002502759650001602784650001202800650001102812651001602823651001102839653003702850653002302887653001902910653002502929700002102954773010302975856008703078852000903165655001203174IND60608118420221119110744.0180904e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060811842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLargeron, Yann10aPersistent inversion dynamics and wintertime PM10 air pollution in Alpine valleys  ap. 92-108.  aThe present study investigates persistent inversions dynamics during a whole winter in Alpine valleys of the area of Grenoble (French Alps), and their relationship to PM10 air pollution episodes and synoptic scale meteorology. For this purpose, hourly time series from November to March of PM10 concentration measurements at the bottom of the valleys and of ground-based temperature data at different altitudes are used. A methodology is developed to quantify a simple estimate of the inversion strength from temperature profiles deduced from the ground-based observations. This estimate is shown to be equivalent to the boundary layer heat deficit. A criterion based on this estimate is proposed to identify persistent (more than 3 days) inversions.Persistent inversions are found to occur from November to February and span 35% of the time. It is shown that they are closely related to PM10 pollution episodes, the PM10 concentration increasing with the boundary layer stability as the inversion develops. Polluted episodes are primarily driven by persistent inversions and consequently, pollution is of fully local origin from November to February. In March local dynamics become less important and long-range transport can dominate.Persistent inversions occur systematically during a high-pressure regime, which first triggers a synoptic scale elevated inversion due to the advection of warm air masses in the mid-troposphere. In valleys, the sheltered boundary layer becomes decoupled from the free troposphere, which allows a ground-based inversion to intensify in the following days. An inversion layer of quasi-constant temperature gradient, greater than 5 K km⁻¹, then forms up to an altitude of about 1600 m, close to the average elevation of the summits. If the episode is sufficiently long, a stagnation stage is reached during which daytime insolation produces a shallow convective surface layer which does not destroy the persistent inversion. The inversion break-up occurs rapidly, in less than a day, because of synoptic scale advection of cold air masses in the mid-troposphere when a low-pressure regime approaches. The end-of-episode decrease in PM10 concentration is due to precipitation combined with an increased ventilation inside the boundary-layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aair 3aair pollution 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acold 3aheat 3ameteorology 3aparticulates 3asolar radiation 3atemperature profiles 3atime series analysis 3atroposphere 3avalleys 3awinter 3aAlps region 3aFrance 0aWintertime persistent inversions 0aPM10 air pollution 0aAlpine valleys 0aHigh-pressure regime1 aStaquet, Chantal0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 June, v. 135 p.92-108dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006900153245011500222300001400337520126900351592002801620650001001648650002401658650001001682650004101692650001401733650001601747650001401763650002201777650001301799650001701812650001301829650001801842650001001860650001001870653002201880653001401902653001601916653002401932653002401956700002101980700002002001700002402021700001802045700001802063773010202081856008702183852000902270655001202279IND60552620120221122043332.0161021e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055262012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusardò, Francesco Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3082-453212aA fatal accidental subarachnoid injection of lidocaine and levobupivacaine during a lumbar paravertebral block  ap. 17-20.  aParavertebral block (PVB) is the technique of injecting a local anesthetic solution alongside the vertebral column, close to where the spinal nerves emerge, resulting in unilateral somatic and sympathetic nerve blockade. Here is reported a fatal case involving a 60-year-old woman with spondylitis arthropathy, who developed cardiac and respiratory arrest 40min after receiving an accidental subarachnoid injection (L5-S1 bilaterally) of depomedrol lidocaine and levobupivacaine. A complete autopsy including histological and toxicological analyses was performed in order to establish the cause of death. Liquid/liquid extraction (LLE) and GC–MS analysis were performed according to a previously published method. Lidocaine and bupivacaine were detected both in blood, at concentrations of 14.8mg/L and 13.3mg/L respectively, and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at concentrations of 287.1mg/L and 464.2mg/L respectively. Both lidocaine and bupivacaine were also detected in the urine. The toxicological findings along with the autopsy allowed us to establish that the accidental subarachnoid injection of lidocaine and levobupivacaine had led to a progressive hypotension and normovolaemic shock caused by a severe ganglionic block, determining the patient's death.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acerebrospinal fluid 3adeath 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahistology 3ahypotension 3alidocaine 3alocal anesthetics 3anecropsy 3anerve tissue 3apatients 3aspine (bones) 3aurine 3awomen 0aLocal anesthetics 0aLidocaine 0aBupivacaine 0aParavertebral block 0aForensic toxicology1 aTritapepe, Luigi1 aMontana, Angelo1 aIndorato, Francesca1 aZaami, Simona1 aRomano, Guido0 tForensic science international.g2015 Nov., v. 256 p.17-20dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017100173300001600344520173200360592002802092650002402120650001302144650001602157650001402173650002302187650000902210650001002219650001602229650002102245650001802266650002202284650001402306650002302320650001302343650001702356650001002373653002402383653002402407653000902431653002202440653001202462700002702474700002502501773010302526856008602629852000902715655001202724IND60535896620221120042916.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053589662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHultman, Maria T.10aEvaluation of the sensitivity, responsiveness and reproducibility of primary rainbow trout hepatocyte vitellogenin expression as a screening assay for estrogen mimics  ap. 233-244.  aVitellogenin (Vtg) induction in primary fish hepatocytes has been proposed as an in vitro screening assay for ER agonists and antagonists, but has not yet been used extensively as a high-throughput screening tool due to poor reproducibility, sensitivity and overall feasibility. The present work has evaluated the role of seasonal variation, normalization, optimal culture and assay conditions on the sensitivity, responsiveness and reproducibility of in vitro vtg gene mRNA and protein expression in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) primary hepatocytes using the xenoestrogen 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) as a test chemical. The results show that primary hepatocytes display a relatively high individual and seasonal variation in both Vtg mRNA and protein induction potential, although less variance was observed in assay sensitivity. Data normalization of assay response to maximum (3nM EE2) and minimum (DMSO) Vtg production dramatically reduced this variance and led to improved assay reproducibility. A time-dependent response was observed both for mRNA and protein expression, reaching maximum Vtg induction after 96h of exposure, although reproducible concentration response curves for both Vtg mRNA and protein could be obtained already after 48h. A need for chemical re-exposure of the hepatocytes was identified to be important for sustaining exposure concentrations in extended studies (>48h), whereas different plate formats (96, 24 or 6 wells) did not affect the bioassay performance. In conclusion, standardization of hepatocyte bioassay and test conditions as well as data-normalization procedures are proposed to be instrumental for more consistent and comparable results in future use of this in vitro assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3abioassays 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afish 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ain vitro studies 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3ascreening 3aseasonal variation 3avariance 3avitellogenin 3awells 0aOncorhynchus mykiss 0aPrimary hepatocytes 0aEDCs 0aVitellogenin mRNA 0aProtein1 aRundberget, Jan Thomas1 aTollefsen, Knut Erik0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Feb., v. 159 p.233-244dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001800158245014800176300001600324520127900340592002801619650001901647650000801666650002501674650001101699650002101710650001001731650002701741650001201768650001301780650001401793650004801807650001201855650003401867650001401901650003101915650003301946650003801979650002102017650003702038650003702075650001302112650001802125650002702143700001402170700001402184700001602198700001702214700002602231700001902257773010502276856004002381852000902421655001202430IND50074563320221122064257.0140407e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007456332DNAL7 a224890482pmid7 a10.1002/tox.217782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Qingli10aExtensive Ace2 duplication and multiple mutations on Ace1 and Ace2 are related with high level of organophosphates resistance in Aphis gossypii  ap. 526-533.  aAphis gossypii (Glover) has been found to possess multiple mutations in the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene (Ace) that might involve target site insensitivity. In vitro functional expression of AChEs reveals that the resistant Ace1 (Ace1R) and Ace2 (Ace2R) were significantly less inhibited by eserine, omethoate, and malaoxon than the susceptible Ace1 (Ace1S) and Ace2 (Ace2S). Furthermore, in both the mutant and susceptible AChEs, Ace2 was significantly less sensitive to eserine, omethoate, and malaoxon than Ace1. These results suggested that both the mutant Ace1 and Ace2 were responsible for omethoate resistance, while the mutant Ace2 played a major role in insecticide resistance. The DNA copy number and transcription level of Ace2 were 1.52‐ and 1.88‐fold higher in the ORR strain than in the OSS strain. Furthermore, the DNA copy number and transcription level of Ace2 were significantly higher than that of Ace1 in either OSS or ORR strains, demonstrating the involvement of Ace2 gene duplication in resistance. Thus, the authors conclude that omethoate resistance in cotton aphids appears to have evolved through a combination of multiple mutations and extensive Ace2R gene duplication. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Nevertheless, whether circRNA expression is related to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression remains largely unclear. In our study, we investigated the role of circ-CBFB in CLL. We found that circ-CBFB was markedly overexpressed in CLL cells compared to normal controls. Furthermore, we found that circ-CBFB could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CLL patients. We also explored the physiological function of circ-CBFB. We found that circ-CBFB knockdown significantly suppressed CLL cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle progression, and induced cellular apoptosis. In terms of its mechanism, we identified circ-CBFB as a sponge of miR-607, which targeted FZD3. By inhibiting miR-607 availability, circ-CBFB promoted FZD3 expression, leading to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and consequent CLL progression. Taken together, our findings revealed that the circ-CBFB/miR-607/FZD3/Wnt/β-catenin regulatory signaling cascade contributes to CLL progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3alymphocytic leukemia 3anon-coding RNA 3apatients 0aCirc-CBFB 0aChronic lymphocytic leukemia 0aProliferation 0aApoptosis 0aCircRNAs 0aCLL 0amiRNAs 0a3′-UTR1 aWu, Linlin1 aBao, Jing1 aLi, Qingsheng1 aChen, Xiaowen1 aXia, Hailong1 aXia, Ruixiang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Sept. 03, v. 503, no. 1 p.385-390dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03760naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001700140245021200157300001600369500002400385500002400409520220100433650002602634650001402660650002102674650000902695650001302704650001602717650002202733650002402755650001002779650001402789650001502803650003302818650001502851650001002866651001202876651001002888651001102898651001002909700002202919700002302941700002002964700002202984700002003006700001803026773010903044852000903153856008003162655001203242IND4462675620221116150028.0120131s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446267562DNAL7 a10.1653/024.094.04312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Vivek10aScirtothrips dorsalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae): Scanning Electron Micrographs of Key Taxonomic Traits and a Preliminary Morphometric Analysis of the General Morphology of Populations of Different Continents  ap. 941-955.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aThe chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) is an emerging pest of many economically important vegetable and ornamental crops grown in the United States. Accurate identification of this pest is a fundamental requirement in development of effective quarantine and management strategies. Using scanning electron microscopy, high resolution images of important taxonomic traits of this pest were produced, which will aid research, regulatory and extension personnel to identify this pest. High resolution images were obtained for identifying characters of S. dorsalis including tergites with antecostal ridges; head with 3 pairs of ocellar setae, metanotum presenting longitudinal striations with medially located pair of setae; veins of forewing presenting widely spaced setae; segment VIII with complete posteromarginal comb of microtrichia; and sternites lacking discal setae but covered with rows of microtrichia except in the antero-medial region. Further, a preliminary comparison of morphological traits of S. dorsalis populations from different geographical regions was conducted, which can help in understanding the phenotype of this pest. Specimens of S. dorsalis were obtained from 5 distinct geographical regions: New Delhi, India; Shizouka, Japan; Negev, Israel; St. Vincent and Florida in the United States. Fourteen morphological characters of each population of S. dorsalis were measured and compared among the 5 populations. No significant differences were observed between the body lengths of the various S. dorsalis populations, which ranged from 0.85 mm (Negev) to 0.98 mm (Florida). When comparing 12 morphological characters, we found no significant differences among New Delhi, St. Vincent, Negev and Florida populations. However, when S. dorsalis populations of these 4 regions were compared with Shizouka, significant differences were detected for either 2 or 5 morphological characters depending on the population, suggesting the Japan population is more robust i.e., longer and wider mesothorax and metathorax, and wider abdomens. Also, the mean lengths of body size among different populations did not vary directly or inversely with latitude. 3aScirtothrips dorsalis 3abody size 3aextension agents 3ahead 3alatitude 3amorphometry 3aornamental plants 3apest identification 3apests 3aphenotype 3aquarantine 3ascanning electron microscopy 3avegetables 3awings 3aFlorida 3aIndia 3aIsrael 3aJapan1 aSeal, Dakshina R.1 aSchuster, David J.1 aMcKenzie, Cindy1 aOsborne, Lance S.1 aMaruniak, James1 aZhang, Shouan0 tFlorida entomologist.g2011 Dec., v. 94, no. 4 p.941-955dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.094.04313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02481naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245014200211300001600353520126100369592002801630650001401658650002501672650001601697650001101713650000901724700002201733700002601755700001901781700002101800700001701821700002301838700001901861773008901880856008201969990002302051852000902074655001202083IND60092899320221122005158.0141103e20131107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009289932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2013.08.0132doi7 aPMC38257552pmcid7 a240353542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenholtz, Matthew10aLong-Range Chromatin Contacts in Embryonic Stem Cells Reveal a Role for Pluripotency Factors and Polycomb Proteins in Genome Organization  ap. 602-616.  aThe relationship between 3D organization of the genome and gene-regulatory networks is poorly understood. Here, we examined long-range chromatin interactions genome-wide in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), iPSCs, and fibroblasts and uncovered a pluripotency-specific genome organization that is gradually reestablished during reprogramming. Our data confirm that long-range chromatin interactions are primarily associated with the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin, defining overall chromosome conformation. Additionally, we identified two further levels of genome organization in ESCs characterized by colocalization of regions with high pluripotency factor occupancy and strong enrichment for Polycomb proteins/H3K27me3, respectively. Underlining the independence of these networks and their functional relevance for genome organization, loss of the Polycomb protein Eed diminishes interactions between Polycomb-regulated regions without altering overarching chromosome conformation. Together, our data highlight a pluripotency-specific genome organization in which pluripotency factors such as Nanog and H3K27me3 occupy distinct nuclear spaces and reveal a role for cell-type-specific gene-regulatory networks in genome organization.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatin 3aembryonic stem cells 3afibroblasts 3agenome 3amice1 aBonora, Giancarlo1 aChronis, Constantinos1 aSplinter, Erik1 ade Laat, Wouter1 aErnst, Jason1 aPellegrini, Matteo1 aPlath, Kathrin0 tCell stem cell.g2013 Nov. 7, v. 13, no. 5 p.602-616dElsevier Inc.x1934-59097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2013.08.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245013500160300002000295520184800315592002802163650002302191650003702214650000802251650001302259650001902272650002402291650002802315650001402343650001802357650001302375650001402388650001502402650001402417650001602431653003402447653003702481653001302518653002402531653002702555700001802582700001702600700001902617700001702636700001702653700001802670700001602688700005502704773014102759856007802900852000902978655001202987IND60598289320221116170829.0180629e20180516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059828932DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b047002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sangik10aEnhanced Performance of Field-Effect Transistors Based on Black Phosphorus Channels Reduced by Galvanic Corrosion of Al Overlayers  ap. 18895-18901.  aTwo-dimensional (2D)-layered semiconducting materials with considerable band gaps are emerging as a new class of materials applicable to next-generation devices. Particularly, black phosphorus (BP) is considered to be very promising for next-generation 2D electrical and optical devices because of its high carrier mobility of 200–1000 cm² V–¹ s–¹ and large on/off ratio of 10⁴ to 10⁵ in field-effect transistors (FETs). However, its environmental instability in air requires fabrication processes in a glovebox filled with nitrogen or argon gas followed by encapsulation, passivation, and chemical functionalization of BP. Here, we report a new method for reduction of BP-channel devices fabricated without the use of a glovebox by galvanic corrosion of an Al overlayer. The reduction of BP induced by an anodic oxidation of Al overlayer is demonstrated through surface characterization of BP using atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy along with electrical measurement of a BP-channel FET. After the deposition of an Al overlayer, the FET device shows a significantly enhanced performance, including restoration of ambipolar transport, high carrier mobility of 220 cm² V–¹ s–¹, low subthreshold swing of 0.73 V/decade, and low interface trap density of 7.8 × 10¹¹ cm–² eV–¹. These improvements are attributed to both the reduction of the BP channel and the formation of an Al₂O₃ interfacial layer resulting in a high-k screening effect. Moreover, ambipolar behavior of our BP-channel FET device combined with charge-trap behavior can be utilized for implementing reconfigurable memory and neuromorphic computing applications. Our study offers a simple device fabrication process for BP-channel FETs with high performance using galvanic oxidation of Al overlayers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aargon (noble gases) 3aatomic force microscopy 3acorrosion 3aencapsulation 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3ascreening 3atransistors 0areduction of black phosphorus 0aanodic oxidation of Al overlayer 0amobility 0asub-threshold swing 0ainterface trap density1 aYoon, Chansoo1 aLee, Ji-Hye,1 aKim, Yeon-Soo,1 aLee, Mi Jung1 aKim, Wondong1 aBaik, Jaeyoon1 aJia, Quanxi1 aPark, Bae Ho1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0928-329X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 May 16, v. 10, no. 22 p.18895-18901dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b047003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001600271520118800287592002801475650001001503650001501513650001001528650001001538650001901548650001201567650001001579650002201589650000901611650001201620700002401632700002001656700002401676700002401700700002601724773014501750856008201895852000901977655001201986IND60627245420221122231638.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1477-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrog, Sabrina10aComplementarity of molecular and elemental mass spectrometric imaging of Gadovist™ in mouse tissues  ap. 629-637.  aDrug biodistribution analyses can be considered a key issue in pharmaceutical discovery and development. Here, mass spectrometric imaging can be employed as a powerful tool to investigate distributions of drug compounds in biologically and medically relevant tissue sections. Both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–mass spectrometric imaging as molecular method and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometric imaging as elemental detection method were applied to determine drug distributions in tissue thin sections. Several mouse organs including the heart, kidney, liver, and brain were analyzed with regard to distribution of Gadovist™, a gadolinium-based contrast agent already approved for clinical investigation. This work demonstrated the successful detection and localization of Gadovist™ in several organs. Furthermore, the results gave evidence that gadolinium-based contrast agents in general can be well analyzed by mass spectrometric imaging methods. In conclusion, the combined application of molecular and elemental mass spectrometry could complement each other and thus confirm analytical results or provide additional information.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3adesorption 3adrugs 3aheart 3aimage analysis 3akidneys 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3amice 3atissues1 aEl-Khatib, Ahmed H.1 aBeck, Sebastian1 aMakowski, Marcus R.1 aJakubowski, Norbert1 aLinscheid, Michael W.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2019 Jan., v. 411, no. 3 p.629-637dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-018-1477-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245015100162300002000313520144900333592002801782650002201810650001701832650001301849650002301862650001301885650001601898650001301914650001401927650001601941653002501957653004001982653002902022653002102051653001702072700001902089700002602108700002502134700001902159700002602178700001902204700006602223700005802289700005602347700005902403773014102462856007802603852000902681655001202690IND60598289420221116171117.0180629e20180517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059828942DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b047112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPickett, Alec10aCorrelating Charge Transport with Structure in Deconstructed Diketopyrrolopyrrole Oligomers: A Case Study of a Monomer in Field-Effect Transistors  ap. 19844-19852.  aCopolymers based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) cores have attracted a lot of attention because of their high p-type as well as n-type carrier mobilities in organic field-effect transistors (FETs) and high power conversion efficiencies in solar cell structures. We report the structural and charge transport properties of n-dialkyl side-chain-substituted thiophene DPP end-capped with a phenyl group (Ph-TDPP-Ph) monomer in FETs which were fabricated by vacuum deposition and solvent coating. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) from bottom-gate, bottom-contact FET architectures was measured with and without biasing. Ph-TDPP-Ph reveals a polymorphic structure with π-conjugated stacking direction oriented in-plane. The unit cell comprises either one monomer with a = 20.89 Å, b = 13.02 Å, c = 5.85 Å, α = 101.4°, β = 90.6°, and γ = 94.7° for one phase (TR1) or two monomers with a = 24.92 Å, b = 25.59 Å, c = 5.42 Å, α = 80.3°, β = 83.5°, and γ = 111.8° for the second phase (TR2). The TR2 phase thus signals a shift from a coplanar to herringbone orientation of the molecules. The device performance is sensitive to the ratio of the two triclinic phases found in the film. Some of the best FET performances with p-type carrier mobilities of 0.1 cm²/V s and an on/off ratio of 10⁶ are for films that comprise mainly the TR1 phase. GIXRD from in operando FETs demonstrates the crystalline stability of Ph-TDPP-Ph.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acase studies 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3amoieties 3asolar cells 3asolvents 3athiophene 3atransistors 0aconjugated molecules 0agrazing-incidence X-ray diffraction 0afield-effect transistors 0acharge transport 0apolymorphism1 aTorkkeli, Mika1 aMukhopadhyay, Tushita1 aPuttaraju, Boregowda1 aLaudari, Amrit1 aLauritzen, Andreas E.1 aBikondoa, Oier1 aKjelstrup-Hansen, Jakob1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4482-49791 aKnaapila, Matti1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4114-97981 aPatil, Satish1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3884-114X1 aGuha, Suchismita1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6269-22980 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 May 17, v. 10, no. 23 p.19844-19852dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b047113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245011700166300001600283520217400299592002802473650001302501650001302514650002402527650002402551650001002575650001402585650000902599650002202608650001102630650002302641650001402664653001502678653001402693653001302707653002402720653000802744653001802752700001602770700001502786700001302801700001402814773010502828856008702933852000903020655001203029IND60552620420221120132730.0161021e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055262042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZilg, B.12aA new model for the estimation of time of death from vitreous potassium levels corrected for age and temperature  ap. 158-166.  aAnalysis of potassium concentration in the vitreous fluid of the eye is frequently used by forensic pathologists to estimate the postmortem interval (PMI), particularly when other methods commonly used in the early phase of an investigation can no longer be applied. The postmortem rise in vitreous potassium has been recognized for several decades and is readily explained by a diffusion of potassium from surrounding cells into the vitreous fluid. However, there is no consensus regarding the mathematical equation that best describes this increase. The existing models assume a linear increase, but different slopes and starting points have been proposed. In this study, vitreous potassium levels, and a number of factors that may influence these levels, were examined in 462 cases with known postmortem intervals that ranged from 2h to 17 days. We found that the postmortem rise in potassium followed a non-linear curve and that decedent age and ambient temperature influenced the variability by 16% and 5%, respectively. A long duration of agony and a high alcohol level at the time of death contributed less than 1% variability, and evaluation of additional possible factors revealed no detectable impact on the rise of vitreous potassium. Two equations were subsequently generated, one that represents the best fit of the potassium concentrations alone, and a second that represents potassium concentrations with correction for decedent age and/or ambient temperature. The former was associated with narrow confidence intervals in the early postmortem phase, but the intervals gradually increased with longer PMIs. For the latter equation, the confidence intervals were reduced at all PMIs. Therefore, the model that best describes the observed postmortem rise in vitreous potassium levels includes potassium concentration, decedent age, and ambient temperature. Furthermore, the precision of these equations, particularly for long PMIs, is expected to gradually improve by adjusting the constants as more reference data are added over time. A web application that facilitates this calculation process and allows for such future modifications has been developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aalcohols 3aambient temperature 3aconfidence interval 3adeath 3aequations 3aeyes 3aforensic sciences 3amodels 3apostmortem changes 3apotassium 0aPostmortem 0aPotassium 0aVitreous 0aPostmortem interval 0aPMI 0aTime of death1 aBernard, S.1 aAlkass, K.1 aBerg, S.1 aDruid, H.0 tForensic science international.g2015 Sept., v. 254 p.158-166dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011700169300002000286520143600306592002801742650002201770650001201792650001201804650001401816650002801830650002601858650001101884650001101895650001301906650001001919650001101929650000901940650001101949700001901960700001901979700002401998700002002022700002002042700001802062773014902080856008102229852000902310655001202319IND60586870320221121082018.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058687032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0325-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMengist, Molla F.10aCadmium uptake and partitioning in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars with different tuber-Cd concentration  ap. 27384-27391.  aPotatoes grown in soil with high Cd concentrations can accumulate high levels of Cd in the tubers. Although there is significant environmental variation involved in the trait of crop uptake of Cd, there are also distinctive cultivar differences. In order to understand this differential Cd accumulation mechanism, two potato cultivars were chosen that accumulate high and low levels of Cd in tubers. The patterns of Cd concentration, Cd content and dry weight accumulation of the two cultivars were examined at different stages of plant growth. The data suggest that differences in total Cd uptake and in Cd partitioning among organs are the mechanisms governing differential Cd-tuber accumulation in the two cultivars. The low tuber-Cd accumulator exhibited lower root-to-shoot and shoot-to-tuber translocation driven by higher root and shoot biomass that retained more Cd in roots and shoots, respectively, reducing its movement to the tubers. Higher remobilization and more efficient tuber loading was observed in the high tuber-Cd accumulator, indicating that remobilization of Cd from leaves to tubers was a major factor, not only in tuber-Cd loading, but also in the establishment of differential tuber-Cd levels. Regardless of cultivar differences, the concentration of Cd in the tuber was very low compared to that in other organs suggesting that, despite its high phloem mobility, Cd tends to be sequestered in the shoots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acultivars 3adry matter accumulation 3aenvironmental factors 3aleaves 3aphloem 3apotatoes 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3atubers1 aMilbourne, Dan1 aGriffin, Denis1 aMcLaughlin, Mike J.1 aCreedon, Joanne1 aJones, Peter W.1 aAlves, Sheila0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Dec., v. 24, no. 35 p.27384-27391dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0325-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015400176300001400330520151500344592002801859650003101887650001201918650001301930650001001943650002001953650003101973650001002004650001302014650001202027650002602039650001102065650002102076650001102097650001402108650002902122650001702151650002402168651001002192653001702202653002102219653001302240653001202253653002002265653000802285653000802293653000902301700001602310700001802326700002202344700001802366773009302384856008502477852000902562655001202571IND60552120920221120235725.0170208e20150920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055212092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevasundaram, Santhi14aThe influence of reduced oxygen availability on gene expression in laboratory (H37Rv) and clinical strains (S7 and S10) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  ap. 70-80.  aMycobacterium tuberculosis has the ability to persist within the host in a dormant stage. One important condition believed to contribute to dormancy is reduced access to oxygen known as hypoxia. However, the response of M. tuberculosis to such hypoxia condition is not fully characterized. Virtually all dormant models against tuberculosis tested in animals used laboratory strain H37Rv or Erdman strain. But major outbreaks of tuberculosis (TB) occur with the strains that have widely different genotypes and phenotypes compared to H37Rv. In this study, we used a custom oligonucleotide microarray to determine the overall transcriptional response of laboratory strain (H37Rv) and most prevalent clinical strains (S7 and S10) of M. tuberculosis from South India to hypoxia. Analysis of microarray results revealed that a total of 1161 genes were differentially regulated (≥1.5 fold change) in H37Rv, among them 659 genes upregulated and 502 genes down regulated. Microarray data of clinical isolates showed that a total of 790 genes were differentially regulated in S7 among which 453 genes were upregulated and 337 down regulated. Interestingly, numerous genes were also differentially regulated in S10 (total 2805 genes) of which 1463 genes upregulated and 1342 genes down regulated during reduced oxygen condition (Wayne's model). One hundred and thirty-four genes were found common and upregulated among all three strains (H37Rv, S7, and S10) and can be targeted for drug/vaccine development against TB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aanimals 3adormancy 3adrugs 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahypoxia 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxygen 3aphenotype 3atranscription (genetics) 3atuberculosis 3avaccine development 3aIndia 0aTuberculosis 0aClinical strains 0aDormancy 0aHypoxia 0aGene regulation 0aRvD 0aS7D 0aS10D1 aKhan, Imran1 aKumar, Neeraj1 aDāsa, Sulocanā,1 aRaja, Alamelu0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 Sept. 20, v. 210 p.70-80dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008500168300001600253520160000269592002801869596004501897650001601942650001901958650001101977650001901988650001602007650001202023650002102035650001102056650001602067650001102083650002202094650000902116650002602125650001202151650001502163650001402178650001302192650002502205650001802230650002002248650000902268700001702277700002002294700001702314700002402331700002002355700002002375700002002395700002502415700002002440700001802460700001802478773014502496856008202641961000902723852000902732655001202741IND60627245620221122192846.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1498-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shun-Chung12aA new anion exchange purification method for Cu stable isotopes in blood samples  ap. 765-776.  aThe isotopic composition of iron, zinc, copper, and cadmium (δ⁵⁶Fe, δ⁶⁶Zn, δ⁶⁵Cu, and δ¹¹⁴Cd) are novel and promising tools to study the metabolism and homeostasis of trace metals in the human body. Serum δ⁶⁵Cu has been proposed as a potential tool for diagnosis of cancer in liquid biopsy, and other metals may have similar utility. However, accurate analysis of trace metal isotopes is challenging because of the difficulties in purifying the metals from biological samples. Here we developed a simple and rapid method for sequential purification of Cu, Fe, Zn, and Cd from a single blood plasma sample. By using a combination of 11 M acetic acid and 4 M HCl in the first steps of column chemistry on AG-MP1 resin, we dramatically improve the separation of Cu from matrix elements compared to previous methods which use concentrated HCl alone. Our new method achieves full recovery of Cu, Fe, Zn, and Cd to prevent column-induced isotope fractionation effects, and effectively separates analytes from the matrix in order to reduce polyatomic interferences during isotope analysis. Our methods were verified by the analysis of isotope standards, a whole blood reference material, and a preliminary sample set including five plasma samples from healthy individuals and five plasma samples from cancer patients. This new method simplifies preparation of blood samples for metal isotope analysis, accelerating multi-isotope approaches to medical studies and contributing to our understanding of the cycling of Fe, Zn, Cu, and Cd in the human body.

We investigated how cues are integrated across time to influence an important progeny phenotype, i.e., seed germination. METHODS: We used Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate how the photoperiod experienced by maternal parents and by progeny influences seed germination. We examined when maternal photoperiod effects on germination are imposed and how long they persist in progeny. KEY RESULTS: The photoperiod experienced by maternal plants more strongly influenced germination than the photoperiod experienced during seed imbibition. In addition, the photoperiod experienced at the prereproductive stage frequently influenced germination as strongly as that experienced during reproduction. In general, seeds from plants grown under short days had higher seed germination percentages than seeds from plants grown in longer days. These maternal effects diminished with after‐ripening, but reappeared in seeds induced into secondary dormancy. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that the effect of photoperiod systematically attenuates in proportion to the time that elapsed between the cue and the timing of seed germination. Moreover, more recently experienced cues did not override the effects of cues experienced previously. Instead, specific sequences of photoperiods experienced at the prereproductive and reproductive stages appear to influence germination behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aafter-ripening 3adormancy 3aimbibition 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3areproduction 3aseed germination1 aAuge, Gabriela1 aDonohue, Kathleen0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Apr., v. 104, no. 4 p.516-526dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.16003893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013700170300001600307520169700323592002802020650001502048650002302063650001702086650001102103650002102114650001002135650001402145650001902159650001702178650001002195650001602205650001502221650001502236650001102251650001502262650001202277650001002289650000902299650001102308650001102319650001202330653000902342653002302351653002002374653001002394653001702404653002802421700002002449700002702469700002402496773012502520856008302645852000902728655001202737IND60532395820221118014612.0190318e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColbach, Nathalie12aA trait-based approach to explain weed species response to agricultural practices in a simulation study with a cropping system model  ap. 197-204.  aThe objective of the present study was to use a cropping system model to evaluate the potential impacts of modified agricultural practices ex ante on weeds and to adapt ecological analytical methods to analyse simulation output to identify species traits selected by cropping techniques. Cropping systems typical of three French regions were determined from farm surveys and a French data base monitoring agricultural practices and weeds (“Biovigilance-Flore”). Current scenarios as well as recent and probable future changes were identified in surveys and by expert opinion were simulated in each region, using the FlorSys model and a weed flora consisting of sixteen major annual weed species. Each scenario was simulated over 24 years and repeated 10 times with randomly chosen regional weather series. The simulated weed flora was analysed with RLQ-analyses and fourth-corner analyses. These showed that longer rotations selected weed species with elongated/flattened seeds; spring crops and late-sown autumn crops favoured round seeds and species with short emergence periods; frequent mouldboard ploughing selected species with thick-coated seeds; frequent tillage favoured monocotyledons and species with a late and/or short emergence period; glyphosate before sowing in direct-drilled fields selected seeds with low area/mass ratios. The identified selection pressures could be explained by effects on life-cycle processes (e.g. thick-coated seeds survive better in the soil after burial, low area/mass ratios delay germination because of slower imbibition). The trait×practice relationships were then used to predict the behaviour of additional weed species in cropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiliopsida 3aanalytical methods 3aannual weeds 3aautumn 3acropping systems 3acrops 3adatabases 3aexpert opinion 3afarm surveys 3aflora 3agermination 3aglyphosate 3aimbibition 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplowing 3aseeds 3asoil 3asowing 3aspring 3aweather 0aWeed 0aLife-history trait 0aCropping system 0aModel 0aRLQ-analysis 0aFunctional relationship1 aGranger, Sylvie1 aGuyot, Sébastien H.M.1 aMézière, Delphine0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 183 p.197-204dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006100138245010000199500002000299520135300319592002801672596004801700596004801748596004801796650001601844650001101860650001501871650001501886650001501901650001301916650001401929650002501943651001401968651001801982651004002000773010802040856007202148852000902220655001202229IND60631670420221117182327.0190312e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063167042DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.25872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdmunds, Peter J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9039-934710aThree decades of degradation lead to diminished impacts of severe hurricanes on Caribbean reefs  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMajor tropical storms are destructive phenomena with large effects on the community dynamics of multiple biomes. On coral reefs, their impacts have been described for decades, leading to the expectation that future storms should have effects similar to those recorded in the past. This expectation relies on the assumption that storm intensities will remain unchanged, and the impacted coral reef communities are similar to those of the recent past; neither assumption is correct. This study quantified the effects of two category five hurricanes on the reefs of St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, where 31 yr of time‐series analyses reveal chronic coral mortality, increasing macroalgal abundance, and five major hurricanes that caused acute coral mortality. Contextualized by these trends, the effects of the most recent storms, Hurricanes Irma and Maria (September 2017), on coral cover were modest. While mean absolute coral cover declined 1–4% depending on site, these effects were not statistically discernable. Following decades of increasing abundance of macroalgae, this functional group responded to the recent hurricanes with large increases in abundance on both absolute and relative scales. Decades of chronic mortality have changed the coral assemblages of St. John to create degraded communities that are resistant to severe storms.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB 08‐41441cNational Science Foundation  aDEB 13‐50146cNational Science Foundation  aOCE 18‐01336cNational Science Foundation 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aecosystems 3ahurricanes 3amacroalgae 3amoieties 3amortality 3atime series analysis 3aCaribbean 3aUnited States 3aVirgin Islands of the United States0 tEcology.g2019 Mar., v. 100, no. 3 p.e02587-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.25873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245012900164300001600293500002000309520185000329592002802179596004702207650001602254650001102270650002002281650001102301650002502312650001602337650001902353700001502372700002102387700002302408700002202431773013302453856007602586852000902662655001202671IND60786389420221118204707.0220803e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078638942DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.16004532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuhlman, Tracey A.10aRecombination‐dependent replication and gene conversion homogenize repeat sequences and diversify plastid genome structure  ap. 559-572.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: There is a misinterpretation in the literature regarding the variable orientation of the small single copy region of plastid genomes (plastomes). The common phenomenon of small and large single copy inversion, hypothesized to occur through intramolecular recombination between inverted repeats (IR) in a circular, single unit‐genome, in fact, more likely occurs through recombination‐dependent replication (RDR) of linear plastome templates. If RDR can be primed through both intra‐ and intermolecular recombination, then this mechanism could not only create inversion isomers of so‐called single copy regions, but also an array of alternative sequence arrangements. METHODS: We used Illumina paired‐end and PacBio single‐molecule real‐time (SMRT) sequences to characterize repeat structure in the plastome of Monsonia emarginata (Geraniaceae). We used OrgConv and inspected nucleotide alignments to infer ancestral nucleotides and identify gene conversion among repeats and mapped long (>1 kb) SMRT reads against the unit‐genome assembly to identify alternative sequence arrangements. RESULTS: Although M. emarginata lacks the canonical IR, we found that large repeats (>1 kilobase; kb) represent ∼22% of the plastome nucleotide content. Among the largest repeats (>2 kb), we identified GC‐biased gene conversion and mapping filtered, long SMRT reads to the M. emarginata unit‐genome assembly revealed alternative, substoichiometric sequence arrangements. CONCLUSION: We offer a model based on RDR and gene conversion between long repeated sequences in the M. emarginata plastome and provide support that both intra‐and intermolecular recombination between large repeats, particularly in repeat‐rich plastomes, varies unit‐genome structure while homogenizing the nucleotide sequence of repeats.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS‐1027259cNational Science Foundation 3aGeraniaceae 3abotany 3agene conversion 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3aplastid genome1 aZhang, Jin1 aBlazier, John C.1 aSabir, Jamal S.

Flocculation process of metals during estuarine mixing can reduce the environmental hazards of metals and also can provide micronutrients to the aquatic system. The present investigation provides a thorough study of eliminating colloidal elements of copper, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc during estuarine mixing of Shalmanrood River water with Caspian Sea water in Iran. The processes of flocculation were carried out in six different salinity regimes (0.45–2.4 ppt). The obtained result is indicative of non-conservative behavior of the studied metals. Higher flocculation resulted in a lower salinity regime. The obtained results indicated that most of the metals were eliminated during the initial mixing of fresh water with sea water at 0.45–0.9 ppt salinity interval. The trend of flocculation rates of elements is as follows: Zn (59.3%) > Pb (47.6%) > Mn (37.5%) > Cu (29.2%) > Ni (27%).The annual average load of copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) from Shalmanrood River to Caspian Sea decreases as a result of flocculation process from 9.9, 7.7, 8.9, 5.1, and 23.2 tons per year to 7, 4.8, 6.5, 2.7, and 9.4 tons per year, respectively. According to the cluster analysis, parameters such as temperature, pH, and Eh do not have any impact on flocculation of elements expect for Pb. The only parameter that influences the flocculation of Mn is the salinity. Metal speciation studies that are carried out by Eh-pH software show that the studied metals are present as oxides (Zn, Cu, and Ni) and hydroxides (Mn and Pb).  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3acomputer software 3acopper 3aenvironmental hazards 3aestuaries 3afauna 3aflocculation 3aflora 3afreshwater 3ahuman health 3ahydroxides 3alead 3amanganese 3amixing 3anickel 3aoxides 3apH 3apollutants 3ariver water 3arivers 3asaline water 3asalinity 3aseawater 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aCaspian Sea 3aIran1 aKarbassi, Abdolreza1 aHeidari, Mehdi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Dec., v. 24, no. 35 p.27430-27435dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0329-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01368naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008500165300001600250520039200266592002800658650002400686650000900710650000900719650001700728650001400745650001500759700001800774700001800792700002200810773012000832856008100952852000901033655001201042IND60701233620221122030159.0200708e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070123362DNAL7 a10.1134/S003294522003011X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlov, D.

In particular, the electrostatic interaction remains the main issue for the precise simulation of various ionic soft materials from ionic liquids to their supramolecular compounds. In this study, we test the nonpolarizable force fields of ionic liquids (ILs) and self-assembled ionic liquid crystals (ILCs) for which the intermolecular charge transfer and intramolecular polarization are significant. The self-consistent modeling scheme is adopted to refine the atomic charges of ionic species in a condensed state through the use of density functional theory (DFT) under the periodic boundary condition. The atomic charges of the generalized amber force field (GAFF) are effectively updated to express the electrostatic properties of ionic molecules obtained by the DFT calculation in condensed phase, which improves the prediction accuracy of ionic conductivity with the obtained force field (GAFF-DFT). The derived DFT charges then suggest that the substitution of a hydrophobic liquid-crystalline moiety into IL-based cations enhances the charge localization of ionic groups in the amphiphilic molecules, leading to the amplification of the electrostatic interactions among the hydrophilic/ionic groups in the presence of hydrophobic moieties. In addition, we focus on an ion-conductive pathway hidden in the self-assembled nanostructure. The MD results indicate that the ionic groups of cation and anion interact strongly for keeping the bicontinuous nanosegregation of ionic nanochannel. The partial fractions of hydrophilic/ionic and hydrophobic nanodomains are then quantified with the volume difference from referenced IL systems, while the calculated ionic conductivity decreases in the self-assembled ILCs more than the occupied volume of ionic nanodomains. These analyses suggest that the mobility of ions in the self-assembled ILCs remains quite restricted even with small tetrafluoroborate anions because of strong attractive interaction among ionic moieties.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP19H04206cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aJP19H05718cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aJP20H02058cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aJP20K15108cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aJPMXP0112101003cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001700  aJPMXP1020200308cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001700 3aamber 3acations 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3aprediction1 aMatubayasi, Nobuyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7176-441X1 aWashizu, Hitoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5787-72040 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 June 13, v. 126, no. 24 p.4611-4622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c027823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009700168300001400265520089300279592002801172650001501200650002901215650000901244650002001253650001101273650002101284650002001305650001801325650002801343653002201371653002001393653001901413653002001432653002801452700001601480773010201496856008501598852000901683655001201692IND60593298220221116153423.0190131e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059329822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shuzhen10aAdapting ecological risk valuation for natural resource damage assessment in water pollution  ap. 85-92.  aEcological risk assessment can address requirements of natural resource damage assessment by quantifying the magnitude of possible damages to the ecosystem. This paper investigates an approach to assess water damages from pollution incident on the basis of concentrations of contaminants. The baseline of water pollution is determined with not-to-exceed concentration of contaminants required by water quality standards. The values of damage cost to water quality are estimated through sewage treatment cost. To get a reliable estimate of treatment cost, DEA is employed to classify samples of sewage plants based on their efficiency of sewage treatment. And exponential fitting is adopted to determine the relation between treatment cost and the decrease of COCs. The range of damage costs is determined through the fitting curves respectively based on efficient and inefficient samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental assessment 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater quality standards 0aDamage assessment 0aEcological risk 0aTreatment cost 0aWater pollution 0aWater quality standards1 aWu, Desheng0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 July, v. 164 p.85-92dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009200171300001400263520130900277592002801586650002701614650002401641650001201665650002001677650001201697650001101709650001001720650001201730650001901742651001001761653001001771653002901781653001401810653001401824700002001838700001601858773012301874856008301997852000902080655001202089IND60532396020221118014503.0190318e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalton, Timothy J.10aPerceptions and performance of conservation agriculture practices in northwestern Ghana  ap. 65-71.  aAgriculture in Northwestern Ghana is subsistence in nature with low productivity due to continuous monocropping of cereals with low input usage. Conservation agriculture has been introduced in the northwestern part of Ghana in 2010 as a potential intervention to address these issues. A baseline study was conducted to gather farmers’ biophysical and socio-economic characteristics, farming methods and a knowledge index of conservation agriculture practices. The knowledge index indicated limited understanding of most of the components of conservation agriculture practices by both male and female farmers. Two farmer field schools aimed at promoting the conservation agricultural practices were conducted and offered to approximately 1/3 of all individuals surveyed at the baseline. These same farmers were resurveyed in 2012 in order to determine whether their knowledge on conservation agriculture practices has changed using a double-difference approach. The approach is also be used to determine whether innate perceptions and biases against conservation agriculture have changed over time through the field schools. These findings are supported with partial budgets on conservation practices in order to determine whether knowledge or on-farm economics limit adoption of conservation practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation practices 3acontinuous cropping 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afemales 3agrains 3amales 3aschools 3asocioeconomics 3aGhana 0aGhana 0aConservation agriculture 0aEconomics 0aKnowledge1 aYahaya, Iddrisu1 aNaab, Jesse0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 187 p.65-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009200173300001600265520110700281592002801388650004401416650001401460650001901474650001301493650002301506650001801529650001301547650001701560650001001577650001901587650001901606650001101625650002101636650001501657650004401672653003801716653002601754653002001780653001401800653001301814653001401827700001901841700002401860700003501884773010701919856008602026852000902112655001202121IND60553021220221118053511.0161021e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055302122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampath, Malathi10aCurcumin loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanofiber for the treatment of carcinoma  ap. 128-134.  aPoly (dl-lactic-co-glycolic) acid [PLGA] copolymers with different ratios (78/22, 68/32 and 61/39) and molecular weight (15,400, 11,000 and 10,000Da) were synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, FTIR, GPC and TGA-DTA studies. Curcumin loaded PLGA with the size of 100–300nm were obtained by electrospinning in which no visible aggregation observed on the surface. The diameter of CPNF (61/39) nanofiber obtained from the topographical imaging by AFM is 160±10nm. The water contact angle measurements indicate that an increase in GA content results in increase in the hydrophilicity of the PLGA copolymer. The in vitro release profile and release kinetics from the CPNF demonstrated a sustained release of curcumin from CPNF. The release profile follows Korsmeyer–Peppas model suggesting a combination of surface drug dissolution and non-Fickian diffusion as a major drug release mechanism. The effect of CPNF on cell viability was assessed by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl] 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay to examine the cytotoxic effect of released curcumin on A431 cells in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarcinoma 3acell viability 3acolloids 3acomposite polymers 3acontact angle 3acurcumin 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3ahydrophilicity 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aPoly (dl-lactic-co-glycolic) acid 0aMelt polycondensation 0aElectrospinning 0aNanofiber 0aCurcumin 0aCarcinoma1 aLakra, Rachita1 aKorrapati, PurnaSai1 aSengottuvelan, Balasubramanian0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 May 01, v. 117 p.128-134dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012400168300001600292520076900308592002801077650001601105650002201121650001401143650001701157650001901174650001001193651001601203773012001219856008101339852000901420655001201429IND60701233820221122005239.0200708e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070123382DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452200301332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProkofiev, A.

In all three species, the males were polygamous and could inseminate at least three females at a rate of one female per day. Compared to the other two species, the O. minutus males had a lower rate of success in three consecutive mating orders. The mated females laid the same number of eggs irrespective of mating sequence. Orius minutus and O. strigicollis females were found to be monandrous, and they re‐mated with another male only when the 1st mating failed. In contrast, O. sauteri females were polyandrous and accepted a 2nd male even when the 1st mating was successful. Multiple mating with a single male did not increase their fecundity, and it decreased the hatching success of eggs. Mating with multiple males did not affect the fecundity or hatching success. Our scanning electron microscopy observation suggested that the genitalia of O. minutus and O. strigicollis were more similar in shape. The similarities in mating system and morphology between O. minutus and O. strigicollis support a close phylogenetic relationship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrius minutus 3aOrius sauteri 3aOrius tristicolor 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3agenitalia 3ahatching 3amales 3amating systems 3aphylogeny 3apolyandry 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aJapan1 aTaniai, Kiyoko1 aMaeda, Taro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3558-84600 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2019 Feb., v. 167, no. 2 p.141-151dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.127403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008000169300001600249500000900265520183400274592002802108650001602136650001702152650001402169650002402183650001002207650002102217650002302238650001402261650001302275650002202288651000902310651001602319700002002335700001502355700002002370700002302390700002402413773012002437856008102557852000902638655001202647IND60665388320221119134720.0191228e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066538832DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.77202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCord, Kristen L.10aTocopherol Content of Soybean Lines with Reduced Linolenate in the Seed Oil  ap. 772-776.  aepub  aSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] oil is an important source of the tocopherols (vitamin E) used as a dietary supplement and as an antioxidant in foods. Previous research studies have indicated that genotypes with lower linolenate than that of conventional soybean genotypes have less tocopherols and that the relative amounts of α- and γ-tocopherol may change as linolenate content is reduced by genetic modification. Those studies have utilized a limited number of genotypes with diverse genetic backgrounds and with greater linolenate content than that of currently available genotypes. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the tocopherol content of 20 lines with reduced linolenate of about 10 g kg⁻¹ and 20 lines with normal linolenate of about 70 g kg⁻¹ derived from each of three single-cross populations segregating for the trait. The lines were grown in replicated tests at Isabela, PR, and at two locations near Ames, IA, during 2002. The mean total tocopherol content of the lines with reduced linolenate was 6.0% less than for the normal-linolenate lines averaged across populations and environments. There was significant variation for total tocopherol among the lines of each type in each population, and some reduced-linolenate lines were not significantly different from normal-linolenate lines for the trait. Lower total tocopherol in reduced-linolenate lines was due to a proportionate decrease in α, γ, and δ tocopherol, and the mean percentages of the three tocopherols in the total tocopherol were not significantly different in the reduced- and normal-linolenate lines. It should be possible to develop cultivars with about 10 g kg⁻¹ linolenate that have an acceptable content of total tocopherol and with the same proportions of α, γ, and δ tocopherol as conventional soybean cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aantioxidants 3acultivars 3adietary supplements 3afoods 3agamma-tocopherol 3agenetic background 3aseed oils 3asoybeans 3atransgenic plants 3aIowa 3aPuerto Rico1 aFehr, Walter R.1 aWang, Tong1 aWelke, Grace A.1 aCianzio, Silvia R.1 aSchnebly, Steven R.0 tCrop science.g2004 May, v. 44, no. 3 p.772-776dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.77203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011700161300002000278520139100298592002801689650002101717650002001738650002601758650001301784650002401797650001101821650001601832650001701848650001101865650002001876650001801896650002101914650000901935650001101944650002501955650001301980700001601993700001502009700001902024700001702043773014902060856008102209852000902290655001202299IND60586871220221120081522.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058687122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0306-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Chao10aEffects of sulfur on toxicity and bioavailability of Cu for castor (Ricinus communis L.) in Cu-contaminated soil  ap. 27476-27483.  aThe biogeochemical cycling of sulfur (S) in soil has an important impact on the bioavailability of heavy metals and affects the utilization of soil polluted by heavy metals. In addition, S-containing compounds are involved in heavy metal detoxification. This study investigated the effects of S on the toxicity and bioavailability of copper (Cu) in castor (Ricinus communis L.) grown in Cu-contaminated mine tailings. The results showed that the application of S reduced the accumulation of Cu in castor and promoted its growth. With the addition of S, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of castor leaves decreased significantly compared with control plants, indicating the alleviation of oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and glutathione (GSH) content decreased significantly with the alleviation of oxidative stress. The sequential extraction of Cu fractions showed that the application of S significantly reduced the reducible Cu fraction, and increased the oxidizable Cu fraction. It also increased the residual Cu fraction in the soil. The transformation of chemical speciation reduced the bioavailability of Cu in soil, which then reduced the accumulation of Cu in castor. Our results demonstrated that S application was effective at promoting castor growth by reducing the bioavailability and uptake of Cu in Cu-contaminated mine tailings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRicinus communis 3abioavailability 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acatalase 3achemical speciation 3acopper 3aglutathione 3aheavy metals 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amine tailings 3aoxidative stress 3asoil 3asulfur 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity1 aYou, Jinwei1 aQi, Yongbo1 aHuang, Guoyong1 aHu, Hongqing0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Dec., v. 24, no. 35 p.27476-27483dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0306-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002900132024001100161040001800172100001500190245012200205506017300327520113600500650002601636650002201662650002501684650001701709650000901726650001701735650001001752650001301762650002201775650001401797650001201811650003201823650002501855650001901880650002701899650001701926650001301943650001401956650001901970700002001989773008802009856011202097856007502209956008602284961000902370852000902379655001202388IND60006103020221214225558.0150629s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000610302DNAL7 a3161672aris7 a10113/610302hdl7 a10.1155/2015/3279692doi8 ans7510  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Arfan10aFine Screening for Resistance to Cold-Induced Sweetening in Potato Hybrids Containing Solanum raphanifolium Germplasm  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aPotato is an indispensable part of human food. Many wild and cultivated potato relatives have been screened to find the best potato germplasm to improve productivity and quality, but only a small sample of the available biodiversity has been exploited. Most wild relatives are self-incompatible diploids. Genetic variability exists within and among populations even within a species. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out fine screening to identify individuals carrying traits of interest. This study was carried out to quantify phenotypic variability for resistance to cold-induced sweetening, an important processing trait. After 4 months of storage at 4C, storage incubation, five families were evaluated for potato chip (crisp) color. The families were generated by crossing a single diploid clone to five plants from one accession of the wild potato relative Solanum raphanifolium. Analysis of variance revealed that resistance against cold induced sweetening was dependent on family and trial. This study underscores the importance of fine screening to select individuals in potato accessions for use in potato improvement. 3aSolanum raphanifolium 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aanalysis of variance 3abiodiversity 3acold 3acold storage 3acolor 3adiploidy 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant breeding 3apostharvest physiology 3apotato chips 3apotatoes 3ascreening 3awild relatives1 aJansky, Shelley0 tAdvances in agriculture.g2015, v. 2015, no. 327969wJournal:26864x2356-654X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/610303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/3279693Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/316167.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245011400213300001600327506007600343520121100419592002801630506003701658650002101695650003101716650001001747650001801757650004301775650001301818650004101831700001901872700001801891773014501909856008202054852000902136655001202145IND60627246020221207093823.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1495-72doi7 aPMC63386982pmcid7 a304785172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilhelm, Johannes G.10aHigh-selectivity profiling of released and labeled N-glycans via polar-embedded reversed-phase chromatography  ap. 735-743.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aN-Glycosylation is the most complex post-translational modification of proteins and involved in many physiological processes and is therefore of major interest in academic research and in the biopharmaceutical industry. Reliable, robust, reproducible, and selective analysis of N-glycans is essential to understand the multitude of biological roles of N-glycosylation. So far, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography analysis of 2-AB or 2-AA derivatized N-glycans has been the standard method. In this work, the superiority of reversed-phase chromatography for complex N-glycosylation analysis is demonstrated. Separation of N-glycans derivatized with anthranilic acid on polar-embedded stationary alkyl phases with sub-2-μm particles results in outstanding selectivity and resolution. In combination with the highly mass spectrometry–compatible mobile phase, even very complex glycan mixtures can be separated, identified, and quantified precisely and accurately. The presented methodology can be applied broadly from basic research to analytical control and release testing of biological drug products and can be implemented in analytical laboratories with minimal effort.

This bias could be caused by increased male mortality, lower male growth rate, or a higher threshold for achieving sexual maturity in males. Here we test these hypotheses using samples from two populations of the Mojave Desert moss Syntrichia caninervis. METHODS: We used double‐digest restriction‐site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to identify candidate sex‐associated loci in a panel of sex‐expressing plants. Next, we used putative sex‐associated markers to identify the sex of individuals without sex structures. KEY RESULTS: We found a 17:1 patch‐level phenotypic female to male sex ratio in the higher elevation site (Wrightwood) and no sex expression at the low elevation site (Phelan). In contrast, on the basis of genetic data, we found a 2:1 female bias at the Wrightwood site and only females at the Phelan site. The relative area occupied by male and female genets was indistinguishable, but males were less genetically diverse. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that both male‐biased mortality and sexual dimorphism in thresholds for sex expression could explain genetic and phenotypic sex ratio biases and that phenotypic sex expression alone over‐estimates the extent of actual sex ratio bias present in these two populations of S. caninervis.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia State University Department of Biological Sciences 3aDNA 3aaltitude 3abotany 3afemales 3amales 3amortality 3amosses and liverworts 3aphenotype 3asex ratio 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual maturity 3aMojave Desert1 aPayton, Adam C.1 aPaasch, Amber E.1 aFisher, Kirsten M.1 aMcDaniel, Stuart F.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 May, v. 104, no. 5 p.733-742dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.17000453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012500170300001600295520108700311592002801398650003101426650001301457650002301470650001301493650001601506650001001522650001601532650001301548650001701561650002801578650001101606650001201617650000701629650002401636650001301660650001701673650002001690650001501710650002101725653001501746653001701761653001701778653002401795653002501819700002101844700001901865700002001884700002001904700002501924700001801949700002101967773010701988856008602095852000902181655001202190IND60553021420221118053342.0161021e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055302142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalil, Faiza10aBiomimetic PEG-catecholates for stabile antifouling coatings on metal surfaces: Applications on TiO2 and stainless steel  ap. 185-192.  aTrimeric catecholates have been designed for the stable immobilization of effector molecules on metal surfaces. The design of these catecholates followed a biomimetic approach and was inspired by natural multivalent metal binders, such as mussel adhesion proteins (MAPs) and siderophores. Three catecholates have been conjugated to central scaffolds based on adamantyl or trisalkylmethyl core structures. The resulting triscatecholates have been immobilized on TiO2 and stainless steel. In a proof of concept study we have demonstrated the high stability of the resulting nanolayers at neutral and slightly acidic pH. Furthermore, polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates of our triscatecholates have been synthesized and were immobilized on TiO2 and stainless steel. The PEG coated surfaces showed excellent antifouling properties upon exposure to human blood and bacteria as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, ellipsometry and a bacterial assay with Staphylococcus epidermidis. In addition, our PEG-triscatecholates showed no cytotoxicity against bone-marrow stem cells on TiO2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aadhesion 3aantifouling agents 3abacteria 3abiomimetics 3ablood 3abone marrow 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahumans 3amussels 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3aproteins 3asiderophores 3astainless steel 3astem cells 3atitanium dioxide 0aBiofouling 0aCatecholates 0aMultivalency 0aSurface engineering 0aAntifouling surfaces1 aFranzmann, Elisa1 aRamcke, Julian1 aDakischew, Olga1 aLips, Katrin S.1 aReinhardt, Alexander1 aHeisig, Peter1 aMaison, Wolfgang0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 May 01, v. 117 p.185-192dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04091naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010000170300001600270520231600286592002802602650001702630650001102647650000902658650001502667650001302682650001802695650001302713650001902726650001102745650001902756650001302775650001102788650001302799650001302812650001502825650002702840650001202867650003702879650001502916650001902931650001102950650001802961650001202979651001502991651001603006653001503022653001803037653002703055653002203082653002403104653001103128653001203139653000703151653000903158653000903167700001803176700001803194773012503212856008303337852000903420655001203429IND60532396220221118014647.0190318e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvanbäck, Annika10aMitigation of phosphorus leaching losses via subsurface drains from a cracking marine clay soil  ap. 124-134.  aIn Scandinavia, subsurface transport via tile drains contributes significantly to phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) leaching from arable land, which adds to the eutrophication of surface waters. Using flow-proportional water sampling, various options for mitigating subsurface P leaching losses (and N leaching) were examined in 28 experimental plots on a flat, tile-drained site with 60% marine clay. Two crop rotations and unfertilised fallow were monitored for a total of six years. In addition to topsoil management practices (different forms of tillage, structural liming and mineral P fertilisation), local spatial variations in subsurface transport were determined within the experimental area.Mean total P (TotP) leaching losses after conventional autumn ploughing and inverting the soil to a depth of 23cm were 0.79kgha−1year−1, with 87% occurring as particulate P (PP), and the corresponding mean total N leaching losses were 27kgha−1year−1, with 91% occurring as nitrate. The coefficient of variation in TotP leaching both in spring before the experiment started (64%) and during the six-year experiment (60%) was higher than the coefficient of variation in P-soil status (20%), or drainage (25%), illustrating the importance of local-scale subsurface transport in this cracking clay. However, TotP and PP leaching losses were significantly (pr>F<0.002) lower from plots with structural liming than from the other treatments grouped together. Different P fertilisation strategies (band-spreading/broadcasting of mineral P and applying a balanced amount/no P fertiliser) had no significant effect on P leaching losses. Nitrogen leaching was significantly (pr>F<0.001) lower from unfertilised fallow than from other treatments and was not significantly lower after shallow autumn tillage than after conventionally ploughing, whereas PP losses tended to be higher. Infiltration measurements with tension infiltrometers revealed a high variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity within plots. In view of the generally high PP losses, efforts to combat eutrophication of the nearby Baltic Sea should concentrate on soil structure improvements, while extensive tillage and totally omitting P fertilisation of cracking soils with moderate soil P status appears to be inefficient mitigation options.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3aautumn 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acracking 3acrop rotation 3adrainage 3aeutrophication 3afallow 3ainfiltrometers 3aleaching 3aliming 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplowing 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil depth 3asoil structure 3aspring 3asurface water 3atopsoil 3aBaltic Sea 3aScandinavia 0aMitigation 0aCracking soil 0aParticulate phosphorus 0aPreferential flow 0aSubsurface leaching 0aP–AL 0aNO3–N 0aPP 0aTotN 0aTotP1 aUlén, Barbro1 aEtana, Ararso0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 184 p.124-134dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008600168300001600254520147700270592002801747650001301775650001101788650002601799650001601825650002101841650001301862650000901875650001701884650001401901650002201915650001301937650001301950651001001963653001001973653003001983653002602013653001502039653001802054700001802072700001502090773010402105856008702209852000902296655001202305IND60608119320221119110418.0180904e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060811932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Dehong10aModeling and analysis of PM2.5 generation for key factors identification in China  ap. 208-216.  aRecently, the PM2.5 pollution in China has occurred frequently and caused widely concern. In order to identify the key factors for PM2.5 generation, the formation characteristics of PM2.5 would be revealed. A property of electric neutrality of PM2.5 was proposed under the least-energy principle and verified through electricity-charge calculation in this paper. It indicated that PM2.5 is formed by the effect of electromagnetic force, including the effect of ionic bond, hydrogen bond and polarization. According to the analysis of interactive forces among different chemical components, a simulation model is developed for describing the random process of PM2.5 generation. In addition, an orthogonal test with two levels and four factors has been designed and carried out through the proposed model. From the text analysis, PM2.5 would be looser and suspend longer in atmosphere due to Organic Compound (OC) existing (OC can reduce about 67% of PM2.5 density). Considering that NH4+ is the only cation in the main chemical components of PM2.5, it would be vital for anions (such as SO42− and NO3−) to aggregate together for facilitating PM2.5 growing. Therefore, in order to relieve PM2.5 pollution, control strategies for OC and NH4+ would be enhanced by government through improving the quality of oils and solvent products, decreasing the amount of nitrogenous fertilizer utilization, or changing the fertilizing environment from dry condition to wet condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanions 3aatmospheric chemistry 3afertilizers 3ahydrogen bonding 3anitrates 3aoils 3aparticulates 3apollution 3asimulation models 3asolvents 3asulfates 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aFormation characteristics 0aElectrical neutrality 0aIonic bond 0aHydrogen bond1 aJiang, Binfan1 aXie, Yulei0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 June, v. 134 p.208-216dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04683naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011000175300001600285500001500301520260300316592002802919650002002947650001002967650002002977650001002997650002303007650002103030650002303051650001503074650002403089650002803113650002303141650001403164650002103178650001703199650000903216650001703225650002603242650001503268650001103283650001103294650001303305650001503318650001503333650001903348650002703367650002003394650001403414650002503428651001203453653001303465653001703478653002203495653002103517653003003538653001503568653001903583700002303602700002503625700002303650700001903673700002003692773013103712856008503843961001203928852000903940655001203949IND60542597720221121151515.0190403e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054259772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddington, Robert N.10aFactors affecting broadleaf woody vegetation in upland pine forests managed for longleaf pine restoration  ap. 130-138.  a2019-12-06  aControlling broadleaf woody plant abundance is one of the greatest challenges in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystem restoration. Numerous factors have been associated with broadleaf woody plant abundance in longleaf pine ecosystems, including site quality, stand structure, and fire frequency and intensity, yet the way in which these factors vary and interact across a landscape is poorly understood. The goal of this study was to quantify the importance of environmental and management factors and their interactions on the abundance of hardwood tree and shrub species in upland pine forests managed for longleaf pine restoration in Fort Benning, GA. We measured understory, midstory, and overstory vegetation in 189 fixed-area plots, and we assembled descriptive plot data about soil texture classes, slope and aspect, and fire management history. We used classification and regression trees to model broadleaf woody species abundance. Regression trees identified fire return interval, soil texture, and slope as the most important factors affecting understory woody plant cover, with high mean cover occurring in areas with longer fire return intervals (i.e. less frequent fire), on fine-textured soils (sandy clay loams and sandy loams), and on slopes less than 6%. An interaction between soil texture and fire return interval was present and suggested that frequent fire was especially important in controlling understory broadleaf woody plants on fine-textured soils. A significant interaction emerged between soil texture and pine basal area as well, suggesting that the potential to release woody competitors with canopy removal was higher on fine-textured soils than on coarse-textured soils. The presence of hardwood stems in the midstory was most dependent upon time since burn. Other factors, such as the number of burns conducted during the growing season and topographic aspect, did not contribute significantly to variation in woody plant cover or density. Of the woody species encountered, sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) was the most abundant, especially on plots with fire return intervals ⩾2.6years, on fine-textured soils, and at low pine basal areas (<9.4m2/ha). Other species such as persimmon (Diospyros virginiana L.), winged sumac (Rhus copallinum L.), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata Michx.) were commonly encountered but at low densities. Our results demonstrate the general complexity of woody species control, but more importantly indicate site differences that could be used to prioritize prescribed fire application at the landscape scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus falcata 3atrees 3astand structure 3astems 3aconiferous forests 3astand basal area 3aprescribed burning 3aecosystems 3afine-textured soils 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3atopographic aspect 3ahighlands 3asandy clay soils 3awoody plants 3aRhus 3asoil texture 3acoarse-textured soils 3aunderstory 3acanopy 3ashrubs 3ahardwood 3alandscapes 3apersimmons 3agrowing season 3aecological restoration 3aPinus palustris 3aoverstory 3aDiospyros virginiana 3aGeorgia 0aSweetgum 0aSoil texture 0aCanopy basal area 0aHardwood control 0aLongleaf pine restoration 0abasal area 0aFire frequency1 aKnapp, Benjamin O.1 aSorrell, Geoffrey G.1 aElmore, Michele L.1 aWang, G.

This otherwise ordinary weather condition was accompanied by unusually heavy precipitation sustained over a period of several days. This triggered numerous landslides and caused many drainage systems to swell, flooding huge tracts of low lying areas that have not experienced similar events in the recent past. Many communities were caught unprepared for the calamity. The amount and extent of damage reflect both the magnitude of the natural disaster itself and the community's nominal level of disaster-preparedness. In view of the increasing atmospheric moisture levels and the likelihood that global warming will affect the weather patterns, there is a possibility that similar weather disturbances can become more frequent. Therefore, there is an urgent need for disaster risk management programs to be developed or enhanced at the local community level especially in areas most vulnerable to weather-related natural hazards, in light of changing global climatic patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3adisaster preparedness 3adisasters 3adrainage systems 3aglobal warming 3alandslides 3arisk reduction 3aweather 3aPhilippines1 aYumul, Graciano P., Jr.cJr.1 aServando, Nathaniel T.1 aDimalanta, Carla B.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 Mar., v. 76, no. 1-2 p.85-94dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011000159300001800269520153500287592002801822650001601850650001301866650001101879650001301890650001001903650001101913650001201924700002101936773009401957856007302051852000902124655001202133IND60408514220221119084856.0150905e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851422DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.104962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Quinn W.10aRates and patterns of thermal mixing at a small stream confluence under variable incoming flow conditions  ap. 4442-4456.  aConfluences are important locations for river mixing within drainage networks, yet few studies have examined in detail the dynamics of mixing within confluences. This study examines the influence of momentum flux ratio, the scale of the flow (cross‐sectional area) and the density differences between incoming flows on thermal mixing at a small stream confluence. Results reveal that rates and patterns of thermal mixing depend on event‐specific combinations of the three factors. The mixing interface at this confluence is generally distorted towards the mouth of the lateral tributary by strong helical motion associated with curvature of flow from the lateral tributary as it aligns with the downstream channel. As the momentum flux from the lateral tributary increases, mixing is enhanced because helical motion from the curving tributary flow expands over the width of the downstream channel. The cross‐sectional area of the flow is negatively correlated with mixing rates, suggesting that the amount of mixing over a fixed distance downstream of the confluence is inversely related to the scale of the flow. Density differences are not strongly related to rates of mixing. Results confirm that mixing rates within the region of confluent flow interaction can be highly variable among flow events with different incoming flow conditions, but that, in general, length scales of mixing are short, and rates of mixing are high at this small confluence compared with those typically documented at large‐river confluences.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3adrainage 3amixing 3amomentum 3amouth 3arivers 3astreams1 aRhoads, Bruce L.0 tHydrological processes.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 29, no. 20 p.4442-4456dWileyx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.104963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245010000177500001900277520154700296592002801843650001401871650001501885650001501900650002101915650002601936650001501962650003201977650001102009650002102020650001802041650001202059650001602071650001702087650001402104650001702118650001702135650001802152650001702170650002402187653002702211653002302238653001802261700001902279700002002298773010702318856008502425852000902510655001202519IND60736466120221116152804.0210603e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073646612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2021.1023732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrera-Bravo, Claudia14aThe roles of parasite-derived extracellular vesicles in disease and host-parasite communication  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, several parasites have been shown to interact with their hosts through intra- and inter-community communication mechanisms, which were identified to be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) through various uptake mechanisms. EVs are a heterogenous group of nanoparticles (~30–5000 nm) classified into three main types according to their size and biogenesis. EVs contain proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and metabolites from the cell of origin which are essential for genetic exchange, biomarker identification and diagnosis of pathological diseases. As important “forward lines of parasite infectivity”, the parasite-secreted EVs function as information transmitters in the early-stage of host-parasite interaction and subsequent host-cell colonization. For this review, we summarize from the literature the relevance of EVs to the pathogenesis and development of human parasitic protistan diseases such as giardiasis, leishmaniasis, amoebiasis, malaria and Blastocystis-mediated gut pathology. Specific in vitro and in vivo interactions of the parasite-EVs and the host, with the reported cellular and immunological outcomes are discussed in this review. EVs have great potential to be further developed as diagnostic, immunomodulation and therapeutic alternatives to fill the knowledge gaps in the current parasitic diseases discussed in this review. Nanomedicine and vaccine development could be explored, with the utilization and/or modification of the parasitic EVs as novel treatment and prevention strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamebiasis 3abiogenesis 3abiomarkers 3adigestive system 3agenetic recombination 3agiardiasis 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahumans 3aimmunomodulation 3aleishmaniasis 3amalaria 3ametabolites 3ananomedicine 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3atherapeutics 3avaccine development 0aExtracellular vesicles 0aCell communication 0aImmune system1 aKoh, Eileen Y.1 aTan, Kevin S.W.0 tParasitology international.g2021 Aug., v. 83 p.102373-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2021.1023733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01402naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014300156300001800299520033700317592002800654650001100682650002300693650001700716650001100733650002200744700001700766700001600783700001900799700001200818700001700830773013300847856007500980852000901055655001201064IND60658922320221119043729.0190826e20110404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065892232DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10462d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Xin-Yu10aPorous Co₃O₄ nanoneedle arrays growing directly on copper foils and their ultrafast charging/discharging as lithium-ion battery anodes  ap. 4718-4720.  aUltrafast charging/discharging of lithium-ion battery anodes is realized from porous Co₃O₄ nanoneedle arrays growing on copper foils.

A wildfire at Northeast Attica, Central Greece, in August 2009, destroyed approximately one third of a study area consisting of a mixture of shrublands, pastures and pines. The present study simultaneously models multiple semi‐arid, shrubland‐dominated Mediterranean catchments and assesses the hydrological response (mean annual and monthly runoff and runoff coefficients) during the first few years following wildfires. A physically based, hydrological model (MIKE SHE) was chosen. Calibration and validation results of mean monthly discharge presented very good agreement with the observed data for the pre‐wildfire and post‐wildfire period for two subcatchments (Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient of 79.7%). The model was then used to assess the pre‐wildfire and post‐wildfire runoff responses for each of seven catchments in the study area. Mean annual surface runoff increased for the first year and after the second year following the wildfires increased by 112% and 166%, respectively. These values are within the range observed in similar cases of monitored sites. This modelling approach may provide a way of prioritizing catchment selection with respect to post‐fire remediation activities. Additionally, this modelling assessment methodology would be valuable to other semi‐arid areas because it provides an important means for comprehensively assessing post‐wildfire response over large regions and therefore attempts to address some of the scaled issues in the specific literature field of research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3ahydrologic models 3apastures 3aremediation 3arunoff 3asemiarid zones 3ashrublands 3asoil properties 3asubwatersheds 3awildfires 3aGreece1 aMallinis, Giorgos1 aKoutsias, Nikos1 aZacharias, Ierotheos0 tHydrological processes.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 29, no. 20 p.4427-4441dWileyx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.105093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010600209520107500315592002801390650002501418650001701443650002001460650002401480650001501504650001801519650001101537650001101548650001001559653003401569653001601603653003001619653002001649653002901669653002201698653002501720653001901745653002401764700002201788773011201810856008301922852000902005655001202014IND60743714120221118223907.0220606e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074371412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2021.1163732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaposo, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1458-883210aAssessment of goodness-of-fit for the main analytical calibration models: Guidelines and case studies  aThis critical review paper will discuss the main analytical calibration models as well as the guidelines for their practical use. The main models used to fit a multiple-point calibration dataset are: 1) linear unweighted or ordinary least squares regression (OLSR); 2) quadratic unweighted least squares regression (QLSR); 3) linear weighted least squares regression (WLSR). Unfortunately, there is no standard procedure in analytical chemistry for objectively testing the goodness-of-fit of calibration models. Different proposals were reported in the literature. However, none is more commonly used, and probably not more controversial than R². In this document, a three step simple calibration diagnosis has been proposed. It is based on a combination of different procedures such as graphical plots, statistical significance tests and numerical parameters. Experimental conditions and design of calibration procedures are very relevant for appropriate selection. Finally, some information on the choice of the different models will be reported in four case studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aexperimental design 3aguidelines 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aweight 3awills 0aBack-calculated concentration 0aCalibration 0aDetermination coefficient 0aGoodness-of-fit 0aLeast squares regression 0aLinear regression 0aQuadratic regression 0aRelative error 0aWeighted regression1 aBarceló, Damià,0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 143 p.116373-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2021.1163733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245012500173300002000298520108800318592002801406650002201434650001101456650001101467650001101478650002301489650001301512650001301525650000801538650002501546700006401571700002301635700001901658773013801677856008001815852000901895655001201904IND60746139320221122233600.0210729e20210714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074613932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c038402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMousavi, Seyedeh Laleh10aCorrelation of Physical Features and the Photovoltaic Performance of P3HT:PCBM Solar Cells by Cu-Doped SnS Nanoparticles  ap. 15841-15852.  aIn this research work, un- and copper (Cu)-doped tin sulfide (SnS) nanoparticles (NPs) with various Cu concentrations were synthesized by the ultrasonic method and added to the active layer of polymer solar cells with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Ag–Al configuration. The structural, optical, and electrical properties related to the effect of these NPs on cell performance were investigated. X-ray diffraction of these NPs indicates the formation of orthorhombic polycrystalline SnS. The field emission scanning electron microscopy image showed that the un- and Cu-doped SnS NPs were spherical particles with a size less than 100 nm. Optical analysis of the cells shows that the optical energy band gap decreases due to the presence of NPs. The electrical properties of the samples, such as diode coefficient (n), reverse saturation current, turn-on potential (Vₜ), and mobility (μ), were measured using the J–V curve at the dark condition. Electrical characterization of the samples showed that the performance of the cells was improved by adding SnS NPs to the active layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acopper 3adiodes 3aenergy 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3asulfides 3atin 3aultrasonic treatment1 aJamali-Sheini, Farid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0749-39151 aSabaeian, Mohammad1 aYousefi, Ramin0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 14, v. 125, no. 29 p.15841-15852dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c038403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01266naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011400160300001800274520017300292592002800465650001800493650002200511650001700533650001300550700002000563700001800583700001900601700002100620700002100641700001700662700001900679773013400698856007500832852000900907655001200916IND60658922620221119042151.0190826e20110329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065892262DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10470e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOoyama, Yousuke10aFluorescence PET (photo-induced electron transfer) sensors for water based on anthracene–boronic acid ester  ap. 4448-4450.  aAnthracene–boronic acid ester as a new class of fluorescence PET sensors for detection of a trace amount of water in organic solvents has been designed and developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboronic acids 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3asolvents1 aMatsugasako, Ai1 aOka, Kazuyuki1 aNagano, Tomoya1 aSumomogi, Minako1 aKomaguchi, Kenji1 aImae, Ichiro1 aHarima, Yutaka0 tChemical communications.g2011 Mar. 29, v. 47, no. 15 p.4448-4450dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc10470e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245015700178300002000335520123800355592002801593650000801621650001401629650001801643650000901661650001001670650003101680650001501711650001701726650001801743650001301761650001601774700006101790700006001851773011601911856008502027852000902112655001202121IND60754853320220218000000.0211026e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c019062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGravel-Tatta, Laurianne10aAre Plant-Based Carbohydrate Nanoparticles Safe for Inhalation? Investigating Their Interactions with the Pulmonary Surfactant Using Langmuir Monolayers  ap. 12365-12376.  aNanoparticle carriers show promise for drug delivery, including by inhalation, where the first barrier for uptake in the lungs is the monolayer pulmonary surfactant membrane that coats the air/alveoli interface and is critical to breathing. It is imperative to establish the fate of potential nanocarriers and their effects on the biophysical properties of the pulmonary surfactant. To this end, the impact of the nanoparticle surface charge on the lateral organization, thickness, and recompressibility of Langmuir monolayers of model phospholipid-only and phospholipid–protein mixtures was investigated using native and modified forms of nanophytoglycogen, a carbohydrate-based dendritic polymer extracted from corn as monodisperse nanoparticles. We show that the native (quasi-neutral) and anionic nanophytoglycogens have little impact on the phase behavior and film properties. By contrast, cationic nanophytoglycogen alters the film morphology and increases the hysteresis associated with the work of breathing due to its electrostatic interaction with the anionic phospholipids in the model systems. These findings specifically highlight the importance of surface charge as a selection criterion for inhaled nanoformulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abreathing 3acarbohydrates 3acorn 3adrugs 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahysteresis 3ananocarriers 3aphospholipids 3apolymers 3asurfactants1 aDeWolf, Christine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5185-72371 aBadia, Antonella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1026-41360 tLangmuir.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 37, no. 42 p.12365-12376dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c019063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008700161520103800248592002801286650002501314650002101339650001601360650002301376650000901399653002301408653002801431653001701459653001301476653002501489700005401514700001701568773011201585856008301697852000901780655001201789IND60743714220221118223852.0220606e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074371422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2021.1163762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Liu10aFunctionalized gold nanomaterials as biomimetic nanozymes and biosensing actuators  aThe development of accurate analytical methods and highly controllable biomedical devices is inseparable from the continuous progress of nanotechnology. Great efforts have been made for the functional modification of nanomaterials, especially gold nanomaterials (Au NMs). Functionalized Au NMs usually exhibit good biocompatibility, benign biocatalytic and excellent biosensing properties, which renders them potent candidates for diverse biomedical applications. This article reviews the recent advances of functionalized Au NMs in the past decade according to the internal inherent properties and external stimuli response of Au NMs. The multiple applications of Au NMs-based biomimic catalysis and biosensing actuators are summarized and highlighted, which may further deepen the understanding of the mechanism of functionalized Au NMs. Last but not least, the limitations of the current Au NMs based detection strategies, and possible outlooks for the design and applications of functionalized Au NMs in the future are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiocompatibility 3abiomimetics 3acatalytic activity 3agold 0aGold nanomaterials 0aFunctional modification 0aEnzyme-mimic 0aNanozyme 0aBiosensing actuators1 aJiang, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8044-758X1 aWang, Xuemei0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 143 p.116376-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2021.1163763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011800165300001100283520116900294592002801463596006201491650001901553650001401572650001101586650001401597650001801611650001201629650001601641650002001657650001101677650001701688650003401705650001601739650000901755650001501764650001901779650005201798700002001850700002001870700001901890700002001909700001801929700002001947773011901967856008302086852000902169655001202178IND60707145120221120200530.0220619e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070714512DNAL7 a10.1186/s13765-020-00529-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Kyung-A10aEffect of persimmon leaves (Diospyros kaki) on goblet cell density and inflammation in experimental dry eye model  ap. 45.  aThe efficacy of ethanol extract of Diospyros kaki (EEDK) on dry eye (DE) was determined using an experimental mouse model. Experimental groups included three treated with various amounts of EEDK and one treated with omega-3 for 2 weeks. Damage to the ocular surface was evaluated, and the presence of conjunctival goblet cells was determined. Moreover, the inflammatory response was analyzed via RT-PCR analysis and a reporter gene assay. Fluorescein staining intensity decreased in the EEDK treatment group, and goblet cell density increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were upregulated in human corneal epithelial cells treated with Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)-4. However, pro-inflammatory cytokines were downregulated at the mRNA level upon treatment with EEDK. Furthermore, EEDK regulated Pam3CSK4-induced gene expression through interferon regulatory factors. EEDK effectively improves the conjunctival goblet cell density and reduces the inflammatory response by reducing interferon regulatory factor activation downstream of Toll-like receptors in DE. Therefore, EEDK could be beneficial agents for preventing and treating DE.  aPublisher supplied data  a2Z05310cKorea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) 3aDiospyros kaki 3achemistry 3acornea 3acytokines 3adose response 3aethanol 3afluorescein 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterferon regulatory factors 3ainterferons 3amice 3apersimmons 3areporter genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aLee, Chung Hyun1 aKang, Tae Kyeom1 aYang, Sung Jae1 aLee, Chang Yong1 aLee, Wook-Bin1 aJung, Sang Hoon0 tApplied biological chemistry.g2020 Dec., v. 63, no. 1 p.45-45dSpringer SingaporewJournal:27084x2468-08347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-020-00529-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245009800178300001600276520099800292592002801290650001901318650001201337650001501349650001901364650001101383650001601394651002101410700002001431700002101451700002101472700002201493700002001515700002101535773010201556856008701658852000901745655001201754IND60084088420221119174819.0141101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008408842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez-Solas, Jorge10aMillennial-scale oscillations in the Southern Ocean in response to atmospheric CO₂ increase  ap. 128-136.  aA coupled climate-ice-sheet model is used to investigate the response of climate at the millennial time scale under several global warming long-term scenarios, stabilized at different levels ranging from 2 to 7 times the pre-industrial CO₂ level. The climate response is mainly analyzed in terms of changes in temperature, oceanic circulation, and ice-sheet behaviour. For the 4×CO₂ scenario, the climate response appears to be highly non-linear: abrupt transitions occur in the Southern Ocean deep water formation strength with a period of about 1200yr. These millennial oscillations do not occur for both lower and larger CO₂ levels. We show that these transitions are associated with internal oscillations of the Southern Ocean, triggered by the Antarctic freshwater budget. We first analyse the oscillatory mechanism. Secondly, through a series of 420 sensitivity experiments we also explore the range of temperature and freshwater flux for which such oscillations can be triggered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3afreshwater 3aglobal warming 3amodels 3atemperature 3aAntarctic region1 aCharbit, Sylvie1 aRamstein, Gilles1 aPaillard, Didier1 aDumas, Christophe1 aRitz, Catherine1 aRoche, Didier M.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 Apr., v. 76, no. 3-4 p.128-136dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245006700200500002000267520107200287592002801359596005901387596005901446596009601505650000801601650001501609650001401624650001101638650001701649650002601666700001501692700001201707700001701719700001401736700001601750700005201766773011401818856007901932852000902011655001202020IND60790619520221119184506.0220826e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079061952DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2022000702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8707-784910aMechanistic insights and implications of FOXO‐SNAI interplay  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAutophagy promotes both health and disease, depending on tissue types and genetic contexts, yet the regulatory mechanism remain incompletely understood. Our recent publication has uncovered a coherent FOXO‐SNAI feed‐forward loop in autophagy, which is evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to human. In addition, it's revealed that DNA binding plays a critical role in intracellular localization of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins. Based on these findings, herein we further integrate mechanistic insights of FOXO‐SNAI regulatory interplay in autophagy and unravel the potential link of FOXO‐induced autophagy with SNAI in diseases. Besides, the generality of DNA‐retention mechanism on transcription factor nuclear localization is illustrated with wide‐ranging discussion, and more functions potentially regulated by FOXO‐SNAI feedforward loop are provided. Elucidation of these unsolved paradigms will expand the understanding of FOXO‐SNAI interplay and facilitate the development of new therapeutics targeting FOXO‐SNAI axis in diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  a31970536cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a32000547cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2022XKQ0205cKey Project of Developmental Biology and Breeding from Hunan Province of China 3aDNA 3aDrosophila 3aautophagy 3ahumans 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factors1 aWu, Chenxi1 aPan, Yu1 aZhu, Xiaojie1 aPeng, Kai1 aMa, Xianjue1 aXue, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6947-84140 tBioEssays.g2022 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.e2200070-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2022000703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015200164300001600316520153200332592002801864650001101892650002601903650002701929650000901956650001001965650002101975650001801996650001402014650001502028650001702043650001202060650001802072650001102090650001202101650002202113650001502135650002602150650001802176650001602194700001702210700002002227700001902247700001602266700001702282773009702299856008102396852000902477655001202486IND60081698620221121064005.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008169862DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-014-0225-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, A F10aEffects of Methanolic Extracts of Annona Species on the Development and Reproduction of Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.

Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) causes significant losses in corn crops and necessitates the use of alternative control strategies, such as the application of bioinsecticides. We report the effect of methanolic leaf extracts of Annona dioica, Annona cacans, and Annona coriacea on the development and reproduction of S. frugiperda. A quantitative analysis was carried out to determine the total concentration of phenolics, flavonoids, and condensed tannin (CT) in leaf extracts. Corn leaves were immersed in a 1% methanolic leaf extract solution and fed to second instars of S. frugiperda. Leaf disks dipped in the synthetic insecticide Connect® (Bayer CropScience Ltda) composed of a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and a pyrethroid (β-cyfluthrin), which are harmful to S. frugiperda, was used as positive control. Distilled water was used as a negative control treatment. The leaf extract of A. coriacea decreased larval survivorship, arrested pupal development, and affected the weight gain of S. frugiperda. A. dioica also affected larval survivorship, but its effects were more pronounced for the adult stage, as fecundity, fertility, egg hatchability, and embryonic development were severely affected. Leaf extracts from A. cacans had no effect on S. frugiperda. The leaf extracts of A. dioica and A. coriacea showed a higher content of flavonoids and phenols, respectively. Our results indicated that both A. dioica and A. coriacea have the potential for development as botanical insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnona 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3abotanical insecticides 3acorn 3acrops 3aegg hatchability 3aembryogenesis 3afecundity 3aflavonoids 3aimidacloprid 3ainstars 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3aphenols 3apupal development 3apyrethrins 3aquantitative analysis 3asurvival rate 3aweight gain1 aPereira, F F1 aFormagio, A S N1 aLucchetta, J T1 aVieira, M C1 aMussury, R M0 tNeotropical entomology.g2014 Oct., v. 43, no. 5 p.446-452dSpringer-Verlagx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-014-0225-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006500168500001900233520156900252592002801821650001701849650001601866650002801882650002601910650002401936650002001960650001101980653002301991653001602014653002202030653002702052653003402079700002102113773011902134856008502253852000902338655001202347IND60736466820221116152825.0210610e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073646682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2021.1589572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaito, Tomoki10aGRAMD1-mediated accessible cholesterol sensing and transport  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCholesterol, an essential lipid for cell signaling and structural integrity of cellular membranes, is highly enriched in the plasma membrane (PM). However, the regulatory mechanisms that control its biosynthesis and uptake both reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Thus, the ER needs to constantly monitor the levels of PM cholesterol. This is in part mediated by regulated transport of a biochemically defined pool of cholesterol, termed “accessible” cholesterol, from the PM to the ER via evolutionarily conserved ER-anchored lipid transfer proteins, the GRAMD1s/Asters (GRAMD1a/1b/1c) (Lam/Ltc proteins in yeast). GRAMD1s possess cytosolically exposed GRAM domain and StART-like domain followed by a transmembrane ER anchor. They form homo- and hetero-meric complexes and move to the contacts formed between the ER and the PM by sensing a transient expansion of the accessible pool of cholesterol in the PM via the GRAM domain and facilitate its extraction and transport to the ER via the StART-like domain. The GRAMD1b GRAM domain possesses distinct, but synergistic sites, for recognizing accessible cholesterol and anionic lipids, including phosphatidylserine, within the PM. This property of the GRAM domain contributes to regulated tethering of the PM to ER membrane where GRAMD1s are anchored and fine-tunes StART-like domain-dependent accessible cholesterol transport. Thus, cells use GRAMD1s to sense the levels of cholesterol in the PM and regulate transport of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER in order to maintain cholesterol homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3acholesterol 3acholesterol homeostasis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aphosphatidylserines 3aplasma membrane 3ayeasts 0aPhosphatidylserine 0aGRAM domain 0aStART-like domain 0aMembrane contact sites 0aNon-vesicular lipid transport1 aSaheki, Yasunori0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 Aug., v. 1866, no. 8 p.158957-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2021.1589573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011600208300001600324500001900340500001100359520176000370592002802130596009802158650000802256650001702264650001502281650001702296650002502313650001502338650001802353650001202371650001202383650001402395650001902409650002902428650002002457700002302477700002802500700001802528700002002546700001702566700002102583700002102604773013302625856008202758852000902840655001202849IND60707145520221120205426.0200814e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070714552DNAL7 a10.1007/s40726-020-00150-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuong, Hung Cong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4732-344010aMembrane Distillation for Strategic Water Treatment Applications: Opportunities, Challenges, and Current Status  ap. 173-187.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Membrane distillation (MD) has been known as a promising water treatment process for many years. However, despite its advantages, MD has never been able to compete with other processes for industrial water treatment and supply. Instead, it has been orientated towards several unique strategic water treatment applications. This review aims to uncover the opportunities and technical challenges pertinent to the MD process and the current status of its strategic water treatment applications most notably including decentralised small-scale desalination for fresh water provision in remote areas, hybridisation with forward osmosis (FO) for treatment of challenging polluted waters, regeneration of liquid desiccant solutions for air conditioning, and treatment of acid effluents for beneficial reuse. RECENT FINDINGS: Pilot and small-scale MD systems have been demonstrated for decentralised desalination using various renewable energy sources to supply fresh water in remote, rural areas and on ships where other desalination processes are inefficient or unfeasible. For this strategic desalination application, MD is technically viable, but more works on configuration modification and process optimisation are required to reduce the process energy consumption and water production costs. For the three other strategic applications, the technical viability of the MD process has been proved by extensive lab-scale researches, but its economic feasibility is still questionable due to the lack of large-scale evaluation and the uncertain costs of MD systems. The orientation of MD towards strategic water treatment applications is clear. However, huge efforts are required to facilitate these applications at commercial and full scale.  aPublisher supplied data  a105.08-2019.08cVietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) 3aair 3adesalination 3adesiccants 3adistillation 3aeconomic feasibility 3afreshwater 3ahybridization 3aliquids 3aosmosis 3apollution 3aprocess energy 3arenewable energy sources 3awater treatment1 aAnsari, Ashley Joy1 aHailemariam, Ruth Habte1 aWoo, Yun Chul1 aPham, Thao Manh1 aNgo, Lan Thi1 aDao, Duong Thanh1 aNghiem, Long Duc0 tCurrent pollution reports.g2020 Sept., v. 6, no. 3 p.173-187dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:23512x2198-65927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40726-020-00150-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03794naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245018400169500001900353520164600372592002802018650000802046650002102054650001502075650001902090650001002109650001002119650001802129650001602147650003002163650002702193653001002220653000802230653001502238653000802253653000702261653000702268653000902275653000902284653000802293653001002301653000802311653001002319653000702329653000702336653000702343653000702350653000702357653000702364653000802371653000802379653000802387653000902395653000902404653000902413653000902422653000902431653000902440653000902449653000902458653000902467653000902476653000902485653002902494653002202523700002202545700002502567700002202592700001802614700001702632700002002649700001902669700002302688700001602711773011902727856008502846852000902931655001202940IND60736467120221116152827.0210610e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073646712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2021.1589632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiura, Hiroaki10aClofibric acid increases molecular species of phosphatidylethanolamine containing arachidonic acid for biogenesis of peroxisomal membranes in peroxisome proliferation in the liver  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe biogenesis of peroxisomes in relation to the trafficking of proteins to peroxisomes has been extensively examined. However, the supply of phospholipids, which is needed to generate peroxisomal membranes in mammals, remains unclear. Therefore, we herein investigated metabolic alterations induced by clofibric acid, a peroxisome proliferator, in the synthesis of phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecular species, and their relationship with the biogenesis of peroxisomal membranes. The subcutaneous administration of clofibric acid to rats at a relatively low dose (130 mg/kg) once a day time-dependently and gradually increased the integrated perimeter of peroxisomes per 100 μm² hepatocyte cytoplasm (PA). A strong correlation was observed between the content (μmol/mg DNA) of PE containing arachidonic acid (20:4) and PA (r² = 0.9168). Moreover, the content of PE containing octadecenoic acid (18:1) positively correlated with PA (r² = 0.8094). The treatment with clofibric acid markedly accelerated the formation of 16:0–20:4 PE by increasing the production of 20:4 and the activity of acyl chain remodeling of pre-existing PE molecular species. Increases in the acyl chain remodeling of PE by clofibric acid were mainly linked to the up-regulated expression of the Lpcat3 gene. On the other hand, clofibric acid markedly increased the formation of palmitic acid (16:0)–18:1 PE through de novo synthesis. These results suggest that the enhanced formation of particular PE molecular species is related to increases in the mass of peroxisomal membranes in peroxisome proliferation in the liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aarachidonic acid 3abiogenesis 3aclofibric acid 3agenes 3aliver 3apalmitic acid 3aperoxisomes 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3asubcutaneous injection 0aAGPAT 0aCDP 0aclofibrate 0aDAG 0aER 0aGP 0aGPAT 0aHPLC 0aLPC 0aLPCAT 0aLPE 0aLPEAT 0aNA 0aPA 0aPC 0aPE 0aPI 0aPS 0aSCD 0aTAG 0aTLC 0a16:0 0a16:1 0a18:0 0a18:1 0a18:2 0a18:3 0a20:3 0a20:4 0a20:5 0a22:5 0a22:6 0aPhosphatidylethanolamine 0aMolecular species1 aMizuguchi, Hiroki1 aAmano-Iwashita, Mino1 aMaeda-Kogure, Rie1 aNegishi, Akio1 aSakai, Ayako1 aToyama, Tomoaki1 aKawai, Hiroshi1 aMitsumoto, Atsushi1 aKudo, Naomi0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 Aug., v. 1866, no. 8 p.158963-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2021.1589633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015500159300001800314520166900332592002802001650001202029650001402041650001502055650001602070650002102086650001502107650001502122650001402137650001402151650001702165650001102182650001302193650001102206650001102217650001502228651001202243700002302255773009402278856007302372852000902445655001202454IND60408515120221119084837.0150905e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851512DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.105182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWells, Corey M.12aA hydrologic assessment of a saline‐spring fen in the Athabasca oil sands region, Alberta, Canada – a potential analogue for oil sands reclamation  ap. 4533-4548.  aCanada's post‐mined oil sands will have a higher concentration of salts compared with freshwater peatlands that dominate the landscape. While rare, naturally occurring saline wetlands do exist in Alberta's Boreal Plains and may function as analogues for reclamation, however, little is known about their hydrology. This paper investigates the geochemical and hydrologic characteristics of a natural saline‐spring peatland in Alberta's oil sands region. The fen is located within a saline groundwater discharge area connected to the erosional edge of the Grand Rapids Formation. Na⁺ (195–25,680 mgl⁻¹) and Cl⁻ (1785–56,249 mg l⁻¹) were the dominant salts, and the fen transitioned sharply to freshwater along its margins because in part of subsurface mineral ridges that restricted shallow groundwater exchange. Salinity decreased from hypersaline to brackish along the local groundwater flow path but no active spring outlets were observed over the two‐year study. Vertical groundwater discharge was minimal because of the very low permeability of the underlying sediments. Subsurface storage was exceeded during periods of high flow, resulting in flooding and surface runoff that was enhanced by the ephemerally connected pond network. These findings have implications for reclamation, as mechanisms such as subsurface mineral ridges may function as effective saline groundwater‐control structures in the post‐mined environment. Incorporating saline wetlands into regional monitoring networks will help to better quantify natural discharge, which has implications for belowground wastewater storage related to in situ bitumen extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3achlorides 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3aoil sands 3apeatlands 3apermeability 3arunoff 3asalinity 3asodium 3aspring 3awastewater 3aAlberta1 aPrice, Jonathan S.0 tHydrological processes.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 29, no. 20 p.4533-4548dWileyx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.105183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016100164300001600325520108500341592002801426650001101454650002101465650001301486650001901499650002201518650001901540650001801559650001501577653003301592653001801625653001501643653001901658653002601677700001501703700001501718700001501733700001601748700001801764700001501782700001801797700001401815700006001829773010101889856008501990852000902075655001202084IND60688977420221122112004.0210212e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068897742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.04.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Diben10aControllable synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles embedded holey reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite as a high-performance anode for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 774-781.  aEmbedding metal oxide nanoparticles with high theoretical capacity into graphene-based substrate in a controllable manner is a promising strategy to explore high-performance electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. In this work, a facile and eco-friendly in situ etching route is developed to prepare ZnO nanoparticles embedded holey reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite with a well-controlled structure. The formation mechanism of ZnO nanoparticles and in situ etched holes are proposed and discussed. The nanocomposite exhibits excellent rate capability, high specific capacity as well as long cycling stability. It is found that the synergetic effects between etching-engineered optimal holes in rGO sheets and embedded ZnO nanoparticles around the holes are responsible for the superior electrochemical properties. This work offers a facile etching strategy to prepare the nanocomposite of metal oxide nanoparticles embedded holey graphene-based supports, and demonstrates a promising electrode architecture to construct high-performance anode for lithium-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3alithium batteries 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3azinc oxide 0aHoley reduced graphene oxide 0aEtching route 0aZinc oxide 0aAnode material 0aLithium-ion batteries1 aWu, Huijie1 aNiu, Yubin1 aWang, Chao1 aChen, Zhuan1 aOuyang, Yirui1 aWang, Shuo1 aLi, Hongliang1 aLi, Rosa,1 aZhang, Lian Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2281-67940 tPowder technology.g2020 May 01, v. 367 p.774-781dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.04.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016200167300001800329520116000347592002801507650002201535650002201557650002201579650001301601650001601614650002701630650001401657650002301671650002501694650002301719650001101742650002501753650001901778650001401797650001901811650002401830650001801854650001501872650003401887650002301921650002101944700001701965700002301982700002102005700002302026773013302049856008202182852000902264655001202273IND60675129920221119033101.0191104e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067512992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-019-01565-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamal, Tahseen10aMicrowave Assisted Synthesis and Carboxymethyl Cellulose Stabilized Copper Nanoparticles on Bacterial Cellulose Nanofibers Support for Pollutants Degradation  ap. 2867-2877.  aBacterial cellulose (BC), a green biopolymer synthesized by certain bacteria, has been widely used for supporting different metal or their oxide nanoparticles which were utilized for different purposes. In this article, we report on using BC as a support for transition metal nanoparticles for catalysis purpose of organic pollutants. BC was synthesized using Gluconacetobacter xylinum. Then the copper (Cu) nanoparticles were synthesized by a quick procedure of microwave heating of the CuSO₄ and hydrazine mixed aqueous solution in the presence of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Typically, 10 μL suspension of the CMC stabilized Cu nanoparticles was coated on the BC nanofibers (CMC-Cu-BC) and further used for the catalytic reductions of methylene blue, 4-nitrophenol and in their mixed solution by sodium borohydride. All the samples were also characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and field emission scanning electron microscope. Our finding suggests that supported Cu nanoparticles catalyst performance was slower than its suspension. However, the ease of separation of the supported CMC-Cu-BC was appealing to be used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGluconacetobacter 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaqueous solutions 3abacteria 3abiopolymers 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose nanofibers 3achemical reduction 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3acopper sulfate 3ahydrazine 3amethylene blue 3amicrowave treatment 3ap-nitrophenol 3apollutants 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asodium borohydride 3athermogravimetry1 aAhmad, Ikram1 aKhan, Sher Bahadar1 aUl-Islam, Mazhar1 aAsiri, Abdullah M.0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2019 Dec., v. 27, no. 12 p.2867-2877dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870065x1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-019-01565-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005100139245011100190500002000301520103200321592002801353596006301381650002301444650003101467650001201498650002901510650001401539650001201553650001401565650001201579650002101591650001901612650001401631650001601645650001001661651001001671700001501681700001701696700001501713773011601728856007401844852000901918655001201927IND60790620020221119184750.0220826e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079062002DNAL7 a10.1111/efp.127582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0321-476010aFunctional characterization of Melampsora larici‐populina Hog1‐type MAPK in response to osmotic stress  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe obligate biotrophic pathogen Melampsora larici‐populina, responsible for poplar foliar rust disease, causes annual epidemics and severe damages to poplar plantations worldwide. Flexible responses to external osmotic pressure changes are important for the growth and survival of pathogens. In a previous study, we suggested that the Hog1‐type MAPK MlpHog1 in M. larici‐populina may play a role in infectious growth and responses to various environmental stresses. In the present study, we analysed its biological characteristics. MlpHog1 displayed a conserved coding sequence pattern among five strains from different regions of China. MlpHog1 restored the Hog1‐orthologue mutant defects responding to hyperosmotic stress in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Magnaporthe oryzae. Transient expression in wheat protoplasts revealed that MlpHog1 is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. These results indicate that MlpHog1 plays a positive role in responding to osmotic stress in the poplar rust M. larici‐populina.  aPublisher supplied data  a31870630cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aMelampsora larici-populina 3aPopulus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acytoplasm 3aforests 3aleaf rust 3amutants 3aosmotic pressure 3aosmotic stress 3apathogens 3aprotoplasts 3awheat 3aChina1 aYang, Bing1 aChen, Kaiyue1 aLiu, Yifei0 tForest pathology.g2022 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.e12758-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.127583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001400295520204200309592002802351650002002379650001702399650001902416650002102435650001602456650002102472650002002493650001102513650002102524650001702545650001402562650002202576650001202598650001302610650002102623650001002644650001702654651001202671653002402683653001602707653001202723653001702735653002502752653002702777700002002804700002202824700001802846773011402864856008502978852000903063655001203072IND60542598720221121151440.0190403e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054259872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöster, Kajar10aDead wood basic density, and the concentration of carbon and nitrogen for main tree species in managed hemiboreal forests  ap. 35-42.  aForest ecosystems are an important carbon (C) pool, and the decomposition of dead wood plays a key role in its C cycle. Based on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories were established. Nations that have signed the agreements are encouraged to quantify C pools and fluxes in their forests, including its proportion occurring as dead wood. There are significant differences in density and C concentration of dead wood among tree species. In managed hemiboreal forests of Estonia the dead wood density, and C and N concentration changes in different decay classes for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), silver and downy birch (Betula pendula Roth. and Betula pubescens Ehrh.), black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.), grey alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench.) and European aspen (Populus tremula L.) have been assessed. All together 548 sample discs taken from logs (measurements were restricted to fallen dead trees only) were collected. The results revealed a decrease in mean dead wood density with progressing decay state for all studied tree species. Pine, spruce and grey alder had the smallest wood density reduction with progressing decay state, retaining 37%, 30%, and 36% of initial density, respectively. Other broadleaved tree species (birch, black alder and aspen) had the greatest density reduction during decomposition, retaining 24%, 23%, and 16% of initial density, respectively. For all studied tree species there were no significant differences of wood density between sites with different moisture conditions (dry, medium or wet areas). In case of pine, spruce and birch the C concentrations were significantly affected by the decay class, while in case of both alders and aspen the C concentrations were not significantly affected by changes in decay classes. For all the assessed tree species the N concentration in dead wood was increasing with increasing decay class.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aAlnus incana 3aBetula pendula 3aBetula pubescens 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aPopulus tremula 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3acarbon sinks 3adead wood 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3atrees 3awood density 3aEstonia 0aCoarse woody debris 0aDecay stage 0aEstonia 0aWood density 0aCarbon concentration 0aNitrogen concentration1 aMetslaid, Marek1 aEngelhart, Jeroen1 aKöster, Egle0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 354 p.35-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012300170300001600293520097400309592002801283650000901311650002201320650000901342650002401351650001801375650001501393650002001408650001301428650001001441653002301451653001801474653002301492653001401515653002401529700005701553700005901610773010101669856008501770852000901855655001201864IND60688977520221122112051.0210212e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068897752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.04.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Subhnit K.12aA review on the enrichment of iron values of low-grade Iron ore resources using reduction roasting-magnetic separation  ap. 796-808.  aThe beneficiation of low-grade iron ores to meet the growing demand for iron and steel is an important research topic. However, certain ores do not qualify to be treated in physical separation processes, and hence, alternative strategies are being looked into for upgrading their iron content. The objective of this review article is to compile and amalgamate the crucial information regarding the beneficiation of low-grade iron ores using carbothermic reduction followed by magnetic separation, which is a promising technique to treat iron ores with complex mineralogy and liberation issues. Reduction roasting studies done for different types low-grade iron ores including oolitic iron ores, banded iron ores, iron ore slimes and tailings, and industrial wastes have been discussed. The large scale technological advancements in reduction roasting and the possibilities of the application of alternative reductants as substitutes for coal have also been highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aindustrial wastes 3airon 3amagnetic separation 3amine tailings 3amineralogy 3areducing agents 3aroasting 3asteel 0aLow-grade iron ore 0aBeneficiation 0aReduction roasting 0aMicrowave 0aMagnetic separation1 aNayak, Deepak1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2345-38411 aRath, Swagat S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9441-46820 tPowder technology.g2020 May 01, v. 367 p.796-808dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.04.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014000165300001600305520131600321592002801637650000801665650001401673650001201687650001301699650001901712650000901731650001601740650002401756650003701780700002301817700001901840700002401859700002201883700002101905773015201926856008102078852000902159655001202168IND60624214520221120144137.0181202e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062421452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-005-2458-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamai, Masato10aTransmission electron microscopic observation of a metastable phase on the thermal decomposition process of Ca-deficient hydroxyapatite  ap. 525-530.  aCalcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (Ca-def HAp) decomposes to stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (HAp) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) at high temperature. In a previous study, we reported that a metastable phase with a high Ca/P molar ratio appeared in the temperature range from 700 to 800°C. In the present study, the formation process of a metastable phase and the crystallographic relationship between the Ca-rich metastable phase and HAp matrix were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Ca-def HAp was annealed at 600–850°C for 2 or 6 h in air. TEM observations were performed before and after annealing Ca-def HAp. Based on analysis of image of Ca-def HAp before annealing, several HAp crystals with different aspect ratios agglomerated. The metastable phases grew thicker by long-term annealing. HRTEM image suggested that the Ca-rich metastable phase was formed by migration to the interface and continuous accumulation of calcium ions from HAp crystals with a small aspect ratio. From HRTEM images and results of the analysis of selected area electron diffraction patterns along the [010], [110] and [001] zone axes, lattice constants of the metastable phases were determined to be a = 2.86 nm, b = 0.94 nm, and c = 0.69 nm with orthorhombic crystals system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aannealing 3acalcium 3acrystals 3ahydroxyapatite 3aions 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aIsshiki, Toshiyuki1 aNishio, Kōji,1 aNakamura, Mitsuhiro1 aNakahira, Atsushi1 aEndoh, Hisamitsu0 tJournal of materials science.g2006 Jan., v. 41, no. 2 p.525-530dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-005-2458-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245015100164520103700315592002801352650001401380650001701394650001201411650001601423650002101439650001701460650001501477650001301492650002101505650001301526650001501539650001101554650002501565650001201590653004101602653002701643653002901670653002201699700001401721700001201735773010601747856008701853852000901940655001201949IND60768916520221121062255.0220412e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076891652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1269142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Bin12aA continuous-flow non-aerated microalgal-bacterial granular sludge process for aquaculture wastewater treatment under natural day-night conditions  aThis study developed a continuous-flow non-aerated microalgal-bacterial granular tubular reactor for aquaculture wastewater treatment under natural day-night conditions. Results showed that daytime was favorable for ammonia removal while nighttime for nitrate removal. Over 99% of nitrite-N could be removed over the day-night cycles at a hydraulic retention time of 6 h. However, the phosphorus removal was found to be sensitive to the weather condition, ranging from 35.0% to 96.6%. It was also observed that dissolved oxygen produced by microalgae in daytime was sufficient for creating a 6-h aerobic condition in nighttime for sustaining heterotrophic activity. Chlorella and Leptolyngbya were identified as the most abundant algae related to weather changes. Metagenomics analysis revealed that the high nitrite removal relied mainly on nitrite reduction. These experimental findings offer new insights into the non-aerated microalgal-bacterial granular sludge for environmentally sustainable aquaculture wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aLeptolyngbya 3aammonia 3aaquaculture 3adissolved oxygen 3ametagenomics 3amicroalgae 3anitrates 3anitrite nitrogen 3anitrites 3aphosphorus 3asludge 3awastewater treatment 3aweather 0aMicroalgal-bacterial granular sludge 0aAquaculture wastewater 0aNatural day-night cycles 0aNitrite reduction1 aFan, Siqi1 aLiu, Yu0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Apr., v. 350 p.126914-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1269143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005600154245007700210300001400287520079500301592002801096650001801124650001301142650001501155650001201170650001601182650002201198650002601220650004101246650001401287650001101301653001501312653001801327653002701345653006001372653001901432700002101451700002201472700003101494700002101525773009901546856008901645852000901734655001201743IND60568571020221122113425.0181012e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056857102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2017.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBale, Nicole1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9118-389012aA method for quantifying heterocyst glycolipids in biomass and sediments  ap. 33-35.  aHeterocyst glycolipids (HGs) are biomarkers for heterocystous N2-fixing cyanobacteria and consist of a sugar moiety bound to an even numbered C26–C32 alkyl chain, containing various alcohol or ketone groups. They have been reported in ancient sediments but, due to a lack of standards, they were quantified in terms of integrated peak area response. Here we describe the use of a commercially available glycolipid (n-dodecyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) as an internal standard (IS) for reliable quantitative analysis. The common HG 1-(O-hexose)-3,25-hexacosanediol was isolated using both normal and reversed phase chromatography and used to assess the relative response factor compared with the IS, allowing correction of difference in mass spectral response between the IS and the target HGs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aalcohols 3abiomarkers 3abiomass 3aglycolipids 3anitrogen fixation 3aquantitative analysis 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asediments 3asugars 0aHeterocyst 0aCyanobacteria 0aHeterocyst glycolipids 0aSemi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography 0aQuantification1 ade Vries, Steven1 aHopmans, Ellen C.1 aSinninghe Damsté, Jaap S.1 aSchouten, Stefan0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2017 Aug., v. 110 p.33-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2017.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015600156300001600312520131300328592002801641650002001669650001901689650004101708650001601749650001601765650001601781650002001797650000701817650002301824650002501847650001801872650002301890650001601913700001401929773012501943856007402068852000902142655001202151IND60656706520221123021506.0190814e20131219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065670652DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41414k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Haiyan10aDetermination of root exudative phenolic compounds in hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) by polydimethylsiloxane tube microextraction after derivatization  ap. 569-574.  aPolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tube microextraction for the determination of 2,3-dimethylphenol (2,3-DMP), 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (2,6-DTBP) and 4,4′-(1-methylethyliden)bisphenol (4,4′-(1-M)BP) in root exudates of hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was studied by optimizing derivatization and extraction conditions.

Recoveries ranging from 85.7 to 103.9% and the RSD below 7.9% were obtained when optimized method was applied to determine 2,3-DMP, 2,6-DTBP and 4,4′-(1-M)BP for 15 and 30 days' root hydroponic solution of hot pepper. The developed method is rapid, simple and inexpensive and offers high sensitivity, good reproducibility and satisfactory recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aderivatization 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahot peppers 3ahydroponics 3aiso-octanes 3amicroextraction 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3aroot exudates 3astandard deviation 3atemperature1 aWang, Yan0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Dec. 19, v. 6, no. 2 p.569-574dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41414k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245016100189300001600350520093300366592002801299650002001327650002001347650001501367650000901382650001201391650001601403650002801419650001101447650001501458650000901473650001301482650001201495650000901507650003801516650002301554650002401577650002101601650004301622650005901665651001101724651001101735653001201746653002001758653001401778700002101792700002301813773008801836856008401924852000902008655001202017IND60086731720221117230728.0160903e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673172DNAL7 a234347742pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDepew, David C.10aModelling mercury concentrations in prey fish: Derivation of a national-scale common indicator of dietary mercury exposure for piscivorous fish and wildlife  ap. 234-243.  aThe National Descriptive Model for Mercury in Fish (NDMMF) was applied to a Canada – wide dataset of fish mercury (Hg) concentrations to derive a common indicator of dietary methylmercury (MeHg) exposure (HgPREY) to piscivorous fish and wildlife. The NDMMF provided unbiased parameter estimates and strong spatial biases in prediction error were not apparent. Prediction error was comparatively higher when sample sizes were small and events with high Hg concentrations. Estimates of HgPREY from 1936 locations between 1990 and 2010 averaged 0.09 ± 0.07 μg g−1 (wet wt) and increased from west to east in a manner consistent with independent measures of MeHg exposure in piscivorous wildlife and conceptual models of aquatic ecosystem sensitivity to Hg methylation and bioaccumulation.

Where the disease occurs, Eucalyptus spp. are non‐native and the native hosts of the pathogen have not been conclusively determined. The chance discovery of C. deuterocubensis on native Melastoma malabathricum growing in the understory of Eucalyptus trees in Indonesia raised the possibility that this woody shrub could be a native host of C. deuterocubensis, which would then have undergone a host jump to Eucalyptus. Four populations of C. deuterocubensis were collected from cankers on Eucalyptus and Melastoma trees in Indonesia and Malaysia. These were subjected to population genetic analyses using microsatellite markers. The genetic diversity for isolates in all four populations was relatively low (H¯ = 0.166–0.316) and unlikely to represent a native source. The maximum percentage of genotypic diversity was high for all four populations (Gₘₐₓ = 60.0–71.5%) irrespective of the host. Structure analyses and haplotype networks showed no structure related to the host plant species. Overall, the results failed to provide evidence that the indigenous M. malabathricum is the native host or origin of C. deuterocubensis infections on the Eucalyptus trees studied.  aPublisher supplied data  cTree Protection Co‐operative Programme, University of Pretoria 3aChrysoporthe 3aEucalyptus 3aMelastoma malabathricum 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahost plants 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3ashrubs 3aunderstory 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia1 aMarincowitz, Seonju1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4726-12111 aWingfield, Brenda D.1 aWingfield, Michael J.,0 tForest pathology.g2022 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.e12762-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.127623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009400172300001400266520144700280592002801727650002101755650001201776650002501788650001301813650001901826650001301845650001301858650001301871650001601884650001601900650001601916650002001932651000901952700002701961700002101988773009902009856008702108852000902195655001202204IND60084089420221119174739.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008408942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz, Henry F.10aChanges in the vertical profiles of mean temperature and humidity in the Hawaiian Islands  ap. 21-25.  aRecent drought and warmer than normal temperatures affecting the Hawaiian Islands have raised concern among natural resource managers that impacts associated with global warming are becoming manifest in the region. A number of studies published over the past few decades have documented changes in the climate of Hawai'i that are generally consistent with expectations from climate change projections, such as those found in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report (IPCC, 2007). In this study we examine a suite of climate variables that are important from the point of view of ecosystem impacts, but that also relate to societal concerns such Island water resources. Our results are consistent with previous studies in showing a significant warming trend, especially evident at higher elevations. In particular, we document a decrease in the frequency of occurrence of freezing temperatures in the upper slopes of the higher terrain on Maui and the Big Island and a concomitant rise in the freezing level surface in the region that is in good agreement with analogous studies done for other mountainous areas of the world. Temperatures at standard reference surfaces in the free atmosphere have warmed throughout the troposphere, with a maximum near the 850mb level. The warming peak at this level could be associated with an increased frequency of occurrence and/or lowering of the trade wind inversion layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3adrought 3aenvironmental impact 3afreezing 3aglobal warming 3ahumidity 3amanagers 3asurfaces 3atemperature 3atrade winds 3atroposphere 3awater resources 3aMaui1 aGiambelluca, Thomas W.1 aEischeid, Jon K.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 May, v. 77, no. 1-2 p.21-25dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01589naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245004800174300001400222520049200236592002800728650002400756650002300780650001300803650001400816650001400830650002000844653002800864653002200892653001400914653002400928700002000952700002500972700002100997773009901018856008901117852000901206655001201215IND60568571220221121074429.0181012e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056857122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2017.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnowdon, L.

The herbaceous pollen signal is difficult to interpret in paleoecological analysis as pollen presence is often rare for individual herb taxa. Indices of association have previously been used to determine association from over- and under-representation; however, previous surveys have used spatially limited single-source areas. Indices of Association (IOA) between pollen and plant presence at increasing distance from the pollen source, to 50 m, are presented in a new spatially extended IOA (SEIOA) method. For several pollen taxa, including Plantago lanceolata, Ranunculus acris-type, Rumex and the Cichorioideae family, association increased progressively, when plants at greater distance were included in the calculation, and over-representation was reduced. Other taxa become increasingly under-represented at the landscape scale, e.g., Filipendula, Apiaceae, Cerastium indicating true ultra-local source areas. A weak association and increasing under-representation indices, cautions that pollen absence of these types in paleoecological analysis is not a secure indicator of plant absence. Extended IOA values can aid the interpretation of the rare-type pollen spectra in paleoecological analyses. The method shows potential for developing individual pollen source areas (iPSAs) for herbaceous pollen types. These iPSAs together with the probability of correct application, determined by accuracy and association scores, are useful when applying pollen correction factors in pollen-derived vegetation community and landscape models. Further indices and significance testing are suggested to enhance understanding of the association and the rate of correct classification. The results can assist both interpretation of community composition from the herbaceous pollen spectra in local-scale paleoecological studies, and understanding the limits to this interpretation in paleoecological analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApiaceae 3aCerastium 3aFilipendula 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aRanunculus 3aRumex 3acommunity structure 3ahighlands 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amosses and liverworts 3apaleoecology 3aplant communities 3apollen 3apollen sampling 3aprobability 3asurveys 3aUnited Kingdom 0aHerbaceous pollen 0aPollen dispersal, 0aIndices of Association 0aSpatially extended Indices of Association 0aIndividual Pollen Source areas1 aWhyte, Ian0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2020 Aug., v. 279 p.104238-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2020.1042383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008000170500001900250520142100269592002801690650001801718650001201736650001501748650001201763700002201775773011201797856008501909852000901994655001202003IND60736467820221116150919.0210603e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073646782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2021.1024562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAggestam, Filip14aThe art of the “green” deal: Policy pathways for the EU Forest Strategy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe European Green Deal is being promoted as the cornerstone of European policy over the next five years. One of the many actions planned under the Green Deal is the third EU Forest Strategy. The objective for this commentary is to discuss whether and how the Green Deal may affect the next EU Forest Strategy. Using the pathways to sustainability approach, we discuss alternative pathways for the next Strategy. We do this by reviewing the Green Deal and a series of different statements put out by representative organisations; we also draw some important insights from previous scientific work on the preceding Strategies. We find that the Green Deal hardly gives any consideration to the multiple benefits forests provide to society and how the forest-based sector could contribute to the Green Deal. The scientific literature provides several potential policy pathways related to coordinating policy objectives, forest governance, cost impacts, data accessibility, harmonisation, knowledge production and communication. However, given the current narratives around forests in the Green Deal, many of the problems that have been articulated by forest policy researchers over the last 20 to 30 years, such as lack of coordination and integration remain the same. We end by discussing potential pathways to overcome these challenges which ultimately may deliver the long-awaited common strategic vison on forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest policy 3aforests 3agovernance 3asociety1 aGiurca, Alexandru0 tForest policy and economics.g2021 July, v. 128 p.102456-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2021.1024563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245008400197300001800281506007600299520171100375592002802086506003702114650001502151650001702166650000902183650002602192650002102218650000902239650001502248650002202263650001802285650001702303650002102320650001402341650001702355650001202372651001502384700002002399700001902419700001802438773011702456856007402573852000902647655001202656IND60408515720221207051547.0150905e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851572DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.135962doi7 aPMC48580342pmcid7 a263087382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHague, D.W.10aRisk Factors and Outcomes in Cats with Acquired Myasthenia Gravis (2001–2012)  ap. 1307-1312.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) in cats most commonly causes generalized weakness without megaesophagus and is more often associated with a cranial mediastinal mass, compared to dogs. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To extend the clinical findings described in the report of 2000 on MG in cats (J Am Vet Med Assoc 215:55–57). ANIMALS: Two hundred and thirty‐five cats with MG. METHODS: Retrospective case study to evaluate the long‐term outcome and incidence of spontaneous remission in myasthenic cats. Information including signalment, clinical presentation, presence of and type of cranial mediastinal mass, treatment including surgical versus medical, survival time, and outcome including spontaneous remissions was collected and analyzed in cats diagnosed at the Comparative Neuromuscular Laboratory, University of California San Diego by detection of acetylcholine receptor antibody titers >0.3 nmol/L by immunoprecipitation radioimmunosassay. RESULTS: Acquired MG in cats is associated with a euthanasia rate of 58%. Abyssinian and Somali cats had an increased incidence of MG compared to mixed breed cats or cats of other breeds. A cranial mediastinal mass, most commonly thymoma, was observed in 52% of the cats, which is higher than in the previous report. Spontaneous remission is not a characteristic of MG in cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Myasthenia gravis in cats is a chronic disease associated with a high incidence of a cranial mediastinal mass. Spontaneous remission is not common and clinicians should warn owners of the necessity for long‐term treatment. The clinical outcome with a cranial mediastinal mass did not differ between surgical or medical treatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3acase studies 3acats 3acholinergic receptors 3achronic diseases 3adogs 3aeuthanasia 3amedical treatment 3amegaesophagus 3amixed breeds 3aprecipitin tests 3aremission 3arisk factors 3athymoma 3aCalifornia1 aHumphries, H.D.1 aMitchell, M.A.1 aShelton, G.D.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2015 Sept., v. 29, no. 5 p.1307-1312dJ.B.

Although it is clear that hBest1's interactions with lipids are crucial for its function such studies were not performed as the protein was not purified. Here we describe an effective purification of hBest1 from Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells via simple gel-filtration and affinity chromatographic steps, which makes possible to probe the protein interplay with lipids. The interaction of the purified hBest1 with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) was studied in Langmuir monolayers. The surface pressure (π)–area (A) isotherms and compression/expansion isocycles of POPC monolayer were recorded in absence and presence of hBest1 in the subphase. The π(A) isotherms were analyzed in terms of surface compressional modulus and via two-dimensional virial equation of state. The dilatational rheological properties of the surface films and their surface potential were also measured. The morphology of the films was observed by Brewster angle microscopy. The inclusion of the protein in the film subphase does not lead to in-depth penetration of hBest1 but interaction takes place in the headgroup region of the monolayer. The hBest1/POPC interaction resulted in formation of more condensed films, which rheological properties and lateral structure differed significantly from the pure POPC monolayers. Our study sheds light on the still unclear question how hBest1 gets in touch with biomembrane phospholipids of eukaryotic cells that might be of key importance for the proper structure and function of RPE biomembranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3achromatography 3acolloids 3adogs 3aepithelium 3aequations 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amicroscopy 3aphospholipids 3arheological properties 0ahBest1 0aPOPC 0aLangmuir monolayers 0aBAM 0aLipid–protein interactions 0aMDCK cells1 aPetrova, Svetla D.1 aGeorgiev, Georgi As.1 aMoskova-Doumanova, Veselina1 aLalchev, Zdravko1 aDoumanov, Jordan A.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 122 p.432-438dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.01.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012900172300001400301520136500315592002801680650001601708650002101724650001601745650001401761650001101775650002601786650001601812650001601828650001601844650001601860650002001876650001301896650001401909650001501923650002301938653005501961653002802016653001602044653001602060653001502076700002002091700002102111700001802132700002502150773009202175856008502267852000902352655001202361IND60552118620221120225103.0161020e20150620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055211862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorelli, Sabrina10aOsteogenic and osteoclastogenic differentiation of co-cultured cells in polylactic acid–nanohydroxyapatite fiber scaffolds  ap. 53-62.  aThe design of bone substitutes involves the creation of a microenvironment supporting molecular cross-talk between cells and scaffolds during tissue formation and remodelling. Bone remodelling process includes the cooperation of bone-building cells and bone-resorbing cells.In this paper we developed polylactic acid (PLA) and composite PLA-nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) scaffolds with 20 and 50wt.% of nHA by electrospinning technique to be used in bone tissue engineering. The developed scaffolds have different fiber diameter, porosity with interconnected pores and mechanical properties. Taking cues from the bone environment features we investigated the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from bone marrow in osteoblasts and the osteoclastogenesis in the developed scaffolds in homotypic and in co-culture up to 46 days.PLA and composite PLA–nHA scaffolds induced osteogenic and osteoclastogenic differentiation. Both osteoblasts and osteoclasts displayed high expression of specific markers (osteopontin, osteocalcin, RANK, RANKL) and functions such as secretion of ALP, cathepsin K and TRAP activity on composite scaffolds especially on PLA–nHA containing 20wt.% of nHA. The heterotypic interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts co-cultured in the developed scaffolds triggered their functional differentiation and activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone marrow 3abone substitutes 3acathepsin K 3acoculture 3ahumans 3amechanical properties 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aosteoclasts 3aosteopontin 3apolylactic acid 3aporosity 3asecretion 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 0aPolylactic acid-nanohydroxyapatite fiber scaffolds 0aBone tissue engineering 0aOsteoblasts 0aOsteoclasts 0aCo-culture1 aSalerno, Simona1 aHolopainen, Jani1 aRitala, Mikko1 aDe Bartolo, Loredana0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 June 20, v. 204 p.53-62dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002600189245009100215300001600306520103100322592002801353650001101381650001401392650001701406650002101423650001001444650001901454650001501473650001801488650002901506650002601535700001601561700002401577700001901601700001601620700001701636700001801653773009001671856008201761990002301843852000901866655001201875IND60092897120221121022250.0141103e20130905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009289712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2013.06.0182doi7 aPMC38566892pmcid7 a240123692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFolgueras, Alicia R.,10aArchitectural Niche Organization by LHX2 Is Linked to Hair Follicle Stem Cell Function  ap. 314-327.  aIn adult skin, self-renewing, undifferentiated hair follicle stem cells (HF-SCs) reside within a specialized niche, where they spend prolonged times as a single layer of polarized, quiescent epithelial cells. When sufficient activating signals accumulate, HF-SCs become mobilized to fuel tissue regeneration and hair growth. Here, we show that architectural organization of the HF-SC niche by transcription factor LHX2 plays a critical role in HF-SC behavior. Using genome-wide chromatin and transcriptional profiling of HF-SCs in vivo, we show that LHX2 directly transactivates genes that orchestrate cytoskeletal dynamics and adhesion. Conditional ablation of LHX2 results in gross cellular disorganization and HF-SC polarization within the niche. LHX2 loss leads to a failure to maintain HF-SC quiescence and hair anchoring, as well as progressive transformation of the niche into a sebaceous gland. These findings suggest that niche organization underlies the requirement for LHX2 in hair follicle structure and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achromatin 3acytoskeleton 3aepithelial cells 3agenes 3ahair follicles 3astem cells 3atissue repair 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aGuo, Xingyi1 aPasolli, H. Amalia1 aStokes, Nicole1 aPolak, Lisa1 aZheng, Deyou1 aFuchs, Elaine0 tCell stem cell.g2013 Sept. 5, v. 13, no. 3 p.314-327dElsevier Inc.x1934-59097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2013.06.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245011600161300001800277500001400295520155500309592002801864650002701892650002601919650002101945650001801966650001201984650001801996650002302014650001202037650001302049650001702062650000902079650003002088650001902118653002002137653002302157653001702180653002302197653002502220700001902245773018402264856007502448852000902523655001202532IND60691897420221120032143.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069189742DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.17822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHIN, Jong-Shik10aComparison of the ω-Transaminases from Different Microorganisms and Application to Production of Chiral Amines  ap. 1782-1788.  aNAL-light  aMicroorganisms that are capable of (S)-enantioselective transamination of chiral amines were isolated from soil samples by selective enrichment using (S)-α-methyl-benzylamine (S)-α-MBA) as a sole nitrogen source. Among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae JS2F, Bacillus thuringiensis JS64, and Vibrio fluvialis JS17 showed good ω-transaminase (ω-TA) activities and the properties of the ω-TAs were investigated. The induction level of the enzyme was strongly dependent on the nitrogen source for the strains, except for V. fluvialis JS17. All the ω-TAs showed high enantioselectivity (E>50) toward (S)-α-MBA and broad amino donor specificities for arylic and aliphatic chiral amines. Besides pyruvate, aldehydes such as propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde showed good amino acceptor reactivities. All the ω-TAs showed substrate inhibition by (S)-α-MBA above 200 mM. Moreover, substrate inhibition by pyruvate above 10 mM was observed for ω-TA from V. fluvialis JS17. In the case of product inhibition, acetophenone showed much greater inhibitions than L-alanine for all ω-TAs. Comparison of the enzyme properties indicates that ω-transaminase from V. fluvialis JS17 is the best one for both kinetic resolution and asymmetric synthesis to produce enantiomerically pure chiral amines. Kinetic resolution of sec-butylamine (20 mM) was done under reduced pressure (150 Torr) to selectively remove an inhibitory product (2-butanone) using the enzyme from V. fluvialis JS17. Enantiomeric excess of (R)-sec-butylamine reached 94.7% after 12 h of reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aVibrio fluvialis 3aacetophenones 3aalanine 3abiotechnology 3aenantioselectivity 3aenzymes 3anitrogen 3apyruvic acid 3asoil 3astereoselective synthesis 3atransamination 0aω-transaminase 0aenrichment culture 0achiral amine 0akinetic resolution 0aasymmetric synthesis1 aKIM, Byung-Gee0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 8 p.1782-1788dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.17823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003400141245011200175300001600287500002000303520183000323592002802153596003302181596001402214650002002228650002702248650001302275650001802288650001802306650001202324650001202336650001402348650001902362650001402381650001602395650001602411650001802427700002702445700002202472700002602494700002902520700002302549700002702572773013302599856007602732961000902808852000902817655001202826IND60786387220221118204834.0220803e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078638722DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.16004022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeal‐Bertioli, Soraya C. M.10aPhenotypic effects of allotetraploidization of wild Arachis and their implications for peanut domestication  ap. 379-388.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: Several species of Arachis have been cultivated for their edible seeds, historically and to the present day. The diploid species that have a history of cultivation show relatively small signatures of domestication. In contrast, the tetraploid species A. hypogaea evolved into highly domesticated forms and became a major world crop, the cultivated peanut. It seems likely that allotetraploidization (hybridity and/or tetraploidization) in some way enhanced attractiveness for cultivation. Here we investigate this using six different hybridization and tetraploidization events, from distinct Arachis diploid species, including one event derived from the same wild species that originated peanut. METHODS: Twenty‐six anatomical, morphological, and physiological traits were examined in the induced allotetraploid plants and compared with their wild diploid parents. KEY RESULTS: Nineteen traits were transgressive (showed strong response to hybridization and chromosome duplication): allotetraploids had larger leaves, stomata and epidermal cells than did their diploid parents. In addition, allotetraploids produced more photosynthetic pigments. These traits have the same trend across the different hybrid combinations, suggesting that the changes are more likely due to ploidy rather than hybridity. In contrast, seed dimensions and seed mass did not significantly change in response to hybridization or tetraploidization. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the original allotetraploid that gave rise to cultivated peanut may have been attractive because of an increase in plant size, different transpiration characteristics, higher photosynthetic capacity, or other characteristics, but contrary to accepted knowledge, increased seed size was unlikely to have been important in the initial domestication.  aPublisher supplied data  cGeneration Challenge Program  cMARS Inc. 3aallotetraploidy 3achromosome duplication 3adiploidy 3adomestication 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3apeanuts 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3aseed size 3aseed weight 3atetraploidy 3atranspiration1 aMoretzsohn, Márcio C.1 aSantos, Silvio P.1 aBrasileiro, Ana C.

Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 1 (NFE2L1, also known as Nrf1), a CNC-bZIP protein, is a master regulator of the cellular adaptive response to stresses. To investigate the role of NFE2L1 in adipocytes, we bred a line of mice with adipocyte-specific Nfe2l1 knockout (Nfe2l1(f)-KO), and found that Nfe2l1(f)-KO mice exhibited a dramatically reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) mass, insulin resistance, adipocyte hypertrophy, and severe adipose inflammation. Mechanistic studies revealed that Nfe2l1 deficiency may disturb the expression of lipolytic genes in adipocytes, leading to adipocyte hypertrophy followed by inflammation, pyroptosis, and insulin resistance. Our findings reveal a novel role for NFE2L1 in regulating adipose tissue plasticity and energy homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3aenergy 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahypertrophy 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3amice 0aNFE2L1 0aAdipose 0aLipolysis 0aInflammation 0aPyroptosis1 aLiu, Zhiyuan1 aZuo, Zhuo1 aGao, Tianchang1 aFu, Jingqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3871-428X1 aWang, Huihui1 aXu, Yuanyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2354-94531 aLiu, Dianxin1 aYamamoto, Masayuki1 aZhu, Beibei1 aZhang, Yiguo1 aAndersen, Melvin E.1 aZhang, Qiang1 aPi, Jingbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0227-80410 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Sept. 03, v. 503, no. 1 p.264-270dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520168800293592002801981650001202009650001502021650001802036650001302054650001802067650003002085650002502115650001102140650001202151650001702163650001802180650001402198650001902212650001002231650000902241650001702250650002602267650002502293650001202318650001002330700002102340773014502361856008202506852000902588655001202597IND60627243420221122061731.0190816e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1488-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarmada, Anis10aThread-based assay for quantitative small molecule analysis of mice tear fluid by capillary electrophoresis  ap. 329-338.  aTear fluid plays blood-like roles in the cornea, and changes in its chemical composition may be reflective of ocular surface disease pathogenesis. Studies of mice tears are limited by the small volume available for collection and difficulty in obtaining representative samples. Here, we establish a non-invasive assay for small volume analysis of small molecules in mice tears that requires no pre-treatment of mice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first small molecule analysis of mice tears. Nanoliters of mice tears (70 ± 25 nL) was collected via a single insertion of phenol red thread in the corner of the eye without anesthesia to prevent any tear production alteration. The processing and elution of tear samples were optimized for minimal sample handling and dilution while maintaining high separation resolution. A capillary electrophoresis separation with light-emitting diode-induced fluorescence detection was developed for the analysis of primary amine-containing small molecules. The levels of arginine, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate after elution were in the micromolar range as seen in human tears. However, taurine and histamine levels were decreased and increased, respectively, compared to human tears, which may be indicative of restraint-induced emotional stress. No significant differences were seen for any of the small molecules between 20-week-old ND4 Swiss Webster females and 12-week-old CD-1 males (N = 3). The developed assay represents a means to assess the chemical composition of tear fluid in mouse models of human disease, which could significantly improve our understanding of ocular surface diseases.

In mountains, ecotones are compressed and act as potential harbingers of species shifts that accompany climate change. As the climate warms in New England, USA, high‐elevation boreal forests are expected to recede upslope, with northern hardwood species moving up behind. Yet recent empirical studies present conflicting findings on this dynamic, reporting both rapid upward ecotonal shifts and concurrent increases in boreal species within the region. These discrepancies may result from the limited spatial extent of observations. We developed a method to model and map the montane forest ecotone using Landsat imagery to observe change at scales not possible for plot‐based studies, covering mountain peaks over 39 000 km². Our results show that ecotones shifted downward or stayed stable on most mountains between 1991 and 2010, but also shifted upward in some cases (13–15% slopes). On average, upper ecotone boundaries moved down −1.5 m yr⁻¹ in the Green Mountains, VT, and −1.3 m yr⁻¹ in the White Mountains, NH. These changes agree with remeasured forest inventory data from Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, and suggest that processes of boreal forest recovery from prior red spruce decline, or human land use and disturbance, may swamp out any signal of climate‐mediated migration in this ecosystem. This approach represents a powerful framework for evaluating similar ecotonal dynamics in other mountainous regions of the globe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aboreal forests 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecline 3aecosystems 3aecotones 3aforest inventory 3aforest types 3ahardwood 3ahumans 3aland use 3amountains 3aNew England region 3aNortheastern United States1 aD'Amato, Anthony W.0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.4497-4507dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.130463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100003200163245007200195300001800267520155100285592002801836650002901864650001501893650002201908650002101930650001001951650000901961650001101970650001801981650001501999650003002014650001502044650001602059650001902075650002202094650001502116650001602131650002002147700003102167700002202198700002202220700002202242700001902264700002102283773012802304856004502432852000902477655001202486IND50088968720221116183852.0140423e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008896872DNAL7 a245502062pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2013004412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomas‐Barberan, Francisco10aIn vitro transformation of chlorogenic acid by human gut microbiota  ap. 1122-1131.  aSCOPE: Chlorogenic acid (3‐O‐caffeoyl‐quinic acid, C‐QA), the caffeic ester of quinic acid, is one of the most abundant phenolic acids in Western diet. The majority of C‐QA escapes absorption in the small intestine and reaches the colon, where the resident microbiota transforms it into several metabolites. C‐QA conversion by the gut microbiota from nine subjects was compared to evaluate the variability of bacterial metabolism. It was investigated whether a potentially probiotic Bifidobacterium strain, capable of C‐QA hydrolysis, could affect C‐QA fate. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bioconversion experiments exploiting the microbiota from diverse subjects revealed that C‐QA was metabolized through a succession of hydrogenation, dexydroxylation and ester hydrolysis, occurring in different order among the subjects. Transformation may proceed also through quinic acid residue breakdown, since caffeoyl‐glycerol intermediates were identified (HPLC‐MS/MS, Q‐TOF). All the pathways converged on 3‐(3‐hydroxyphenyl)‐propanoic acid, which was transformed to hydroxyphenyl‐ethanol and/or phenylacetic acid in few subjects. A strain of Bifidobacterium animalis able to hydrolyze C‐QA was added to microbiota cultures. It affected microbial composition but not to such an extent that C‐QA metabolism was modified. CONCLUSION: A picture of the variability of microbiota C‐QA transformations among subjects is provided. The transformation route through caffeoyl‐glycerol intermediates is described for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis 3aabsorption 3abiotransformation 3achlorogenic acid 3acolon 3adiet 3ahumans 3ahydrogenation 3ahydrolysis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aphenolic acids 3aphenylacetic acid 3aprobiotics 3aquinic acid 3asmall intestine1 aGarcía‐Villalba, Rocío1 aQuartieri, Andrea1 aRaimondi, Stefano1 aAmaretti, Alberto1 aLeonardi, Alan1 aRossi, Maddalena0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2014 May, v. 58, no. 5 p.1122-1131dWiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In our previous reports, we showed that mammalian Cep169 interacts and collaborates with CDK5RAP2 to regulate microtubule (MT) dynamics and stabilization. Although Cep169 is required for MT regulation, its precise cellular function remains largely elusive. Here we show that Cep169 associates with centrosomes during interphase, but dissociates from these structures from the onset of mitosis, although CDK5RAP2 (Cep215) is continuously located at the centrosomes throughout cell cycle. Interestingly, treatment with purvalanol A, a Cdk1 inhibitor, nearly completely blocked the dissociation of Cep169 from centrosomes during mitosis. In addition, mass spectrometry analyses identified 7 phosphorylated residues of Cep169 corresponding to consensus phosphorylation sequence for Cdk1. These data suggest that the dissociation of Cep169 from centrosomes is controlled by Cdk1/Cyclin B during mitosis, and that Cep169 might regulate MT dynamics of mitotic spindle.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentrosomes 3adissociation 3ainterphase 3amammals 3amass spectrometry 3amicrotubules 3amitosis 3amitotic spindle apparatus 3aphosphorylation 0aMitosis 0aPhosphorylation 0aCep169 0aCdk1 0aCentrosome1 aInoue, Yoko1 aTaniyama, Yuki1 aTanaka, Sayori1 aTerada, Yasuhiko0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Dec. 25, v. 468 p.642-646dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007900155300001600234500002000250520109200270592002801362650002701390650002001417650001201437650001401449650002201463650002201485650002101507650001801528650001701546650001401563650001001577650000901587650002301596650001101619651002601630700002201656700002601678773014201704856007401846961001201920852000901932655001201941IND60642308820221119141221.0190507e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064230882DNAL7 a10.1111/cjag.121862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xuan10aHow to fight against southern pine beetle epidemics: An insurance approach  ap. 193-213.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe southern pine beetle (SPB) is among the leading biological agents killing southern pine species in the eastern United States. In light of recognized spatiotemporal autocorrelation in SPB outbreaks, we devise a spatiotemporal block bootstrapping method that can be applied to analyze spatiotemporally dependent infestations. We also identify the relevant risk determinants and evaluate their impacts on the frequency of SPB outbreaks. For example, we find forest type, climate, and natural disasters like storm and forest management are all significantly associated with SPB risks. Using the results of a statistical model, we design a county‐level group index insurance plan that generates estimates of actuarially fair premium rates for timber stands containing southern pine species. Given that no government‐provided compensation scheme for SPB epidemics currently exists, application of this new insurance product could reduce forest owners losses. Our study offers an approach to analyzing and protecting against risks of other destructive pests affecting the timber sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus frontalis 3aautocorrelation 3aclimate 3adisasters 3adisease outbreaks 3aforest management 3aforest ownership 3aforest stands 3aforest types 3ainsurance 3apests 3arisk 3astatistical models 3astorms 3aEastern United States1 aGoodwin, Barry K.1 aPrestemon, Jeffrey P.0 tCanadian journal of agricultural economics.g2019 June, v. 67, no. 2 p.193-213dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44931x0008-39767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cjag.121863Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520175500293592002802048650002502076650001102101650001202112650001602124650002002140650001202160650002502172650001602197650001102213650001902224650002202243650002102265650001102286650001202297650001802309650002502327650001602352650002002368650001502388651001002403700002402413700001702437700002202454700001702476700001702493773011402510856008102624852000902705655001202714IND60440597920221119170648.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044059792DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-014-3847-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Yanqing10aCharacteristics of climate change in southwest China karst region and their potential environmental impacts  ap. 937-944.  aGlobal warming, due to the enhanced greenhouse effect, is likely to have significant effect on the hydrological cycle, which would result in more evaporation, more precipitation, and uneven distribution of precipitation around the globe. Some parts of the world may see significant reduction in precipitation, or major alterations in the timing of wet and dry seasons, and increases in both floods and droughts. In China, a warming trend has been observed across the mainland region during the past 50 years, with an increasing temperature of about 0.2–0.3 °C/10 year in northern and less than 0.1 °C/10 year in southern China. To understand the characteristics of climate change, this study has conducted statistical analysis on climate parameters from 12 representative meteorological stations in southwest China karst region. The non-parametric Mann–Kendall rank statistic method and the Pettitt–Mann–Whitney change point statistics were used, respectively, for the change trend and change point analyses of daily temperature and precipitation at each station. The 5-year moving averages of 11 climate parameters showed a clear increase in the maximum and minimum annual average temperature in southwest China, however, no consistent increase for precipitation. In addition to temperature and precipitation, changes in the atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and cloud cover were also observed from this study. Changes in climate characteristics will or have altered the hydrologic cycle in the region, which would induce more frequent drought and flood, redistribution of water resources, rocky desertification, and carbon balance, and will ultimately have great impacts on the social, economic, and environmental life in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acloud cover 3adesertification 3adrought 3aenvironmental impact 3aevaporation 3afloods 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse effect 3ahydrologic cycle 3akarsts 3aseasons 3asocial impact 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3awater resources 3awind speed 3aChina1 aYou, Gene Jiing-Yun1 aLin, Kairong1 aJiang, Zhongcheng1 aZhang, Cheng1 aQin, Xiaoqun0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 2 p.937-944dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3847-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008600162300001600248520100700264592002801271650001601299650001301315650003101328650002401359650001201383700002201395700002201417700002401439700002501463700001701488773013201505856007801637852000901715655001201724IND60792032220221118164232.0220904e20201102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079203222DNAL7 a10.17221/385/2020-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalík, Jiří10aEffect of organic fertilisers on glomalin content and soil organic matter quality  ap. 590-597.  aGlomalin is one of the factors with an important role at forming and stabilising soil aggregates. Long-term stationary experiments were carried out to observe the influence of various fertilisation treatments on the content of glomalin in topsoil. The content of easily extractable glomalin (EEG) and total glomalin (TG) were determined. Moreover, glomalin was also determined by using the near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (G<sub>NIRS</sub>). Both mineral and organic fertilisation significantly increased the content of glomalin compared to the unfertilised control. However, observed differences among individual fertilisation treatments were not significant. A significant correlation was determined between the content of EEG, TG, G<sub>NIRS</sub>, and the content of humic substances as well as humic acids. Both methods used (EEG, TG) can equally reflect soil organic matter quality. A significant correlation was also recorded between the G<sub>NIRS</sub> and extraction methods (EEG, TG).  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3aglomalin 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3asoil organic matter 3atopsoil1 aSedlář, Ondřej1 aKulhánek, Martin1 aČerný, Jindřich,1 aSmatanová, Michaela1 aSuran, Pavel0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 66, no. 11 p.590-597dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/385/2020-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100006200166245007200228300001800300520166200318592002801980650001702008650001902025650001002044650002302054650002102077650001402098650001002112650001102122650001402133650001502147650001102162650001602173650001302189651001402202653001302216653002602229653002902255653000902284653002102293653002302314653001502337653001802352700002102370700002302391700001902414700002202433773012102455856008102576852000902657655001202666IND60651211020221117054950.0190711e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065121102DNAL7 a294418392pmid7 a10.1017/S003118201800015X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnett, Louise K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2867-664614aThe impact of parasites during range expansion of an invasive gecko  ap. 1400-1409.  aHost–parasite dynamics can play a fundamental role in both the establishment success of invasive species and their impact on native wildlife. The net impact of parasites depends on their capacity to switch effectively between native and invasive hosts. Here we explore host-switching, spatial patterns and simple fitness measures in a slow-expanding invasion: the invasion of Asian house geckos (Hemidactylus frenatus) from urban areas into bushland in Northeast Australia. In bushland close to urban edges, H. frenatus co-occurs with, and at many sites now greatly out-numbers, native geckos. We measured prevalence and intensity of Geckobia mites (introduced with H. frenatus), and Waddycephalus (a native pentastome). We recorded a new invasive mite species, and several new host associations for native mites and geckos, but we found no evidence of mite transmission between native and invasive geckos. In contrast, native Waddycephalus nymphs were commonly present in H. frenatus, demonstrating this parasite's capacity to utilize H. frenatus as a novel host. Prevalence of mites on H. frenatus decreased with distance from the urban edge, suggesting parasite release towards the invasion front; however, we found no evidence that mites affect H. frenatus body condition or lifespan. Waddycephalus was present at low prevalence in bushland sites and, although its presence did not affect host body condition, our data suggest that it may reduce host survival. The high relative density of H. frenatus at our sites, and their capacity to harbour Waddycephalus, suggests that there may be impacts on native geckos and snakes through parasite spillback.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHemidactylus 3abody condition 3ahosts 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alongevity 3amites 3anymphs 3aparasites 3ashrublands 3asnakes 3aurban areas 3awildlife 3aAustralia 0aGeckobia 0aHemidactylus frenatus 0ahost–parasite dynamics 0amite 0aparasite release 0aparasite spillback 0apentastome 0aWaddycephalus1 aPhillips, Ben L.1 aHeath, Allen C.

Endoscopy is sometimes used for direct confirmation of parasite infection and as a therapeutic option for removal. In recent years, innovations in endoscopy have advanced remarkably with regards to endoscopic devices as well as diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopical methods. Several new endoscopic devices are now used for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to parasitic infections. In the present article, we have focused on in vivo imaging of parasitic infections. In vivo images of parasites were obtained using various endoscopic methods such as high-definition endoscopy, super-magnifying endoscopy, and video capsule endoscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigen detection 3abiopsy 3ablood serum 3acapsule endoscopy 3adigestive tract 3afeces 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aintestinal mucosa 3aparasites 3aparasitoses 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aserology 0aParasitic infection 0aColonoscopy 0aEsophagogastroduodenoscopy 0aCapsule endoscopy 0aEndocytoscopy 0aSuper-magnifying endoscope1 aOgata, Haruhiko1 aHibi, Toshifumi0 tParasitology international.g2014 Feb., v. 63, no. 1 p.216-220dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245011900161500001400280520161100294592002801905650001501933650002101948650001901969650002801988650001402016650002102030650001202051650001402063650001902077650001602096650002102112650001302133650001702146650001902163650002102182650001502203650001702218650001302235650002802248700002002276700001902296700001802315700002102333700002202354700001702376700002202393773012602415856007702541852000902618655001202627IND60711631720221119024117.0200928e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163172DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Tzu-Jung 10aWithanolide C Inhibits Proliferation of Breast Cancer Cells via Oxidative Stress-Mediated Apoptosis and DNA Damage  aNAL-light  aSome withanolides, particularly the family of steroidal lactones, show anticancer effects, but this is rarely reported for withanolide C (WHC)—especially anti-breast cancer effects. The subject of this study is to evaluate the ability of WHC to regulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells, using both time and concentration in treatment with WHC. In terms of ATP depletion, WHC induced more antiproliferation to three breast cancer cell lines, SKBR3, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231, than to normal breast M10 cell lines. SKBR3 and MCF7 cells showing higher sensitivity to WHC were used to explore the antiproliferation mechanism. Flow cytometric apoptosis analyses showed that subG1 phase and annexin V population were increased in breast cancer cells after WHC treatment. Western blotting showed that cleaved forms of the apoptotic proteins poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP) and cleaved caspase 3 (c-Cas 3) were increased in breast cancer cells. Flow cytometric oxidative stress analyses showed that WHC triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) production as well as glutathione depletion. In contrast, normal breast M10 cells showed lower levels of ROS and annexin V expression than breast cancer cells. Flow cytometric DNA damage analyses showed that WHC triggered γH2AX and 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) expression in breast cancer cells. Moreover, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) pretreatment reverted oxidative stress-mediated ATP depletion, apoptosis, and DNA damage. Therefore, WHC kills breast cancer cells depending on oxidative stress-associated mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylcysteine 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acaspase-3 3aflow cytometry 3aglutathione 3ahuman cell lines 3alactones 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3apopulation 3apretreatment 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species1 aTang, Jen-Yang 1 aLin, Li-Ching 1 aLien, Wan-Ju 1 aCheng, Yuan-Bin 1 aChang, Fang-Rong 1 aOu-Yang, Fu 1 aChang, Hsueh-Wei 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009000153300002000243520070400263592002800967650001800995650001801013650002301031650001101054650001701065650002801082650001301110650001901123650001401142700001401156700002401170700002401194700002501218700001901243700002001262700001901282773013701301856007401438852000901512655001201521IND60660244120221120054140.0190823e20140911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066024412DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03453h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meng10aDitopic boronic acid and imine-based naphthalimide fluorescence sensor for copper(ii)  ap. 11806-11809.  aCopper ions are essential for many biological processes.

A novel naphthalimide derivative bearing a monoboronic acid group (BNP) was investigated as a Cu²⁺ selective fluorescent sensor in living cells. This derivative is one of the rare examples of reversible fluorescent chemosensors for Cu²⁺ which uses a boronic acid group for a binding site. Moreover, the adduct BNP–Cu²⁺ displays a fluorescence enhancement with fructose.

The three reservoirs showed differents total microcystin LR concentration, with no significant differences among them. Over 20 sampling dates, the three reservoirs exhibited total microcystin LR concentrations on eight occasions that corresponded to a slight to moderate human health risk according to WHO guideline values for recreational waters. By determining the concentration of microcystin LR in cyanobacterial biomass, we identified cyanobacterial populations that occurred over time with varying degrees of toxin production (maximal 85.4 µg/mm³). The microcystin LR concentration in Bonete was positively correlated with temperature (r = 0.587) and cyanobacterial biomass (r = 0.736), in Baygorria with cyanobacterial biomass (r = 0.521), and in Palmar with temperature (r = 0.500) and negatively correlated with ammonia (r = −0.492). Action is needed to reduce the presence of toxic cyanobacteria in these systems. A decrease in the use of agrochemicals and management changes in the reservoir basins could be successful long-term measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aWorld Health Organization 3aagrochemicals 3aammonia 3abasins 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3aguidelines 3ahuman health 3amicrocystins 3arisk 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3atoxicity 3aUruguay1 aFábián, Dániel,1 aPiccardo, Andrea1 aChalar, Guillermo0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2017 Oct., v. 99, no. 4 p.488-492dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-017-2158-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245014900213300001600362520178500378592002802163650001102191650001102202650003502213650001102248650003502259650001302294650001702307650001902324650000902343650001702352650002002369650002802389651000902417653001702426653002002443653001902463653002202482653002002504653001002524653001102534653001102545700003402556700004002590700002002630700003002650773011202680856008602792852000902878655001202887IND60600244120221119071142.0180703e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060024412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVafaeipour, Majid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4627-264810aAssessment of regions priority for implementation of solar projects in Iran: New application of a hybrid multi-criteria decision making approach  ap. 653-663.  aOne of the promising ways to shift towards sustainable development has been the utilization of solar energy worldwide. Based on its geographical specifications, Iran enjoys high solar potential to implement feasible solar energy projects. However, to obtain the best productivity and payback, identification and prioritization of suitable regions for construction of expensive solar power plants is a delicate issue. In contrast with common assumptions, identifying appropriate geographical regions for implementation of such projects is not only associated with the amount of received solar radiation, but also there are many economic, environmental, technical, social and risk criteria (and their relevant sub-criteria) which must be taken into account. To address the complicated nature of the prioritization challenge caused by existence of various indicators, this paper applies a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach and prioritizes 25 scattered cities all around the country for implementation of future solar power plants. For this, both quantitative and qualitative effective indicators are identified to be considered as the inputs to the utilized hybrid model. The Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA, proposed in 2010) method is employed to rank the identified criteria, and the Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS, proposed in 2012) is applied to evaluate and prioritize the alternatives (cities) where Yazd city ranked first. Eventually via considering the ranked cities, a comprehensive GIS map of the country is presented. The utilized integrated approach can offer helpful information for energy sector decision-makers and planning energy management in top level of managing requirements of countries in all respects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aenergy 3ageographic information systems 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aplanning 3apower plants 3aprioritization 3arisk 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3asustainable development 3aIran 0aSolar energy 0aDecision making 0aSite selection 0aSolar power plant 0aDecision making 0aSWARA 0aWASPAS 0aDelphi1 aHashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz1 aMorshed Varzandeh, Mohammad Hossein1 aDerakhti, Arman1 aKeshavarz Eshkalag, Mahsa0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Oct., v. 86 p.653-663dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009800164500001400262520092600276592002801202650001801230650002501248650001701273650001001290650001001300650001001310650001001320650001201330650002001342650001301362650001701375650003101392650001801423650002101441650001701462650001101479650001201490650001701502700002001519700002001539700001701559700002401576700002101600700002201621773012601643856007701769852000901846655001201855IND60711631920221119023952.0200928e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163192DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarada, Chikako 10aSuppression of Oxidative Stress as Potential Therapeutic Approach for Normal Tension Glaucoma  aNAL-light  aGlaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of the eye, which involves degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs): the output neurons of the retina to the brain, which with their axons comprise the optic nerve. Recent studies have shown the possible involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, especially in the subtype of normal tension glaucoma. Basic experiments utilizing rodent and primate models of glaucoma revealed that antioxidants protect RGCs under various pathological conditions including glutamate neurotoxicity and optic nerve injury. These results suggested that existing drugs and food factors may be useful for prevention and hence therapy of glaucoma. In this review, we highlight some therapeutic candidates, particularly those with antioxidant properties, and discuss the therapeutic potential of RGC protection by modulating gene expressions that prevent and ameliorate glaucoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaxons 3abrain 3acells 3adrugs 3aganglia 3agene expression 3aglaucoma 3anerve tissue 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aretina 3arodents 3atherapeutics1 aNoro, Takahiko 1 aKimura, Atsuko 1 aGuo, Xiaoli 1 aNamekata, Kazuhiko 1 aNakano, Tadashi 1 aHarada, Takayuki 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013500167300001600302520150100318592002801819650001401847650002601861650001901887650001601906650003101922650001101953650001801964650001701982650001701999650001802016653001802034653002302052653002002075653001202095653002202107700001902129700001502148700002202163700001702185773011302202856008602315852000902401655001202410IND60600244220221119071235.0180703e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060024422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, I.10aEffect of the use of olive–pomace oil biodiesel/diesel fuel blends in a compression ignition engine: Preliminary exergy analysis  ap. 227-233.  aAlthough biodiesel is among the most studied biofuels for diesel engines, it is usually produced from edible oils, which gives way to controversy between the use of land for fuel and food. For this reason, residues like olive–pomace oil are considered alternative raw materials to produce biodiesel that do not compete with the food industry. To gain knowledge about the implications of its use, olive–pomace oil methyl ester, straight and blended with diesel fuel, was evaluated as fuel in a direct injection diesel engine Perkins AD 3-152 and compared to the use of fossil diesel fuel. Performance curves were analyzed at full load and different speed settings. To perform the exergy balance of the tested fuels, the operating conditions corresponding to maximum engine power values were considered. It was found that the tested fuels offer similar performance parameters. When straight biodiesel was used instead of diesel fuel, maximum engine power decreased to 5.6%, while fuel consumption increased up to 7%. However, taking into consideration the Second Law of the Thermodynamics, the exergy efficiency and unitary exergetic cost reached during the operation of the engine under maximum power condition for the assessed fuels do not display significant differences. Based on the exergy results, it may be concluded that olive–pomace oil biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel may substitute the use of diesel fuel in compression ignition engines without any exergy cost increment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acooking fats and oils 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy use and consumption 3aexergy 3afood industry 3afossil fuels 3aolive pomace 3araw materials 0aDiesel engine 0aEngine performance 0aExergy analysis 0aBiofuel 0aResidue recycling1 aQuintana, C.E.1 aRuiz, J.J.1 aCruz-Peragón, F.1 aDorado, M.P.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Sept., v. 85 p.227-233dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03946naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245011500200300001600315520145900331536046601790592002802256596011802284596013402402596010302536650002202639650001502661650001202676650000902688650001102697650001602708650002902724650000902753650001702762650001002779650001502789650001902804650003102823650001402854650002902868650002102897650001502918650002202933650001402955651001002969653003002979653001703009653002603026653001603052700001603068700001903084700002303103700001503126773011203141856008203253852000903335655001203344IND60791205620221119191923.0220826e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079120562DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X2110301142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4065-262010aDetecting cadmium contamination in loessal soils using near-infrared spectroscopy in the Xiaoqinling gold area  ap. 952-974.  aLoess is an important soil type that is widespread in the Loess Plateau of northwest China. However, mining exploitation, beneficiation, and metallurgy have led to inorganic contamination of soils that threatens the health of residents. The regular absorption peak shift of near-infrared (NIR) spectra in loessal soils represents a new method of soil environmental assessment based on field reflectance spectroscopy and hyperspectral remote sensing. Specifically, the NIR features of loessal soil will shift in response to changes in the soil composition and microstructure induced by heavy metal pollution. This study collected 27 samples from notable regions in the study area. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectral analysis, NIR spectral analysis, modified seven-step Tessier sequential extraction, and X-ray diffraction were used to analyze the band shift phenomenon of MIR and NIR features. The alignment of NIR bands was determined via the correlation between NIR and MIR bands associated with the vibration variations of the hydroxyl group. The correlations established by NIR band positions and exchangeable Cd cations were also analyzed. The results were then discussed according to the mineralogical characteristics of the heavy metal cations adsorbed on the surface and interlayer sites of clay minerals. These results can be used as a reference for the application of NIR technology to detecting heavy metal contamination in the soil of mining regions.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, grant number 2021JM-350, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant numbers 41502312, 51904220 and 41802196 and the Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited Major Science and Technology Projects, grant number XBY-ZDKJ-2020-08.  aPublisher supplied data  a2021JM-350cNatural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincedhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100007128  a41502312a41802196a51904220cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aXBY-ZDKJ-2020-08cNorthwest Engineerring Corporation Limited Major Science and Technology Projects 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3acadmium 3aclay 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental assessment 3agold 3aheavy metals 3aloess 3ametallurgy 3amicrostructure 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apollution 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asoil composition 3asoil types 3aspectral analysis 3avibration 3aChina 0aHeavy metal contamination 0aloessal soil 0asequential extraction 0amining area1 aXu, Youning1 aShang, Haixing1 aAbdullah, Abdullah1 aZhang, Wen0 tEnergy & environment.g2022 Aug., v. 33, no. 5 p.952-974dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X2110301143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01685naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245009800165300002000263520072300283592002801006650001101034650002001045650002001065650001401085650001801099700002301117700002101140773013501161856007801296852000901374655001201383IND60541621220221117173242.0160822e20150923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054162122DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b062612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamelio, Andrew

Celastrol, and for that matter any member of the celastroid family, was prepared for the first time through chemical synthesis starting from 2,3-dimethylbutadiene. A triene cyclization precursor generated in 12 steps underwent a nonbiomimetic polyene cyclization mediated by ferric chloride to generate the generic celastroid pentacyclic core. In the cyclization, engagement of a tetrasubstituted olefin formed adjacent all carbon quaternary centers stereospecifically. With access to the carbocyclic core of the family of natural products, wilforic acid and wilforol A were prepared en route to racemic celastrol.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclinical trials 3aferric chloride 3asynthesis 3atriterpenoids1 aJohnson, Trevor C.1 aSiegel, Dionicio0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Sept. 23, v. 137, no. 37 p.11864-11867dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b062613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245016100164500001400325520184100339592002802180650001502208650001402223650002102237650001602258650001902274650002002293650001402313650001102327650001902338650001302357650001502370650002302385650001702408650001102425650001802436650001602454650001902470650001602489650002302505650001702528650002702545650002002572650001902592650002102611650001702632650002802649650002602677700001902703700001902722700002202741700002102763700002002784700002202804773012602826856007702952852000903029655001203038IND60711632020221119024100.0200928e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163202DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Sheng-Yao 10aCombined Treatment with Low Cytotoxic Ethyl Acetate Nepenthes Extract and Ultraviolet-C Improves Antiproliferation to Oral Cancer Cells via Oxidative Stress  aNAL-light  aUltraviolet-C (UVC) irradiation provides an alternative radiotherapy to X-ray. UVC sensitizer from natural products may improve radiotherapy at low cytotoxic side effects. The aim of this study is to assess the regulation for oral cancer cell proliferation by a combined treatment of UVC and our previously reported anti-oral cancer natural product (ethyl acetate extract of Nepenthes adrianii × clipeata; EANA). The detailed possible UVC sensitizing mechanisms of EANA such as effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA damage are investigated individually and in combination using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTS) assay, flow cytometry, and western blotting at low dose conditions. In a 24 h MTS assay, the low dose EANA (5 μg/mL) and low dose UVC (12 J/m²) individually show 80% and combinedly 57% cell proliferation in oral cancer Ca9-22 cells; but no cytotoxicity to normal oral HGF-1 cells. Mechanistically, low dose EANA and low dose UVC individually induce apoptosis (subG1 accumulation, pancaspase activation, and caspases 3, 8, 9), oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial superoxide, and mitochondrial membrane potential depletion), and DNA damage (γH2AX and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine). Moreover, the combined treatment (UVC/EANA) synergistically induces these changes. Combined low dose treatment-induced antiproliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage were suppressed by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine. In conclusion, UVC/EANA shows synergistic antiproliferation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA damage to oral cancer cells in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. With the selective killing properties of low dose EANA and low dose UVC, EANA provides a novel UVC sensitizing agent to improve the anti-oral cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aNepenthes 3aWestern blotting 3aX-radiation 3aacetylcysteine 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3aassays 3acancer therapy 3acaspases 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acytotoxicity 3adosage 3aethyl acetate 3aexhibitions 3aflow cytometry 3airradiation 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amouth neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3aradiotherapy 3areactive oxygen species 3aultraviolet radiation1 aLin, Li-Ching 1 aYang, Zhe-Wei 1 aChang, Fang-Rong 1 aCheng, Yuan-Bin 1 aTang, Jen-Yang 1 aChang, Hsueh-Wei 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011200164300001800276500001900294520104000313592002801353650000801381650001101389650001401400650002301414650001301437650002101450650002201471650002001493650001501513650001401528653000901542653002001551653002601571653003001597653002501627700001801652700001801670700001101688700001601699700005801715773014301773856008501916852000902001655001202010IND60701101220221118073439.0200706e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070110122DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c018262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xin10aHexamine-Coordination-Framework-Derived Co–N-doped Carbon Nanosheets for Robust Oxygen Reduction Reaction  ap. 9721-9730.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, Co–N-doped carbon nanosheet (Co-NCS), obtained through a self-assembly strategy and subsequent pyrolysis process, was reported as an efficient ORR catalyst. Combining the unique 2D architecture and high N-doping level, the optimized Co-NCS exhibits a superior ORR performance with more positive onset potential (0.96 V) and half-wave potential (0.93 V) than those of commercial Pt/C under alkaline conditions. Additionally, the optimized catalyst also displays desirable ORR activity in acidic media, approaching that of commercial Pt/C. Significantly, the synergistic catalysis is demonstrated through selective etching of active species, holding great potential in an in-depth understanding of the contributions of CoNₓ and Co@C NPs in catalysts. Furthermore, the zinc–air batteries assembled with the optimized Co-NCS as the air cathode outperform the Pt-based zinc–air batteries. This finding sheds light on the synthesis of ORR catalysts and the exploration of their application in energy conversion systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3agreen chemistry 3ananosheets 3apyrolysis 0aCoNx 0aCo@C structures 0aSynergistic catalysis 0aOxygen reduction reaction 0aZinc−air batteries1 aWei, Xiaoqian1 aWang, Hengjia1 aWu, Yu1 aGu, Wenling1 aZhu, Chengzhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0679-79650 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 May 27, v. 8, no. 26 p.9721-9730dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c018263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012300166520193200289592002802221650001602249650002602265650002802291650001702319650001202336650001502348650002002363650002002383650001002403650002502413650001502438650001202453650001402465650002202479650000902501650001902510650001402529650001102543700002102554700002102575700001902596700001702615700001402632700001702646700002002663700002102683700002202704700002502726700001902751773012402770856008202894852000902976655001202985IND60794312720221119120938.0220922e20220909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079431272DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110910262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Danhua 10aSecreted Glycosyltransferase RsIA_GT of Rhizoctonia solani AG-1 IA Inhibits Defense Responses in Nicotiana benthamiana  aAnastomosis group AG-1 IA of Rhizoctonia solani Khün has a wide host range and threatens crop production. Various glycosyltransferases secreted by phytopathogenic fungi play an essential role in pathogenicity. Previously, we identified a glycosyltransferase RsIA_GT (AG11A_09161) as a secreted protein-encoding gene of R. solani AG-1 IA, whose expression levels increased during infection in rice. In this study, we further characterized the virulence function of RsIA_GT. It is conserved not only in Basidiomycota, including multiple anastomosis groups of R. solani, but also in other primary fungal taxonomic categories. RsIA_GT possesses a signal peptide (SP) for protein secretion, and its functionality was proven using yeast and Nicotiana benthamiana. The SP-truncated form of RsIA_GT (RsIA_GT(ΔS)) expressed in Escherichia coli-induced lesion-like phenotype in rice leaves when applied to punched leaves. However, Agrobacterium-mediated transient expressions of both the full-length RsIA_GT and RsIA_GT(ΔS) did not induce cell death in N. benthamiana leaves. Instead, only RsIA_GT(ΔS) suppressed the cell death induced by two reference cell death factors BAX and INF1 in N.benthamiana. RsIA_GT(ΔS)ᴿ¹⁵⁴ᴬ ᴰ¹⁶⁸ᴬ ᴰ¹⁷⁰ᴬ, a mutant RsIA_GT(ΔS) for the glycosyltransferase catalytic domain, still suppressed the BAX- or INF1-induced cell death, suggesting that the cell death suppression activity of RsIA_GT(ΔS) would be independent from its enzymatic activity. RsIA_GT(ΔS) also suppressed the H₂O₂ production and callose deposition and showed an effect on the induction of defense genes associated with the expression of BAX and INF1. The transient expression of RsIA_GT(ΔS) in N. benthamiana enhanced the lesion area caused by R. solani AG-1 IA. The secreted glycosyltransferase, RsIA_GT, of R. solani AG-1 IA is likely to have a dual role in virulence inside and outside of host cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aactive sites 3acallose 3acell death 3acrop production 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aglycosyltransferases 3ahost range 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aprotein secretion 3arice 3asignal peptide 3avirulence 3ayeasts1 aWang, Zhaoyilin 1 aYamamoto, Naoki 1 aWang, Mingyue 1 aYi, Xiaoqun 1 aLi, Ping 1 aLin, Runmao 1 aNasimi, Zohreh 1 aOkada, Kazunori 1 aMochida, Keiichi 1 aNoutoshi, Yoshiteru 1 aZheng, Aiping 0 tPathogens.g2022 Sept. 09, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110910263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011000164300001800274500001900292520196600311592002802277650001402305650001102319650001902330650002102349650003402370650001902404650002102423650001502444650002002459650001402479650001402493653002002507653002302527653003302550653002402583700005302607700001702660700002402677700001602701700005202717773014402769856008502913852000902998655001203007IND60701101420221118073454.0200706e20200604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070110142DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c018632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Xu10aInvestigation on the Discharge and Charge Behaviors of Li-CO₂ Batteries with Carbon Nanotube Electrodes  ap. 9742-9750.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLi–CO₂ batteries are regarded as promising electrochemical devices to simultaneously capture CO₂ and deliver electric energy. Although efforts are made to exploring reaction routes and developing effective catalysts, the discharge and charge behaviors at different current densities and the intrinsic mechanisms are not reported. Herein, a Li–CO₂ battery with a carbon nanotube electrode is investigated. It is found that with an increase of the current density, the discharge voltage plateau gradually decreases. After the initial charge polarization, the following charge process shows a two-stage charge voltage profile where the first stage is sensitive to the applied current density, whereas the second one is not. In addition, the electrode discharged at a lower current density has a higher voltage plateau of the first stage. The characterization results demonstrate that the discharge product is a combination of Li₂CO₃ and carbon in which crystalline Li₂CO₃ nanoparticles with the size of ∼5 nm are distributed. Upon charging, rich nanopores with the sizes of 5–10 nm are observed, which may come from the shrinkage of both crystalline and amorphous Li₂CO₃. Even at the end of charge, Li₂CO₃ and carbon remain on the electrode, resulting in the irreversible process. Thus, the first charge stage is proposed to be the decomposition of crystal and amorphous Li₂CO₃, whereas the second charge stage with a high voltage is attributed to the blockage of transport channels and the accumulation of side products. Furthermore, for the first charge stage, a low discharge current density leads to small sizes of crystalline Li₂CO₃ combining with amorphous carbon in the products, increasing the transport resistance and causing a high charge voltage. On the contrary, a high discharge current density results in large sizes of Li₂CO₃ crystals, improving the overall conductivity and leading to a low charge voltage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agreen chemistry 3ananopores 3ashrinkage 0acurrent density 0aproduct morphology 0adischarge−charge behaviors 0aintrinsic mechanism1 aTan, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5750-04771 aZhu, Xingbao1 aDiamond, Catherine,1 aCheng, Chun1 aNi, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5310-40390 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 June 04, v. 8, no. 26 p.9742-9750dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c018633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03902naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245011300201300001800314520200900332536025302341592002802594650001902622650001102641650001202652650001302664650002002677650001402697650001802711650001202729650001502741651001602756651001202772651001102784651001202795651001502807651001602822651001102838651002902849653002302878653001102901653002802912653001902940653001702959700001602976700001102992700002003003700002103023700001203044700002203056700001403078700002103092773010803113856008203221852000903303655001203312IND60791206020221119191859.0220826e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079120602DNAL7 a10.1177/095968362211069632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2746-606510aReconstruction of historical forest cover on a 1° grid in central and southeast Europe from AD 1800 to 2000  ap. 1052-1064.  aThe natural vegetation has been substantially changed over the last millenium, especially from forest to agricultural areas in Europe. To study the effects of deforestation on carbon and climate system, it is essential to construct spatially precise maps in forest cover. The current representative historical forest data sets are either derivatives of agricultural datasets or are produced based on the deforestation-population relationship. Almost no attempts have been made to use the inherently linked relationship between deforestation and cropland expansion that has run through Europe for millennia. This study created an approach based on the relationship between cultivation intensity and forest fraction to reconstruct forest cover changes in central and southeast Europe from AD 1800 to 2000 by the following steps: (1) To develop the spatial relationship curve (spatial resolution is 1°) between the “cultivation intensity (0–100%)” and the “forest fraction (0–100%)” derived from modern land cover datasets; (2) To generate the national-scale cropland data based on historical records from AD 1800 to 2000, and to allocate them to a 1° pixel; (3) To reconstruct the forest cover using the aforementioned relationship curve and the historical gridded cropland database. The results show that: (1) The forest fraction in central and southeast Europe decreased from 38.4% in AD 1800 to 27.0% in AD 1900, and then increased to 32.5% in AD 2000. (2) In AD 1800, large areas of forests can be primarily found in Luxembourg, Netherlands and Belgium, the south of France, the south of Germany, the Alps region, Poland, and the majority of the Balkans. (3) Throughout the 19th century, the entire region was generally subjected to deforestation, with large areas of forest coverage only being preserved in the Alps and the western and southern Balkans after 100 years of exploration. (4) The forest coverage in most of the study regions increased again at the end of the 20th century.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0603304).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acropland 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adeforestation 3aforests 3aland cover 3aAlps region 3aBelgium 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aLuxembourg 3aNetherlands 3aPoland 3aSouthern European region 0acropland expansion 0aEurope 0ahistorical forest cover 0areconstruction 0arelationship1 aFang, Xiuqi1 aYe, Yu1 aPongratz, Julia1 aZhang, Chengpeng1 aLi, Jun1 aYang, Liang Emlyn1 aLi, Yikai1 aEckmeier, Eileen0 tHolocene.g2022 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1052-1064dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968362211069633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01294naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245012300159300001600282500001400298520027500312592002800587650001500615650001300630650001300643650001200656650001300668653001800681653002200699653001700721700002100738773011700759856007100876852000900947655001200956IND60721981120221122130106.0201229e20201029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072198112DNAL7 a10.3417/20205802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubinstein, Jared10aNeotypification of the Interspecific Hybrid Pterocarya ×rehderiana (Juglandaceae) Originating at the Arnold Arboretum  ap. 232-234.  aNAL-light  aThe interspecific hybrid Pterocarya × rehderiana C.

To better understand if and to what degree patterns between microbial genomic features and host association (i.e., human and plant) exist, I analyzed the genomes of select Burkholderia strains—a bacterial genus comprised of both human and plant-associated strains—that were isolated from either humans or plants. To this end, I uncovered host-specific, genomic patterns related to metabolic pathway potentials in addition to convergent features that may be related to pathogenic overlap between hosts. Together, these findings detail the genomic associations of human and plant-associated Burkholderia strains and provide a framework for future investigations that seek to link host-host transmission potentials.  aPublisher supplied data  a2109481cNational Science Foundation 3aBurkholderia 3abiochemical pathways 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahost specificity 3ahumans 3amicrobiology0 tArchives of microbiology.g2022 June, v. 204, no. 6 p.335-335dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-022-02953-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01447naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001900169245010400188300001600292520038000308592002800688653002500716653001100741653001500752653001800767653001700785700002100802700002100823700002200844773015500866856010301021852000901124655001201133IND60131636520221120104001.0151127e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013163652DNAL7 a10.1638/1042-7260(2002)033[0311:HSOWAC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrenner, Deena10aHealth survey of wild and captive bog turtles (clemmys muhlenbergii) in north carolina and virginia  ap. 311-316.  aBlood samples, fecal samples, and cloacal swabs were collected from 42 bog turtles (Clemmys muhlenbergii), including 14 wild males, 22 wild females, three captive males, and three captive females, in Virginia and North Carolina, USA.

(Hemiptera: Plataspidae) to Two Different Native Strains of Beauveria bassiana  aThis is the first study that examined and compared the survival, LC₅₀, and RR₅₀ estimates of Megacopta cribraria F. (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) nymphs and adults that were exposed to two native Beauveria bassiana isolates (Previously codified as NI8 and KUDSC strains) at four concentrations. The greatest reduction in survival and mortality was observed primarily on or after 10 d post-exposure to B. bassiana isolates. Survival of early instars (2nd, 3rd) were not affected by either strains or concentration at 3 d and 5 d post-exposure. Survival of later instars (5th) and adults was significantly reduced when exposed to the KUDSC strain at all concentrations. Comparison of dose–mortality values (LC₅₀) using resistance ratios (RR₅₀) were significantly different between life stages of the kudzu bug for both strains of B. bassiana. The LC₅₀ values showed that kudzu bug adults are more susceptible than any other life stage when exposed to either strain. The KUDSC strain was more pathogenic than NI8 10 d after exposure, but NI8 exhibited significantly higher pathogenicity than KUDSC 20 d after exposure. Our results suggest potential field application of B. bassiana for kudzu bug control and their integration into pest management strategies to suppress them before they cause economic damage to soybean crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aMegacopta cribraria 3ainstars 3amortality 3apathogenicity 3apest management 3asoybeans1 aPortilla, Maribel 1 aParys, Katherine 1 aAllen, Clint 1 aGeorge, Justin 1 aReddy, Gadi V.

This transformation is mediated by PᵗBu₃-coordinated palladium catalyst and allows the derivatization of a diverse range of heterocycles, including pyrroles, indoles, imidazoles, benzoxazoles, and furans. Preliminary studies suggest that this reaction may proceed via the catalytic formation of highly electrophilic intermediates. Overall, this provides with an atom-economical and general synthetic route to generate aryl-(hetero)aryl ketones using stable reagents (aryl iodides and CO) and without the typical need to exploit pre-metalated heterocycles in carbonylative coupling chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aderivatization 3afurans 3aimidazoles 3aindoles 3aiodides 3aketones 3apalladium 3apyrroles1 aArndtsen, Bruce A.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Sept. 23, v. 137, no. 37 p.12050-12054dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b070983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012500162300001800287520129300305592002801598650001401626650001301640650001501653650002001668650001801688650001501706650002101721650001101742700001701753700002001770700001301790700001801803773012601821856008101947852000902028655001202037IND60580678920221118062813.0170926e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058067892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-017-1829-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Lichen10aMicroalgal cultivation and hydrodynamic characterization using a novel tubular photobioreactor with helical blade rotors  ap. 1743-1751.  aIndustrial-scale microalgal cultivation for food, feedstocks and biofuel production is limited by several engineering factors, such as cultivation systems. As a closed microalgal growth system, tubular photobioreactors are the most preferred ones in the mass algae production. In this work, microalgal cultivation and hydrodynamic characterization using a novel tubular photobioreactor equipped with helical blade rotors (HBRs) were investigated, with the aid of computational fluid dynamics and cultivation experiments to evaluate the effect of HBRs on the performance of tubular photobioreactor and growth of the Chlorella sp. The results showed that the use of HBRs in tubular photobioreactors would result in swirl flow and increase of radial velocity and circumferential velocity; it also indicated that the HBRs would enable microalgal cells to move forward helically and to be shuttled alternatively between the light zone and the dark zone. This has led to the faster growth rate of Chlorella sp. and no attachment on the tube surface in the tubular photobioreactor during the whole cultivation cycle. In conclusion, the HBRs could improve the performance of tubular photobioreactors and thus impact positively on the cultivation of microalgae cells for biotechnological industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3abiofuels 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3ahydrodynamics 3amicroalgae 3aphotobioreactors 3arotors1 aYang, Weimin1 aGuan, Changfeng1 aYan, Hua1 aFu, Pengcheng0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2017 Dec., v. 40, no. 12 p.1743-1751dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-017-1829-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245013900156300002000295500001500315520093600330592002801266650002301294650001101317650001101328650001401339650002101353650001401374650001501388650002601403653000901429700001401438700001601452700002001468700001901488773013501507856007801642852000901720655001201729IND60541621920221117160711.0160822e20150923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054162192DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b071232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ying10aIntramolecularly Hydrogen-Bonded Aromatic Pentamers as Modularly Tunable Macrocyclic Receptors for Selective Recognition of Metal Ions  ap. 12055-12063.  a2019-12-06  aDespite the tremendous progress that has been made in macrocyclic chemistry since the discovery of corands, cryptands, and spherands more than four decades ago, macrocyclic systems possessing a high level of controllability in structural configuration concurrent with a systematic tunability in function are still very rare. Employing an inner design strategy to orient H-bonding forces toward a macrocyclic cavity interior while convergently aligning exchangeable ion-binding building blocks that dictate a near-identical backbone curvature, we demonstrate here a novel pentagonal framework that not only enables its variable interior cavity to be maintained at near-planarity but also allows its ion-binding potential to be highly tunable. The H-bonded macrocyclic pentamers thus produced have allowed a systematic and combinatorial evolution of ion-selective pentamers for preferential recognition of Cs⁺, K⁺, or Ag⁺ ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acesium 3asilver 3apotassium 3ahydrogen bonding 3areceptors 3ametal ions 3amacrocyclic compounds 0aions1 aShen, Jie1 aSun, Zhang,1 aRen, Changliang1 aZeng, Huaqiang0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Sept. 23, v. 137, no. 37 p.12055-12063dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b071233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002700169245010300196300001600299520051300315592002800828653001500856653001200871653002100883653003000904653001300934653001300947700002600960700001900986773015501005856010301160852000901263655001201272IND60131636920221120103848.0151127e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013163692DNAL7 a10.1638/1042-7260(2002)033[0332:TZKAXA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewandowski, Albert H.10aTiletamine––zolazepam, ketamine, and xylazine anesthesia of captive cheetah (acinonyx jubatus)  ap. 332-336.  aThirty-two anesthetic episodes used a combination of tiletamine––zolezepam (50 mg/ml each), ketamine (80 mg/ml), and xylazine (20 mg/ml) at various dosages for routine diagnostic and minor surgical procedures in 13 captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus).

First, a thin layer of surface copper atoms of the foil was converted to γ-CuBr nanocorals (NCs) by dissolution and in situ deposition in a bromide medium. Then, the CuBr NCs were doped with Co utilizing the high ionic mobility of Cu⁺ in the γ-CuBr structure through cation exchange and dissolution reactions. During the Co-doping process, the surface γ-CuBr was converted to Cu₂O, leading to the formation of CuBr/Co@Cu₂O NCs. CuBr/Co@Cu₂O NCs were then converted to CuBr/Co@CuO hollow NCs (h-NCs), with high surface roughness and high stability by three linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans in O₂-saturated KOH solution (0.1 M) over a potential range of 1.2–1.7 V (vs RHE). The h-NC was not formed without Co-doping of γ-CuBr. The as-formed CuBr/Co@CuO h-NCs exhibit an overpotential of 270 mV with a current density of 10 mA cm–² and a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec–¹ for OER as a result of having high electrochemically active surface area and synergistic catalytic Co and CuBr@CuO nanostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acation exchange 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3afoil 3agreen chemistry 3aoxygen production 3aporosity 3asurface area 3asurface roughness 3avoltammetry 0aoxygen evolution reaction 0aelectrocatalyst 0acopper oxide 0acobalt-doping 0acuprous halides 0ahollow nanostructures1 aUnnikrishnan, Binesh1 aPeriasamy, Arun Prakash1 aChen, I-Wen Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2532-13801 aTseng, Yu-Ting1 aYang, Ya-Yun1 aLin, Weiran,1 aHuang, Chih-Ching1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0363-11291 aZhang, Huanzong,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5393-14100 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 June 08, v. 8, no. 26 p.9794-9802dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c023093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03966naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245010300213300001800316520170200334536029602036592002802332650001902360650001202379650001902391650001202410650001002422650002402432650001902456650002102475650001702496650003302513650001402546651001302560651001002573651001002583653001702593653001802610653001802628653001702646653001902663653000802682700002902690700006802719700002002787700002602807700006102833700002802894700003402922700002402956700003402980700001903014700006303033700005703096773010803153856008203261852000903343655001203352IND60791206420220826000000.0220826e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079120642DNAL7 a10.1177/095968362211069672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn-Đình, Thái1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1303-023912aA high-resolution, 1250-year long drought record from Ea Tyn Lake, Central Highlands of Việt Nam  ap. 1026-1040.  aAn understanding of past climatic variability at regional to local scales is mandatory for a proper evaluation of current and potential future repercussions from global climate change. The Southeast Asian tropics remain severely under-represented in paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstructions, although a few recent paleoclimate studies evaluated the variability, position and strength of the main Asian monsoon systems at different timescales from modern records to the last 15,000 years. Comparable data from Việt Nam, however, are scarce although Việt Nam and its Central Highlands are critically located at the intersection of the East Asian Summer Monsoon and the Indian Summer Monsoon with highly important socio-ecological consequences from changes in the climate system. This study presents a high-resolution sedimentary climate record from Ea Tyn Lake in Việt Nam’s Central Highlands covering the last 1250 years. Using geochemical and sedimentological proxies and principal component analysis, we reconstructed at least 12 drought events, some of which appear to be of supraregional significance as they coincide with historically documented droughts in India, China, and Cambodia. Beyond tracking short-term climate events, the Rb/Sr elemental ratio along the Ea Tyn Lake sediment sequence reflects long-term monsoon variability throughout the last millenium, which was previously only reconstructed via δ¹⁸O speleothem records from China and India. Our Ea Tyn Lake record shows that the East Asian Summer Monsoon was relatively strong between ~1000 and 1350 cal CE and weaker between 1350 and 1850 cal CE, followed by renewed intensification after ~1850 cal CE.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The content of this manuscript is based upon work supported by the Việt Nam National University (VNU) grant number QG.20.11 (Thái Nguyễn-Đình).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3alakes 3ameteorological data 3amonsoon season 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aprincipal component analysis 3asediments 3aCambodia 3aChina 3aIndia 0ageochemistry 0alake sediment 0aLate-Holocene 0apaleoclimate 0aSoutheast Asia 0aXRF1 aNguyễn, Thùy Dương,1 aNguyễn, Văn Hưởng,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1523-59211 aOjala, Antti EK1 aĐỗ-Trọng, Quốc1 aPhan-Thanh, Tùng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1019-59001 aNguyễn, Thị Hồng,1 aThị Ánh Nguyễn, Nguyệt1 aXuân Đinh, Thành1 aThị Huyền Nguyễn, Trang1 aSauer, Peter E1 aSchimmelmann, Arndt1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4648-52531 aUnkel, Ingmar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8940-16570 tHolocene.g2022 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1026-1040dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968362211069673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245009500163300001600258520102100274536016401295592002801459596001201487596001901499650001701518650001301535650001801548650001401566650002001580650002001600650002901620650001801649650001601667650001501683650001301698650001301711650001301724650000901737650002101746650001401767653002701781653001601808653002001824653002501844653002801869700001601897700002001913700001301933700001601946700001401962700001501976700001501991773012702006856008602133852000902219655001202228IND60679272920221119194714.0210310e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067927292DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2019.16290362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Jun10aUptake and utilization of different nitrogen forms in erect panicle japonica rice cultivar  ap. 397-406.  aThe response of rice to nitrogen (N) was compared between three rice cultivars and three N treatments: 1:0, 0:1, and 1:1 NH₄ ⁺:NO₃ ⁻. The three rice cultivars used were: Shennong1401 (SN1401, erect panicle rice cultivar) and Habataki and Sasanishiki (curved panicle rice cultivars). At the booting stage, higher gene expression and enzyme activity associated with N metabolism of rice in the including-NO₃ ⁻ solutions effected the secondary assimilation of N metabolism, and ultimately increased grain development. During the tillering stage, lower NO₃ ⁻ uptake rates and glutamine synthetase and NADH-dependent glutamate synthase activity in Habataki and Sasanishiki under the NO₃ ⁻ treatments resulted in lower effective panicle number per plant. However, no significant differences were observed in the grain yield per plant of SN1401 between NH₄ ⁺ and NO₃ ⁻ treatments. Our results indicate that the erect panicle rice cultivar can grow better under the including-NO₃ ⁻ treatment.  aThis research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [grant number 2018YFD0300306], Liaoning BaiQianWan Talents Program [grant number 2015-39].  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-39  a2018YFD0300306 3aOryza sativa 3aammonium 3abooting stage 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutamic acid 3agrain yield 3ametabolism 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apanicles 3arice 3aseed development 3atillering 0aErect panicle japonica 0ahydroponics 0ametabolic genes 0anitrogen uptake rate 0anitrogen use efficiency1 aGao, Jiping1 aZhang, Wenzhong1 aXin, Wei1 aZhao, Yanze1 aLi, Ziang1 aZhao, Chen1 aZhao, Ying0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 14, no. 1 p.397-406dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000112x1742-91537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2019.16290363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100002200159245008800181300001800269520148600287592002801773650001901801650001101820650002501831650001801856650002601874650001201900650001901912650001601931650002401947650001501971650001401986653001002000653001002010653002102020653000802041653001002049653000902059653001502068700002502083773012302108856007402231852000902305655001202314IND60118913020221119122104.0141127e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011891302DNAL7 a242150772pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert3632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 adel Pozo, Juan C.10aAuxin and the ubiquitin pathway. Two players–one target: the cell cycle in action  ap. 2617-2632.  aPlants are sessile organisms that have to adapt their growth to the surrounding environment. Concomitant with this adaptation capability, they have adopted a post-embryonic development characterized by continuous growth and differentiation abilities. Constant growth is based on the potential of stem cells to divide almost incessantly and on a precise balance between cell division and cell differentiation. This balance is influenced by environmental conditions and by the genetic information of the cell. Among the internal cues, the cross-talk between different hormonal signalling pathways is essential to control this division/differentiation equilibrium. Auxin, one of the most important plant hormones, regulates cell division and differentiation, among many other processes. Amazing advances in auxin signal transduction at the molecular level have been reported, but how this signalling is connected to the cell cycle is, so far, not well known. Auxin signalling involves the auxin-dependent degradation of transcription repressors by F-box-containing E3 ligases of ubiquitin. Recently, SKP2A, another F-box protein, was shown to bind auxin and to target cell-cycle repressors for proteolysis, representing a novel mechanism that links auxin to cell division. In this review, a general vision of what is already known and the most recent advances on how auxin signalling connects to cell division and the role of the ubiquitin pathway in plant cell cycle will be covered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aF-box proteins 3aauxins 3acell differentiation 3acell division 3aenvironmental factors 3aligases 3aplant hormones 3aproteolysis 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3aubiquitin 0aAPC/S 0aauxin 0aplant cell cycle 0aSCF 0aSKP2A 0aTIR1 0aubiquitin.1 aManzano, Concepción0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 June, v. 65, no. 10 p.2617-2632dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert3633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245021700174300001400391520143500405592002801840650002201868650002101890650002101911650001701932650002101949650001101970650001201981650001101993650001302004650001002017650001402027650002502041650001602066650001102082653001402093653002002107653002402127653003402151653004802185773011102233856008602344852000902430655001202439IND60600245220221119070837.0180703e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060024522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanković, Bojan,14aThe pyrolysis of coffee paper cup waste samples using non-isothermal thermo-analytical techniques.

It was found that second pyrolysis stage can be described by Šesták–Berggren (SB) autocatalytic model, with mechanism function f(α)=α⁰.⁰¹¹(1−α)¹.⁴⁵⁹. Based on analysis of SB kinetic exponents (designated by M and N), it was found that second pyrolysis stage is mainly controlled by chemical process, involving reactions with reaction-order (n) higher than unity. Applying specific statistical analysis, in order to obtain precise distribution of reactivity, the discrete (binomial) distribution has shown that there are two important areas of current distribution for corresponding energy outcomes, within the apparent activation energy as random variable. The first “concentration” area of energy outcomes corresponds to start of chain end depolymerization reaction forming levoglucosan at high enough temperature region, while second “concentration” area of energy outcomes includes occurrence of macro-radicals in liquid phase propagate with radical addition on unsaturated C–C bonds, with cross-linking and formation of small chemical species. It was found that further elevating of temperature (above 340°C), will leads to fact that rate of tar-forming reactions increases and formation of char decreases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3achemical bonding 3achemical species 3acrosslinking 3adepolymerization 3aenergy 3aliquids 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apaper 3apyrolysis 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3awastes 0aPyrolysis 0aPaper cup waste 0aAutocatalytic model 0aChemically controlled process 0aDiscrete (binomial) reactivity distribution0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Sept., v. 85 p.33-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01765naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001600169245010100185300001600286520071500302592002801017653001901045653001501064653001301079653001701092653001301109653002201122700002101144700001901165773015501184856010301339852000901442655001201451IND60131637120221120103842.0151127e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013163712DNAL7 a10.1638/1042-7260(2002)033[0342:SIORTI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuglei, Eva10aSurgical implantation of radio transmitters in arctic foxes (alopex lagopus) on svalbard, norway  ap. 342-349.  aTwelve captive wild-caught adult arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) were anesthetized a total of 24 times for an equal number of surgical procedures involving implantation of heart rate (HR) and core body temperature transmitters (Tb) between October 1995 and April 1997.

By analyzing gene expressions in a ¹O₂‐overproducing Arabidopsis mutant (ch1) under different light regimes, we show here that the ¹O₂ signalling pathway involves the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐mediated unfolded protein response (UPR). ch1 plants in low light exhibited a moderate activation of UPR genes, in particular bZIP60, and low concentrations of the UPR‐inducer tunicamycin enhanced tolerance to photooxidative stress, together suggesting a role for UPR in plant acclimation to low ¹O₂ levels. Exposure of ch1 to high light stress ultimately leading to cell death resulted in a marked upregulation of the two UPR branches (bZIP60/IRE1 and bZIP28/bZIP17). Accordingly, mutational suppression of bZIP60 and bZIP28 increased plant phototolerance, and a strong UPR activation by high tunicamycin concentrations promoted high light‐induced cell death. Conversely, light acclimation of ch1 to ¹O₂ stress put a limitation in the high light‐induced expression of UPR genes, except for the gene encoding the BIP3 chaperone, which was selectively upregulated. BIP3 deletion enhanced Arabidopsis photosensitivity while plants treated with a chemical chaperone exhibited enhanced phototolerance. In conclusion, ¹O₂ induces the ER‐mediated UPR response that fulfils a dual role in high light stress: a moderate UPR, with selective induction of BIP3, is part of the acclimatory response to ¹O₂, and a strong activation of the whole UPR is associated with cell death.  aPublisher supplied data  aSLOSAMcANR  a14‐CE02‐0010‐02cANR 3aArabidopsis 3aacclimation 3abyproducts 3acell death 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agenes 3amutants 3aphotooxidation 3aphotosensitivity 3aphotosynthesis 3asinglet oxygen 3atunicamycin 3aunfolded protein response1 aChevalier, Anne1 aD'Alessandro, Stefano1 aKsas, Brigitte1 aHavaux, Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6434-393X0 tplant journal.g2020 June, v. 102, no. 6 p.1266-1280dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.147003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100006000185245015900245300002000404506007600424520123800500592002801738506003701766650001001803650001901813650001101832650001601843650003401859650001201893650001601905653003401921653002301955653003001978653001302008653002602021653002002047700001502067700006102082700001902143700001702162773014202179856007802321852000902399655001202408IND60655129520221207053546.0190731e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065512952DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b043612doi7 aPMC67506432pmcid7 a312677322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcharya, Rachana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1671-984010aAchieving Ultralow Turn-On Voltages in Organic Thin-Film Transistors: Investigating Fluoroalkylphosphonic Acid Self-Assembled Monolayer Hybrid Dielectrics  ap. 27104-27111.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe properties of organic thin-film transistors (TFTs) and thus their ability to address specific circuit design requirements depend greatly on the choice of the materials, particularly the organic semiconductor and the gate dielectric. For a particular organic semiconductor, the TFT performance must be reviewed for different combinations of substrates, fabrication conditions, and the choice of the gate dielectric in order to achieve the optimum TFT and circuit characteristics. We have fabricated and characterized organic TFTs based on the small-molecule organic semiconductor 2,7-diphenyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene in combination with an ultrathin hybrid gate dielectric consisting of aluminum oxide and a self-assembled monolayer. Fluoroalkylphosphonic acids with chain lengths ranging from 6 to 14 carbon atoms have been used to form the self-assembled monolayer in the gate dielectric, and their influence on the TFT characteristics has been studied. By optimizing the fabrication conditions, a turn-on voltage of 0 V with an on/off current ratio above 10⁶ has been achieved, in combination with charge-carrier mobilities up to 0.4 cm²/V s on flexible plastic substrates and 1 cm²/V s on silicon substrates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacids 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3adielectrics 3aelectric potential difference 3asilicon 3atransistors 0aorganic thin-film transistors 0ahybrid dielectrics 0aself-assembled monolayers 0aDPh-BTBT 0asubstrate temperature 0aturn-on voltage1 aPeng, Boyu1 aChan, Paddy K.

The activity of cell divisions sets the number of cells that will make up the organ; the cell expansion activity then determines its final size. Among the various mechanisms that may influence the determination of cell size, endopolyploidy by means of endoreduplication appears to be of great importance in plants. Endoreduplication is widespread in plants and supports the process of differentiation of cells and organs. Its functional role in plant cells is not fully understood, although it is commonly associated with ploidy-dependent cell expansion. During the development of tomato fruit, cells from the (fleshy) pericarp tissue become highly polyploid, reaching a DNA content barely encountered in other plant species (between 2C and 512C). Recent investigations using tomato fruit development as a model provided new data in favour of the long-standing karyoplasmic ratio theory, stating that cells tend to adjust their cytoplasmic volume to the nuclear DNA content. By establishing a highly structured cellular system where multiple physiological functions are integrated, endoreduplication does act as a morphogenetic factor supporting cell growth during tomato fruit development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acell division 3acell growth 3acells 3aendopolyploidy 3afruiting 3amodels 3anuclear genome 3apericarp 3aplant growth 3atomatoes 0aCell cycle control 0acell size 0aendoreduplication 0afruit 0agrowth 0akaryoplasmic ratio theory 0atomato.1 aBourdon, Matthieu1 aPirrello, Julien1 aCheniclet, Catherine1 aGévaudant, Frédéric1 aFrangne, Nathalie0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 June, v. 65, no. 10 p.2731-2746dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert3663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012300170300001800293520152900311592002801840650001901868650001201887650001501899650001301914650001101927650002501938650001501963650001201978650001101990650003102001700002002032773012602052856008102178852000902259655001202268IND60580679120221118043501.0170926e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058067912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-017-1834-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajamanickam, Ravi10aBiodegradation of gaseous toluene with mixed microbial consortium in a biofilter: steady state and transient operation  ap. 1801-1812.  aPetroleum oil refineries are massive emitters of risky volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Among the VOCs, toluene is taken into account as a significant pollutant. In the present study, a compost biofilter is used to treat the toluene vapor. However, an elimination capacity and removal efficiency of the biofilter was investigated for a wide range of toluene concentrations (0.29–3.8 g m⁻³) and operated for 54 days effectively. Elimination capacity of 93 g m⁻³ h⁻¹ was recorded as maximum value at a toluene inlet concentration of 114 g m⁻³ h⁻¹. An elimination capacity was perpetually better at the lower section of the biofilter, and therefore, the value was around 40–60 g m⁻³ h⁻¹. The high removal efficiency of 97% was obtained at inlet toluene load of 60.55 g m⁻³ h⁻¹. Hence, the biofilm was quite sensitive to handling transient loading conditions. The pressure drop had no vital impact on the biofilter performance. An Ottengraf model was applied to all phase of biofilter operation in each of the diffusion limiting region and reaction limiting region. The parameters of the model K ₁ (75.95 g¹/² m⁻³/² h⁻¹) and K ₀ (90.51 g m⁻³ h⁻¹) were obtained from diffusion and reaction limiting region severally. However, K ₁ was used to calculate the theoretical elimination capacities, and therefore, K ₀ was used to discover the biofilm thickness. By the way, the average biofilm thickness was found to be 0.98 mm from reaction limiting region.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3abiofilters 3acomposts 3amodels 3aoil and gas industry 3apollutants 3atoluene 3avapors 3avolatile organic compounds1 aBaskaran, Divya0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2017 Dec., v. 40, no. 12 p.1801-1812dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-017-1834-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245013900192300001600331520075200347592002801099653002301127653002301150653001101173653001801184700001801202700001801220700002401238700001801262700002101280700002201301700002401323700002101347773015501368856010301523852000901626655001201635IND60131637220221120103959.0151127e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013163722DNAL7 a10.1638/1042-7260(2002)033[0350:CDHGAW]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarner, Michael M.10aCongenital diffuse hyperplastic goiter associated with perinatal mortality in 11 captive-born bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus)  ap. 350-355.  aDiffuse hyperplastic goiter was diagnosed by histopathology in 11 perinatal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that died at four separate zoos and aquaria.

One of the factors that can ensure health in humans is regular physical activity. This type of activity can enhance immune function and dramatically prevent the spread of the cytokine response and OS. However, if physical activity is done intensely at irregular intervals, it is not only unhealthy but can also lead to muscle damage, OS, and inflammation. In this review, the response of cytokines and OS to exercise is described. In addition, it is focused predominantly on the role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) generated from muscle metabolism and damage during exercise and on the modulatory effects of antioxidant supplements. Furthermore, the influence of factors such as age, sex, and type of exercise protocol (volume, duration, and intensity of training) is analyzed. The effect of antioxidant supplements on improving OS and inflammatory cytokines is somewhat ambiguous. More research is needed to understand this issue, considering in greater detail factors such as level of training, health status, age, sex, disease, and type of exercise protocol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3aantioxidants 3achronic diseases 3acytokines 3aduration 3aexercise 3ahealth status 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3alead 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aprotocols 3aresearch 3avolume1 aSuzuki, Katsuhiko1 aCastell, Linda M.,0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 18, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100001400193245016800207300001800375500001900393520147000412592002801882596008301910650004301993650002302036650001202059650001502071650001502086650002002101650002002121650001702141650002202158653002802180653001702208653002002225653001602245653002402261700001602285700001702301700001802318700001302336700001902349700001602368700005602384773014402440856008602584852000902670655001202679IND60701102120221118073705.0200706e20200609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070110212DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c025292chorus7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c025292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Qing10aHigh Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol Production from Food Waste by Recombinant Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum in Batch and Continuous Immobilized-Cell Fermentation  ap. 9822-9832.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSustainable and economical production of butanol via acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation faces several major challenges, including high feedstock cost, low butanol yield, and low butanol productivity. To address these challenges, low-cost food waste was used as feedstock for ABE production in batch and continuous immobilized-cell fermentation by a recombinant high-butanol production strain Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum deltptabuk. Food waste was first liquefied and saccharified to obtain fermentable sugars. After that, food waste hydrolysates were fed into both batch and continuous immobilized-cell fermentation systems to produce ABE. In the batch fermentation, only 14.32 g/L ABE was produced using food waste hydrolysates medium. However, when food waste hydrolysate medium was fed into the continuous immobilized-cell fermentation, remarkable increases of ABE production, yield, and productivity were achieved. At the dilution rate of 0.1 h–¹, 19.65 g/L ABE was produced with an ABE yield of 0.43. At the dilution rate of 0.39 h–¹, the highest ABE productivity (4.56 g/L/h) was obtained, which was 23 times higher than that in the batch fermentation. This study for the first time demonstrated efficient conversion of food waste to butanol via continuous immobilized-cell fermentation to achieve high titer and productivity, which would potentially support the advanced utilization of organic waste materials for biofuel production.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aClostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum 3abatch fermentation 3abutanol 3afeedstocks 3afood waste 3afuel production 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrolysates 3aimmobilized cells 0aAcetone-butanol-ethanol 0aFermentation 0aEnergy recovery 0aClostridium 0aCell immobilization1 aAn, Zhaohui1 aDamle, Ashok1 aPoe, Nicholas1 aWu, Jian1 aWang, Hengjian1 aWang, Zhiwu1 aHuang, Haibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2106-41050 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 June 09, v. 8, no. 26 p.9822-9832dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c025293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011000209300001100319520198800330592002802318596006802346596005702414650001702471650002102488650003102509650001502540650001402555650001302569650001102582650001302593650001102606650001102617650001202628651001902640700005902659700006402718773011602782856008302898852000902981655001202990IND60777721720221119023403.0220609e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077772172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-022-04066-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatour, Robert J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8644-173310aOntogenetic niche structure and partitioning of immature sandbar sharks within the Chesapeake Bay nursery  ap. 76.  aCharacterizing ontogenetic niches of species is fundamental to understanding ecosystem structure and how habitat utilization changes across life-stages. Niche partitioning over temporal and spatial domains is also key to the coexistence of interspecific and intraspecific competitors. This study utilized fisheries-independent bottom longline survey data collected from 2013 to 2020 to develop ecological niche models for neonate and juvenile sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus) inhabiting the lower Chesapeake Bay nursery area. Modeled relationships in combination with auxiliary environmental data yielded size-specific habitat suitability estimates that were used to develop projected spatiotemporal distributions and assess ontogenetic niche equivalency. Results showed appreciable differences among the two size-classes in the relationships of relative abundance with measured abiotic variables. High neonate (observed size range 45.5–70.5 cm total length, TL) relative abundance was associated with high bottom temperatures, low bottom dissolved oxygen levels, and intermediate depths and bottom salinities. In contrast, high juvenile (observed size range 71–116 cm TL) relative abundance was linked with intermediate bottom temperatures and bottom dissolved oxygen levels, deeper depths, and lower bottom salinities. Fine-scale coexistence among the two size-classes was low, and annual maps of projected habitat suitabilities showed temporally consistent spatial separation of favorable abiotic niche conditions for neonates and juveniles. Niche equivalency results revealed that overlap among the size-specific niches was low to moderate with statistically significant differences detected annually and seasonally within years. Taken together, these results yield valuable insights on neonate and juvenile sandbar shark ecology by providing a nuanced delineation of stage-specific ecological niches and evidence of niche separation within a large nursery ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data  aNA18NMF4720321cNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  a20-0304cAtlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission 3aCarcharhinus 3adissolved oxygen 3aecological differentiation 3aecosystems 3ajuveniles 3aneonates 3aniches 3aontogeny 3aoxygen 3asharks 3asurveys 3aChesapeake Bay1 aGartland, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1436-22911 aPeterson, Cassidy D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0836-30390 tMarine biology.g2022 June, v. 169, no. 6 p.76-76dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-022-04066-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015000167300001600317520110100333592002801434650001401462650002001476650002001496650003101516650001001547650001101557650001401568650002101582650002101603650001501624650002601639650003601665653005101701653003401752653001001786653001001796700001901806700001801825700001701843700001701860773012201877856008201999852000902081655001202090IND60533233220221121065550.0160728e20150911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053323322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Young-Sun10aInvolvement of transcription repressor Snail in the regulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) by transforming growth factor-β  ap. 131-136.  aHuman telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), a catalytic subunit of telomerase, is the primary determinant for telomerase enzyme activity, which has been associated with cellular immortality. Expression of the hTERT gene is regulated by various extracellular (external) stimuli and is aberrantly up-regulated in more than 90% of cancers. Here we show that hTERT gene expression was repressed in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) by a mechanism dependent on transcription factors Snail and c-Myc. TGF-β activated Snail and down-regulated c-Myc gene expression. In addition, ectopic expression of Snail strongly inhibited hTERT promoter activity, although co-expression of c-Myc abrogated this effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that TGF-β decreased c-Myc occupancy and dramatically increased recruitment of Snail to the E-box motifs of the hTERT promoter, thereby repressing hTERT expression. Our findings suggest a dynamic alteration in hTERT promoter occupancy by Snail and c-Myc is the mechanistic basis for TGF-β-mediated regulation of hTERT.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatin 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein subunits 3atelomerase 3atranscription factors 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aHuman telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) 0aTransforming growth factor-β 0aSnail 0ac-Myc1 aPark, Seoyoung1 aGwak, Jungsug1 aJu, Bong Gun1 aOh, Sangtaek0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Sept. 11, v. 465 p.131-136dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245013500165300001400300500001900314520178700333592002802120650002202148650001302170650002502183650001102208653001402219653002202233653001802255700002202273700002002295700002502315700002302340700002402363773011502387856007802502852000902580655001202589IND60721981920221122222149.0210111e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072198192DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2020.01992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorlick, Jenna C.10a“I Feel Like Less of a Mom”: Experiences of Weight Stigma by Association among Mothers of Children with Overweight and Obesity  ap. 68-75.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground: Parents of children with higher weight are blamed and shamed for their children's weight. However, parents' experiences of this form of stigma, termed weight stigma by association, are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the sources, forms, and impacts of weight stigma by association among mothers of children with overweight or obesity. Methods: In this qualitative study, mothers who reported concern about their children's weight participated in semistructured interviews administered by the research team. A coding scheme was developed and reliably applied to interview transcripts. Mothers' self-reported sociodemographic information, and height and weight were measured. Results: Thirty-four mothers (Mₐgₑ: 43.4 years; 26.5% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 70.6% with obesity) participated in the study. Mothers reported that family members were a common source of negative comments about their children's weight; these comments were often critical of mothers' parenting and in some cases contributed to negative affect among mothers. Many mothers also reported negative experiences during children's physicians' visits as a result of their children's weight. Almost all mothers expressed guilt and sadness for their perceived role in their children's weight status, expressing regret that they did not parent differently. Conclusions: Mothers of children with overweight and obesity are frequently the target of weight stigma by association and experience negative cognitions and emotions regarding their perceived role in their children's weight. Continued research is needed to elucidate the impacts of stigma by association due to child weight on parents' health, the parent/child relationship, and children's health.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aqualitative analysis 3astigma 0aparenting 0apediatric obesity 0aweight stigma1 aGorman, Claire V.1 aWeeks, Heidi M.1 aPearlman, Arielle T.1 aSchvey, Natasha A.1 aBauer, Katherine W.0 tChildhood obesity.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 17, no. 1 p.68-75dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2020.01993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002200169245015100191300001600342520180600358592002802164650001402192650002402206650002002230650001902250650001802269650003302287650001402320650002002334650001602354651001102370700002802381700003002409773012702439856007302566852000902639655001202648IND60347107420221118052842.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034710742DNAL7 a10.1111/jse.121592doi7 a10.1111/jse.121592chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Paul M.10aPhylogeny and subgeneric classification of Bouteloua with a new species, B. herrera‐arrietae (Poaceae: Chloridoideae: Cynodonteae: Boutelouinae)  ap. 351-366.  aBouteloua (Poaceae: Chloridoideae: Cynodonteae; Boutelouiane) is an important genus of forage grasses containing 60 species found primarily in the Americas with a center of diversity in northern Mexico. A modern subgeneric classification is lacking. The goals of our study were to reconstruct the evolutionary history among the species of Bouteloua using molecular data with increased species sampling compared to previous studies. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 209 samples, of which 59 species (206 individuals) were in Bouteloua, using two plastid (rpl32‐trnL spacer and rps16‐trnK spacer) and nuclear ITS 1&2 (ribosomal internal transcribed spacer) sequences to infer evolutionary relationships and produce a subgeneric classification. Overall, ITS and plastid phylogenies rendered similar patterns. However, the ITS phylogeny lacked backbone structure, recovering only four internal clades out of nine found in the plastid phylogeny. The ITS network shows a radiative evolutionary pattern and indicates a number of incompatible splits, suggesting past hybridization between species of different sections. The maximum‐likelihood tree from the combined plastid and ITS regions is well resolved and depicts a strongly supported monophyletic Bouteloua that includes ten strongly supported clades and one moderately supported clade. The molecular results support the recognition of 10 sections and two subsections within Bouteloua s.l.; three sections are new: Barbata, Hirsuta, and Trifida; four sections are new combinations: Buchloe, Cyclostachya, Opizia, and Triplathera; and two subsections are new: Eriopoda and Hirsuta. Based on our molecular results and the possession of unique morphological characters we describe a new species from Nuevo León, Bouteloua herrera‐arrietae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBouteloua 3acenter of diversity 3achloroplast DNA 3aforage grasses 3ahybridization 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amonophyly 3anew combination 3anew species 3aMexico1 aRomaschenko, Konstantin1 aHerrera Arrieta, Yolanda,0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2015 July, v. 53, no. 4 p.351-366dScience PresswJournal:jnl40712x1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.121593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001900169245008600188300001600274520047300290592002800763653002400791653002700815653002800842653001200870653003300882653002400915700002000939700002100959700001700980700001800997700001901015700002201034700002001056773015501076856010301231852000901334655001201343IND60131637420221120103913.0151127e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013163742DNAL7 a10.1638/1042-7260(2002)033[0367:LSCCIA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatō, Tsuneo,10aLingual squamous cell carcinoma in a california sea lion (zalophus californianus)  ap. 367-370.  aA 28-yr-old female California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) in a commercial aquarium developed an ulcerated lingual tumor and died.

Morphology of the invading larva (a sporocyst), and the intramolluscan larval development of this fluke have not been characterized extensively. In this study, experimental infections of Lymnaea stagnalis using N. attenuatus eggs resulted in the development of sporocysts containing one germ ball or mother redia between 12 and 21days post exposure (p.e.) within the hepatopancreas. Independent mother rediae and developing daughter rediae were present between day 25 and day 42 p.e. Cercariae, within the body of rediae, were detected 42days p.e. The development of daughter rediae and cercariae started posteriorly in the body of parent redia and these larvae migrated anteriorly during development towards the birth pore. A cercaria was also observed emerging from the birth pore and released cercariae maturated further within the snail hepatopancreas prior to leaving the snail. The intramolluscan development was completed 45days p.e. when the first fully formed cercariae were shed into the outer environment. These data detail the fascinating post-embryonic development of N. attenuatus and highlight the intricate nature of larval transitions within its snail host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLymnaea stagnalis 3aNotocotylus 3acecum 3acercariae 3aeggs 3aflukes 3ahepatopancreas 3alarvae 3alarval development 3aparasitism 3asnails 3awaterfowl 0aNotocotylus attenuatus 0aIntramolluscan development 0aSporocysts 0aRediae 0aCercariae 0aTrematodes 0aLymnaea stagnalis1 aBulantová, Jana1 aWalker, Anthony J.1 aHorák, Petr,0 tParasitology international.g2014 Feb., v. 63, no. 1 p.94-99dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2013.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009800168300001100266520148500277592002801762596006301790596006301853650001901916650001101935650002001946650002201966650001501988650001702003650001802020650002402038651001102062700005802073700002102131700001702152700002102169700001702190700001802207700001902225700002502244700001702269773011602286856008302402852000902485655001202494IND60777721820221119022618.0220609e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077772182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-022-04068-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaraman, Sezgin10aPopulation genetic diversity of green turtles, Chelonia mydas, in the Mediterranean revisited  ap. 77.  aThe Mediterranean green turtle regional management unit is one of the 17 management units of green turtles considered a global conservation priority. However, previous studies using different genetic markers revealed very little diversity and differentiation across populations due to the overdominance of one haplotype (CM-A13) in the Mediterranean. We, therefore, used a more informative marker, mitochondrial short tandem repeats (mtSTRs), in 431 samples collected along the eastern Mediterranean coasts of Turkey and Northern Cyprus. In addition, we added the mtSTR haplotypes of previous studies and reached a total of 980 samples covering 12 nesting beaches (almost 100% of the populations in the region). We identified 42 haplotypes, 4 of which were recorded for the first time in the region. The species has a genetic diversity in the region higher than previously thought, ranging from 0.54 (Sugözü, Turkey) to 0.934 (Israel) and with the most common haplotypes being 6-8-8–4 (26.5%), 6-8-5-4 (17.3%), and 6-8-6-4 (14.9%). The analysis of a more extensive data set of mtSTRs supported recognizing at least three management units in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, we used the new data to assess the origin of the turtles foraging in Israel. We determined that Samandağ (Turkey) was the population of origin of most of the individuals. Overall, we show that mtSTRs highly improve the resolution to detect population structuring and source for this species and region.  aPublisher supplied data  a117Z996cTürkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu  a117Z996cTürkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu 3aChelonia mydas 3aCyprus 3adata collection 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3aoverdominance 3apopulation genetics 3aIsrael1 aTurkozan, Oguz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6889-79081 aCarreras, Carlos1 aYılmaz, Can1 aSönmez, Bektaş1 aCandan, Onur1 aErgene, Serap1 aErgene, Mahmut1 aUçar, Aşkın Hasan1 aUlger, Celal0 tMarine biology.g2022 June, v. 169, no. 6 p.77-77dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-022-04068-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03565naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011000169300001600279520121000295536046501505592002801970596003201998596002102030596002202051596001302073650001602086650002402102650001102126650001702137650002102154650002802175650001502203650002002218650003102238650001002269650001702279650001902296650002702315650002202342650001902364650001602383650001002399650002402409650002002433653002402453653002102477653001702498653002802515700001802543700001202561700001402573700001502587700001502602700001202617700001702629700001802646700001702664773012702681856008602808852000902894655001202903IND60679273320221119194911.0210310e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067927332DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2019.16347702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFei, Qionghui10aTranscriptome profiling and phytohormone responses of Arabidopsis roots to different ambient temperatures  ap. 314-323.  aAmbient temperatures influence plant growth and development, however very little is known about changes in root growth in response to ambient temperature change. Here, we performed transcriptome profiling and compared the differences in gene expression at lower and higher temperatures compared with normal plant growth temperatures. Our analysis of the biological processes and molecular functions regulated by differentially expressed genes revealed that low temperature upregulated carbohydrate metabolism and transmembrane transport, and downregulated signal transduction and defense. High temperature upregulated metabolic processes, transport, and auxin biosynthesis, and downregulated catabolic processes. We found that increased temperature specifically affected the levels of Arabidopsis response regulators, ARR1 and ARR12, to decrease cytokinin signaling, altered the level of the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 to downregulate brassinosteroid signaling, and changed the level of the gibberellin receptor DELLA to upregulate gibberellin signaling and mediate root elongation. These data contribute to our knowledge of how root growth adapts to elevated ambient temperature under climate warming.  aThis work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number lzujbky-2018-109]; the foundation of the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations [grant number lzujbky-2018-kb05]; Fund for Fostering Talents in Basic Science of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers J1210077, J1210033, J110350]; the Chinese National Science Foundation [grant number 31201062].  aPublisher supplied data  aJ1210077aJ1210033aJ110350  alzujbky-2018-109  alzujbky-2018-kb05  a31201062 3aArabidopsis 3aambient temperature 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinosteroids 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acytokinins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agibberellins 3aglobal warming 3agrowth and development 3aplant development 3aplant hormones 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptomics 0aAmbient temperature 0aArabidopsis root 0aphytohormone 0atranscriptome profiling1 aLiang, Liyuan1 aLi, Fan1 aZhang, Li1 aLi, Youxia1 aGuo, Yuman1 aWu, Lei1 aMeng, Xueqin1 aGao, Huanhuan1 aLi, Xiaofeng0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 14, no. 1 p.314-323dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000112x1742-91537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2019.16347703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011500165300001800280500001400298520218700312592002802499650000802527650001502535650001502550650002202565650001402587650001602601650003102617650002002648650001702668650002802685650001302713650001102726650001102737650002302748650001602771650001602787650002302803700002502826700005602851773011802907856008303025852000903108655001203117IND60721982020221121052016.0201229e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072198202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.0c006692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Arumay10aPrerecognition Diffusion Mechanism of Human DNA Mismatch Repair Proteins along DNA: Msh2-Msh3 versus Msh2-Msh6  ap. 4822-4832.  aNAL-light  aDNA mismatch repair (MMR) is an important postreplication process that eliminates mispaired or unpaired nucleotides to ensure genomic replication fidelity. In humans, Msh2-Msh6 and Msh2-Msh3 are the two mismatch repair initiation factors that recognize DNA lesions. While X-ray crystal structures exist for these proteins in complex with DNA lesions, little is known about their structures during the initial search along nonspecific double-stranded DNA, because they are short-lived and difficult to determine experimentally. In this study, various computational approaches were used to sidestep these difficulties. All-atom and coarse-grained simulations based on the crystal structures of Msh2-Msh3 and Msh2-Msh6 showed no translation along the DNA, suggesting that the initial search conformation differs from the lesion-bound crystal structure. We modeled probable search-mode structures of MSH proteins and showed, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, that they can perform rotation-coupled diffusion on DNA, which is a suitable and efficient search mechanism for their function and one predicted earlier by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence microscopy studies. This search mechanism is implemented by electrostatic interactions among the mismatch-binding domain (MBD), the clamp domains, and the DNA backbone. During simulations, their diffusion rate did not change significantly with an increasing salt concentration, which is consistent with observations from experimental studies. When the gap between their DNA-binding clamps was increased, Msh2-Msh3 diffused mostly via the clamp domains while Msh2-Msh6 still diffused using the MBD, reproducing the experimentally measured lower diffusion coefficient of Msh2-Msh6. Interestingly, Msh2-Msh3 was capable of dissociating from the DNA, whereas Msh2-Msh6 always diffused on the DNA duplex. This is consistent with the experimental observation that Msh2-Msh3, unlike Msh2-Msh6, can overcome obstacles such as nucleosomes. Our models provide a molecular picture of the different mismatch search mechanisms undertaken by Msh2-Msh6 and Msh2-Msh3, despite the similarity of their structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3acrystal structure 3adiffusion 3adiffusivity 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenomics 3ahumans 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3anucleosomes 3anucleotides 3asalt concentration1 aGreenblatt, Harry M.1 aLevy, Yaakov1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9929-973X0 tBiochemistry.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 59, no. 51 p.4822-4832dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c006693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013200165300001800297500001900315520111600334592002801450650003101478650002401509650001301533650001701546650001901563650002001582650002301602650001301625650002701638650002001665650001901685650001701704653002001721653002901741653002001770653001901790700005401809700001901863700005301882700005901935773014401994856008502138852000902223655001202232IND60701102320221118073655.0200706e20200603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070110232DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c027032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Liqin10aPhoto-Driven Highly Efficient One-Step CO₂ Biomethanation with Engineered Photo-Synthetic Bacteria Rhodopseudomonas palustris  ap. 9616-9621.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCO₂ methanation is considered as a promising process for methane production and renewable energy storage. However, current methane production processes involve nonrenewable energy input or high temperature and pressure, which raises the concerns of sustainability. Here, a sustainable photo-driven one-step CO₂ biomethanation approach using whole-cell biocatalysis was established by endowing the methanation capability to a photosynthetic bacterium (PSB). With simple genetic engineering of inherent dinitrogen reductase, the CO₂ biomethanation PSB was constructed from facultative anaerobic bacteria of Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGMCC 1.2180. With this engineered PSB strain, one-step CO₂ biomethanation powered by sustainable solar energy was realized at ambient temperature and pressure. After optimization, a record-high photo-driven bio-CH₄ yield (CO₂-to-CH₄, 35% with 10 μmol/L CO₂) was achieved. This study provided an efficient and sustainable methane-producing approach, demonstrating the great potential of bacterial methanation for CO₂ transformation and solar energy harvesting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodopseudomonas palustris 3aambient temperature 3abacteria 3abiocatalysis 3acarbon dioxide 3agreen chemistry 3amethane production 3anitrogen 3anonrenewable resources 3aoxidoreductases 3aphotosynthesis 3asolar energy 0aCO2 methanation 0aPhoto-synthetic bacteria 0aGreen catalysis 0aSustainability1 aFang, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1622-96381 aWang, Yan-Zhai1 aZhou, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3980-487X1 aYong, Yang-Chun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1216-51630 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 June 03, v. 8, no. 26 p.9616-9621dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c027033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03799naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001800181245011000199300001800309506007600327520157900403592002801982506003702010650002502047650001702072650002102089650002402110650001002134650001902144650001602163650001802179650001202197650002402209650002202233650006302255650005002318650004802368650003302416650004602449650005602495650004002551650006102591650004102652653002502693653002102718653000902739653000902748653001902757653000902776700001802785700001802803700001602821700001502837700001602852700001802868700001702886700001802903773012102921856007403042852000903116655001203125IND60118910720221207113039.0141127e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011891072DNAL7 a235807542pmid7 aPMC36544252pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Rongfang10aBZR1 and BES1 participate in regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis by brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis   ap. 2401-2412.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effect of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) on glucosinolate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated in the present study by using mutants and transgenic plants involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis and signal transduction, as well as glucosinolate biosynthesis. The results showed that EBR significantly decreased the contents of major aliphatic glucosinolates including glucoiberin (S3), glucoraphanin (S4), and glucoerucin (T4), as well as the indolic glucosinolates glucobrassicin (IM) and neoglucobrassicin (1IM). In addition, a significantly higher level of glucosinolates accumulated in the BR-deficient mutant cpd and a dramatically lower glucosinolate content in the transgenic plant DWF4-ox overexpressing the BR biosynthetic gene DWF4 compared with their related wild-types, confirmed the repressing effect of BR on glucosinolate biosynthesis. BRI1, the receptor of BR signal transduction, was involved in regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis by BR. Furthermore, the observation of reduced content of glucosinolates and lower expression levels of glucosinolate biosynthetic genes in 35S-BZR1/bzr1-1D and bes1-D plants compared with the corresponding wild-types suggested that BZR1 and BES1, two important components in BR signal transduction, are responsible for the inhibiting role of BR in glucosinolate biosynthesis. The disappearance of the repressing effect of BR on glucosinolate content in the myb28, myb34, and myb122 mutants indicated that these three MYB factors are important for the regulation of BR in glucosinolate biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinosteroids 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglucobrassicin 3aglucoiberin 3aglucoraphanin 3amutants 3asignal transduction 3atransgenic plants 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBrassinosteroidsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aGlucosinolatesxbiosynthesis 2aNuclear Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSteroids, Heterocyclicxpharmacology 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0abrassinosteroids 0aBZR1 0aBES1 0aglucosinolates 0aMYB.1 aQian, Hongmei1 aShen, Wangshu1 aLiu, Lihong1 aZhang, Min1 aCai, Congxi1 aZhao, Yanting1 aQiao, Junjie1 aWang, Qiaomei0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 May, v. 64, no. 8 p.2401-2412dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01296naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013300158300001800291520033900309592002800648650002300676650002100699650001800720700001700738700001800755700001600773773013400789856007400923852000900997655001201006IND60660242520221120075350.0190823e20140619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066024252DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03409k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hong-Jiao12aA new class of organic photovoltaic materials: poly(rod-coil) polymers having alternative conjugated and non-conjugated segments  ap. 7720-7722.  aA new class of organic photovoltaic materials, poly(rod-coil) polymers composed of alternatively definite conjugated and non-conjugated segments, have been proposed.

However the nature of such impacts remains poorly understood. Here we use a modelling approach to compare random communities, with no trait evolutionary fine‐tuning, and co‐adapted communities, where traits have co‐evolved, in terms of emerging biodiversity–productivity, biodiversity–stability and biodiversity–invasion relationships. Community adaptation impacted most BEF relationships, sometimes inverting the slope of the relationship compared to random communities. Biodiversity–productivity relationships were generally less positive among co‐adapted communities, with reduced contribution of sampling effects. The effect of community‐adaptation, though modest regarding invasion resistance, was striking regarding invasion tolerance: co‐adapted communities could remain very tolerant to invasions even at high diversity. BEF relationships are thus contingent on the history of ecosystems and their degree of community adaptation. Short‐term experiments and observations following recent changes may not be safely extrapolated into the future, once eco‐evolutionary feedbacks have taken place.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐10‐LABX‐41cTULIP Laboratory of Excellence  aPhD fellowshipcIDEX UCA Jedi  aANR 17‐CE32‐0011‐05cANR program NGB  agrant agreement No 666971cH2020 European Research Council  cEuropean Research Council  a666971cHorizon 2020 3acoevolution 3aecosystems 3amodels1 aDavid, Patrice1 aJarne, Philippe1 aLoreau, Michel1 aMouquet, Nicolas1 aCalcagno, Vincent0 tEcology letters.g2020 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.1263-1275dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.135303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03722naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245012000204300001800324500001900342500002000361520209600381592002802477596006602505596005202571596002402623596004702647596005502694596004102749596000902790650001002799650002302809650001102832650001502843650001102858650001402869650001702883650001902900650002002919700005802939700005802997773012103055856007903176852000903255655001203264IND60699465720221121062305.0200619e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069946572DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.133522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuintero, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4979-687410aFruit resource provisioning for avian frugivores: The overlooked side of effectiveness in seed dispersal mutualisms  ap. 1358-1372.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMutualistic interactions between frugivorous birds and fleshy‐fruited plants are key processes for both natural plant regeneration and the maintenance of birds relying on fruit resources. However, seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) has been frequently studied only from the plant's perspective, that is the contribution of animals to plant fitness. Using a sample of Atlantic rainforest avian frugivores, this study presents a first comparative, empirical study of fruit effectiveness as a nutritional food resource for seed‐dispersing birds through the use of resource‐provisioning effectiveness (RPE) models. RPE is the product of the amount of fruits a frugivore can consume (quantity component) and the quality of the ingesta in terms of energy and nutrients obtained (quality component). Our results show wide variation in RPE among fleshy‐fruited plant species. Energy‐rich fruits consistently show a smaller quantity component, while energetically poor fruits are consistently the most consumed, with fruit species spanning a gradient from these two extremes. The specific RPEᵢ resulting from a pairwise fruit–frugivore interaction is positively correlated with the total RPE (RPET) that a given fruit species has for the whole frugivore assemblage. RPE therefore appears to be a characteristic feature of the fruit species, rather than of the specific frugivore partner. Only the fruit's specific energy content showed a significant phylogenetic signal, suggesting potential constraints for free covariation between RPE and SDE of fruits and frugivores. Synthesis. We analyse variation in the effectiveness of fleshy‐fruit food provisioning to avian frugivores by explicitly redefining RPE within the SDE framework. We found ample variation in RPE among plant species, showing differences in both quantity and quality components of fruit resources rewards for the frugivores. Our findings help unravel how seed‐dispersing birds may discriminate among alternative fruit resources and to understand the configuration of mutual dependencies among mutualistic partners.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2017‐82847‐PcAgencia Estatal de Investigación, Spain  aLCF/BQ/DE18/11670007c“la Caixa” Foundation  cEuropean Commission  aRNM–5731cJunta de Andalucía Excellence  cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  cFondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional  cCNPq 3abirds 3aempirical research 3aenergy 3afrugivores 3afruits 3aphylogeny 3arain forests 3aseed dispersal 3aspecific energy1 aPizo, Marco A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3103-03711 aJordano, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2142-91160 tjournal of ecology.g2020 July, v. 108, no. 4 p.1358-1372dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.133523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245010400176520141000280592002801690650002301718650001601741650002101757650001901778650001201797650001101809650001001820650001601830650001001846651001201856700003001868700002901898700001901927700002801946700002801974700002802002773012402030856008202154852000902236655001202245IND60794310420221119121030.0220922e20220902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079431042DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110910062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuntean, Maria-Doinița 10aFungal Grapevine Trunk Diseases in Romanian Vineyards in the Context of the International Situation  aVitis vinifera, known as the common grape vine, represents one of the most important fruit crops in the world. Romania is a wine-producing country with a rich and long tradition in viticulture. In the last decade, increasing reports of damage caused by grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) have raised concerns in all wine producing countries. Up to now, no study was performed regarding the GTDs situation in Romania, an important grapevine grower in Europe. In this study, we aim, after a comprehensive presentation of the fungal GTDs worldwide, to review the scientific information related to these diseases in Romania in order to open a national platform in an international framework. In order to achieve this, we consulted over 500 references from different scientific databases and cited 309 of them. Our review concludes that, in Romania, there is little amount of available literature on this matter. Three out of six fungal GTDs are reported and well documented in all of the Romanian viticultural zones (except for viticultural zone 4). These are Eutypa dieback, Phomopsis dieback, and Esca disease. Of the fungal pathogens considered responsible Eutypa lata, Phomopsis viticola and Stereum hirsutum are the most studied and well documented in Romania. Management measures are quite limited, and they mostly include preventive measures to stop the GTDs spread and the removal of affected grapevines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiaporthe ampelina 3aEutypa lata 3aStereum hirsutum 3aVitis vinifera 3adieback 3afruits 3afungi 3aviticulture 3awines 3aRomania1 aDrăgulinescu, Ana-Maria 1 aTomoiagă, Liliana Lucia1 aComșa, Maria,1 aRăcoare, Horia-Silviu 1 aSîrbu, Alexandra Doina1 aSanda Chedea, Veronica,0 tPathogens.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110910063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011400155300001600269520135800285592002801643650002301671650001301694650001001707650002101717650001101738650001401749650001401763650001401777650002001791650003101811650001001842650003501852650000901887650001801896650002201914650001201936650001401948650001201962700001301974700001401987700001502001700001902016700002102035773011002056856007402166852000902240655001202249IND60347101020221118052654.0150812e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034710102DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.123162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Danli10aMolecular cloning and functional analysis of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) homolog GhFT1 from Gossypium hirsutum  ap. 522-533.  aFLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) encodes a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine‐binding protein (PEBP) family that functions as the mobile floral signal, playing an important role in regulating the floral transition in angiosperms. We isolated an FT‐homolog (GhFT1) from Gossypium hirsutum L. cultivar, Xinluzao 33 GhFT1 was predominantly expressed in stamens and sepals, and had a relatively higher expression level during the initiation stage of fiber development. GhFT1 mRNA displayed diurnal oscillations in both long‐day and short‐day condition, suggesting that the expression of this gene may be under the control of the circadian clock. Subcellular analysis revealed that GhFT1 protein located in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Ectopic expression of GhFT1 in transgenic arabidopsis plants resulted in early flowering compared with wild‐type plants. In addition, ectopic expression of GhFT1 in arabidopsis ft‐10 mutants partially rescued the extremely late flowering phenotype. Finally, several flowering related genes functioning downstream of AtFT were highly upregulated in the 35S::GhFT1 transgenic arabidopsis plants. In summary, GhFT1 is an FT‐homologous gene in cotton that regulates flower transition similar to its orthologs in other plant species and thus it may be a candidate target for promoting early maturation in cotton breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abreeding 3acalyx 3acircadian rhythm 3acotton 3acultivars 3acytoplasm 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3aphenotype 3astamens1 aLi, Chao1 aDong, Rui1 aLi, Xiaobo1 aXiao, Xiangwen1 aHuang, Xianzhong0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2015 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.522-533dBlackwell Pub.x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.123163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02032naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245006600205300001600271520093700287592002801224650002001252650001301272650001501285650001601300650001101316650001101327650001501338650002301353700002701376700006001403700001801463773011101481856008101592852000901673655001201682IND60601689820221119211345.0180706e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060168982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2014.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVal, Marie-Eve1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7097-907210aManagement of multipartite genomes: the Vibrio cholerae model  ap. 120-126.  aA minority of bacterial species has been found to carry a genome divided among several chromosomes. Among these, all Vibrio species harbor a genome split into two chromosomes of uneven size, with distinctive replication origins whose replication firing involves common and specific factors. Most of our current knowledge on replication and segregation in multi-chromosome bacteria has come from the study of Vibrio cholerae, which is now the model organism for this field. It has been firmly established that replication of the two V. cholerae chromosomes is temporally regulated and coupled to the cell cycle, but the mediators of these processes are as yet mostly unknown. The two chromosomes are also organized along different patterns within the cell and occupy different subcellular domains. The selective advantages provided by this partitioning into two replicons are still unclear and are a key motivation for these studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae 3abacteria 3acell cycle 3achromosomes 3agenome 3amodels 3amotivation 3areplication origin1 aSoler-Bistué, Alfonso1 aBland, Michael J1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0726-61651 aMazel, Didier0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2014 Dec., v. 22 p.120-126dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03925naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013300164300001100297520247000308592002802778650001102806650002202817650002402839650002802863650002402891650001602915650001402931650001102945650002102956650002102977650001402998650002403012650002603036650002403062650001603086650001403102650001803116650002403134650000903158651001303167700001803180700001903198700002303217773009903240856008303339852000903422655001203431IND60791204020221119191926.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079120402DNAL7 a10.1186/s40795-022-00588-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirma, Abel10aDeterminants of dietary practice among pregnant women at the public hospitals in Bench-Sheko and Kaffa Zones, Southwest Ethiopia  ap. 88.  aBACKGROUNDS: The frequency of poor dietary practice due to inappropriate dietary habits is higher during pregnancy compared to any other stage of the life cycle. Suboptimal dietary practices during pregnancy can increase the risk of intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, anemia, prenatal and infant mortality, and morbidity. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the dietary practice and associated factors among pregnant women at the public hospitals of Bench-Sheko and Kaffa zone. METHODOLOGY: An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 566 pregnant women who attended antenatal care at the public hospitals of the Bench-Sheko and Kaffa zones. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to select the study units. The data were entered into Epi Data 3.1 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21 software for further analysis. Both Binary and Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between dependent and independent variables. The Crude Odd Ratio (COR) and Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence interval (CI) were calculated and the variable with P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULT: According to this study, only 23.7% (95% CI: 20.1, 27.4) of the study participants had a good dietary practice. The urban residents (AOR = 2.64; 95% CI:1.18, 5.92), monthly income of > 2000ETB (AOR = 2.47; 95% CI: 1.31,4.65), having nutrition information (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.14,5.52), good dietary knowledge (AOR = 2.79; 95% CI: 1.48,5.27), mothers occupation of employer (AOR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.04,3.42) and a family size < 5 (AOR = 3.37; 95% CI: 1.32,8.65) were determinate of dietary practice. CONCLUSION: Generally, the prevalence of good dietary practice is suboptimal in the study area. Urban residency, monthly income > 2000ETB, good dietary knowledge, having nutrition information, family size < 5, and government employed mothers were the predictors of the good dietary practice in the Bench-Sheko and Kaffa zone. Therefore, providing in-service training for health professionals and assigning nutritionist to each public hospital should be done to provide health and nutrition education; and strengthen the existed nutrition counseling service for pregnant women. Moreover, the government should create sustainable income-generating activities for pregnant women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3acomputer software 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aexperimental design 3afamily size 3ahospitals 3aincome 3ainfant mortality 3alow birth weight 3amorbidity 3anutrition education 3anutrition information 3anutrition knowledge 3aoccupations 3apregnancy 3aprenatal care 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aEthiopia1 aGenetu, Amare1 aAyalew, Ermias1 aGétāčaw Dāwit,0 tBMC nutrition.g2022 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.88-88dBioMed CentralwJournal:27315x2055-09287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40795-022-00588-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003800147245016000185520157200345592002801917650003101945650001501976650002301991650001502014650001802029650001602047650001802063650002002081650001702101650001202118650002702130650001502157650001502172650000902187650001702196650001302213700002802226700002902254700002502283700001902308700002502327700002402352700002602376700002502402773012402427856008202551852000902633655001202642IND60794310720221119120939.0220922e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079431072DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110910102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillar Corrales, M.q(Margarita),10aDifferentially Represented Proteins in Response to Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Identified by Quantitative Serum Proteomics in Asian Elephants  aTuberculosis is a major global concern. Tuberculosis in wildlife is a risk for zoonotic transmission and becoming one of the challenges for conservation globally. In elephants, the number of cases is likely rising. The aim of this study was to identify proteins related to tuberculosis infection in elephants, which could then be used for the development of diagnostic tools and/or vaccines. A serum proteomics approach was used to characterize differentially represented proteins in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Asian elephants (Elaphas maximus). Blood samples were collected from eight elephants, four of which were antibody positive for tuberculosis and four were antibody negative. Proteomics analysis identified 26 significantly dysregulated proteins in response to tuberculosis. Of these, 10 (38%) were identified as immunoglobulin and 16 (62%) as non-immunoglobulin proteins. The results provided new information on the antibody response to mycobacterial infection and biomarkers associated with tuberculosis and protective response to mycobacteria in Asian elephants. Protective mechanisms included defense against infection (Alpha-1-B glycoprotein A1BG, Serpin family A member 1 SERPINA1, Transthyretin TTR), neuroprotection (TTR), and reduced risks of inflammation, infections, and cancer (SERPINA1, Keratin 10 KRT10). Using a translational biotechnology approach, the results provided information for the identification of candidate diagnostic, prognostic, and protective antigens for monitoring and control of tuberculosis in Asian elephants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3abiomarkers 3abiotechnology 3ablood serum 3aglycoproteins 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainflammation 3akeratin 3aneuroprotective effect 3aprealbumin 3aproteomics 3arisk 3atuberculosis 3awildlife1 aRajbhandari, Rajesh Man1 aArtigas-Jerónimo, Sara 1 aContreras, Marinela 1 aSadaula, Amir 1 aKarmacharya, Dibesh 1 aAlves, Paulo Célio1 aGortázar, Christian 1 aFuente, José de la,0 tPathogens.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110910103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01773naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245009700193300001600290520078600306592002801092653001901120653002001139653002101159653002701180653002501207773013701232856011701369852000901486655001201495IND60131634020221120103904.0151127e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013163402DNAL7 a10.1638/1042-7260(2002)033[0125:DASROS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDivers, Stephen J.,10aDiagnosis and surgical repair of stifle luxation in a spur-thighed tortoise (testudo graeca)  ap. 125-130.  aThis report describes stifle luxation resultant from multiple ligamentous injuries in a spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca). Despite an absence of obvious trauma in the case history, the tortoise presented with acute, unilateral hind limb lameness. Diagnosis of stifle luxation was based on cranial drawer motion, increased rotational joint instability, and radiographic findings. Joint stabilization was accomplished by a combination of cranial cruciate reconstruction using an autograft of lateral vastus muscle in an over-the-top procedure and lateral imbrication of the joint capsule. Postoperative management included restriction of limb movement for 6 wk and parenteral chondroprotective regime. Treatment was effective in restoring clinically normal function to the limb.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTestudo graeca 0astifle luxation 0acruciate rupture 0aover-the-top procedure 0apentosan polysulfate0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2002 June, v. 33, no. 2 p.125-130dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F1042-7260%282002%29033%5B0125%3ADASROS%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007100140245010600211300001600317500002000333520160300353592002801956596007801984596004202062596004302104596008902147596009502236650001502331650002402346650002602370650002002396650002502416650001502441650001502456650001402471650004302485650002302528650002102551650001602572700006802588700001902656700003002675700003302705773013602738856007402874852000902948655001202957IND60701099420221121020540.0200706e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070109942DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.124152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, Flávio Siqueira de1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5533-135510aEnvironmental drivers of taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities in a tropical mountain  ap. 393-403.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe investigated the patterns of taxonomic (TD) and functional (FD) α and β‐diversities of ants in a mountainous landscape along three dimensions, namely one temporal (seasonal) and two spatial dimensions: between habitats – grassland and forest habitats (horizontal), and among elevation bands (vertical). In addition, we tested the effects of environmental variables (mean elevation and temperature, and normalised difference vegetation index – NDVI) on taxonomic and functional α‐ and β‐diversities. β diversities among the two spatial dimensions are the main components of TD. Conversely, FD is almost entirely composed by the α‐diversity component, with a very low contribution of β‐diversity. Regarding environmental drivers, the decrease in temperature caused by increased elevations and seasonal variations had a negative effect on taxonomic α‐diversity. There were no effects of environmental variables on ant functional α‐diversity. Despite the high turnover of ant species occurring along spatial dimensions, the communities were functionally redundant. The changes in species richness and composition patterns in this mountain were strongly influenced by variables correlated with elevation and habitat structure. Species composition changed across all dimensions, but the core traits and functions remained unchanged. Differences observed in the composition of ant communities over relatively short geographic distances highlight the importance to conserve the entire mountain, ensuring the maintenance of the ant diversity and associated ecosystem functions.  aPublisher supplied data  aCode 001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  cCompanhia Energética de Minas Gerais  cAgência Nacional de Energia Elétrica  aCRA ‐ APQ‐00311‐15cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais  aPELD ‐ 441515/ 2016‐9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aFormicidae 3aecological function 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest habitats 3afunctional diversity 3agrasslands 3alandscapes 3amountains 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies richness 3atemperature1 aDa Silva, Pedro Giovâni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0702-91861 aSolar, Ricardo1 aFernandes, Geraldo Wilson1 aNeves, Frederico de Siqueira0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2020 July, v. 13, no. 4 p.393-403dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.124153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009900154300001600253520119200269592002801461650001301489650001501502650001601517650001601533650001001549650001901559650001301578650001601591700002101607700002001628773011001648856007401758852000901832655001201841IND60347101720221118052714.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034710172DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.122952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Meng10aCRISPR Primer Designer: Design primers for knockout and chromosome imaging CRISPR‐Cas system  ap. 613-617.  aThe clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)‐associated system enables biologists to edit genomes precisely and provides a powerful tool for perturbing endogenous gene regulation, modulation of epigenetic markers, and genome architecture. However, there are concerns about the specificity of the system, especially the usages of knocking out a gene. Previous designing tools either were mostly built‐in websites or ran as command‐line programs, and none of them ran locally and acquired a user‐friendly interface. In addition, with the development of CRISPR‐derived systems, such as chromosome imaging, there were still no tools helping users to generate specific end‐user spacers. We herein present CRISPR Primer Designer for researchers to design primers for CRISPR applications. The program has a user‐friendly interface, can analyze the BLAST results by using multiple parameters, score for each candidate spacer, and generate the primers when using a certain plasmid. In addition, CRISPR Primer Designer runs locally and can be used to search spacer clusters, and exports primers for the CRISPR‐Cas system‐based chromosome imaging system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abiologists 3achromosomes 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3aplasmids 3aresearchers1 aZhou, Shi‐Rong1 aXue, Hong‐Wei0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2015 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.613-617dBlackwell Pub.x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.122953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01654naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014100158300001800299520032900317592002800646650001500674650001900689650002100708650002700729650001500756650001400771650001400785650006600799650001400865650001100879650002700890700001800917700001500935700001400950700001600964700001800980700001600998773013401014856007501148852000901223655001201232IND60659043120221118200931.0190827e20110823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065904312DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13166d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiao-Shui12aA magnetite/oxidized carbon nanotube composite used as an adsorbent and a matrix of MALDI-TOF-MS for the determination of benzo[a]pyrene  ap. 9816-9818.  aA magnetite/oxidized carbon nanotube composite, Fe₃O₄@SiO₂/OCNT, was fabricated in a simple way, and it was successfully used as a magnetic solid-phase extraction sorbent and a significant matrix of the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) for the detection of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical communication 3adesorption 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3asilica 3asolid phase extraction1 aWu, Jian-Hong1 aXu, Li-Dan1 aZhao, Qin1 aLuo, Yan-Bo1 aYuan, Bi-Feng1 aFeng, Yu-Qi0 tChemical communications.g2011 Aug. 23, v. 47, no. 35 p.9816-9818dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc13166d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245006500179520120100244592002801445650001901473650002001492650001101512650002201523650001001545650001101555650001901566650001901585700001801604700002801622700001601650700001501666773012401681856008201805852000901887655001201896IND60794310820221119120932.0220922e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079431082DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110910092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyelami, Favour Oluwapelumi10aEmerging Roles of Noncoding RNAs in Bovine Mastitis Diseases  aNon-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are an abundant class of RNA with varying nucleotide lengths. They have been shown to have great potential in eutherians/human disease diagnosis and treatments and are now gaining more importance for the improvement of diseases in livestock. To date, thousands of ncRNAs have been discovered in the bovine genome and the continuous advancement in deep sequencing technologies and various bioinformatics tools has enabled the elucidation of their roles in bovine health. Among farm animals’ diseases, mastitis, a common inflammatory disease in cattle, has caused devastating economic losses to dairy farmers over the last few decades. Here, we summarize the biology of bovine mastitis and comprehensively discuss the roles of ncRNAs in different types of mastitis infection. Based on our findings and relevant literature, we highlighted various evidence of ncRNA roles in mastitis. Different approaches (in vivo versus in vitro) for exploring ncRNA roles in mastitis are emphasized. More particularly, the potential applications of emerging genome editing technologies, as well as integrated omics platforms for ncRNA studies and implications for mastitis are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3abovine mastitis 3acattle 3adisease diagnosis 3afarms 3agenome 3ahuman diseases 3anon-coding RNA1 aUsman, Tahir 1 aSuravajhala, Prashanth 1 aAli, Nawab 1 aDo, Duy N.0 tPathogens.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110910093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01535naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010600167300001600273520024600289592002800535650002000563650001300583650001400596650002600610650001600636650002800652650002300680650003500703651001000738653002700748653001000775653001100785653002000796653001700816653002000833653001800853700002000871700001800891773010200909856008101011852000901092655001201101IND60564315420221119042726.0170318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056431542DNAL7 a10.1556/034.59.2017.1-2.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Manju C.,10aCololejeunea manilalia (Lejeuneaceae, Marchantiophyta), a new species from the Western Ghats of India  ap. 261-268.  aCololejeunea manilalia sp. nov., an epiphyllous leafy liverwort, collected from the high altitude, tropical wet evergreen shola (cloud forest) of the New Amarambalam Reserved Forest in the Western Ghats of India is described and illustrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarchantiophyta 3aaltitude 3aepiphytes 3amosses and liverworts 3anew species 3ascientific illustration 3ataxon descriptions 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aIndia 0aCololejeunea manilalia 0aIndia 0aKerala 0aleafy liverwort 0aLejeuneaceae 0aNew Amarambalam 0aWestern Ghats1 aChandini, V.

In this study, the transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants with modulated expressions of two cysteine desulfhydrases, and exogenous H₂S donor (sodium hydrosulfide, NaHS) and H₂S scavenger (hypotaurine, HT) pre‐treated plants were used to dissect the involvement of H₂S in plant stress responses. The cysteine desulfhydrases overexpressing plants and NaHS pre‐treated plants exhibited higher endogenous H₂S level and improved abiotic stress tolerance and biotic stress resistance, while cysteine desulfhydrases knockdown plants and HT pre‐treated plants displayed lower endogenous H₂S level and decreased stress resistance. Moreover, H₂S upregulated the transcripts of multiple abiotic and biotic stress‐related genes, and inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Interestingly, MIR393‐mediated auxin signaling including MIR393a/b and their target genes (TIR1, AFB1, AFB2, and AFB3) was transcriptionally regulated by H₂S, and was related with H₂S‐induced antibacterial resistance. Moreover, H₂S regulated 50 carbon metabolites including amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, and aromatic amines. Taken together, these results indicated that cysteine desulfhydrase and H₂S conferred abiotic stress tolerance and biotic stress resistance, via affecting the stress‐related gene expressions, ROS metabolism, metabolic homeostasis, and MIR393‐targeted auxin receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabiotic stress 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaromatic amines 3aauxins 3abiotic stress 3acarbon 3acysteine 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aorganic acids and salts 3aplant stress 3areactive oxygen species 3areceptors 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3asugar alcohols 3atranscription (genetics)1 aYe, Tiantian1 aHan, Ning1 aBian, Hongwu1 aLiu, Xiaodong1 aChan, Zhulong0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2015 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.628-640dBlackwell Pub.x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.123023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013400155300001800289520100600307592002801313650004401341650002201385650001501407650000901422650001501431650002101446650002101467650001101488650003701499650003701536700001701573700001201590773012801602856007501730852000901805655001201814IND60777719320221119023406.0220520e20220519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077771932DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ay00199c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yaju10aAptamer-conjugated MoS₂ for enrichment and direct detection of small molecules in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry  ap. 1841-1846.  aIn this work, MoS₂ nanosheets were synthesized by the chemical exfoliation method and then modified with a thiol-terminated aptamer via a simple thiol functionalization route. The as-made nanomaterial was characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. By integrating the advantages of MoS₂ nanosheets and the recognition ability of aptamers, the functionalized nanomaterial has been successfully employed for simultaneous enrichment and analysis of sulfadimethoxine by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS). The aptamer-conjugated MoS₂ showed an excellent capture ability to eliminate background signals from the species co-existing in a milk sample. The simplicity of the synthesis method and the excellent performance of aptamer-conjugated MoS₂ make it an ideal candidate for application in selective MS analysis of the target analyte from complex samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3adesorption 3amilk 3ananosheets 3aoligonucleotides 3asulfadimethoxine 3athiols 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aLiao, Qiaobo1 aXi, Kai0 tAnalytical methods.g2022 May 19, v. 14, no. 19 p.1841-1846dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ay00199c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016300157300001600320500002000336520160100356592002801957596005501985596005902040650003802099650001402137650001002151650001202161650001302173650002202186650002302208650002302231650001802254650001402272650001802286650002302304650002202327650002102349651001002370700002002380700001302400700001202413700005602425700002802481773013602509856007402645852000902719655001202728IND60701099620221121030400.0200706e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070109962DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.124102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaojie10aDiversity and seasonal changes in carabid assemblages of a mature, secondary and plantation forest mosaic in the Zhangguangcai Mountains in northeastern China  ap. 340-350.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhile China is promoting the re‐establishment of forests across the country on a globally unprecedented scale, the biodiversity harboured by the resulting secondary and plantation forests remains poorly understood. Here, we assess the carabid diversity at Zhangguangcai Mountains in northeastern China that comprise a unique mosaic of mature forest remnants, secondary forests and forest plantations. We located pitfall traps in five distinct forest types: mature conifer and mature mixed forest, secondary mixed forest, secondary broadleaved forest dominated by birch (Betula platyphylla) and poplar (Populus davidiana), and in larch plantations. We recorded 9073 carabid beetles representing 42 species, with richness, abundance and diversity of ground beetles all peaking in secondary broadleaved forests. Assemblages sampled in larch plantations were least species rich, but species extrapolation curves indicate a potentially high overall species richness. Carabid communities were clearly differentiated according to forest type, with larch plantations and secondary broadleaved forests containing beetle assemblages distinct from the other three forest types, while the mixed secondary and mature forest types harboured similar assemblages. Carabid communities also showed a clear seasonality in all forest types, with the plantation forest communities remaining distinctly different from the clustered communities of the mature and mixed secondary forest types throughout the year. Broadleaved secondary forest assemblages occupy an intermediate position throughout the sampling season.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC0506402cMinistry of Science and Technology  a31770567cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aBetula pendula subsp. mandshurica 3aCarabidae 3aLarix 3aPopulus 3aconifers 3adeciduous forests 3aforest communities 3aforest plantations 3amixed forests 3amountains 3apitfall traps 3aseasonal variation 3asecondary forests 3aspecies richness 3aChina1 aDiekman, Maryse1 aYan, Xin1 aZou, Yi1 aSang, Weiguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7131-896X1 aAxmacher, Jan Christoph0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2020 July, v. 13, no. 4 p.340-350dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.124103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001400170245013100184300001600315520171900331592002802050650002402078650001202102650000902114650001602123650001102139650001502150650000902165650001102174650001802185650001802203650001802221650001202239650001802251650001802269650002302287650001502310650001302325700001702338700001902355700001902374700001602393700001302409773010202422856008702524852000902611655001202620IND4467053720221118013416.0141112e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446705372DNAL7 a227501712pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.05.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBossy, A.10aContributions of natural arsenic sources to surface waters on a high grade arsenic-geochemical anomaly (French Massif Central)  ap. 257-268.  aThe subwatershed studied drains a non-exploited area of the St-Yrieix-la-Perche gold mining district (French Massif Central) and it is located on an arsenic (As) geochemical anomaly. In this context, it is important to know the geochemical processes involved in the transfer of As from solid environmental compartments to the aquatic system. The stream showed a temporal variation of dissolved As (Asd) content from 69.4μg.L⁻¹ in the low flow period to 7.5μg.L⁻¹ in the high flow period. Upstream, ground- and wetland waters had Asd concentrations up to 215 and 169μg.L⁻¹, respectively. The main representative As sources were determined at the subwatershed scale with in-situ monitoring of major and trace element contents in different waters and single extraction experiments. The As sources to stream water could be regrouped into two components: (i) one As-rich group (mainly in the low flow period) with groundwater, gallery exploration outlet waters and wetland waters, and (ii) one As-poor group (mainly in the high flow period) with rainwaters and soil solutions. In the soil profile, Asd showed a significant decrease from 52.4μg.L⁻¹ in the 0–5cm superficial soil horizon to 14.4μg.L⁻¹ in the 135–165cm deep soil horizon. This decrease may be related to pedogenic processes and suggests an evolution of As-bearing phase stability through the soil profile. Quantification of Asd fluxes at the subwatershed scale showed that groundwater was the major input (>80%) of Asd to surface water. Moreover, natural weathering of the As-rich solid phases showed an impact on the As release, mainly from superficial soil horizons with runoff contributing about 5% to As input in surface water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3aarsenic 3agold 3agroundwater 3amining 3amonitoring 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil horizons 3asoil profiles 3asoil solution 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3aweathering 3awetlands1 aGrosbois, C.1 aHendershot, W.1 aBeauchemin, S.1 aCrouzet, C.1 aBril, H.0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 432 p.257-268dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.05.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03951naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245012400202300001800326500001900344500002000363520230800383592002802691596005702719650002402776650001702800650002402817650001502841650001502856650001002871650001502881650001002896650002102906650001102927650001302938650002602951650002002977650001502997650000903012650002103021650001403042650001303056650001903069700006003088700002003148700001903168700002503187773012103212856007903333852000903412655001203421IND60699466120221121082509.0200619e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069946612DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.133712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraff, Pamela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6042-267310aProtection offered by leaf fungal endophytes to an invasive species against native herbivores depends on soil nutrients  ap. 1592-1604.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNatural grassland ecosystems are increasingly threatened by excessive loadings of nutrients and by the presence of species bred for high productivity. By manipulating grazing regimes and nutrient availability, agricultural practices facilitate the establishment and spread of certain forage plant species outside managed landscapes, challenging local biodiversity. The ecological success of some species in the invaded range sometimes seems to be associated with the symbiosis with foliar fungal endophytes. Symbiotic fungi may increase the competitiveness of host species, but also the resistance to herbivory through the production of toxic secondary compounds such as alkaloids. While progress has been made in understanding how soil nutrients modulate other benefits offered by fungal endophytes to plants (e.g. stress tolerance, competitive ability, etc), the consequences for a higher trophic level (i.e. herbivores) and the potential feedbacks on plant invasion have not been explored yet. We explored the relative and interactive importance of soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in modulating the interaction of the invasive grass tall fescue—associated with fungal endophytes—and native herbivores in a natural grassland. We hypothesized that N and P nutrients modulate differentially leaf quality traits, namely nutritional value and fungal alkaloid contents, determining the level of damage by native insect herbivores on the exotic tall fescue. We found that only the addition of P significantly increased native caterpillar density in the field, which corresponded to a concomitant increase in leaf damage. In contrast to expectations, the concentration of the alkaloid ergovaline in leaves was not strongly related to N. It was the level of soil P which dictated the concentration of the element (P) in the leaves and reduced the level of defence against herbivores in this endophyte‐symbiotic species. Then, herbivore performance increased, and plants were more prone to be attacked. Synthesis. Our study indicates a strong control of soil P fertility on the triple interaction among plants, fungal endophytes and native herbivores. This highlights the potential role of increased soil nutrients on the invasion spread of endophyte‐symbiotic forage plants in natural grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data  aUBACYT 20020130100423BAcUniversidad de Buenos Aires 3aFestuca arundinacea 3abiodiversity 3aecological invasion 3aendophytes 3aergovaline 3afungi 3agrasslands 3ahosts 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutritive value 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3astress tolerance 3asymbiosis 3atoxicity 3atrophic levels1 aGundel, Pedro E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3246-02821 aSalvat, Adriana1 aCristos, Diego1 aChaneton, Enrique J.0 tjournal of ecology.g2020 July, v. 108, no. 4 p.1592-1604dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.133713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01457naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006300169300001600232500001900248520038200267592002800649650001500677650001300692650001200705651001300717653002000730653001900750653001900769653002000788700002100808700002300829700002700852773012500879856008201004852000901086655001201095IND60721979220221120143515.0201229e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072197922DNAL7 a10.1649/0010-065X-74.4.7862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephan, Karl H.14aThe Aderidae (Coleoptera) of Latimer County, Oklahoma, USA  ap. 786-790.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn intensive survey of the Aderidae (Coleoptera) of Latimer County, Oklahoma, USA was conducted during 1984–1985.

The biosynthesis of sterols and BRs as well as the signalling cascade they induce in plants have been elucidated largely through metabolic studies and the analysis of mutants in Arabidopsis and rice. Only fragmentary details about BR signalling in other plant species are known. Here a forward genetics strategy was used in Petunia hybrida, by which 19 families with phenotypic alterations typical for BR deficiency mutants were identified. In all mutants, the endogenous BR levels were severely reduced. In seven families, the tagged genes were revealed as the petunia BR biosynthesis genes CYP90A1 and CYP85A1 and the BR receptor gene BRI1. In addition, several homologues of key regulators of the BR signalling pathway were cloned from petunia based on homology with their Arabidopsis counterparts, including the BRI1 receptor, a member of the BES1/BZR1 transcription factor family (PhBEH2), and two GSK3-like kinases (PSK8 and PSK9). PhBEH2 was shown to interact with PSK8 and 14-3-3 proteins in yeast, revealing similar interactions to those during BR signalling in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, PhBEH2 also interacted with proteins implicated in other signalling pathways. This suggests that PhBEH2 might function as an important hub in the cross-talk between diverse signalling pathways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3arice 3aArabidopsis 3abiosynthesis 3aplant hormones 3aPetunia hybrida 3abrassinosteroids 3agrowth and development 3ayeasts 3agenes 3amutants 3ametabolic studies 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBrassinosteroidsxbiosynthesis 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenes, Plantxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMutationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPetuniaxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSignal Transductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSteroid Hydroxylasesxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aBRI1 0akinases 0adwarf 0aBES1 0aBIN2 0aBZR1 0aproteins 0aSEC. 0acompact disc1 aYokota, Takao1 aShibata, Kyomi1 ade Boer, Gert-Jan1 aGerats, Tom1 aVandenbussche, Michiel1 aKoes, Ronald1 aSouer, Erik0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 May, v. 64, no. 8 p.2435-2448dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245015800202300001600360520159100376536026801967592002802235596010202263650001002365650002302375650001502398650002702413650001902440650001102459650001702470650000902487650001402496650001002510650001802520650002202538650001202560650000902572651001002581653002802591653001802619653001902637653001802656700002402674700001802698700006602716700002202782700002402804773011902828856008202947852000903029655001203038IND60791204420221119192008.0220826e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079120442DNAL7 a10.1177/037957212210783612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuri, Seema1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1525-419910aSensory Trial of Quintuple Fortified Salt—Salt Fortified With Iodine, Iron, Folic Acid, Vitamin B₁₂, and Zinc—Among Consumers in New Delhi, India  ap. 340-350.  aMicronutrient deficiencies are a cause of significant public health burden and loss of gross domestic product, especially in developing countries. Multiple fortified salt can potentially address this challenge at scale and in a cost-effective manner. This laboratory-based sensory trial evaluated the acceptability of quintuple fortified salt (Q₅FS), that is, iodized salt (IS) fortified with additional 4 micronutrients: iron, folic acid, vitamin B₁₂, and zinc. Iodized salt and double fortified salt (DFS), that is, IS fortified with iron, are used for comparison. Forty-five respondents were recruited by open invitations to the university staff and their families. Each study participant rated 10 food items each in a set of 3 identical preparations differing only in the salt used. A 5-point hedonic scale was used to rate each dish on 6 sensory attributes: appearance, color, aroma, taste, texture, and aftertaste. Finally, the dish was rated on the attribute of overall acceptability—a subjective combined score based on all sensory attributes considered together. Among the 3 salt types, there was no difference in scores for the sensory attributes of appearance, aroma, taste, texture, and aftertaste, and the attribute of overall acceptability. Color in IS scored significantly higher than in Q₅FS and DFS, but there was no difference between the scores of DFS and Q₅FS. The 3 salts IS, DFS, and Q₅FS are comparable to each other in all sensory properties, except for color. This study concludes that Q₅FS is organoleptically acceptable under ideal conditions.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through grant # OPP1151531 to the University of Toronto.  aPublisher supplied data  aOPP1151531cBill and Melinda Gates Foundationdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100000865 3acolor 3acost effectiveness 3afolic acid 3agross domestic product 3ahedonic scales 3aiodine 3aiodized salt 3airon 3anutrition 3aodors 3apublic health 3ataste sensitivity 3atexture 3azinc 3aIndia 0amultiple fortified salt 0afortification 0amicronutrients 0asensory trial1 aRekhi, Tejmeet Kaur1 aThomas, Tinku1 aJadhav, Meena Haribhau1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0224-20651 aMannar, Venkatesh1 aDiosady, Levente L.0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g2022 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.340-350dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x1564-82657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/037957212210783613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245012300162500001400285520145200299592002801751650002501779650001901804650001401823650001601837650003001853650001701883650002001900650001601920650001301936700002201949700002001971700003101991700003102022700002702053773012102080856007502201852000902276655001202285IND60711630720221118121555.0200928e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163072DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100915402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeloumi, Dhekra 10aInflammatory Correlated Response in Two Lines of Rabbit Selected Divergently for Litter Size Environmental Variability  aNAL-light  aA divergent selection experiment for environmental variance of litter size variance was carried out in rabbits over thirteen generations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response in the two lines of the experiment, in order to analyse the effect of selection on susceptibility to diseases after challenging to stressful situations, such as 24 h after the first delivery. A total of 78 females were used in this study, 39 from each line. The line selected for litter size heterogeneity (the high line) showed lower white blood leukocyte count (WBC; -0.87 × 10³/µL), lower percentage of basophils (-0.11%), higher concentration of TNF-α (+13.8 pg/mL), and greater concentration of CRP (+38.1 µg/mL) than the line selected for litter size homogeneity (the low line). The high line had also higher concentrations of bilirubin, cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared to the low line (difference between lines were +0.08 µmol/L, +0.14 µmol/L, +0.35 U/L and +2.4 U/L, respectively). The high line showed higher inflammatory response than the low line, in accordance with a larger susceptibility to infectious disorders. In conclusion, the line selected to increase litter size environmental variability seems to have poor capacity coping with environmental stressors. Therefore, selection for litter size environmental variability can be a useful way to improve animal welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal welfare 3abilirubin 3acholesterol 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3ainflammation 3aleukocyte count 3alitter size 3avariance1 aBlasco, Agustín,1 aMuelas, Raquel 1 aSantacreu, María  Antonia1 aGarcía, María  de la Luz1 aArgente, María-José 0 tAnimals.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100915403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002200181245011400203300001800317500001500335506007600350520169300426592002802119506003702147650001902184650001602203650001102219650001902230650001402249650001702263650001102280650001502291650001102306650001302317650001102330650001402341650001902355650001202374650001702386650001602403650001302419650001202432650001302444650001402457650004502471650003302516650003402549650001702583653001102600653001402611653002002625653001402645653001502659653001002674700001902684700001702703700002202720700002702742700002202769773012102791856007402912852000902986655001202995IND60118911320221207111433.0141127e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011891132DNAL7 a235992772pmid7 aPMC36544312pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobson, Paul R.H.10aVariation in canopy duration in the perennial biofuel crop Miscanthus reveals complex associations with yield  ap. 2373-2383.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnergy crops can provide a sustainable source of power and fuels, and mitigate the negative effects of CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel use. Miscanthus is a perennial C4 energy crop capable of producing large biomass yields whilst requiring low levels of input. Miscanthus is largely unimproved and therefore there could be significant opportunities to increase yield. Further increases in yield will improve the economics, energy balance, and carbon mitigation of the crop, as well as reducing land-take. One strategy to increase yield in Miscanthus is to maximize the light captured through an extension of canopy duration. In this study, canopy duration was compared among a diverse collection of 244 Miscanthus genotypes. Canopy duration was determined by calculating the number of days between canopy establishment and senescence. Yield was positively correlated with canopy duration. Earlier establishment and later senescence were also both separately correlated with higher yield. However, although genotypes with short canopy durations were low yielding, not all genotypes with long canopy durations were high yielding. Differences of yield between genotypes with long canopy durations were associated with variation in stem and leaf traits. Different methodologies to assess canopy duration traits were investigated, including visual assessment, image analysis, light interception, and different trait thresholds. The highest correlation coefficients were associated with later assessments of traits and the use of quantum sensors for canopy establishment. A model for trait optimization to enable yield improvement in Miscanthus and other bioenergy crops is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3acanopy 3aimage analysis 3aeconomics 3aenergy crops 3amodels 3aMiscanthus 3acarbon 3agenotype 3aleaves 3aemissions 3aenergy balance 3abiomass 3afossil fuels 2aAgriculture 2aBiofuels 2aBiomass 2aGenotype 2aPhenotype 2aPoaceaexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aTime Factors 0ayield. 0aphenotype 0acanopy duration 0aBioenergy 0asenescence 0atrait1 aFarrar, Kerrie1 aGay, Alan P.1 aJensen, Elaine F.1 aClifton-Brown, John C.1 aDonnison, Iain S.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 May, v. 64, no. 8 p.2373-2383dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015000170300001600320520063600336536021700972592002801189596001301217650002201230650002201252650001101274650001901285650002001304650001901324650001401343650001201357650001701369653001401386653001901400653001201419653003501431653002901466653003401495700001201529700001901541700001801560700001801578700001301596700001201609700001801621773012701639856008601766852000901852655001201861IND60679270920221119060121.0210310e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067927092DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2018.15621112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hui-Hui10a2-Cys Prx plays a critical role in scavenging H₂O₂ and protecting photosynthetic function in leaves of tobacco seedlings under drought stress  ap. 119-128.  aDrought stress led to a decrease in PSII photochemical activity in tobacco leaves and the blockage of electron transfer, especially from Q A to Q B on PSII acceptor side.

It also improved stomatal limitation and net photosynthetic rate of tobacco seedlings and reduced its PSII photoinhibition under drought stress which promoted the ability of PSII electron transfer.  aThis work was supported by The Northeast Agricultural University Young Talents and SIPT project of Northeast Agricultural University and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Number 31500323).  aPublisher supplied data  a31500323 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3aphotochemistry 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosystem II 3aseedlings 3atobacco 3awater stress 0a2-Cys Prx 0aoverexpression 0atobacco 0aphotosynthetic characteristics 0achlorophyll fluorescence 0areactive oxygen species (ROS)1 aXu, Nan1 aTeng, Zhi-Yuan1 aWang, Jun-Rui1 aMa, Songliang1 aWu, Xuye1 aLi, Xin1 aSun, Guang-Yu0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 14, no. 1 p.119-128dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000112x1742-91537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2018.15621113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007700172300001800249520154200267592002801809650002301837650001601860650001901876650002701895650001501922650001901937650001101956650002501967650001801992650001502010650001902025650001202044650001302056650003002069650002402099650001202123653001302135653002602148653002002174653001602194653001802210653003602228700002202264700001902286700002602305700002102331700002702352700002502379700002102404700002202425700002002447700002202467700002202489773014902511856008302660852000902743655001202752IND60533231120221121060847.0181120e20150904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053323112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValiante, Salvatore10aExpression and potential role of the peptide orexin-A in prostate cancer  ap. 1290-1296.  aThe peptides orexin-A and orexin-B and their G protein-coupled OX1 and OX2 receptors are involved in multiple physiological processes in the central nervous system and peripheral organs. Altered expression or signaling dysregulation of orexins and their receptors have been associated with a wide range of human diseases including narcolepsy, obesity, drug addiction, and cancer. Although orexin-A, its precursor molecule prepro-orexin and OX1 receptor have been detected in the human normal and hyperplastic prostate tissues, their expression and function in the prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be addressed. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the immunohistochemical localization of orexin-A in human PCa specimens, and the expression of prepro-orexin and OX1 receptor at both protein and mRNA levels in these tissues. Orexin-A administration to the human androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma cells LNCaP up-regulates OX1 receptor expression resulting in a decrease of cell survival. Noteworthy, nanomolar concentrations of the peptide counteract the testosterone-induced nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor in the cells: the orexin-A action is prevented by the addition of the OX1 receptor antagonist SB-408124 to the test system. These findings indicate that orexin-A/OX1 receptor interaction interferes with the activity of the androgen receptor which regulates PCa onset and progression, thus suggesting that orexin-A and its receptor might represent novel therapeutic targets to challenge this aggressive cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandrogen receptors 3aantagonists 3acell viability 3acentral nervous system 3adrug abuse 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3anarcolepsy 3aneoplasm cells 3aobesity 3apeptides 3aperipheral nervous system 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atissues 0aOrexin-A 0aReceptor 1 for orexin 0aProstate cancer 0aLNCaP cells 0aCell survival 0aAndrogen receptor translocation1 aLiguori, Giovanna1 aTafuri, Simona1 aPavone, Luigi Michele1 aCampese, Roberto1 aMonaco, R.q(Roberto),1 aIachetta, Giuseppina1 aAssisi, Loredana1 aMirabella, Nicola1 aForte, Maurizio1 aCostagliola, Anna1 aVittoria, Alfredo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 464, no. 4 p.1290-1296dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01558naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014200154300001800296520030200314592002800616650002700644650002300671650002600694650001300720650001200733650001800745650001700763650001700780700001600797700002400813700001900837700001800856700002200874700002300896700002300919773013400942856007501076852000901151655001201160IND60659043420221118202013.0190827e20110830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065904342DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13170b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yong12aA mesoporous metal–organic framework constructed from a nanosized C₃-symmetric linker and [Cu₂₄(isophthalate)₂₄] cuboctahedra  ap. 9995-9997.  aThe mesoporous framework [Cu₃(L)(H₂O)₃]·(DMF)₃₅·(H₂O)₃₅ (NOTT-119) shows on desolvation a BET surface area of 4118(200) m² g⁻¹, a pore volume of 2.35 cm³ g⁻¹, a total H₂ uptake of 101 mg g⁻¹ at 60 bar, 77 K and a total CH₄ uptake of 327 mg g⁻¹ at 80 bar, 298 K.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acoordination polymers 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3ananomaterials 3aporous media 3asurface area1 aYang, Sihai1 aBlake, Alexander J.1 aLewis, William1 aPoirier, Eric1 aBarnett, Sarah A.1 aChampness, Neil R.1 aSchröder, Martin,0 tChemical communications.g2011 Aug. 30, v. 47, no. 36 p.9995-9997dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc13170b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245018100172300001400353520178100367592002802148650003002176650000802206650001802214650001602232650002802248650002302276650001302299650001902312650001702331650001102348650002402359650002002383650001602403650001102419650001102430650001602441650001502457653003202472653003002504653002102534653003502555653002202590700002102612700001702633700001802650773011102668856008602779852000902865655001202874IND60600243120221119070546.0180703e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060024312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanaan, Mohamad10aNew airborne pathogen transport model for upper-room UVGI spaces conditioned by chilled ceiling and mixed displacement ventilation: Enhancing air quality and energy performance  ap. 50-61.  aThe maximum allowable return air ratio in chilled ceiling (CC) and mixed displacement ventilation (DV) system for good air quality is regulated by acceptable levels of CO2 concentration not to exceed 700ppm and airborne bacterial count to satisfy World Health Organization (WHO) requirement for bacterial count not to exceed 500CFU/m³. Since the CC/DV system relies on buoyancy effects for driving the contaminated air upwards, infectious particles will recirculate in the upper zone allowing effective utilization of upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) to clean return air. The aim of this work is to develop a new airborne bacteria transport plume-multi-layer zonal model at low computational cost to predict bacteria concentration distribution in mixed CC/DV conditioned room without and with upper-room UVGI installed. The results of the simplified model were compared with layer-averaged concentration predictions of a detailed and experimentally-validated 3-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model.The comparison showed good agreement between bacteria transport model results and CFD predictions of room air bacteria concentration with maximum error of ±10.4CFU/m³ in exhaust air. The simplified model captured the vertical bacteria concentration distribution in room air as well as the locking effect of highest concentration happening at the stratification level.The developed bacteria transport model was used in a case study to determine the return air mixing ratio that minimizes energy consumption and maintains acceptable IAQ with and without UVGI. Results showed that the use of upper-room UVGI resulted in 35% in energy saving, whereas the use of in-duct UVGI achieved no more than 12% energy saving, both compared to 100% fresh air case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aairborne microorganisms 3aairborne pathogens 3abacteria 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3afluid mechanics 3airradiation 3amixing 3amodels 3aplate count 3aprediction 0aModeling bacteria transport 0aUV germicidal irradiation 0aAir disinfection 0aMixed displacement ventilation 0aEnergy efficiency1 aGhaddar, Nesreen1 aGhali, Kamel1 aAraj, Georges0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Sept., v. 85 p.50-61dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009500163520139400258592002801652650002901680650001301709650002101722650002001743650002001763650001001783650001401793650001501807650002201822650002901844650001401873650001401887650001501901650001401916650001101930650001701941700001501958700001901973700001601992700001702008700001902025700001702044773012402061856008202185852000902267655001202276IND60794311220221119120905.0220922e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079431122DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110910122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiao 10aIdentification and Evolutionary Relationship of Corynebacterium striatum Clinical Isolates  aCorynebacterium striatum has developed into a new community-acquired and hospital-acquired multi-drug resistance (MDR) bacterium, and is a potential target pathogen for infection control and antibacterial management projects. In this study, non-duplicate samples of inpatients were collected from a local central hospital. Mass spectrometry showed that 54 C. striatum isolates mainly appeared in secretion and sputum from 14 departments. Protein fingerprint cluster analysis showed that the isolates were divided into four groups, most of which appeared in summer. The drug resistance test showed that all strains had multi-drug resistance, with high resistance rates to lincosamides, quinolones and tetracycline detected. Further analysis of the phylogenetic tree of C. striatum was conducted by cloning the 16S rRNA gene. It was found that isolates in the same department had high homology and tended to be located in the same branch or to be crossed in the same main branch. The strains in the same evolutionary branch group had the same drug resistance. Screening of site-specific recombinant elements revealed that 18 strains had integrase genes with the same sequence. This study shows that there may be mobile genetic elements in clinical isolates that drive gene exchange among strains, thus causing the cross-infection, spread and evolution of pathogenic bacteria in the hospital.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium striatum 3abacteria 3acluster analysis 3across infection 3adisease control 3agenes 3ahospitals 3aintegrases 3amass spectrometry 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aquinolones 3asecretion 3asummer 3atetracycline1 aPei, Jiao 1 aLiu, Mingming 1 aHuang, Rui 1 aLi, Jiqiang 1 aLiao, Shiying 1 aLiang, Jian 0 tPathogens.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110910123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010500162300001800267520129000285592002801575650001501603650002201618650001801640650001101658650002301669650001201692650001101704653002401715653002101739653001801760653001801778653003001796700001801826700001601844700002301860700002601883773012401909856008002033852000902113655001202122IND60564315820221119043011.0170318e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056431582DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b125882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Nikita10aHighly Conformal Ni Micromesh as a Current Collecting Front Electrode for Reduced Cost Si Solar Cell  ap. 8634-8640.  aDespite relatively high manufacturing cost, crystalline-Si solar cell continues to hold promising future due to its high energy conversion efficiency and long life. As regards cost, one pertinent issue is the top electrode metallization of textured cell surface, which typically involves screen printing of silver paste. The associated disadvantages call for alternative methods that can lower the cost without compromising the solar cell efficiency. In the present work, a highly interconnected one-dimensional (1D) metal wire network has been employed as front electrode on conventional Si wafers. Here, for the first time, we report an innovative solution based crackle templating method for conformal metal wire network patterning over large textured surfaces. Laser beam induced current mapping showed uniform photocurrent collection by the electrodes without any shadow losses. With electroless deposition of Ni wire network on corrugated solar cell, a short circuit current of 33.28 mA/cm² was obtained in comparison to 20.53 mA/cm² without the network electrode. On comparing the efficiency with the conventional cells with screen printed electrodes, a 20% increment in efficiency has been observed. Importantly, the estimated manufacturing cost is at least two orders lower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aenergy conversion 3amanufacturing 3anickel 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asilicon 3asilver 0acrackle lithography 0asolution process 0aphotovoltaics 0aSi solar cell 0atop contact metallization1 aRao, K.

Its composition is essential for the normal growth and morphology pattern, as demonstrated by pectin-defective mutant phenotypes. Besides this basic role in plant physiology, in tomato, pectin structure contributes to very important quality traits such as fruit firmness. Sixty-seven different enzymatic activities have been suggested to be required for pectin biosynthesis, but only a few genes have been identified and studied so far. This study characterized the tomato galacturonosyltransferase (GAUT) family and performed a detailed functional study of the GAUT4 gene. The tomato genome harbours all genes orthologous to those described previously in Arabidopsis thaliana, and a transcriptional profile revealed that the GAUT4 gene was expressed at higher levels in developing organs. GAUT4-silenced tomato plants exhibited an increment in vegetative biomass associated with palisade parenchyma enlargement. Silenced fruits showed an altered pectin composition and accumulated less starch along with a reduced amount of pectin, which coincided with an increase in firmness. Moreover, the harvest index was dramatically reduced as a consequence of the reduction in the fruit weight and number. Altogether, these results suggest that, beyond its role in pectin biosynthesis, GAUT4 interferes with carbon metabolism, partitioning, and allocation. Hence, this cell-wall-related gene seems to be key in determining plant growth and fruit production in tomato.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atomatoes 3aplant growth 3abiosynthesis 3afruits 3aphenotype 3apectins 3acell walls 3astarch 3atranscription (genetics) 3acarbon 3afirmness 3agenes 3amutants 3aharvest index 3afruit growing 3abiomass 3aenzyme activity 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aCell Wallxchemistry 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFruitxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGenes, Plantxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aPectinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSilencer Elements, Transcriptionalxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aUronic Acidsxmetabolism 0aSolanum pennellii 0agalacturonosyltransferase 0afruit metabolism 0agalacturonic acid 0apectin 0atomato. 0aparenchyma1 aBermúdez, Luisa1 aLira, Bruno Silvestre1 ade Souza, Amanda Pereira1 aElbl, Paula1 aDemarco, Diego1 aAlseekh, Saleh1 aInsani, Marina1 aBuckeridge, Marcos1 aAlmeida, Juliana1 aGrigioni, Gabriela1 aFernie, Alisdair Robert1 aCarrari, Fernando1 aRossi, Magdalena0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 May, v. 64, no. 8 p.2449-2466dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245009200164500001400256520138100270592002801651650001701679650001701696650001801713650002201731650001501753650001001768650001701778650001401795651001001809651002201819651001301841700002201854700002401876700002301900700002801923700002501951700003401976700002302010773012102033856007502154852000902229655001202238IND60711631020221118121550.0200928e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163102DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100915442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiontella, Andrea 12aA Genetic Window on Sardinian Native Horse Breeds through Uniparental Molecular Systems  aNAL-light  aSardinia, an island located to the west of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea, boasts three native horse breeds: Giara, Sarcidano, and Sardinian Anglo-Arab. Here, we have investigated for the first time three loci of the non-recombining region of the Y chromosome (NRY) in 34 stallions from these breeds and performed a phylogenetic analysis of the maternal relationships among 178 previously published mitochondrial control regions. We found that the current NRY diversity of Sardinian horse breeds is linked to three haplotypes (HT), all identified within Sarcidano. Each breed showed a typical HT: HT1 (ancestral) was the most represented in Sarcidano, HT2 (Neapolitan/Oriental wave) in Giara, and HT3 (Thoroughbred wave) in Sardinian Anglo-Arab. The specificity of each haplotype suggests the influence of independent breeding strategies and the effect of genetic drift in each Sardinian population. The female counterpart, extended to 178 horses, showed a low genetic variability and a common maternal origin for Giara and Sarcidano. The higher variability of the Sardinian Anglo-Arab indicates multiple mare lineages in its current population. Further genetic analyses will be crucial to understand the paternal history of male horses, preserve the endangered mares’ and stallions’ lineages, and improve the enhancement of autochthonous genetic resources on this island.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThoroughbred 3aY chromosome 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amares 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny 3aItaly 3aMediterranean Sea 3aSardinia1 aCardinali, Irene 1 aPieramati, Camillo 1 aCherchi, Raffaele 1 aBiggio, Giovanni  Paolo1 aAchilli, Alessandro 1 aSilvestrelli, M.q(Maurizio),1 aLancioni, Hovirag 0 tAnimals.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100915443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166520147100264592002801735650002101763650002501784650002901809650001201838650002401850650001601874650000701890650004301897650001401940700001901954700001901973700001501992700001802007700001302025700001302038700001602051773012402067856008202191852000902273655001202282IND60794311420221119120928.0220922e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079431142DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110910142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yangyang 10aEffects of a Novel, Intelligent, pH-Responsive Resin Adhesive on Cariogenic Biofilms In Vitro  aBackground: Secondary caries often result in a high failure rate of resin composite restoration. Herein, we studied the dodecylmethylaminoethyl methacrylate–modified resin adhesive (DMAEM@RA) to investigate its pH-responsive antimicrobial effect on Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans dual-species biofilms and on secondary caries. Methods: Firstly, the pH-responsive antimicrobial experiments including colony-forming units, scanning electron microscopy and exopoly-saccharide staining were measured. Secondly, lactic acid measurement and transverse microradiography analysis were performed to determine the preventive effect of DMAEM@RA on secondary caries. Lastly, quantitative real-time PCR was applied to investigate the antimicrobial effect of DMAEM@RA on cariogenic virulence genes. Results: DMAEM@RA significantly inhibited the growth, EPS, and acid production of Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans dual-species biofilms under acidic environments (p < 0.05). Moreover, at pH 5 and 5.5, DMAEM@RA remarkably decreased the mineral loss and lesion depth of tooth hard tissue (p < 0.05) and down-regulated the expression of cariogenic genes, virulence-associated genes, and pH-regulated genes of dual-species biofilms (p < 0.05). Conclusions: DMAEM@RA played an antibiofilm role on Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans dual-species biofilms, prevented the demineralization process, and attenuated cariogenic virulence in a pH-dependent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3aelectron microscopy 3alactic acid 3apH 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3avirulence1 aLiang, Jingou 1 aZhou, Xuedong 1 aRen, Biao 1 aWang, Haohao 1 aHan, Qi 1 aLi, Hao 1 aCheng, Lei 0 tPathogens.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110910143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013600167300001800303500001900321520122300340592002801563650001301591650001201604650002001616650002201636653002001658653001301678653002001691653002601711653002201737653003701759700001401796700001401810700001701824700001401841700001701855700001801872700001601890700001601906700005401922773014401976856008502120852000902205655001202214IND60701100120221118073505.0200706e20200610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070110012DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c000112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Guoyu10aUniform Coating of Se on Selenophilic Surfaces of Nickel-Rich Layered Oxide Cathode Materials for High Performance Li-Ion Batteries  ap. 9632-9640.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel and uniform Se coating layer on the selenophilic surface of the Ni-rich layered metal oxide (LNCM) cathode material was constructed via a facile melt-diffusion approach. The high selenophilicity of the LNCM surfaces should attribute to the strong interactions of the exposed Ni, Co, and Mn atoms with Se coating through the formation of metal–Se bonds, resulting in the conformal and homogenous deposition of Se layers. The uniform Se coating layers could not only protect the Ni-rich LNCM cathode materials from the side reaction with the electrolytes but also reduce the degree of Li⁺/Ni²⁺ cation disorder. Therefore, owing to the multifunctional effects of Se coating, the Se-coated LNCM811 cathode materials exhibit excellent cyclic stability and rate performances with a high initial capacity of 205 mA h g–¹ at 0.2 C and the high reversible capacities of 173 mA h g–¹ at the 100th cycle at 0.2 C, 132 mA h g–¹ at 200th cycle at 2 C, and 103 mA h g–¹ at 300th cycle at 5 C.

However, the pathway connecting trait expression to ecosystem function is complicated by feedbacks: trait expression may vary within species in response to community diversity, and trait expression also determines a community's functional diversity. The predictability and consequences of interactions between trait expression and community diversity are poorly understood, particularly in forest ecosystems. Here we quantify the extent to which light access—which past studies suggest affects trait expression and differs as a result of interactions among plants—differs consistently with community diversity and explains intraspecific trait variation in trees. In a common garden, trees of five angiosperm and seven gymnosperm species were planted to form 37 communities ranging widely in species and functional diversity whereby confounding environmental variation was minimized. We sampled leaves of each species to characterize intraspecific variation within and among communities in three traits—leaf size, specific leaf area and nitrogen concentration—and estimated each leaf's access to light. We found that light access explained a substantial portion of trait variation within all species, species tended to receive less light in more diverse communities and effects of community diversity on trait expression tended to be mediated by light. Synthesis. This study shows that community diversity affects leaf trait plasticity in young trees through its effects on light availability. Moreover, trait responses across angiosperms and gymnosperms were remarkably similar, showing that shared biophysical constraints overwhelm divergent evolutionary histories. Together, these results illustrate how leaf trait expression responds to, and may subsequently shape, diversity in young tree communities in largely predictable ways via resource‐based interactions, with consequences that may scale from individuals to ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  cCollege of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, University of Minnesota  cGraduate School, University of Minnesota  cCollege of Biological Sciences, University of Minnesota  cFulbright Science and Technology Award  cCanada Research Chairs  cInstitute on the Environment, University of Minnesota 3aAngiospermae 3aGymnospermae 3aecological function 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3aintraspecific variation 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphylogeny 3aspecific leaf area 3atrees1 aCavender‐Bares, Jeannine1 aPaquette, Alain1 aMessier, Christian1 aReich, Peter B.0 tjournal of ecology.g2020 July, v. 108, no. 4 p.1617-1634dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.133463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245010800175300001600283500001900299520070900318592002801027650001801055650001401073650001601087651001101103653002101114653002901135653001601164700003101180700002801211700002901239700002401268700003101292700003201323773012501355856008201480852000901562655001201571IND60721979920221120143522.0201229e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072197992DNAL7 a10.1649/0010-065X-74.4.8602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Mauricio Pérez10aNew Distribution and Host Plant Records of Xyleborini (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) in Mexico  ap. 860-868.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to the increasing interest and the importance of ambrosia beetles, particularly those in the tribe Xyleborini, we considered it necessary to update the distribution and host reports of the species in Mexico.

Because wheat (Triticum spp.) is a major staple food, development of salt-tolerant wheat cultivars through screening and breeding techniques seems plausible as tremendous genetic variability exists for salt tolerance in this crop. To improve crop productivity on salt-affected lands, a salt-tolerant spring wheat (T. aestivum L.) cultivar S-24 (Reg. No. CV-1044; PI 652453) was developed through screening and breeding techniques. S-24 was derived from screening and selection of an F₃ population at 2.4 S m⁻¹ salinity, and it was developed from a cross (‘LU-26S’/‘Kharchia’) in 1992–1993 at the Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan. S-24 is salt tolerant, maintaining a high K⁺/Na⁺ ratio in plant tissue, and possesses good agronomic characteristics including grain yield and 1000 kernel weight (TKW). S-24 has dark green color, a semidwarf growth habit, and large-sized red-colored grain. It has superior grain yield potential in production fields where high levels of salinity are present, such as the Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan. This salt-tolerant cultivar is of considerable value for exploitation of salt-affected soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm releases 3asalt tolerance 3aplant breeding 3asoil salinity 3aspring wheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3agermplasm screening 3asalt stress 3aPakistan 0acultivars0 tJournal of plant registrations.g2010 Jan., v. 4, no. 1 p.34-37dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:6195x1940-34967nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3198/jpr2008.05.0252crc3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02550naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245008200181300001600263520146700279592002801746650001501774650001901789650002201808650001301830650001501843650002301858650001101881653001201892653002201904653002101926653001501947653001801962773011301980856008602093852000902179655001202188IND60600243620221119070839.0180703e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060024362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyshevski, Sergey Edward10aMicrostepping and high-performance control of permanent-magnet stepper motors  ap. 245-253.  aWe examine the problem of control of high-performance drives and servos with permanent-magnet stepper motors. Control of electromechanical systems implies control and optimization of electromechanical transductions and energy conversion. Robust spatio-temporal control algorithms are designed to ensure high efficiency, high-precision microstepping and optimal performance. The system stability, robustness and control design are examined applying an admissibility concept. Nonlinear control guarantees optimal energy conversion in expanded operating envelopes. Our analytic designs are substantiated and verified. A proof-of-concept system is tested and characterized. The high electromagnetic torque and high-precision microstep angular positioning simplify kinematics, enables efficiency, ensures direct-drive capabilities, reduces complexity, etc. For four-phase permanent magnet stepper motors, one may ensure up to 256 microsteps within a 1.8° full step. High efficiency and accurate 2.454×10⁻⁴rad positioning (25,600 microsteps per revolution) are achieved with high electromagnetic and holding torques. To guarantee high efficiency, optimality and enabled energy conversion capabilities, electromechanical energy conversion and high electromagnetic torque are achieved by applying soft balanced phase voltages. The ripple and friction torques are minimized. The fundamental findings, technology-centric design and experimental results are reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectric power 3aenergy conversion 3afriction 3akinematics 3amagnetic materials 3atorque 0aControl 0aEnergy conversion 0aElectric machine 0aOptimality 0aStepper motor0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Sept., v. 85 p.245-253dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013400162300001400296520146900310592002801779650001101807650002101818650002101839650001201860650001901872650001301891650001401904650003701918650001301955650001601968650002101984653001702005653000802022653003202030653002402062653002302086653000902109700001402118700002102132700001902153700001502172773012002187856008202307852000902389655001202398IND60533231620221121102505.0160728e20150911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053323162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lily14aThe regulation of glucose on milk fat synthesis is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in bovine mammary epithelial cells  ap. 59-63.  aGlucose as one of the nutrition factors plays a vital role in the regulation of milk fat synthesis. Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a vital proteolytic pathway in all eukaryotic cells through timely marking, recognizing and degrading the poly-ubiquitinated protein substrates. Previous studies indicated that UPS plays a considerable role in controlling the triglyceride (TG) synthesis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to confirm the link between high-glucose and UPS and its regulation mechanism on milk fat synthesis in BMEC (bovine mammary epithelial cells). We incubated BMEC with normal (17.5 mm/L) and high-glucose (25 mm/L) with and without proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin and found that, compared with the control (normal glucose and without proteasome inhibitor), both high-glucose concentration and proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin could increase the accumulation of TG and poly-ubiquitinated proteins, and reduce significantly three proteasome activities (chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like). In addition, high-glucose concentration combined with proteasome inhibitor further enhanced the increase of the poly-ubiquitinated protein level and the decrease of proteasome activities. Our results suggest that the regulation of high-glucose on milk fat synthesis is mediated by UPS in BMEC, and high-glucose exposure could lead to a hypersensitization of BMEC to UPS inhibition which in turn results in increased milk fat synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3aepithelial cells 3aeukaryotic cells 3aglucose 3amammary glands 3amilk fat 3anutrition 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3atriacylglycerols 0aHigh-glucose 0aUPS 0aPoly-ubiquitinated proteins 0aProteasome activity 0aMilk fat synthesis 0aBMEC1 aJiang, Li1 aDing, Xiang-dong1 aLiu, Jian-feng1 aZhang, Qin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Sept. 11, v. 465 p.59-63dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245013900180300001600319500001900335520130400354592002801658650001701686650001701703650002401720650001501744650001001759650001001769653001701779653002001796653002601816653001101842700003001853700002701883700002301910773012501933856008202058852000902140655001202149IND60721980020221122162229.0201229e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072198002DNAL7 a10.1649/0010-065X-74.4.8692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez-Espinoza, Karla M.10aSheep Dung Removal by Coexisting Rainbow Scarabs (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Phanaeus MacLeay) under Experimental Laboratory Conditions  ap. 869-874.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDung beetles are key providers of several ecosystem processes such as dung removal, which is a critical function especially in livestock areas. Here we evaluate sheep dung removal activity by coexisting species of the genus Phanaeus MacLeay under laboratory conditions, to describe their role in this ecosystem function. We assessed the effect of four factors: i) Beetle species—we compared the amount of dung removed by pairs of Phanaeus quadridens (Say, 1835) vs. pairs of Phanaeus adonis Harold, 1863; ii) beetle density—we compared treatments with two and six individuals; iii) coexistence of different species—we compared dung removal by only females of P. quadridens with mixed females of three species (P. quadridens, P. adonis, and Phanaeus palliatus Sturm, 1843); and iv) time after dung deposition (24 and 48 h). We did not find differences in the amount of dung removed between species (P. quadridens and P. adonis), nor between different densities. Phanaeus quadridens females alone removed more dung than females of the three species combined, and a greater amount of dung was removed during the first 24 hours. Understanding the links between dung beetle ecological functions and ecosystem services is critical for the management of these services, especially in livestock areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScarabaeidae 3adung beetles 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3afeces 3asheep 0aScarabaeinae 0aovine livestock 0atunneler dung beetles 0aMexico1 aOrtega-Martínez, Ilse J.1 aRios-Díaz, Cecilia L.1 aMoreno, Claudia E.0 tColeopterists' bulletin.g2020 Dec. 22, v. 74, no. 4 p.869-874dColeopterists SocietywJournal:jnl46163x0010-065X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1649/0010-065X-74.4.8693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100002200159245010400181300001800285520152700303592002801830650002101858650002701879650001101906650001601917650001101933650002301944650001401967650001401981650001301995650001002008650001102018650001902029650002502048650004102073650004002114650004102154650004802195650002002243650003602263650003402299650005002333653001802383653001502401653000802416653002002424653002302444653002402467700003202491700002602523773012102549856007402670852000902744655001202753IND60118911820221119120354.0141127e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011891182DNAL7 a236458682pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarin, Sébastien10aIs white clover able to switch to atmospheric sulphur sources when sulphate availability decreases?  ap. 2511-2521.  aSulphur (S) is one of the very few nutrients that plants can absorb either through roots as sulphate or via leaves in a gas form such as SO2 or H2S. This study was realized in a non-S-enriched atmosphere and its purpose was to test whether clover plants can increase their ability to use atmospheric S when sulphate availability decreases. A novel methodology measuring the dilution of 34S provided from a nutrient solution by atmospheric 32S was developed to measure S acquisition by Trifolium repens L. Clones of white clover were grown for 140 d in a hydroponic system with three levels of sulphate concentrations. S concentration in plants decreased with S deficiency and plant age. In the experimental conditions used here, S derived from atmospheric deposition (Sdad) constituted from 36% to 100% of the total S. The allocation of S coming from atmospheric and pedospheric sources depends on organs and compounds. Nodules appeared as major sinks for sulphate. A greater proportion of atmospheric S was observed in buffer-soluble proteins than in the insoluble S fraction. Decreasing the S concentration in the nutrient solution resulted in an increase in the Sdad:leaf area ratio and in an increase in the leaf:stolon and root:shoot mass ratios, suggesting that a plasticity in the partitioning of resources to organs may allow a higher gain of S by both roots and leaves. This study shows that clover can increase its ability to use atmospheric S even at low concentration when pedospheric S availability decreases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium repens 3aatmospheric deposition 3aclones 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3anutrient solutions 3anutrients 3aplant age 3aproteins 3aroots 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 2aAtmospherexanalysis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPlant Shootsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aRoot Nodules, Plantxchemistryxphysiology. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSulfatesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSulfurxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aTrifoliumxchemistryxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aFoliar uptake 0aplasticity 0a34S 0asulphate uptake 0asulphur deficiency 0asulphur deposition.1 aLemauviel-Lavenant, Servane1 aCliquet, Jean-Bernard0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 May, v. 64, no. 8 p.2511-2521dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009700130300001600227520103100243650002001274650001701294650001901311650001801330650002501348650002201373650001801395650000901413650001201422650000901434650001101443650001101454650001301465650003601478651001001514653002801524653003101552700001801583700001601601773012601617852000901743930003301752945001301785946001101798655001201809IND2047735020221122220742.0950914e199503  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204773502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegittimo, P.C.10aPlant species as indicators of geochemical anomalies: experiences on Ilex aquifolium (holly)  ap. 114-118.  aThe distribution of Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cu, in plants growing in mineralized and sterile areas of Tuscany has been studied to verify if and to what extent metal-accumulating species represent evidence of geochemical anomalies in soils. Samples of leaves and twigs from trees were collected, and analyzed by means of differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). Hollies, brambles, and Holm oaks in particular were considered in the mineralized area of Bottino, and the special aptitude of hollies in concentrating Cd with respect to the other metals has been verified. Cadmium has been previously recognized as a pathfinder for zinc ore bodies; the results of this investigation appear to point out the relevance of holly as a bioindicator of geochemical zinc anomalies. Lower metal concentration characterizes the same species from other mineralized and sterile zones, with the exception of the urbanized area of Florence, where relatively higher Zn concentrations in hollies appear to be due to atmospheric pollution. 3aIlex aquifolium 3aforest trees 3aRubus plicatus 3aErica arborea 3aDryopteris filix-mas 3aindicator species 3aion transport 3azinc 3acadmium 3alead 3acopper 3aleaves 3abranches 3achemical constituents of plants 3aItaly 0ageochemical prospecting 0abiogeochemical prospecting1 aDucceschi, L.1 aMartini, M.0 tEnvironmental geology.g1995 Mar., v. 25, no. 2 p.114-118aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02369naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011200144300001600256500002300272500001500295520096900310650002501279650001501304650002201319650002301341650001301364650001101377650001901388650002401407650001201431650002101443650001101464650003401475650002401509650003701533650004101570650003501611650003701646653002601683700001501709700002201724773008801746852000901834939003301843946001101876655001201887IND9203600520221122175205.0920605e199111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920360052DNAL7 a17805952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatrija, F.10aOstertagia ostertagi in neonatal calves: establishment of infection in ruminating and non-ruminating calves  ap. 344-346.  aFirst of a series.  a2019-12-04  aAn experiment was carried out to study the role of the ruminal function in the establishment of Ostertagia ostertagi in neonatal calves. Three groups of calves were fed either milk only (groups A and C), or hay and concentrate in addition to milk (group B) from birth. At the time of infection, ruminal function was negligible in groups A and C, whereas it was well developed in group B. Calves of groups A and B were each given 25,000 normal ensheathed infective larvae of O ostertagi and those of group C were given 25,000 infective larvae exsheathed in vitro. Daily faecal egg output and post mortem worm counts 28 days after infection were higher in calves with well developed ruminal function than those having only negligible ruminal function. In the latter group, exsheathed larvae established at a lower rate than did ensheathed larvae. The results suggest that the degree of development of the ruminal function influences the establishment of O ostertagi. 3aOstertagia ostertagi 3arumination 3arumen development 3adisease resistance 3aneonates 3acalves 3adisease course 2aAbomasumxpathology 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxparasitology 2aFecesxparasitology 2aOstertagiaxgrowth & development 2aOstertagiasisxetiologyxveterinary. 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aRumenxparasitologyxphysiology. 0abiological resistance1 aNansen, P.1 aChristensen, C.M.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1991 Nov., v. 51, no. 3 p.344-346x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02377naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001100128245005000139300001600189500001500205520125000220650001701470650000801487650001201495650001801507650002501525650001601550650001501566650002201581650001201603650002401615650001101639650002201650650002101672650002501693653001601718653001701734773012601751852000901877930003301886945001301919946001101932655001201943IND2044973720221122155802.0950309e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204497372DNAL7 a78280272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, J.10aEgg chorion tanning in Aedes aegypti mosquito  ap. 835-843.  a2019-12-05  aThe biochemical pathway of egg chorion tanning in the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is described and compared with chorion protein crosslinking in Drosophila and silkmoths and the biochemical pathways of cuticular tanning in insects. Phenol oxidase, dopa decarboxylase and tyrosine are critical components involved in egg chorion tanning in A. aegypti. Tanning of the mosquito egg chorion is initiated following activation of phenol oxidase, which then catalyzes the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dopa and further oxidizes dopa and dopamine to their respective o-quinones. Because intramolecular cyclization is much slower in dopaminequinone than dopaquinone, the chance to react with external nucleophiles to participate in protein crosslinking reactions also is much greater in dopaminequinone than dopaquinone. This might partly explain the necessity for the involvement of dopa decarboxylase in mosquito chorion tanning. Intramolecular cyclization of dopaquinone and dopaminequinone to form dopachrome and dopaminechrome, respectively, the structural rearrangement of these aminochromes to produce 5,6-dihydroxyindole, and the subsequent oxidation of 5,6-dihydroxyindole by phenol oxidase also lead to melanin formation during egg chorion tanning. 3amelanization 3aova 3achorion 3aAedes aegypti 3abiochemical pathways 3aBombyx mori 3aDrosophila 2aAedesxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aEnzymesxphysiology 2aFemale 2aOvaryxmetabolism 2aOvumxphysiology 2aProteinsxmetabolism 0acomparisons 0apigmentation0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.

We have shown previously that the Proline-Rich Homeodomain protein (PRH/Hex) self-assembles to form oligomeric complexes that bind to arrays of PRH binding sites with high affinity and specificity. We have also shown that many PRH target genes contain suitably spaced arrays of PRH sites that allow this protein to bind and regulate transcription. Here, we use analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy to further characterize PRH oligomers. We use the same techniques to show that PRH oligomers bound to long DNA fragments self-associate to form highly ordered assemblies. Electron microscopy and linear dichroism reveal that PRH oligomers can form protein-DNA fibres and that PRH is able to compact DNA in the absence of other proteins. Finally, we show that DNA compaction is not sufficient for the repression of PRH target genes in cells. We conclude that DNA compaction is a consequence of the binding of large PRH oligomers to arrays of binding sites and that PRH is functionally and structurally related to the Lrp/AsnC family of proteins from bacteria and archaea, a group of proteins formerly thought to be without eukaryotic equivalents.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3abacteria 3abinding sites 3aelectron microscopy 3agene expression regulation 3ahomeodomain proteins 3aprotein subunits 3atranscription (genetics) 3aultracentrifugation1 aSawasdichai, Anyaporn1 aShukla, Anshuman1 aNoy, Peter1 aDafforn, Tim1 aSmith, Corinneq(Corinne L.)1 aJayaraman, Padma-Sheela1 aGaston, Kevin0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Nov., v. 38, no. 21 p.7513-7525x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq6593Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01860naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008600127300001400213520103700227650001801264650002001282650002501302651001201327653000901339653001001348653001001358773012401368852000901492930003301501945001301534946001101547655001201558IND2047775120221122113344.0950915e199507  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204777512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbam, T.K.S.10aFactors affecting performance of permeable groins in channel bank erosion control  ap. 53-56.  aThe factors affecting the performance of permeable groins are investigated by an analytical approach supplemented with field observation. These factors are broadly divided into three classes: (1) the properties of the soil where the groin is embedded; (2) the flow characteristics of the river channel that are imposed on the groin; and (3) the makeup of the groins. Factors relating to the properties of the soil and flow are then combined into an expression for the factor of safety against failure by overturning. This enables a deterministic sensitivity technique involving partial differentiation of the factor of safety with respect to each contributory factor to be applied. The results obtained show that depth of the groin is the most critical factor that determines groin stability. The depth is followed by flow velocity and discharge, unit weight of water, unit weight of soil, and cohesion. This order of importance agrees with the analysis of observed groin performance in a pilot project at Kaiama in the Niger delta. 3awater erosion 3aerosion control 3ariverbank protection 3aNigeria 0anets 0aposts 0apiles0 tEnvironmental geology.g1995 July, v. 26, no. 1 p.53-56aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01816naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245009100176300001600267500002400283520068300307650001900990650002101009650002401030650001201054650002001066650001201086650001501098650002401113650001301137650001801150650001201168650000901180650001601189651001501205700002801220773010601248852000901354856005501363655001201418IND4385321720221122113355.0061119e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438532172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2006.00169.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoser, Christine M.14aThe complex dynamics of smallholder technology adoption: the case of SRI in Madagascar  ap. 373-388.  aIncludes references  aThis article explores the dynamics of smallholder technology adoption, with particular reference to a high-yielding, low external input rice production method in Madagascar. We present a simple model of technology adoption by farm households in an environment of incomplete financial and land markets. We then use a probit model and symmetrically censored least squares estimation of a dynamic tobit model to analyze the decisions to adopt, expand, and disadopt the method. We find that seasonal liquidity constraints discourage adoption by poorer farmers. Learning effects--both from extension agents and from other farmers--exert significant influence over adoption decisions. 3adynamic models 3aextension agents 3aextension education 3afarmers 3afarmland values 3afinance 3ahouseholds 3ainnovation adoption 3alearning 3aleast squares 3amarkets 3arice 3asmall farms 3aMadagascar1 aBarrett, Christopher B.0 tAgricultural economics.g2006 Nov., v. 35, no. 3 p.373-388dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2006.00169.x 7aarticle02703naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002000179245006900199300001800268506007600286520131200362506003701674650001501711650001501726650002001741650002001761650002901781650000901810650001101819650001201830650001901842650001401861650001801875650001401893650001701907650003001924700001701954700001901971700002701990773008302017852000902100856007802109946001102187990002302198655001202221IND4446003920221207100416.0101203e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444600392DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq6242doi7 aPMC29950502pmcid7 a206600132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaybon, Alison10aPARP1 suppresses homologous recombination events in mice in vivo  ap. 7538-7545.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies suggest that PARP1 inhibitors, several of which are currently in clinical trial, may selectively kill BRCA1/2 mutant cancers cells. It is thought that the success of this therapy is based on immitigable lethal DNA damage in the cancer cells resultant from the concurrent loss or inhibition of two DNA damage repair pathways: single-strand break (SSB) repair and homologous recombination repair (HRR). Presumably, inhibition of PARP1 activity obstructs the repair of SSBs and during DNA replication, these lesions cause replication fork collapse and are transformed into substrates for HRR. In fact, several previous studies have indicated a hyper-recombinogenic phenotype in the absence of active PARP1 in vitro or in response to DNA damaging agents. In this study, we demonstrate an increased frequency of spontaneous HRR in vivo in the absence of PARP1 using the pun assay. Furthermore, we found that the HRR events that occur in Parp1 nullizygous mice are associated with a significant increase in large, clonal events, as opposed to the usually more frequent single cell events, suggesting an effect in replicating cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that PARP1 inhibits spontaneous HRR events, and supports the model of DNA replication transformation of SSBs into HRR substrates.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3aclinical trials 3ahomologous recombination 3amice 3amodels 3amutants 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anucleic acids 3aphenotype 3atherapeutics 3atumor suppressor proteins1 aKaria, Bijal1 aBruce, Crystal1 aBishop, Alexander J.R.0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Nov., v. 38, no. 21 p.7538-7545x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq6243Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03657naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001400157245012600171300001600297500002400313500001500337520169600352650002802048650003002076650001102106650002402117650002202141650001702163650002302180650000902203650002902212650005202241650001802293650001902311650001502330650002602345650002002371650002702391651001102418651001602429653002102445653002702466653002502493653002602518653001802544653004002562700001402602700001802616700001602634700001402650700001502664700001702679700001302696700002402709773009602733852000902829856008802838930003302926945002502959946001102984655001202995IND4399444820221122113305.0071228e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439944482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aWengi, N.10aReal-time PCR-based prevalence study, infection follow-up and molecular characterization of canine hemotropic mycoplasmas  ap. 132-141.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) have been reported in several mammalian species including dogs. Infections may lead to hemolytic anemia, but investigations in the dog had been hampered by the lack of adequate diagnostic methods. Only recently sensitive PCR-based assays were reported for the two canine hemoplasmas, Mycoplasma haemocanis and Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum. By applying these assays, 15.4% of 460 dogs from the south of France tested hemoplasma positive. It was hypothesized that this high prevalence may be associated with the presence of Rhipicephalus sanguineus, a proposed vector for canine hemoplasmas. To address this hypothesis and expand the PCR-based knowledge on canine hemoplasmosis, we investigated dogs in a climatic zone that does not allow for the permanent establishment of R. sanguineus. Blood samples were collected throughout a year from 889 dogs in Switzerland: 1.2% of the dogs tested real-time PCR positive. The infection status was not significantly associated with anemia, age or gender. Phylogenetic analyses of Candidatus M. haematoparvum and M. haemocanis isolates revealed >=99.8% identity to published sequences. All samples collected from three infected dogs throughout a follow-up period of <=13 months tested PCR positive. Interestingly, the majority of the infected dogs either had been imported from or had visited regions where R. sanguineus is indigenous. Thus, canine hemoplasma prevalence was found to be low in a country with a climate incompatible with frequent occurrence of R. sanguineus. Nonetheless, veterinarians may expect hemoplasma infections in dogs with a travel history and/or after potential tick vector exposure. 3aepidemiological studies 3ageographical distribution 3aanemia 3atick-borne diseases 3adisease detection 3adog diseases 3adisease prevalence 3adogs 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3amycoplasmosis 3ainsect vectors 3aMycoplasma 3aenvironmental factors 3arisk assessment 3amolecular epidemiology 3aFrance 3aSwitzerland 0aanemia (disease) 0ahemotropic mycoplasmas 0ahematologic diseases 0aMycoplasma haemocanis 0ahemoplasmosis 0aCandidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum1 aWilli, B.1 aBoretti, F.S.1 aCattori, V.1 aRiond, B.1 aMeli, M.L.1 aReusch, C.E.1 aLutz, H.1 aHofmann-Lehmann, R.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 126, no. 1-3 p.132-141dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.06.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02524naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245007100201300001800272506007600290520131700366506003701683650001201720650002701732650001001759650001301769650001801782650001501800650001301815650001101828650002201839650002901861700001801890700002501908773008301933852000902016856007802025946001102103655001202114IND4446004420221207110038.0101203e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444600442DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq6692doi7 aPMC29950812pmcid7 a206710282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriest, Christina10aDeconstructing nucleotide binding activity of the Mdm2 RING domain  ap. 7587-7598.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMdm2, a central negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, possesses a Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain within its C-terminus. In addition to E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the Mdm2 RING preferentially binds adenine base nucleotides, and such binding leads to a conformational change in the Mdm2 C-terminus. Here, we present further biochemical analysis of the nucleotide-Mdm2 interaction. We have found that MdmX, an Mdm2 family member with high sequence homology, binds adenine nucleotides with similar affinity and specificity as Mdm2, suggesting that residues involved in nucleotide binding may be conserved between the two proteins and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding may have similar functional consequences for both Mdm family members. By generating and testing a series of proteins with deletions and substitution mutations within the Mdm2 RING, we mapped the specific adenine nucleotide binding region of Mdm2 to residues 429-484, encompassing the minimal RING domain. Using a series of ATP derivatives, we demonstrate that phosphate coordination by the Mdm2 P-loop contributes to, but is not primarily responsible for, ATP binding. Additionally, we have identified the 2' and 3' hydroxyls of the ribose and the C6 amino group of the adenine base moiety as being essential for binding.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenine 3aadenosine triphosphate 3agenes 3amutation 3anucleic acids 3aphosphates 3aproteins 3aribose 3asequence homology 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aPrives, Carol1 aPoyurovsky, Masha V.0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Nov., v. 38, no. 21 p.7587-7598x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq6693Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01274naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115242011900129245012900248300001600377500002400393520015300417650002500570650002100595650002000616650003900636653002400675700001700699700001400716700002100730773012400751852000900875939003300884945000800917946001100925655001200936991560594970742620221122064312.0830411e198107  xx |||||o|||||||||||scr||7 aPAR830037762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrgas, J.10aPneumocystis carinii pneumonia during immunosuppressive therapy after cadaveric renal transplantation--case report10aPneumocystis carinii pneumonija u toku imunosupresivne terapije nakon transplantacije kadavericnog bubrega--prikaz bolesnice  ap. 293-296.  aSummary in English.  aPneumocystis carinii pneumonia, immunosuppressed woman who had undergone kidney transplant 3 months earlier, fatal illness, clinical and case review 3aPneumocystis carinii 3aimmunocompetence 3aimmune response 3aacquired immunodeficiency syndrome 0aPathology, Protozoa1 aSmetisko, A.1 aThune, S.1 aGlavas-Boras, S.0 tLijecnicki vjesnik.

The exocyclic ring of M₁dG opens to the acyclic N²-OPdG structure when paired with C but remains closed in single-stranded DNA or when mispaired with T. M₁dG is a target of nucleotide excision repair (NER); however, NER is absent in mitochondria. An in vitro transcription system with purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) and transcription factors, mtTFA and mtTFB2, was used to determine the effect of M₁dG on POLRMT elongation. DNA templates contained a single adduct opposite either C or T downstream of either the light-strand (LSP) or heavy-strand (HSP1) promoter for POLRMT. M₁dG in the transcribed strand arrested 60-90% POLRMT elongation complexes with greater arrest by the adduct when opposite T. POLRMT was more sensitive to N²-OPdG and M₁dG after initiation at LSP, which suggests promoter-specific differences in the function of POLRMT complexes. A closed-ring analog of M₁dG, PdG, blocked ≥95% of transcripts originating from either promoter regardless of base pairing, and the transcripts remained associated with POLRMT complexes after stalling at the adduct. This work suggests that persistent M₁dG adducts in mitochondrial DNA hinder the transcription of mitochondrial genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA repair 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3agenes 3aguanine 3ahumans 3amalondialdehyde 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial RNA 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aLodeiro, M.

Mus81-Mms4 is a structure-specific endonuclease that can resolve stalled replication forks as well as toxic recombination intermediates. In this study, we show that Mus81-Mms4 can suppress dna2 mutational defects by virtue of its functional and physical interaction with Rad27. Mus81-Mms4 stimulated Rad27 activity significantly, accounting for its ability to restore the growth defects caused by the dna2 mutation. Interestingly, Rad27 stimulated the rate of Mus81-Mms4 catalyzed cleavage of various substrates, including regressed replication fork substrates. The ability of Rad27 to stimulate Mus81-Mms4 did not depend on the catalytic activity of Rad27, but required the C-terminal 64 amino acid fragment of Rad27. This indicates that the stimulation was mediated by a specific protein-protein interaction between the two proteins. Our in vitro data indicate that Mus81-Mms4 and Rad27 act together during DNA replication and resolve various structures that can impede normal DNA replication. This conclusion was further strengthened by the fact that rad27 mus81 or rad27 mms4 double mutants were synergistically lethal. We discuss the significance of the interactions between Rad27, Dna2 and Mus81-Mms4 in context of DNA replication.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA replication 3aamino acids 3acatalytic activity 3amutants 3amutation 3anucleic acids 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3atoxicity 3ayeasts1 aLee, Chul-Hwan1 aKang, Young-Hoon1 aCho, Il-Taeg1 aNguyễn, Tuấn Anh.1 aSeo, Yeon-Soo0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Nov., v. 38, no. 21 p.7611-7625x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq6513Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02387naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009400184300001600278520098900294650001301283650001201296650001501308650002101323650001301344650001101357650001001368650002201378650001101400650000901411650001601420650001501436650003201451650003001483650001001513651001401523653002901537653001501566653001401581653002301595700002501618773011001643852000901753856008501762930003301847946001301880655001201893IND4401180220221122065155.0080210e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440118022DNAL7 a180046182pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-007-9041-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVining, Joanne 14aThe Influence of Proximity to a National Forest on Emotions and Fire-Management Decisions  ap. 155-167.  aBecause American national forests are managed for all citizens, it is important that researchers explore the differences and similarities between citizens living both near and far from publicly managed land. We surveyed residents living at various distances from nationally managed land to collect resident perceptions of different forest fire-management techniques, to determine public preferences for these techniques, and to examine the motivations behind these preferences. Participants both close to and far away from national forests tended to favor a multipronged approach to fire management by preferring the use of a combination of two or more fire-management techniques. There were no significant differences by proximity in participants' self-rated emotions, types of fire-management techniques preferred, or the reasons and rationales for their preferred fire-management technique(s), indicating that the proximity variable may not be as significant as previously thought. 3aemotions 3aforests 3amotivation 3anational forests 2aEmotions 2aFemale 2aFires 2aForestryxmethods 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPerception 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aResidence Characteristics 2aTrees 0aMinnesota 0aEnvironmental psychology 0aPerception 0aProximity 0aPublic preferences1 aMerrick, Melinda S. 0 tEnvironmental management.g2008 Feb., v. 41, no. 2 p.155-167dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-007-9041-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02555naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001400138245019000152300001400342500001500356520111500371650002601486650002501512650003101537650002401568650002301592650002301615650001501638650001901653650002201672650001401694650002901708650003101737650002001768650001601788653001701804700001501821700001901836700001701855700001501872773006701887852000901954856007801963939003302041946001102074655001202085IND9301246120221122065302.0930302e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930124612DNAL7 a10.1007/BF003560252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukai, Y.10aMolecular cytogenetic analysis of radiation-induced wheat-rye terminal and intercalary chromosomal translocations and the detection of rye chromatin specifying resistance to Hessian fly  ap. 88-95.  a2019-12-04  aRadiation-induced wheat-rye chromosome translocation lines resistant to Hessian fly. Mayetiola destructor (say), were analyzed by in situ hybridization using total genomic and highly repetitive rye DNA probes pSc119 and pSc74. In situ hybridization analysis revealed the exact locations of the translocation breakpoints and allowed the estimation of the sizes of the transferred rye segments. T6BS.6BL-6RL and T4BS.4BL-6RL are terminal translocations with either most of the complete long arm of rye chromosome 6R or only the distal 57% of the 6RL arm attached to the long arms of wheat chromosomes 6B and 4B, respectively. The breakpoint in T6BS.6BL-6RL is located at a fraction length (FL) of 0.11 in the long arm of T6BS.6BL-6RL and at FL 0.46 in the long arm of T4BS.4BL-6RL. Ti4AS.4AL-6RL-4AL is an intercalary translocation with the breakpoint located at FL 0.06 in the long arm of wheat chromosome 4A. The inserted 6RL segment, with the Hessian fly resistance gene, has a size of 0.7 micrometer, and is the smallest and, so far, the first radiation-induced intercalary translocation identified in wheat. 3ain situ hybridization 3aMayetiola destructor 3aintergeneric hybridization 3atranslocation lines 3agenetic resistance 3achromosome banding 3aDNA probes 3aSecale cereale 3aTriticum aestivum 3achromatin 3achromosome translocation 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apest resistance 3aX-radiation 0acytogenetics1 aFriebe, B.1 aHatchett, J.H.1 aYamamoto, M.1 aGill, B.S.0 tChromosoma.g1993 Jan., v. 102, no. 2 p.88-95x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003560253Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01538naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245005000123300001600173500005400189520058200243650001200825650001400837650001200851650001400863651002800877651001900905653001900924653000900943653001900952653002500971773012600996852000901122930003301131945001301164946001101177655001201188IND2051426120221122023504.0960528e199603  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205142612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVrba, J.10aThermal mineral water springs in Karlovy Vary  ap. 120-125.  aIn the special issue: Springs and bottled waters.  aIn the western part of the Czech Republic about 130-180 km west of the capital of Prague, in an area of about 300 sq km, several dozen mineral springs occur from various origins, with water of different chemical characteristics, temperatures, and levels of carbonation and radioactive intensity.

The availability of huge water supplies was considered a symbol of opulence and therefore an expression of power. The countryside around Rome offered a spectacular view: it was adorned with an incalculable number of monuments, temples, and villas, and it was crossed by sturdy aqueducts with magnificent arcades. The aqueduct as a superelevated monumental work is a typical concept of the Roman engineering, although it is possible to recognize that the inspiration and the basic ideas came from Etruscan technology. The Etruscans did not construct real aqueducts, even though they built hydraulic works as irrigation channels, drainage systems, dams, etc. The Greeks had also built similar hydraulic structures, before the Roman influence. Interesting aqueduct remains are in Rome, Segovia (Spain), Nimes (France), and Cologne (Germany), among other places. 3awater supply 3asprings (water) 3ahistory 3aItaly 0aancient rome 0aaqueducts1 aBoni, C.0 tEnvironmental geology.g1996 Mar., v. 27, no. 2 p.126-134aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02872naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001500175245011700190300001600307500002400323520141900347650001901766650003001785650002001815650001501835650001501850650001901865650002001884650001301904650000901917650001801926650002101944650001301965650002601978650002102004650001602025651001302041700001602054700001802070700001402088773008602102852000902188856008802197930003302285945002502318946001102343655001202354IND4399442020221122002658.0071228e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439944202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2007.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aJ700 0aF1201 aSahile, S.10aEffect of mixed cropping and fungicides on chocolate spot (Botrytis fabae) of faba bean (Vicia faba) in Ethiopia  ap. 275-282.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of four cropping systems: faba bean (FB) alone , FB mixed with field pea (FB:FP), with barley (FB:BA) and maize (FB:MA), and three spray intervals of fungicide (mancozeb) applied at 7, 14 and 21 days at the rate of 2.5 kg a.i. ha-1 and unsprayed control on FB chocolate spot caused by Botrytis fabae were studied in two cultivars. The experiment was conducted during the 2004 and 2005 cropping seasons at Adet, Ethiopia. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design in a factorial combination with four replications. Treatment effects studied were disease severity, progress rate, area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and grain yield. In some of the mixed cropping systems, disease severity showed a downward trend. FB:MA mixed cropping had a significant effect on disease severity, AUDPC and disease progress rate. The system reduced the epidemics of chocolate spot and increased FB grain yield. FB:FP increased the disease progress rate and reduced grain yield in both seasons. Short fungicide spray intervals (7 days) reduced the disease severity, AUDPC, and disease progress rate and increased the yield. Both local and the improved FB cultivar CS20DK showed almost similar disease progress rates. Mixed cropping with cereals contributed to the slowing of chocolate spot epidemics and increased grain yield of FB. It also promotes proactive integrated disease management. 3aBotrytis fabae 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease control 3aVicia faba 3afaba beans 3amixed cropping 3aHordeum vulgare 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aPisum sativum 3adisease severity 3amancozeb 3apesticide application 3aapplication rate 3agrain yield 3aEthiopia1 aFininsa, C.1 aSakhuja, P.K.1 aAhmed, S.0 tCrop protection.g2008 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.275-282dButterworthx0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2007.06.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/02/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03177naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001700166245016900183300001400352500002400366520149900390650001001889650001901899650003101918650004101949650002201990650002302012650001602035650002102051650002402072650001902096650002502115650001902140650002002159650002302179650001602202650001802218650003702236650003802273653004102311700001702352700001802369773009402387852000902481856008802490930003302578945002502611946001102636655001202647IND4399442720221122002849.0071228e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439944272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aKitikoon, P.14aThe antibody responses to swine influenza virus (SIV) recombinant matrix 1 (rM1), matrix 2 (M2), and hemagglutinin (HA) proteins in pigs with different SIV exposure  ap. 51-62.  aIncludes references  aThe influenza invariant matrix 2 (M2) protein is a potential subunit vaccine candidate to induce protective immunity against broader strains of influenza A viruses (IAV). Antibodies to M2 protein have not been well characterized in IAV natural hosts. To characterize M2-specific antibodies in pigs, an ELISA to the extracellular region of the M2 (M2e) protein was developed. Sera from pigs experimentally infected with three different swine influenza virus (SIV) subtypes, immunized with an SIV inactivated vaccine, or positive for SIV maternally derived antibodies (MDA) in the absence of SIV infection were tested in assay. Confirmation of antibody titer status of pigs, was determined using a hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test and the presence of antibodies to matrix 1 (M1) protein was measured by a recombinant M1 (rM1)-based ELISA. The antibody titers to the HA and M2e proteins but not to the rM1 were directly correlated to the dose of virus used to infect the pigs and the level of antibodies detected by the HI assay varied according to SIV subtype. Pigs experimentally infected with SIV produced low levels of M2e antibodies compared to antibodies detected by the HI and rM1 assays. Vaccination alone followed by infection did not increase the levels of M2e antibodies in contrast to HA and rM1 antibodies. Pigs with MDA had different levels of HA antibodies and were positive to M2e antibodies, but results were not correlated to HA antibodies levels and inconsistently present. 3aswine 3aswine diseases 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aInfluenza A virus 3adisease prevention 3avaccination 3asubunit vaccines 3avaccine development 3aviral proteins 3arecombinant proteins 3ahemagglutinins 3aimmune response 3aantibody detection 3ablood serum 3aserodiagnosis 3ahemagglutination inhibition test 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0ainfluenza invariant matrix 2 protein1 aStrait, E.L.1 aThacker, E.L.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 126, no. 1-3 p.51-62dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.07.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02695naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245014000130300001600270500002300286520160600309650001201915650001001927650002101937650002101958650001401979650001301993650001302006650002702019650001802046650001802064653002502082653001302107653003002120700001802150773008802168852000902256939003302265946001102298655001202309IND9203598420221121231645.0920605e199111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920359842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpezialetti, R.10aSurface markers on bovine fetal lymphocytes and immunoglobulin synthesis in a congential infection related to epizootic bovine abortion  ap. 239-245.  aFirst of a series.  aImmunological parameters were studied among 23 late-term bovine fetuses. Epizootic bovine abortion (EBA) disease was induced in fetuses by feeding Ornithodoros coriaceus ticks on pregnant heifers. A spirochaete-like microorganism was detected in the blood of diseased fetuses and in inapparent natural infections in some abattoir-collected fetuses. Fetuses were classified according to stages of disease: EBA diseased (n = 10), EBA infected (n = 7) and normal (n = 6). Using flow cytometry, the presence of surface immunoglobulins (sIg) and peanut agglutinin (PNA) receptors were used to detect B and T lymphocytes, respectively. In peripheral blood of normal fetuses, most lymphocytes were identified as T or B cells, whereas about 20 per cent of lymphocytes in EBA diseased fetuses did not reveal the sIg or PNA receptor markers (null cells). Size and shape analyses by flow cytometry detected a population of enlarged lympho- cytes in the EBA diseased fetuses. The numbers of cells bearing determinants reactive with monoclonal antibodies specific for bovine T cells (B26A and B29A) and B cells (TH21A) were considerably less than those expressing the PNA receptor and sIg. These results suggested that the monoclonal antibodies were binding to differentiation antigens which were not consistently expressed on the fetal cells. Radioimmunodiffusion was used to measure bovine IgM, IgG1 and IgG2 in fetal serum. The quantities of immunoglobulins were markedly increased in animals infected with the spirochaete-like organism (groups 1 and 2) and were assumed to result from fetal antibody synthesis. 3aheifers 3afetus 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aimmunoglobulin G 3areceptors 3aantigens 3abacteria 3aOrnithodoros coriaceus 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 0acongenital infection 0aabortion 0aspirochaete-like organism1 aOsebold, J.W.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1991 Nov., v. 51, no. 3 p.239-245x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01085naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005100126300001400177500005400191520034100245650002000586650001200606651001100618773012400629852000900753930003300762945001300795946001100808655001200819IND2051424420221121201929.0960528e199603  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205142442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIssar, A.S.10aKadesh Barnea (water shall flow from the rock)  ap. 85-86.  aIn the special issue: Springs and bottled waters.  aThe spring mentioned quite frequently in the Bible as a camp of the tribes of Israel was Kadesh Barnea.

Although they are implicated in membrane trafficking and signal transduction, the functions of these proteins are not well understood. The Arabidopsis copine gene BON1/CPN1 was previously shown to negatively regulate a disease resistance (R) gene SNC1 . Here we report that in Arabidopsis, as in other organisms, there is a family of copine genes, BON1, 2 and 3. Using double and triple mutant combinations we show that these three copine genes have overlapping functions essential for the viability of plants. The loss of function of BON1 combined with that of BON2 or BON3 leads to extensive cell death phenotypes resembling the hypersensitive response (HR) in defense responses. The resulting lethality can be suppressed by mutations in PAD4 or EDS1 which are required for R gene signaling and cell death control. Accession-dependent phenotypes of the mutant combinations suggest that the BON/CPN genes may together repress several R genes other than SNC1. Moreover, the mutant combinations exhibit developmental defects when R-gene-mediated defense responses are largely suppressed in pad4 and eds1 mutants . Thus, the copine family in Arabidopsis may have effects in promoting growth and development in addition to repressing cell death, and these two processes might be intricately intertwined. 3aArabidopsis 3aProtozoa 3acell death 3acell growth 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ahypersensitive response 3amammals 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3aviability 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxcytology 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aCarrier Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aCell Deathxgenetics 2aCell Divisionxgenetics 2aGenes, Lethal 2aGenes, Plant 2aMembrane Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aMutation 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aYang, Huijun1 aGrisafi, Paula1 aSanchatjate, Siraprapha1 aFink, Gerald R.1 aSun, Qi1 aHua, Jian0 tplant journal.g2006 Jan., v. 45, no. 2 p.166-179dBlackwell Science Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02585.x 7aarticle02414naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001300179245013700192300001300329506007600342520104600418506003701464650001501501650001301516650004201529650001801571650001401589700001601603700001901619700001601638700001601654700001601670700002001686700001801706700002401724700001601748773008301764852000901847856007801856946001101934990002301945655001201968IND4446006820221207100508.0101203e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444600682DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq7892doi7 aPMC29950852pmcid7 a208469582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavn, U.10aBy-passing in vitro screening--next generation sequencing technologies applied to antibody display and in silico candidate selection  ap. e193.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn recent years, unprecedented DNA sequencing capacity provided by next generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized genomic research. Combining the Illumina sequencing platform and a scFv library designed to confine diversity to both CDR3, >1.9 x 10⁷ sequences have been generated. This approach allowed for in depth analysis of the library's diversity, provided sequence information on virtually all scFv during selection for binding to two targets and a global view of these enrichment processes. Using the most frequent heavy chain CDR3 sequences, primers were designed to rescue scFv from the third selection round. Identification, based on sequence frequency, retrieved the most potent scFv and valuable candidates that were missed using classical in vitro screening. Thus, by combining NGS with display technologies, laborious and time consuming upfront screening can be by-passed or complemented and valuable insights into the selection process can be obtained to improve library design and understanding of antibody repertoires.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3anucleic acids 3ascreening1 aGueneau, F.1 aBaerlocher, L.1 aOsteras, M.1 aDesmurs, M.1 aMalinge, P.1 aMagistrelli, G.1 aFarinelli, L.1 aKosco-Vilbois, M.H.1 aFischer, N.0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Nov., v. 38, no. 21 p.e193-e193x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq7893Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01907naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245004400144300001600188500001500204520046800219650001600687650001800703650002500721650002900746650001800775650002300793650002900816650003100845650002800876650003100904650002500935650002600960650003400986650002701020653001901047653001901066653001901085653002801104653001001132700001601142700001601158700002401174773013701198852000901335930003301344945001301377946001101390655001201401IND2047204120221121054518.0950809e19950515ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204720412DNAL7 a77819812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkamrov, A.10aMycoplasma gallisepticum 16S rRNA genes  ap. 321-325.  a2019-12-05  aThe genome of Mycoplasma gallisepticum A5969 contains a truncated pseudogene for 16S rRNA in addition to a single unsplit rRNA-operon and a second discontinuous set of rRNA genes.

Hybridization analysis of the transformants revealed distinct locations of integrated vectors in the genomes, but in some transformants freely replicating plasmids could also be detected. 3auracil 3agenetic transformation 3abiopesticides 3aplasmids 3amutants 3aTrichoderma lixii 3agenetic vectors 0aHypocrea lixii 0aintegrated vectors1 aAntal, Z.1 aFerenczy, L.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1995 July 15, v. 130, no. 1 p.59-62aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02092naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245006700123300001600190500001500206520082300221650001801044650002801062650002801090650001401118650002601132650002701158650002501185650003201210650001801242653001701260700001401277700002001291700002101311700001701332700001601349700001501365700001601380700001601396700001601412773014001428852000901568930003301577945001301610946001101623655001201634IND2047324020221121035100.0950816e19950615ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204732402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFani, R.10aPhylogeny of the genus Azospirillum based on 16S rDNA sequence  ap. 195-200.  a2019-12-05  aThe 16S rDNA of 17 strains of Azospirillum, 14 assigned to one of the known species A. amazonense, A. brasilense, A. halopraeferens, A. irakense and A. lipoferum, and the other three of uncertain taxonomic position, was sequenced after polymerase chain reaction amplification and analysed in order to investigate the phylogenetic relationships at the intra-generic and super-generic level.

In the present study, expression of the EaeA protein, the eaeA gene product, among swine O45 E. coli isolates was examined. The majority (20/22) of attaching and effacing positive, eaeA + E. coli O45 isolates, but none of ten attaching and effacing negative, eaeA- or eaeA+ isolates, expressed a 97-kDa outer membrane protein as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing demonstrated a high homology between this 97-kDa protein of swine E. coli O45 and the EaeA protein (intimin) of human enteropathogenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. In addition, a serological relationship between the EaeA proteins of swine O45, rabbit (RDEC-1) and human (E2348/69) attaching and effacing E. coli strains was observed. Our results indicate an association between expression of the EaeA protein and attaching and efficacing activity among O45 E. coli isolates. The data also suggest an antigenic relatedness of the EaeA proteins of swine, rabbit, and human attaching and effacing E. coli. 3aswine 3aEscherichia coli 3acell membranes 3abacterial proteins 3agenes 3aamino acid sequences 3abacterial antigens 3aouter membrane proteins 0aserological relationships 0acomparisons 0aeaea gene 0asequency homology 0amolecular sequence data1 aHarel, J.1 aDumas, F.1 aFairbrother, J.M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1995 June 15, v. 129, no. 2/3 p.237-242aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle01013naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115242005400133245006300187300001600250500002400266520012500290650002300415650002800438650000900466653002400475700001600499773013500515852000900650939003300659945000800692946001100700655001200711991560578970742620221121011942.0830127e198109  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aPAR830008812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAouchiche, M.10aOphthalmic involvement in cutaneous leishmaniasis10aManifestations ophtalmologiques des leishmanioses cutanees  ap. 519-522.  aSummary in English.  aLeishmania spp., human cutaneous and mucocutaneous ocular infections, presentations, diagnosis, therapy, clinical review 3aLeishmania tropica 3aLeishmania braziliensis 3aeyes 0aPathology, Protozoa1 aHartani, D.0 tMedecine Tropicale.

In contrast, the linear DNA plasmids of yeasts appear to be cytoplasmic and to have a specific genetic organization. In these respects the yeast linear plasmids can be regarded as a separate group of plasmids. A survey of plasmids among about 1800 strains covering practically all the currently accepted species of yeast (about 600) has provided a preliminary, overall view of the nature and frequency of yeast plasmids. Linear DNA plasmids were found at a frequency of 1-2%, with more than 20 cases of new linear plasmids discovered in a large variety of species. The same survey showed that circular DNA plasmids are characteristically confined to a few genera and species. The linear DNAs have many features in common with the linear killer DNAs of Kluyveromyces lactis and form a large family of multicopy, small DNAs disseminated among yeast species. 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3ayeasts 3aplasmids 3ascreening 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxanalysis 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aYeastsxgenetics 0aDNA0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1995 Aug. 15, v. 131, no. 1 p.1-9aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03396naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152024002200171024001900193024002200212024001900234040001800253072000900271072000900280100001600289245009600305300001600401500002400417500001500441506007600456520163300532506003702165650002102202650002702223650002102250650002102271650003302292650001502325650002202340650002202362650002102384650001202405650003102417650002202448653001502470700001802485700001402503700002002517773011502537852000902652856008802661930003302749945002502782946001102807655001202818IND4399431720221207110050.0071228e20071215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439943172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.07.0152doi7 aPMC71125772pmcid7 a178701852pmid7 aPMC71125772pmcid7 a178701852pmid7 aPMC71125772pmcid7 a178701852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL5001 aScharek, L.10aInfluence of the probiotic Bacillus cereus var. toyoi on the intestinal immunity of piglets  ap. 136-147.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn a feeding trial, sows and piglets were fed with the probiotic bacterium Bacillus cereus var. toyoi as a feed additive, and the effects on immune cell populations were examined. The development of the gut immune system was determined for piglets at the ages of 14, 28, 35 and 56 days post partum. Tissue samples of the Jejunum and the continuous Peyer's patch were used for enumeration of intraepithelial lymphocyte populations by fluorescence activated flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Both independent methods of investigation led to similar results: the population of intraepithelial CD8+ T cells was significantly enhanced in the probiotic group piglets (p <= 0.05), and the numbers of γδ T cells tended to be higher in the intestinal epithelium (p < 0.1) at the time of weaning (day 28). Lamina propria lymphocytes were also influenced by the treatment. Application of B. cereus var. toyoi resulted in significantly more CD25+ lymphocytes and γδ T cells in the probiotic group post-weaning. The occurrence of pathogenic Escherichia coli serogroups was also less frequent in the feces of piglets from the probiotic group. The finding that the CD8+ T cell population in the intestinal mucosa showed changes on day 28 indicated that the influence of B. cereus var. toyoi supplementation on the intestinal immune system started before weaning, an observation supported by changes in the intestinal microflora observed during the suckling-period. The results suggest that feeding of B. cereus var. toyoi to sows may result in beneficial effects on piglet health status independent of their feed supplementation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal nutrition 3abacterial colonization 3aEscherichia coli 3amucosal immunity 3aBacillus cereus biovar toyoi 3aprobiotics 3aintestinal mucosa 3amaternal immunity 3afeed supplements 3apiglets 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aprotective effect 0aepithelium1 aAltherr, B.J.1 aTolke, C.1 aSchmidt, M.F.G.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 Dec. 15, v. 120, no. 3-4 p.136-147dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.07.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle00883naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001300115242001900128245002300147300001600170500002400186520008300210650001200293650001500305653003600320700001500356700001400371773013500385852000900520939003300529945000800562946001100570655001200581991560577330742620221120230629.0830127e198107  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aPAR830008772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGras, C.10aTropical sprue13aLa sprue tropicale  ap. 449-454.  aSummary in English.  atropical sprue, human, giardiasis suggested as possible major etiologic factor 3aGiardia 3agiardiasis 0aLamblia intestinalis (Protozoa)1 aChapoy, P.1 aAubry, P.0 tMedecine Tropicale.

Glyphosate-only and nonglyphosate programs were evaluated within each tillage system. Soil cores were collected at 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths prior to spring to estimate the seedbank. Weed biomass by species was determined in mid-summer each year, except in 2003. Twenty-seven species were found in soil collected from the test site throughout the study. Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop. (large crabgrass), Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats. (Palmer amaranth), and Mollugo verticillata L. (carpetweed) were the dominant weeds in soil at initiation of the experiment. Summer annual grasses comprised more than 20% of total weed biomass in 2001, but less than 1% of total biomass in 2002 and 2004. D. sanguinalis seed density in soil was reduced rapidly in all management systems and was replaced by Dactyloctenium aegyptium (L.) Willd (crowfootgrass) as the dominant summer annual grass. There was an 80-99% reduction in the A. palmeri seed density (0-5 cm depth) during the first year of the study and M. verticillata became the dominant summer annual broad-leaved weed. Perennial weeds comprised <10% of the total weed biomass in 2001, but by 2004, >99% of the total weed biomass was made up of perennial weeds in nonglyphosate systems regardless of tillage treatment. These perennial weeds consisted of Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (bermudagrass), Cyperus rotundus L. (purple nutsedge), and Solanum carolinense L. (Carolina horsenettle). The seed density in soil of most species declined over the four cropping seasons. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3ano-tillage 3aconventional tillage 3aweeds 3aplant communities 3acommunity structure 3aburied seeds 3aplant competition 3aSouth Carolina0 tCrop protection.g2008 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.151-160dButterworthx0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2007.04.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/02/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02404naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001900166245015100185300001600336500002400352500001500376520088200391650001701273650001501290650001601305650001201321650003001333650001501363650001401378650002701392650002101419650002201440650001901462650001301481650002601494653002601520653001801546700001801564700001701582700001601599700001901615773008601634852000901720856008801729930003301817945002501850946001101875655001201886IND4399436920221120194744.0071228e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439943692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2007.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF6001 aFerreira, E.M.10aEffectiveness of systemic fungicides in the control of Quambalaria eucalypti and their effects on production of eucalypt mini-cuttings for rooting  ap. 161-170.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEucalypt leaf spot caused by Quambalaria eucalypti is currently one of the main diseases occurring in mini-clonal hedges cultivated in sand beds with drip fert-irrigation or hydroponic tanks. Given the lack of studies on the effectiveness of fungicides for control of this pathogen, the protective, curative and antisporulating effects of systemic fungicides and their influence on production and rooting of eucalypt mini-cuttings were evaluated. Among the nine active ingredients tested, azoxystrobin, epoxiconazole, epoxiconazole+pyraclostrobin, pyraclostrobin and tebuconazole were the most effective against Q. eucalypti. Epoxiconazole, epoxiconazole+pyraclostrobin and tebuconazole presented protective, curative and antisporulating effects against the pathogen. In mini-clonal hedges, only epoxiconazole+pyraclostrobin negatively affected the production of mini-cuttings. 3aplant growth 3aEucalyptus 3asporulation 3aconidia 3afungal diseases of plants 3afungicides 3aleaf spot 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3ain vitro studies 3aspore germination 3aplant cuttings 3amycelium 3aantifungal properties 0aQuambalaria eucalypti 0aleaf spotting1 aAlfenas, A.C.1 aMaffia, L.A.1 aMafia, R.G.1 aMounteer, A.H.0 tCrop protection.g2008 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.161-170dButterworthx0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2007.05.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/02/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03192naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245009100171300001600262500013700278520196000415650002302375650000902398650002602407650002102433650002402454650001102478650001302489650001502502650001102517650001102528650001402539650001802553650001002571700001602581773014502597856005502742852000902797655001202806IND4533878520221120164110.0160119e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453387852DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1086.362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercykutty, v.10aStudies on graft compatibility of buds in growth and Tappability of Hevea Brasiliensis  ap. 285-291.  aPaper presented at the I International Symposium on Vegetable Grafting - ISVG2014 held Mar 17-21, 2014, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China  aThe present experiment was conducted in a statistically laid out field trial to see whether compatibility of different types of lateral buds grafted on the rootstocks contributed to better budding success, uniform growth and higher percentage of trees attaining tappable girth in the 7th year after planting. Five types of dormant buds of one year old scion of the most popular clone RRII 105 viz. Brown leaf scar buds, greenish brown leaf scar buds, greenish brown scale leaf buds, clustered leaf storey buds and tender leaf buds were grafted onto one year old stock seedlings. Results illustrated that the differences in budding success, survival rate and growth parameters in young stage were not significant (P=0.05), except the height of the plants originated from brown leaf scar buds. However, differences became apparent with respect to percentage of trees attaining tappable girth in the 7th year. Trees raised from greenish brown leaf scar buds showed the highest percentage of tappable trees (63.90%) followed by greenish brown scale leaf buds (54.16%) which indicated relatively better performance of these buds in terms of uniform growth and tappability of the trees. Trees originated from brown leaf scar buds recorded moderate (45.45%) tappability. Clustered leaf storey buds and tender leaf buds recorded significantly low tappability of 37.50 and 36.36%, respectively with higher intraclonal variation in growth indicating graft incompatibility of these buds. The highest success in terms of uniform growth and tappability coupled with reduction in gestation period could be achieved by grafting greenish brown leaf scar buds collected from one year old scion. Quality of buds is one of the major factors which determine the quality of the scion in terms of growth and tappability. Selection of buds in a budwood at the time of bud grafting is very important to ensure compatibility and production of quality planting materials in rubber. 3aHevea brasiliensis 3abuds 3afield experimentation 3agestation period 3agraft compatibility 3aleaves 3aplanting 3arootstocks 3arubber 3ascions 3aseedlings 3asurvival rate 3atrees1 aGireesh, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 June 15, , no. 1086 p.285-291dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1086.36  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245012000155300001600275500002400291520120000315650002001515650002001535650002001555650001201575650001301587650001501600650001101615650001501626650001001641650001501651650001201666650001101678700001801689773008801707852000901795856003801804655001201842IND4442508220221120144341.0100917s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444250822DNAL7 a10.1071/RJ100102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCameron, J.M.R.10aOrigins of Travelling Stock Routes. 2. Early development, management, and the growing embrace of the law (1830-70s)  ap. 341-351.  aIncludes references  aTravelling Stock Routes (TSRs) are a network of grazing routes and reserves which are thought to have originated from the informal tracks of early European explorers, pastoralists and settlers. However, their origins are much more complex, and entwined in legislative and administrative attempts from the 1830s to 1870s to manage and control diseases in sheep and cattle. We describe (1) the development of management controls for the emerging TSR network, through the series of enactments in legislatures designed to eradicate scab in sheep, and ovine catarrh from the pastoral industry, and (2) identify the people who made the decisions which influenced the management and design of the TSR network. Requirements for droving permits, access to squatting runs, and historic methods for sheep disease control are described, and development of major quarantine points on stock routes are highlighted. As we indicate, this narrative sets the stage for the formal survey of the first TSRs in the early 1870s, and highlights the rich social and economic drivers that contributed to their development upon the landscape, their design and location, and influence on present-day management approaches. 3acattle diseases 3adecision making 3adisease control 3agrazing 3aindustry 3alandscapes 3apeople 3aquarantine 3asheep 3asheep scab 3asurveys 3atravel1 aSpooner, P.G.0 tRangeland journal.g2010, v. 32, no. 3 p.341-351dCSIRO Publishingx1036-98727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ10010 7aarticle00888naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115242007700132245006700209300001600276500002400292520011900316650001200435650001300447773010100460852000900561939003300570945000800603946001100611655001200622991560568540742620221120144440.0830314e198203  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aPAR830024642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrojan, H.J.10aEye damage as a result of long-term malaria prophylaxis with chloroquine10aAugenschaden bei Langzeitprophylaxe der Malaria mit Chloroquin  ap. 232-236.  aSummary in English.  acorneal and retinal pathology associated with long-term high doses of chloroquine used as antimalarial prophylaxis 3amalaria 3atoxicity0 tKlinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde.g1982 Mar., v. 180, no. 3 p.232-236x0023-21657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830314c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01346naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115242010100132245010400233300001600337500002400353520029900377650002400676650000900700651001200709653001700721653002500738653002400763700001300787700001700800700001700817773010100834852000900935939003300944945000800977946001100985655001200996991560566260742620221120115940.0840423e198304  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aPAR840023312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruntzig, J.10aLymphographic and morphological studies of the conjunctiva in onchocerciasis patients in Liberia10aLymphographische und morphologische Untersuchung der Bindehaut von Onchozerkosepatienten in Liberia  ap. 304-308.  aSummary in English.  aOnchocerca volvulus, patients with conjunctival involvement, lymphographic and morphologic studies showed microfilariae mainly in edematous dilated interstitial channels, no signs of inflammatory cellular reactions found in vicinity of parasites, pathological findings, worm morphology: Liberia 3aOnchocerca volvulus 3aeyes 3aLiberia 0alocalization 0aMorphology, Nematoda 0aPathology, Nematoda1 aLenz, W.1 aAlbiez, E.J.1 aMehlhorn, H.0 tKlinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde.g1983 Apr., v. 182, no. 4 p.304-308x0023-21657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840423c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle00879naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245007000132300001400202500005700216500001600273520010800289650001700397650001900414650001200433700002400445773005900469852000900528939003300537945000800570946001100578655001200589991560564610742620221120103600.0830307e198110  xx |||||o|||||||||||rus||7 aPAR830019992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaidov, G.S.10aTreament of echinococcal cyst perforation into the biliary tracts  ap. 95-96.  aTitle in original language could not be transcribed.  aIn Russian.  aechinococcosis, human, perforation of hepatic cyst into biliary tract, surgical management, case report 3aEchinococcus 3aechinococcosis 3asurgery1 aAbdurakhmanov, M.M.0 tKhirurgiia.g1981 Oct., v. 10 p.95-96x0023-12077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830307c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02456naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100003400186245006300220300001600283500002400299500001500323520085500338650001301193650001401206650001901220650001801239650001301257650002001270650002201290650001201312650003801324650003201362650001801394650002301412650005701435650005701492650005801549653001401607653002301621700002301644773010401667852000901771856008901780930003301869945002501902946001101927655001201938IND4409060220221120084414.0080815e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440906022DNAL7 a186501202pmid7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2008.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aF2001 aCarpita, N.

A deeper understanding of the synthesis, deposition and hydrolysis of the distinctive cell walls of grasses is crucial to gain genetic control of traits that contribute to biomass yield and quality. With a century of genetic investigations and breeding success, recently completed genome sequences, well-characterized cell wall compositions, and a close evolutionary relationship with future bioenergy perennial grasses, we propose that maize and sorghum are key model systems for gene discovery relating to biomass yield and quality in the bioenergy grasses. 3aZea mays 3aC4 plants 3aplant genetics 3agrain sorghum 3abiofuels 3aSorghum bicolor 3agenetic resources 2aBiomass 2aCell Wallxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEnergy-Generating Resources 2aGenome, Plant 2aModels, Biological 2aPoaceaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSorghumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aZea maysxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0abioenergy 0aliterature reviews1 aMcCann, Maureen C.0 tTrends in plant science.g2008 Aug., v. 13, no. 8 p.415-420dElsevier Science Ltd.x1360-13857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2008.06.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/11/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02427naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001800186245006100204300001600265500002400281500001500305520080100320650001301121650002801134650002801162650001301190650002701203650001901230650001901249650004201268650003701310650001301347650002501360650003701385650002301422650003601445650002501481653002301506653002101529700002001550700002201570700002201592773010401614852000901718856008901727930003301816945002501849946001101874655001201885IND4409060120221120084436.0080815e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440906012DNAL7 a186198942pmid7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2008.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF3001 aValluru, Ravi10aFreezing tolerance by vesicle-mediated fructan transport  ap. 409-414.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFructans are fructose-based polymers associated with freezing tolerance.

Fructans and fructan biosynthetic enzymes, in general, are believed to be present in the vacuole. This paper draws particular attention to the surprising presence of fructans and fructan exohydrolase activity in the apoplast of cold-stressed plants. This observation raises questions concerning the origin of apoplastic fructans and suggests that fructans are transported to the apoplast by post-synthesis mechanisms, perhaps induced by cold. We propose a conceptual vesicle-mediated transport model for the movement of vacuolar fructans to the apoplast, where they could assist in stabilizing the plasma membrane. 3afructans 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aphysiological transport 3avacuoles 3aphysiological response 3aplant response 3acold tolerance 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aBiological Transportxphysiology 2aFreezing 2aFructansxmetabolism 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aPlantsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aVacuolesxmetabolism 0aliterature reviews 0aplant physiology1 aLammens, Willem1 aClaupein, Wilhelm1 aVan den Ende, Wim0 tTrends in plant science.g2008 Aug., v. 13, no. 8 p.409-414dElsevier Science Ltd.x1360-13857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2008.05.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/11/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02300naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245009600185300001600281500002400297520105700321650002401378650002301402650001201425650001901437650001501456650001701471650001501488650002201503653001901525653002301544700001801567700002201585773010401607852000901711856008901720930003301809945002501842946001101867655001201878IND4409049420221120084322.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440904942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ501 0aQ1111 aGiménez, Ana10aConsumer reaction to changes in sensory profile of dulce de leche due to lactose hydrolysis  ap. 951-955.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of lactose hydrolysis on the sensory profile of dulce de leche and consumer reaction to this process using overall acceptability data and survival analysis calculations was examined. Lactose hydrolysis caused marked changes in the sensory profile of dulce de leche, particularly for flavor and texture, leading to a decrease in consumer overall acceptability and intent to purchase the product. Survival analysis methodology was used to estimate the consumer rejection percentage to purchase dulce de leche as a function of lactose hydrolysis percentage. Using a Weibull distribution, lactose hydrolysis percentage corresponding to a 10% consumer rejection was calculated as 4.6+/-0.4%, in agreement with calculations from least significant difference in overall acceptability, suggesting that both methodologies might provide similar results. Survival analysis could be used to estimate limits for ingredient replacement or changes in manufacturing processes that cause complex sensory changes in the product, leading to consumer rejection. 3aconsumer acceptance 3asensory properties 3alactose 3adairy products 3ahydrolysis 3afood quality 3ashelf life 3aMaillard reaction 0adulce de leche 0alactose hydrolysis1 aAres, Gaston.1 aGámbaro, Adriana0 tInternational dairy journal.g2008 Sept., v. 18, no. 9 p.951-955dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.12.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/10/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02274naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100002900177245004500206300001600251500002400267520082300291650002301114650001701137650001501154650001401169650003501183650002301218650002201241650002101263650003901284650003901323650004001362650004301402653002301445700001901468700002101487700002501508773010401533852000901637856008901646930003301735945002501768946001101793655001201804IND4409060520140724000000.0080815e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440906052DNAL7 a186501192pmid7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2008.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aBerger, F.q(Frédéric)10aDouble fertilization - caught in the act  ap. 437-443.  aIncludes references  aIn flowering plants, fertilization is unique because it involves two pairs of male and female gametes, a process known as double fertilization. Here, we provide an overview of the field and a detailed review of the outstanding recent advances, including in vivo imaging of double fertilization and the identification of a signaling pathway controlling the release of the male gametes and of a protein involved in gamete membrane fusion. These recent results are stepping stones for further research; our knowledge of double fertilization is expanding as newly discovered molecular pathways are explored and new mutants are characterized. Controlling plant fertilization is essential for seed production, and molecular understanding of double fertilization will provide the tools to improve crops and breeding programs. 3aplant reproduction 3apollen tubes 3acell cycle 3achromatin 2aFlowersxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPollen Tubexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPollinationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aReproductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0aliterature reviews1 aHamamura, Yuki1 aIngouff, Mathieu1 aHigashiyama, Tetsuya0 tTrends in plant science.g2008 Aug., v. 13, no. 8 p.437-443dElsevier Science Ltd.x1360-13857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2008.05.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20081112b20081206c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/11/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02815naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002400128245006700152300001600219520126200235650001401497650001301511650002201524650001201546650001501558650002101573650001801594650002801612650001201640650001001652650001201662650004601674650001201720650003301732650001601765650003701781650001101818650001401829650002401843650002201867650001501889650002401904650003101928650001201959653001601971653002301987700001802010700001402028700001902042773011002061852000902171930003302180945001302213946001102226655001202237IND2052413720221120073548.0960802e199504  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205241372DNAL7 a77885592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcEwen Nicholls, D.10aBrain mRNA from infants of aluminium-exposed lactating rabbits  ap. 365-370.  aThe neurotoxicity of aluminium (Al) involves bundling of neurofilaments, increased chromatin binding and decreased protein synthesis in Al injected rabbits. Thus, using an amphipathic Al ligand, maltol, experiments were carried out to examine whether or not administration of Al to lactating mother rabbits reduces brain protein synthesis in their offspring. Lactating mother rabbits received s c. injections 3 times weekly of aluminium (Al) maltolate (1 mg Al/kg body wt) or an equivalent weight of maltol, for 4 weeks post-partum. Polysome preparations were obtained from the brain of their infants in order to assess mRNA translation in cell-free protein synthesizing systems. The brain polysomes showed a statistically significant reduction in the incorporation of [14C]leucine into protein. The poly (A)+ and poly (A)- fractions obtained from these polysomes showed reductions of 44% or more in the incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein. A variety of products separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis all exhibited decreased labelling. These experiments suggest that infant rabbits exposed to a highly neurotoxic form of Al in milk exhibit changes in brain protein synthesis which resemble those in infants injected directly with Al. 3alactation 3aaluminum 3aprotein synthesis 3aleucine 3amethionine 3aisotope labeling 3amessenger RNA 3amaternal-fetal transfer 3ainfants 3abrain 3arabbits 2aAluminum Compoundsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxmetabolism 2aBody Weight 2aBrainxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLeucinexmetabolism 2aMaternal Exposure 2aOrgan Size 2aPyronesxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRabbits 0atranslation 0aaluminum maltolate1 aSpeares, G.M.1 aAsina, S.1 aMiller, A.C.M.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g1995 Apr., v. 27, no. 4 p.365-370x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03566naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245012600147300001600273500001500289520185400304650001302158650001102171650001502182650002602197650001502223650002602238650001202264650001802276650003702294650002202331650001602353650003102369650002502400650005102425650004002476650001802516650002702534650002802561650002402589650002202613650002202635650001902657653001702676653001202693653002202705653001902727653001202746653002202758700002002780773011002800852000902910930003302919945001302952946001102965655001202976IND2052413420221120073652.0960802e199504  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205241342DNAL7 a77885572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDroupadi, P.R.10aAbsorption spectroscopy of the complexation between superpotent guanidinium sweeteners and specific monoclonal antibodies  ap. 351-357.  a2019-12-05  aSpectroscopic studies of antibody-antigen interactions can provide useful information about the interactive motifs and energetics involved in the intermolecular association process. In this study we used absorption spectroscopy to examine the interactions between five different monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and four superpotent ligand sweeteners. Quantitative changes in the absorption spectra in the wavelength range of 230-800 nm were utilized for the determination of intrinsic association constants and thermodynamic parameters of the mAb-ligand complexes. The intrinsic association constants for the mAb-ligand complexes were found to be in the range of 10(7)-10(5)IM-1 and were in agreement with previous radioimmunoassay determinations. For two mAb, qualitative changes in the spectra in the 340 nm range could be identified and were related to the presence of charge-transfer interaction between the guanidinium ligand and aromatic residues in the binding site of the mAb. A charge transfer spectra was observed in mAb NC10.8 with two different sweetener ligands. The thermodynamic parameters of the ligand-mAb interactions were analyzed by van't Hoff plots and in almost all cases the reactions were found to be enthalpically driven. The determinations of intrinsic affinity and thermodynamic parameters may be useful in computer-aided molecular modeling studies of the antibody binding pocket and predicted ligand docking orientations. Antibody NC6.8 was found to react with this set of sweetener ligands in a rank order that is related to their sweetness potencies and the spectroscopic findings for NC6.8 are in agreement with the X-ray diffraction data of the Fab-ligand crystal structures. These studies may shed light on the molecular nature of these superpotent sweetener ligands and their interactions with putative taste receptors. 3aenthalpy 3aenergy 3aabsorbance 3aartificial sweeteners 3aguanidines 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aentropy 3abinding sites 3astructure-activity relationships 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3aantigen-antibody reactions 2aAcetatesximmunology 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxchemistryximmunology. 2aAntigen-Antibody Complexxchemistry 2aBinding Sites 2aGuanidinesximmunology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Structure 2aSpectrophotometry 2aSweetening Agents 2aThermodynamics 0ainteractions 0aligands 0acomplex formation 0athermodynamics 0aanalogs 0abinding constants1 aLinthicum, D.S.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g1995 Apr., v. 27, no. 4 p.351-357x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02518naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001900184245015900203300001200362500002400374500001500398520098300413650001601396650002401412650002301436650001701459650001601476650001701492650001901509650001301528650001501541650000901556650001801565650001501583650001401598653000901612653002101621653001101642653002001653653002401673700003101697773008201728852000901810856008801819930003301907945002501940946001101965655001201976IND4409064720221120063426.0080815e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440906472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2007.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL500 0aL200 0aQ5011 aSzulc, Tadeusz10aEffect of methionine and fishmeal added to the diet of cows with different beta-lactoglobulin genotypes on the composition and physical properties of milk  ap. 1-6.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of protected methionine (20 mg/head/day) and fishmeal (300 g of crude protein/head/day) on milk yield, composition and physical properties, as well as the proportion of individual casein fractions, was analysed for 41 Black-and-White cows with different milk beta-lactoglobulin genotypes (AA, AB and BB).

The addition of fishmeal to the diet of AB beta-lactoglobulin genotype cows resulted in a significant decrease in the content of urea together with an increase in the content of crude protein and casein, including alpha- and beta-caseins, in milk. 3acow feeding 3aphysical properties 3aexperimental diets 3aalpha-casein 3abeta-casein 3amilk quality 3alactoglobulins 3agenotype 3amethionine 3acows 3acrude protein 3amilk yield 3afish meal 0adiet 0amilk composition 0acasein 0aprotein content 0aprotein composition1 aPawelska-Góral, Magdalena0 tLivestock science.g2008 Aug., v. 117, no. 1 p.1-6dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2007.11.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20081030b20081101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/10/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02599naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001400183245004900197300001600246500002400262500001500286520101700301650002101318650001001339650002501349650001401374650001701388650002301405650001801428650001701446650002001463650002801483650001201511650002801523650001701551650005301568650001101621650001201632650002201644653002001666700001601686700001401702700001901716700001801735700001701753773008701770852000901857856008601866930003301952945002501985946001102010655001202021IND4399562820221120035432.0071231e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956282DNAL7 a171415412pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aL8401 aArens, D.10aSeasonal changes in bone metabolism in sheep  ap. 585-591.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThere is a great need for animal models of osteoporosis and sheep are a suitable large animal that meets most requirements. Since it is known that bone mass in humans responds to seasonal changes, this study investigated natural bone metabolism in sheep in order to better define the sheep as a model for osteoporosis. Bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular structure, biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption and estrogen were analysed over a period of 18 months. The lowest BMDs, measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), were observed during winter. Thereafter, a 5.1% increase in BMD was observed during spring and summer (P < 0.05). Bone resorption markers showed a variable pattern, with higher values in spring compared to autumn (P < 0.001). The physiological estrus phase during autumn was detected by serum estrogen levels. The findings show that it is necessary to take seasonal variations into account if sheep are used to establish an animal model for osteoporosis. 3aestrus detection 3asheep 3alongitudinal studies 3aestrogens 3abone density 3aseasonal variation 3aanimal models 3aosteoporosis 3abone resorption 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aBone Density 2aBone and Bonesxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aSeasons 2aSheepxmetabolism 0abone metabolism1 aSigrist, I.1 aAlini, M.1 aSchawalder, P.1 aSchneider, E.1 aEgermann, M.0 tVeterinary journal.g2007 Nov., v. 174, no. 3 p.585-591dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.10.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03168naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001600183245014300199300001600342500002400358500001500382520099500397650002001392650002101412650003001433650002001463650002801483650001801511650001801529650001601547650001101563650003101574650001001605650001201615650002901627650001101656650005501667650002001722650009001742650005201832650001701884650006301901650005701964650003502021650001902056653002202075653003902097653002002136700002002156700001502176700001602191700001702207700001902224773008702243852000902330856008602339930003302425945002502458946001102483655001202494IND4399563520221120035331.0071231e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956352DNAL7 a171695922pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8331 aVangeel, I.10aEfficacy of a modified live intranasal bovine respiratory syncytial virus vaccine in 3-week-old calves experimentally challenged with BRSV  ap. 627-635.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo experimental bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) challenge studies were undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a single intranasal dose of a bivalent modified live vaccine containing BRSV in 3-week-old calves. In the first study, vaccine efficacy was evaluated in colostrum deprived (maternal antibody negative) calves 5, 10 and 21 days after vaccination. Nasal shedding of BRSV was significantly reduced in vaccinated calves challenged 10 or 21 days after vaccination. Virus excretion titres were also reduced in vaccinates challenged 5 days after vaccination but reduction in duration of shedding and total amount of virus shed were not statistically significant. Clinical disease after challenge in this study was mild. In the second study, vaccine efficacy was assessed in calves with maternal antibodies against BRSV by challenge 66 days post-vaccination. Vaccination significantly reduced nasal shedding after challenge and the severity of clinical disease was also reduced. 3acattle diseases 3aveterinary drugs 3aintranasal administration 3adrug evaluation 3aBovine orthopneumovirus 3alive vaccines 3aanimal models 3avaccination 3acalves 2aAdministration, Intranasal 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aLeukocyte Count 2aRespiratory Syncytial Virus Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aRespiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovineximmunology 2aTime Factors 2aVaccines, Attenuatedxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aViral Vaccinesxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aViremiaximmunologyxvirology. 2aVirus Shedding 0apathogen shedding 0aBovine respiratory syncytial virus 0aviral challenge1 aAntonis, A.F.G.1 aFluess, M.1 aRiegler, L.1 aPeters, A.R.1 aHarmeyer, S.S.0 tVeterinary journal.g2007 Nov., v. 174, no. 3 p.627-635dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.10.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02328naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245013100169300001600300520100900316650002301325650001301348650001601361650001301377650001101390650002001401650001601421650001601437650001301453653001101466653001701477653001801494653002401512653001701536700001601553700001501569700001501584700001501599773012301614852000901737856009201746930003301838946001101871655001201882IND4434508620221120024834.0100326e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443450862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-1090.2009.00098.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTSCHUDIN, A.10aEvaluation of hand-rearing records for Spix's macaw Cyanopsitta spixii at the Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation from 2005 to 2007  ap. 201-211.  aThis investigation evaluates the feeding and growth of 14 Spix's macaw Cyanopsitta spixii at the Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation from 2005 to 2007. The follow-up period lasted for up to c. 6 months. The average weight of the chicks, the mean brooder temperature, the number of feedings per day, the formula fed, the ratio of the total amount fed per body weight and the number of regurgitating chicks per day were analysed. Four different feeding strategies (differences in feeding formula and amount fed) are compared with regard to the weight gain. Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 were fed more restrictively than Group 1 and, therefore, reached a lower peak weight, although all four groups finally reached the same weight level around day 100. An association between non-restrictive feeding and the number of regurgitations is suggested in the data set. All chicks survived and were weaned successfully. The investigation indicates the importance of a restrictive feeding strategy and individual control. 3aCyanopsitta spixii 3aaluminum 3abody weight 3abrooders 3achicks 3adata collection 3atemperature 3aweight gain 3awildlife 0agrowth 0ahand rearing 0aregurgitation 0arestrictive feeding 0aSpix's macaw1 aRETTMER, H.1 aWatson, R.1 aCLAUSS, M.1 aHAMMER, S.0 tInternational zoo yearbook.g2010 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.201-211dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0074-96647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-1090.2009.00098.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100326b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02228naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245007000170300001600240520099500256650001501251650002601266650002701292653001801319700002101337700001901358700001801377700002101395700002401416700002101440700002401461700002301485700002001508700002501528773013901553852000901692856008501701930003301786946001101819655001201830IND4432506720221123033848.0100205e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443250672DNAL7 a10.1134/S10681620100101392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalinichenko, A.

The affinity and cross reactivity of these antibodies were determined using the methods of direct, indirect, and competitive ELISA. The structures of monoclonal antibody genes were comprehensively studied and the variable and constant regions of the antibody genes were cloned and sequenced. Sequencing analysis confirmed the results of isotyping the light and heavy antibody chains obtained by ELISA. Variable and constant fragments of the antibody genes were cloned into a bicistron expression vector for the recombinant Fab-fragment for one of the antibodies expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Thus, data were obtained that can be useful for the development of an aflatoxin detection system on the basis of the described monoclonal antibodies and the creation of recombinant antibodies with changed parameters of specificity using protein engineering methods. 3aaflatoxins 3amonoclonal antibodies 3arecombinant antibodies 0aFab-fragments1 aToporova, V.

Immunological and enzymatic studies showed that antibodies against lung cytochrome P450LgM2 inhibited benzphetamine N-demethylation, ethylmorphine N-demethylation and aniline 4-hydroxylation reactions in sheep lung microsomes about 99, 80 and 62%, respectively. Benzphetamine N-demethylation reaction in sheep lung microsomes was only catalyzed by cytochrome P450LgM2 isozyme while the other isozymes of P450 as well as P450LgM2 are also involved in the metabolism of ethylmorphine and aniline. Similar to lung microsomes, benzphetamine N-demethylase activity of the reconstituted systems containing purified sheep lung cytochrome P450LgM2 or phenobarbital (PB)-treated rabbit liver cytochrome P450LgM2(2B4) was also inhibited by P450LgM2 antibodies about 95 and 82%, respectively. A 50% inhibitory effect of sheep P450LgM2 antibodies was also observed in ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity of the reconstituted system containing purified sheep lung cytochrome P450LgM2. SDS-PAGE peptide maps obtained following the partial proteolysis of purified sheep lung cytochrome P450LgM2 and PB-rabbit liver P450LM2(2B4) isozymes, using chymotrypsin and papain, were similar in general. However they showed some differences both qualitatively and quantitatively, suggesting that some differences exist among the amino acid sequences of sheep lung cytochrome P450LgM2 and rabbit liver cytochrome P4502B4. 3aimmunochemistry 3asheep 3aantibodies 3ametabolic detoxification 3aproteolysis 3amicrosomes 3acytochrome P-450 3achromosome mapping 3alungs 3aenzyme activity 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Specificity 2aBlotting, Western 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme System 2aImmunochemistry 2aLungxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aMicrosomesxenzymology 2aOxidoreductases, N-Demethylatingxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Mapping 2aRabbits 2aSheep 2aSpecies Specificity 0apurification 0abenzphetamine n-demethylase activity 0aethylmorphine n-demethylase activity 0adrug metabolism 0ainhibition 0apeptide mapping1 aAbu-Baker, T.1 aArinc, E.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g1996 Mar., v. 28, no. 3 p.363-372x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03222naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245016000143300001800303500001500321520134300336650000901679650001901688650002501707650001901732650002601751650002101777650002001798650001501818650000701833650001001840650002101850650002001871650001101891650007801902650002301980650003202003650001202035650001602047650003302063650002902096650004002125650007502165650000902240650002602249650000902275650001702284653001702301653001202318653001402330653001002344653001902354700001602373700001602389773011302405852000902518930003302527945001302560946001102573655001202584IND2051879020221123011340.0960626e199510  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205187902DNAL7 a74969962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujita, H.10aADP-ribosylation in adrenal glands: purification and characterization of mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases and ADP-ribosylhydrolase affecting cytoskeletal actin  ap. 1065-1078.  a2019-12-05  aMono-ADP-ribosylation in mammals is poorly understood.

After tryptic digestion of alkylated actin mono-ADP-ribosylated by the purified mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases or botulinum C2 toxin, the two radioactive peptide patterns were identical. The purified ADP-ribosylhydrolase with mono-ADP-ribosylated actin as the substrate had a molecular weight of 61,000 on gel filtration, a pH optimum of 7.5, and a Km for mono-ADP-ribosylated actin of about 7 micromolar. The enzyme released ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated actin and the alpha-subunit of heteromeric GTP-binding proteins. Actin monomers mono-ADP-ribosylated by the four mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases did not form actin filaments after the addition of Mg2+. After release of ADP-ribose by ADP-ribosylhydrolase, actin filaments formed on the addition of Mg2+, suggesting that the polymerization and depolymerization of cytoplasmic actin the adrenal chromaffin cells may be regulated by mono-ADP-ribosylation. 3arats 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3apentosyltransferases 3apolymerization 3aadenosine diphosphate 3achromaffin cells 3aadrenal medulla 3ahydrolases 3apH 3aactin 3amolecular weight 3aenzyme activity 3aribose 2aADP Ribose Transferasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aAdrenal Medullaxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBiopolymers 2aBotulinum Toxinsxmetabolism 2aCytoskeletonxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aN-Glycosyl Hydrolases 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0apurification 0abinding 0astability 0acells 0aadrenal glands1 aOkamoto, H.1 aTsuyama, S.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g1995 Oct., v. 27, no. 10 p.1065-1078x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02794naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002500158245009100183300001600274500002400290500001500314520110300329650001301432650001801445650001801463650001401481650002501495650001801520650002201538650002201560650001301582650001701595650001501612650001501627650001901642650001501661653001701676653008101693653002801774700002401802700002101826700002101847700001901868700002701887700001901914700002401933773010401957852000902061856008902070930003302159945002502192946001102217655001202228IND4409048420140724000000.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440904842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5011 aVanderghem, Caroline10aProteome analysis of the bovine milk fat globule: Enhancement of membrane purification  ap. 885-893.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA simple and rapid procedure was developed for the extraction of the milk fat globule membrane from milk removes the large majority of the skim milk proteins for proteome analysis. In order to improve the extraction and the solubilization of the hydrophobic membrane proteins for subsequent two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, four detergents (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, amidosulfobetaine-14, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate and sodium deoxycholate) were tested in the sample preparation, associated with a sonication step. Zwitterionic detergents were shown to be efficient in recovering integral and peripheral proteins from membrane material. Spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF). The advantages of MALDI-TOF/TOF (speed, easiness of analysis, good sensitivity and high mass accuracy) were demonstrated on the milk fat globule membrane proteome investigation. Identified proteins are implicated in a wide range of functions including fat secretion and transport, protein trafficking and regulation. 3aproteome 3amilk analysis 3amilk proteins 3askim milk 3aultrasonic treatment 3arapid methods 3amembrane proteins 3amass spectrometry 3amilk fat 3afat globules 3aextraction 3aproteomics 3asolubilization 3adetergents 0apurification 0amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry 0azwitterionic detergents1 aBlecker, Christophe1 aDanthine, Sabine1 aDeroanne, Claude1 aHaubruge, Eric1 aGuillonneau, François1 aDe Pauw, Edwin1 aFrancis, Frédéric0 tInternational dairy journal.g2008 Sept., v. 18, no. 9 p.885-893dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.02.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20110627b20110701c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02015naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001500158245007300173300001600246500002400262520073400286650001501020650002601035650001801061650002201079650000701101650002501108650001301133650001201146653002001158653002601178700002101204700001601225700002401241700001601265700001701281773010401298852000901402856008901411930003301500945002501533946001101558655001201569IND4409048920221122234824.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440904892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1211 aAnanou, S.10aOptimization of enterocin AS-48 production on a whey-based substrate  ap. 923-927.  aIncludes references  aThis study demonstrates the optimization of AS-48 production by strain Enterococcus faecalis A-48-32 using a whey-derived substrate, Esprion-300 (E-300). To optimise AS-48 production, various factors such as E-300 concentration, glucose, pH and inoculum size were adjusted. The following optimal conditions were established: a growth medium comprising 5% E-300 and 1% glucose, inoculated with 8% producer strain and incubated at 28^oC with a controlled pH of 6.55. Under these conditions a maximum activity of 360AUmL^-^1 was attained after 18h and remained relatively constant for 24h. The critical factors for optimal AS-48 production in this medium were the pH stabilization at 6.55, in addition to a 1% glucose concentration. 3aenterocins 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3awhey products 3aenzyme substrates 3apH 3alactic acid bacteria 3ainoculum 3aglucose 0aenterocin AS-48 0awhey-based substrates1 aMuñoz Páez, A.1 aGálvez, A.1 aMartínez-Bueno, M.1 aMaqueda, M.1 aValdivia, E.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2008 Sept., v. 18, no. 9 p.923-927dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.02.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03362naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245019100142300001800333500001500351520168100366650001402047650001002061650002102071650002502092650001102117650000902128650000902137650002502146650001002171650002102181650001902202650001202221650002202233650000902255650004002264650001102304650002802315650002502343650000902368650002102377650002702398650001202425650005102437653001702488653001602505653002402521700001602545700001502561700001702576773011302593852000902706930003302715945001302748946001102761655001202772IND2052358120221122234827.0960730e199512  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205235812DNAL7 a85818222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeda, K.10aPurification and characterization of canine manganese superoxide dismutase and its immunohistochemical localization in canine heart compared with that of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase  ap. 1257-1265.  a2019-12-05  aSeveral forms of superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1) are known to be major scavengers of superoxide radicals which are involved in various kinds of injuries including heart failure. In an attempt to elucidate the protective system of the canine heart against superoxide radical, the present study immunohistochemically examined the localizations of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) in the canine heart. Mn-SOD was purified homogeneously from canine liver by chromatography on a DE-52 column and a CM-S2 column, followed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G200 column: the purified enzyme consisted of two identical subunits of molecular weight 22,000. Polyclonal antibody was prepared against the purified Mn-SOD, and its specificity was confirmed by Western blotting. The Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD in canine hearts were examined by immunocytochemical staining using specific anti Mn-SOD serum and anti-canine Cu,Zn-SOD serum prepared previously. Cu,Zn-SOD was localized in vessel cells including the endothelium, whereas little Mn-SOD occurred in the vessel cells but some was located in the endothelium. The corrected Cu,Zn-SOD activity (714 +/- 27 U/ml; mean +/- SEM, n = 4) was similar to that of the corrected Mn-SOD activity (633 +/- 42 U/ml; n = 4) in the canine heart. The present study shows that both forms of SOD are present in the endothelium. It is concluded that they may cooperatively scavenge superoxide radicals generated around the canine heart vessels, and Cu,Zn-SOD may be functional in secondary protection of the myocytes against more severe injury derived from superoxide radicals in the vessel cells. 3amanganese 3aliver 3aprotein subunits 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acopper 3azinc 3adogs 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aheart 3amolecular weight 3aanimal tissues 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aDogs 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFemale 2aFree Radical Scavengers 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMale 2aMolecular Weight 2aMyocardiumxenzymology 2aRabbits 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexisolation & purification 0apurification 0acomparisons 0atissue localization1 aMatsumi, S.1 aMagara, T.1 aNakagawa, S.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g1995 Dec., v. 27, no. 12 p.1257-1265x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02380naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245007200142300001600214520098200230650000801212650000801220650002901228650001401257650001401271650002301285650002001308650002001328650000701348650002001355650001601375650001101391650001401402650002801416650003501444650002001479650003101499650006401530653002001594700001601614773010801630852000901738856009401747930003301841945001301874946001101887655001201898IND2334095620221122213850.0030911e200303  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233409562DNAL7 a127152552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, J.10aDegradation of DNA during the autolysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 175-182.  aThe autolysis of yeast cells has practical implications in the production of fermented foods and beverages and flavourants for food processing. Protein and RNA degradation during yeast autolysis are well described but the fate of DNA is unclear. Yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were autolysed by incubating suspensions at 30-60 degrees C (pH 7.0), and at pH 4.0-7.0 (40 degrees C) for 10-14 days. Up to 55% of total DNA was degraded, with consequent leakage into the extracellular environment of mainly 3'- and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides, and lesser amounts of polynucleotides. The rate and extent of DNA degradation, composition of the DNA degradation products and DNase activity were affected by temperature and pH. The highest amount of DNA degradation occurred at 40 degrees C and pH 7.0, where the highest DNase activity was recorded. DNase activity was lowest at 60 degrees C and pH 4.0, where the proportion of polynucleotides in the degradation products was higher. 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aautolysis 3abeverages 3adeoxyribonucleases 3afermented foods 3afood processing 3apH 3apolynucleotides 3atemperature 3ayeasts 2aAutolysis 2aDNA, Fungalxmetabolism 2aDeoxyribonucleasesxmetabolism 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxenzymologyxmetabolism. 0adna degradation1 aFleet, G.H.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2003 Mar., v. 30, no. 3 p.175-182x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3Table of contents and abstracts  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02855naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004100125300001500166500018900181500002400370520178600394650001002180650001402190650001602204650001502220650001002235700002702245700001802272700001702290773013902307852000902446856008602455655001202541IND4461534420221122213908.0110819s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446153442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsteva, J.10aSeed regeneration of melon germplasm  ap. 97-101.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Seed, Transplant and Stand Establishment of Horticultural Crops, held September 27 - October 1, 2009, Murcia and Almeria, Spain.  aIncludes references  aBetween 2002 and 2008 the UPCT (Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena) has regenerated and characterized 125 melon accessions from the germplasm bank of the UPV (Universidad Politécnica de Valencia). Thirty of them were contaminated, since their seeds generated plants of different types. The other 95 accessions were uniform regarding type. Sixty-six of the 95 uniform accessions were regenerated using only hand pollination, which yielded an average of 1322 seeds per accession. The remaining 29 accessions were multiplied using pollination mesh cages, combined with a few hand crosses in case the plants of the cage had been morphologically different. We obtained an average of 3895 seeds for each of these 29 accessions. It seems reasonable to attribute these differences in seed yield to the fact that pollination in cages takes place in more natural conditions than when it is manual. In the cases where accessions were contaminated, the exclusive use of hand pollination produced an average of 572 valid seeds per accession. The use of cages reduced the amount of valid seeds to 334 seeds per accession, after rejecting the seeds obtained in cages (since several types of melon plants appeared), and only keeping those obtained from the additional hand crosses. The use of cages is not more expensive than the exclusive use of hand pollination, if the accessions are not contaminated, and it seems to favour controlled multiplication. For contaminated accessions, the use of cages does not seem so advantageous. In any case, seeds harvested in cages can be used in the culling of contaminated accessions by means of hand pollination in later seasons, since it is likely that a fraction of seeds comes from self-pollinations or crosses among plants of the authentic variety. 3acages 3agermplasm 3apollination 3aseed yield 3aseeds1 aMartinez-Sanchez, J.J.1 aVicente, M.J.1 aMigliaro, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 June, , no. 898 p.97-101dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/898/898_11.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04277naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245017900150300001600329520239000345650001202735650001902747650001702766650001102783650001602794650001002810650001402820650001802834650003102852650002202883650001202905650001802917650002202935650002002957650001302977650003702990650001103027650004503038650003903083650002803122650007103150650002803221650003003249650003203279650005503311650004403366650001203410650002603422653001403448700001703462700002003479773011003499852000903609930003303618945001303651946001103664655001203675IND2051451220221122171553.0960529e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205145122DNAL7 a76484272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayat-Sarmadi, M.14aThe effects of various kinase and phosphatase inhibitors on the transmission of the prolactin and extracellular matrix signals to rabbit alpha S1-casein and transferrin genes  ap. 707-718.  aIn all species, milk protein genes are specifically expressed in the mammary gland under the control of lactogenic hormones and extracellular matrix. In rabbit, casein gene expression is induced by prolactin alone and this induction is amplified by extracellular matrix. Transferrin gene expression is induced by extracellular matrix in the absence of hormones. The transduction mechanisms of prolactin and extracellular matrix to milk protein genes is only partly known. The present study has been undertaken to determine if protein kinases and phosphatases are involved in these mechanisms. Rabbit primary mammary cells were cultured in three different conditions (i) directly on floating collagen I, (ii) on plastic after a trypsinization to remove endogenous extracellular matrix, and (iii) on floating collagen I after a trypsinization to restore a functional extracellular matrix. In these culture conditions, prolactin and several protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors were added to the medium. The expression of alpha S1-casein and transferrin gene was evaluated using Northern blotting analysis. In cells cultured directly on collagen I, staurosporine, quercetin and 6-dimethylaminopurine strongly inhibited prolactin action of alpha S1-casein gene whereas herbimycin A was only partly inhibitory. An erbstatin analogue, tyrosine phosphate, 1(5 isoquinolylsulphonyl) 2-methylpiperazine and GF 109 203 X did not alter prolactin action. The inhibitors which inhibited prolactin action when cells were directly cultured on collagen I were also those which prevented the induction of alpha S1-casein gene expression when cells were cultured on plastic in the absence of extracellular matrix. The induction of transferrin gene by the extracellular matrix was inhibited slightly by quercetin. Okadaic acid, phenylarsine oxide and sodium pervanadate which inhibit Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatase inhibitors were unable to mimic prolactin action on alpha S1-casein gene expression. On the contrary, these inhibitors prevented prolactin action. These data suggest that a cascade including protein kinase and phosphates for Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphate is involved in the transduction of the prolactin message from its receptor to casein genes. The signal delivered to the mammary cells by the extracellular matrix is quite different, possibly involving another cascade of protein kinases. 3arabbits 3amammary glands 3acell culture 3acasein 3atransferrin 3agenes 3aprolactin 3amessenger RNA 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aenzyme inhibitors 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCaseinsxgenetics 2aCells, Cultured 2aCollagen 2aExtracellular Matrixxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aProlactinxpharmacology 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitors 2aProtein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aProtein-Tyrosine Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRabbits 2aTransferrinxgenetics 0ainduction1 aPuissant, C.1 aHoudebine, L.M.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g1995 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.707-718x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03974naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002500128245008300153300001600236500001500252520204300267650001002310650001602320650002302336650001402359650002602373650001302399650001402412650002302426650002702449650001202476650000902488650002402497650001202521650006902533650000902602650003902611650005202650650003702702650000902739650006702748650004402815650000902859650001702868650004002885650006502925650005402990650004003044653000903084653001603093700001803109700002403127700002103151773011003172852000903282930003303291945001303324946001103337655001203348IND2051450820221122171604.0960529e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205145082DNAL7 a76484242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedraza-Chaverri, J.10aEffect of dietary antioxidants on puromycin aminonucleoside nephrotic syndrome  ap. 683-691.  a2019-12-05  aSeveral studies indicate the pathophysiological importance of reactive oxygen species in rats with nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside, an experimental model of the human minimal change disease. The role of reactive oxygen species in these rats was further evaluated, examining the effect of dietary deficiency and supplementation of antioxidants (vitamin E and selenium) on biochemical and renal ultrastructural alterations induced by puromycin aminonucleoside. Male Wistar rats, weaned at 3 weeks, were placed on diets normal, deficient or supplemented in vitamin E and selenium for 4 weeks. At the end of this period, rats were divided in two groups: control (sacrificed without any further treatment) and nephrotic (injected with puromycin aminonucleoside and sacrificed 7 and 22 days later). In control rats, the dietary deficiency or supplementation of antioxidants resulted in no significative differences in renal function, proteinuria or kidney ultrastructure. However, kidney lipoperoxidation, kidney glutathione peroxidase activity and circulating levels of vitamin E changed according to the amount of antioxidants in the diet. Seven days after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside, rats fed normal, deficient or supplemented diets, developed nephrotic syndrome. However, proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, renal dysfunction and ultrastructural alterations were higher in rats fed a deficient diet. In contrast, proteinuria and kidney ultrastructural alterations were lower in rats fed a supplemented diet. Kidney lipoperoxidation and glutathione peroxidase activity increased on day 7 in rats fed a normal or a deficient diet, but not in rats fed a supplemented diet. This study shows that nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside in rats is modified by dietary antioxidants (vitamin E and selenium). Dietary supplementation ameliorates it and dietary deficiency exacerbates it. It is concluded that reactive oxygen species are involved in the pathophysiology of this experimental disease. 3aurine 3ablood serum 3alipid peroxidation 3avitamin E 3anutrient deficiencies 3aselenium 3apuromycin 3anephrotic syndrome 3aglutathione peroxidase 3akidneys 3arats 3adietary supplements 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aDiet 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aKidneyxenzymologyxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aNephrotic Syndromexchemically inducedxmetabolismxpathology. 2aPuromycin Aminonucleosidexpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSeleniumxadministration & dosagexdeficiencyxpharmacology. 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aVitamin E Deficiencyxcomplications 0adiet 0aproteinuria1 aArevalo, A.E.1 aHernandez-Pando, R.1 aLarriva-Sahd, J.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g1995 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.683-691x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02777naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012700167300001600294500002400310520181400334650001902148650001902167650001302186650001402199650001402213650001302227650001102240700002302251700002602274773009402300852000902394856004802403655001202451IND4414424020221122104038.0090102e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441442402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-008-9453-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkegami, Makihiko10aRamet phenology and clonal architectures of the clonal sedge Schoenoplectus americanus (Pers.) Volk. ex Schinz & R. Keller  ap. 287-301.  aIncludes references  aThe clonal plant Schoenoplectus americanus shows variable belowground clonal architecture as a result of producing two types of ramets: those with very long rhizomes (long rhizome ramet, LRR) and those with very short ones (short rhizome ramet, SRR). In a previous study we demonstrated that the two types of ramets are functionally specialised. The production of SRRs results in the formation of consolidated clonal patches with densely packed shoots, while the production of LRRs results in a more diffuse network of connected rhizomes with widely spaced shoots. We hypothesised that the two types of ramets would be produced at different times during the growing season because of their functional differences. The production of LRRs throughout the growing season would enable the species to continuously explore new habitats while the production of SRRs early in the growing season would enable the species to occupy and consolidate resources in available open patches. We evaluated this hypothesis through field observations in different communities with S. americanus and indeed found that SRRs were produced early in the growing season while LRRs tended to be produced over an extended period of time. Plants in high-quality environments (i.e. higher light conditions) produced more SRRs, and these were formed early in the growing season. In contrast, plants in low-quality environments produced more LRRs, and these were formed continuously over the growing season. We also observed that the shoot longevity was greater for SRR. In high-quality patches, the production of the lower cost SRRs results in a more rapid occupancy of open spaces; in lower quality patches, the production of LRRs throughout the growing season enables plants to explore the immediate environment for higher quality patches. 3aSchoenoplectus 3agrowing season 3ahabitats 3alongevity 3aphenology 3arhizomes 3ashoots1 aWhigham, Dennis F.1 aWerger, Marinus J.

For this purpose, a statistical approach is developed for assessment and selection of the optimal combination of water quality variables. The proposed approach overcomes deficiencies in the conventional correlation-regression approach used to assess and eventually reduce the number of water quality variables in WQM networks. For the reduction of water quality variables, criteria developed from record-augmentation procedures are integrated with correlation analysis and cluster analysis to identify highly associated water quality variables. This step is followed by the application of an information performance index to systematically identify the optimal combination of variables to be continuously measured and those to be discontinued. The linear regression and maintenance of variance (MOVE) record-extension techniques are employed to reconstitute information about discontinued variables. The proposed approach is applied for rationalization of the water quality variables in the Nile Delta surface WQM network in Egypt. Results indicate that the proposed approach represents a useful decision support tool for the optimized selection of water quality variables. The MOVE record-extension technique is shown to result in better performance than regression for the estimation of discontinued variables. 3acluster analysis 3adecision support systems 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3avariance 3awater quality 3aEgypt1 aOuarda, T.B.M.J.1 aSt-Hilaire, A.1 aChebana, F.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 May 28, v. 386, no. 1-4 p.173-185dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.03.019 7aarticle02750naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245019400143300001600337500001500353520073500368650002501103650001801128650001301146650001201159650001601171650001001187650001301197650002101210650002101231650001801252650002401270650002601294650008201320650003701402650002601439650002901465650004101494650006601535650002101601650001101622650002001633650002401653650002401677650002801701650003001729650001801759650003301777653001201810653002101822653001801843653001601861700001501877700001701892700001501909773011001924852000902034930003302043945001302076946001102089655001202100IND2052623820221122065126.0960815e199503  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205262382DNAL7 a77808362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUchide, N.10aPresence of Vicia graminea lectin- or Vicia unijuga lectin-binding (Vgu) glycoproteins, Vgu glycoproteins with Thomsen-Friedenreich (T) activity and T-active glycoproteins in human meconium  ap. 319-327.  a2019-12-05  aPerchloric acid-soluble fraction prepared from a mixture of meconiums of 22 newborn babies was subjected to a systematic affinity chromatography using Vicia unijuga lectin-Cellulofine column and Arachis hypogaea lectin-Agarose column and separated into four fractions, Vgu glycoprotein, Vgu glycoprotein with T activity, T-active glycoprotein and another glycoprotein fractions.

A novel cystathionine beta-synthase has been purified 3600-fold from the cytosol of P. redivivus. The enzyme catalyses the synthesis of cystathionine from homocysteine plus serine or cysteine. The enzyme, native Mr 71.7 kDa, pI 4.7, is a dimer and also catalyses the replacement of the beta-SH group of cysteine with 2-mercaptoethanol to yield a thioether, S-(2-hydroxyethyl) cysteine and H2S. This reaction proceeds much faster than cystathionine synthesis and L-cysteine cannot be replaced by D-cysteine, L-cystine, N-acetyl L-cysteine, cysteamine or D,L-homocysteine. 2-Mercaptoethanol in the assay can be replaced by monothiolglycerol and to a lesser extent by cysteamine. The absolute Km values for L-cysteine and 2-mercaptoethanol were 0.13 +/- 0.05 mM and 1.72 +/- 0.24 mM, respectively, the absolute Vmax was 55 +/- 4.9 micromoles.min-1.mg protein-1. The enzyme had a pH optimum of approx. 8.5 and did not require metal ions for activity. The enzyme was inhibited by a series of substrate analogues, anthelmintics and plant phenols. The P. redivivus enzyme differs markedly from its mammalian equivalent and suggests distinctive differences in sulphur amino acid metabolism in nematodes. 3aPanagrellus redivivus 3amodels 3aenzyme inhibitors 3apH 3acystathionine beta-synthase 3akinetics 3aenzyme activity 3ametal ions 2aAnimals 2aCystathionine beta-Synthasexisolation & purification 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMetalsxpharmacology 2aMolecular Weight 2aNematodaxenzymology 2aSubstrate Specificity 0apurification 0asubstrates 0aserine sulfhydrase activity1 aWalker, J.1 aBarrett, J.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g1996 May, v. 28, no. 5 p.543-549x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03187naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001300197245012700210300001800337500002400355500001500379520100000394650002101394650002501415650002701440650002101467650002201488650002301510650001301533650002601546650002401572650003101596650001301627650002201640650001301662650002901675650005201704650004801756650004101804650004101845650004101886650002301927650003001950650002901980651001002009651001002019653002102029653002402050653001802074653002202092700001802114700001502132700001502147700002502162700001602187700001802203773009102221852000902312856007502321930003302396945002502429946001102454655001202465IND4385182320221122045032.0061113e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438518232DNAL7 a169731892pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aL830 0aF8301 aBaby, S.10aCaryophyllene-rich rhizome oil of Zingiber nimmonii from South India: Chemical characterization and antimicrobial activity  ap. 2469-2473.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aVolatile oil from the rhizomes of Zingiber nimmonii (J.

The homologous series of C29-C33 secondary alcohols (1.1 μg/cm2) was dominated by hentriacontanol isomers (94%). Only octacosanediols and trace amounts of hexacosanediols (<1%) were detected in the primary/secondary alkanediol faction (0.7 μg/cm2). The secondary/secondary alkanediols (0.12 μg/cm2) contained a single homologue with chain length C31. All three compound classes showed characteristic isomer distributions with secondary functional groups predominantly located between C-14 and C-16. Based on the isomer compositions, the sequence of biosynthetic steps introducing the hydroxyl functions is discussed. 3aPisum sativum 3apeas 3aepicuticular wax 3aalcohols 2aAlcoholsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aAlkanesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Structure 2aPeasxchemistry 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aWaxesxanalysisxchemistry. 0aalkanediols 0anonacosan 0atriacontan 0adotriacontan 0atritriacontan1 aAu, J.1 aGniwotta, F.1 aJetter, R.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Nov., v. 67, no. 22 p.2494-2502dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.08.0163electronic resource  a20061121b20061202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/11/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03121naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001600196245008300212300001800295500002400313500001500337520119100352650001501543650002601558650002401584650002201608650001501630650002101645650002701666650001801693650003001711650002301741650004201764650001201806650004201818650005201860650002501912650001101937650002901948650002101977650002901998651001802027653002202045653001802067653002702085653002002112653002902132653002302161653002002184653001602204773009902220852000902319856007402328930003302402945002502435946001102460655001202471IND4385183020221122004513.0061113e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438518302DNAL7 a169875242pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL001 0aL6001 aScott, M.P.14aThe role of juvenile hormone in competition and cooperation by burying beetles  ap. 1005-1011.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFew studies have addressed the physiological mechanisms that modulate aggression in insects. In some social insects, there is a correlation of JH and aggression in colony defense and in the establishment of dominance, but only a few studies demonstrate a causal relationship. Burying beetles aggressively defend a breeding resource, a carcass, and juvenile hormone (JH) hemolymph titers increase rapidly upon the discovery of a carcass. In this study, I show that treatment with the JH analog, methoprene, in the absence of a carcass increases the probability of injuries from aggressive interactions, but treatment to one member of a pair of competing Nicrophorus orbicollis females does not increase the probability that she will win control of the resource. In addition, higher JH levels are not associated with greater competitive ability in communally breeding Nicrophorus tomentosus females. Treatment of one female N. tomentosus does not increase her share of the communal brood. Methoprene seems to make a less competitive female more persistent and less willing to concede, which, although maintaining her share of reproduction, results in her exclusion from the brood chamber. 3aaggression 3areproductive behavior 3ahormonal regulation 3ajuvenile hormones 3amethoprene 3asocial dominance 3aNicrophorus orbicollis 3abrood rearing 3aintraspecific competition 3adefensive behavior 2aAggressionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCompetitive Behaviorxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCooperative Behavior 2aFemale 2aMethoprenexpharmacology 2aRadioimmunoassay 2aReproductionxphysiology 0aNew Hampshire 0acommunal breeding 0abrood defense 0aNicrophorus tomentosus 0asocial behavior 0ajuvenile hormone analogs 0abreeding resources 0acarcass defense 0aNicrophorus0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2006 Oct., v. 52, no. 10 p.1005-1011dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.04.0063electronic resource  a20061121b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03577naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001800164245013400182300001800316500002400334500001500358520207900373650001702452650002302469650002202492650001002514650001502524650001602539650001402555650001002569650001002579650001802589650002202607650001902629650001902648653002502667653001502692653002602707700001802733773016202751852000902913856007802922930003303000945002503033946001303058655001203071IND4385178120140723000000.0061113e20061101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438517812DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06165602doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF600 0aQ5051 aCortell, J.M.10aEffect of Shading on Accumulation of Flavonoid Compounds in (Vitis vinifera L.) Pinot Noir Fruit and Extraction in a Model System  ap. 8510-8520.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAccumulation and compositional changes of flavonols, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins were measured in Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinot noir in shaded and exposed treatments. In addition, extraction of these compounds into a model wine solution was measured. The study was conducted in a commercial vineyard within a uniform zone of relatively low vigor vines. Light exclusion boxes were installed on pairs of clusters on the same shoot (shaded treatment), and a second set of clusters on an adjacent shoot were labeled as the exposed treatment. Fruit samples were harvested at the onset of ripening (véraison) and at commercial harvest. Cluster shading resulted in a substantial decrease in mg/berry accumulation of flavonols and skin proanthocyanidins and minimal differences in anthocyanins. In analyzing seed proanthocyanidins by phloroglucinolysis, shaded and exposed treatments were similar at véraison; however, by harvest, the shaded treatment had higher extension and terminal subunits (nmol/seed) as compared to the exposed treatment. For skin proanthocyanidins, shaded fruit was lower for all subunits (nmol/berry) at both véraison and harvest. Shading caused an increase in the proportion of (-)-epicatechin and a decrease in (-)-epigallocatechin at harvest in skin extension subunits. Seed proanthocyanidins in shaded fruit contained a lower proportion of (+)-catechin and a higher proportion of (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate in extension subunits and a lower proportion of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate and a higher proportion of (-)-epicatechin in terminal subunits. For anthocyanins, the shaded treatment had a proportional reduction in delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, and malvidin and a large increase in peonidin glucosides. The model extractions from the two treatments paralleled differences in the fruit with a lower concentration of flavonols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins in the shaded treatment. The skin proanthocyanidin percent extraction was found to be ~17% higher in the exposed model extraction than the shaded treatment. 3aanthocyanins 3amodel food systems 3aproanthocyanidins 3aseeds 3aextraction 3awine grapes 3aflavonols 3awines 3ashade 3afruit growing 3afruit composition 3aVitis vinifera 3awine cultivars 0amodel wine folutions 0aflavonoids 0agrape cluster shading1 aKennedy, J.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Nov. 1, v. 54, no. 22 p.8510-8520dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06165603Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070525b20070602c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle01909naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013800128300001800266500001500284520093800299650003701237650003001274650001401304650002301318650001301341650001001354650002001364653001201384653001601396700001901412773008501431852000901516939003301525946001301558655001201571IND9202479120221121190015.0920427e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920247912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDessart, S.R.10aHigh frequency intergeneric and intrageneric conjugal transfer of drug resistance plasmids in Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris  ap. 2912-2919.  a2019-12-04  aTransfer of the broad host range conjugative plasmids pAMbeta 1, pVA797::Tn917, and pIP501 between Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris occurred at high frequency via a conjugation-like process on solid surface agar.

Reverse intergeneric transfer from Leuc. mesenteroides ssp. cremoris to L. lactis occurred at frequencies up to 10(-4) transconjugants per donor cell. Intrageneric transfer between Leuc. mesenteroides ssp. cremoris strains was also observed at frequencies as high as 10(-3) transconjugants per donor cell. The ability to transfer these plasmids to and among Leuc. mesenteroides ssp. cremoris at high frequencies provides a method of genetic transfer, making diem available to cloning strategies developed in other Gram-positive bacteria. 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3aphenotype 3astrain differences 3aplasmids 3agenes 3adrug resistance 0acloning 0aconjugation1 aSteenson, L.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Sept., v. 74, no. 9 p.2912-2919x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01978naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009800144300001800242500001500260520069000275650002600965650001900991650001901010650001201029650008001041650002501121650002201146650002401168650001101192650002001203650002501223650001101248650001501259650000901274650002401283650002101307653001401328700002001342700001801362773008501380852000901465930003301474946001301507655001201520IND9202478520221121185952.0920427e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920247852DNAL7 a17234152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeung, C.T.10aIsolation and characterization of monoclonal antibody directed against bovine alpha-S2-casein  ap. 2872-2878.  a2019-12-04  aA monoclonal antibody 62-1A of isotype IgM, directed against bovine alpha(s)2-casein, was isolated and characterized.

The hybrid nanoparticles consist of gold core and poly[poly(ethylene oxide) methyl ether acrylate]-block-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) [P(A-MPEO)-block-PNIPAM] shell. The water-soluble comb-shaped copolymers, P(A-MPEO)-block-PNIPAM with PNIPAM as a handle, were successfully synthesized via a macromonomer technique using reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization method. The terminal dithioester group of the comb-shaped copolymer was reduced to a thiol end group forming SH-terminated copolymers, P(A-MPEO)-block-PNIPAM-SH. Successively they were used to stabilize gold nanoparticles by the "grafting-to" approach. The hybrid nanoparticles were characterized by TEM, UV-vis, and HRTEM. Because of the thermosensitive property of PNIPAM in aqueous solution, the comblike copolymer-tethered gold nanoparticles show a sharp and reversible phase transition at 30 °C in aqueous solution, which was determined by microdifferential scanning calorimetry. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper is a contribution to that question by examining the relationships between some important growth characteristics in barley trials in both systems in Northern Sweden and in Denmark. Mixed model analyses were used for regressions of growth characteristics (or transformations of those) on yield (and log-transformed yield), allowing the slope to depend on the growing system. The analyses showed that diseases seemed to have a less negative effect on yield in the organic growing system than in the conventional growing system if pesticides were not applied. For other characteristics the effect depended on the country. This was the case for grain characteristics where the effect of volume weight in the Swedish trials was much larger in the conventional growing system than in the organic growing system, while a non-significant difference in the opposite direction was found for the trails from Denmark. For the trials from Denmark the effect of grain weight was much larger in the organic growing system than in the conventional growing system, but there was only a small and non-significant difference in the Swedish trials. In both countries there was a significant interaction between the two grain characteristics. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aspring barley 3agrain yield 3aplant growth 3aagronomic traits 3aregression analysis 3aorganic production 3aplant diseases and disorders 3agenotype-environment interaction 3avariety trials 3acultivars 3aSweden 3aDenmark 0agrain weight1 aEricson, Lars0 tEuphytica.g2008 Oct., v. 163, no. 3 p.367-380dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-008-9713-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20080911b20081011c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/09/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03766naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002300181245017300204300001600377500023800393500002400631500001500655520180100670650001802471650001802489650001402507650001702521650002002538650003702558650001602595650002302611650001102634650001002645650002602655650001502681651001202696653003002708653001802738653001402756653002502770653002402795700002502819700002502844700002802869700002602897773009002923852000903013856008503022930003303107945002503140946001103165655001203176IND4409354020140724000000.0080822e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440935402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-008-9714-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF120 0aF900 0aF8311 aØstergård, Hanne10aPredicting spring barley yield from variety-specific yield potential, disease resistance and straw length, and from environment-specific disease loads and weed pressure  ap. 391-408.  aIn the special issue: Plant breeding for organic and sustainable, low-input agriculture: dealing with genotype-environment interactions / edited by Edith T.

This analysis aims at developing a framework for analyzing grain yield using external varietal information about disease resistance, weed competitiveness and yield potential and quantifying the impact of susceptibility grouping and straw length scores (as a measure for weed competitiveness) for predicting spring barley grain yield under variable biotic stress levels. The study comprised 52 spring barley varieties and 17 environments, i.e., combinations of location, growing system and year. Individual varieties and their interactions with environments were analysed by factorial regression of grain yield on external variety information combined with observed environmental disease loads and weed pressure. The external information was based on the official Danish VCU testing. The most parsimonious models explained about 50% of the yield variation among varieties including genotype-environment interactions. Disease resistance characteristics of varieties, weighted with disease loads of powdery mildew, leaf rust and net blotch, respectively, had a highly significant influence on grain yield. The extend to which increased susceptibility resulted in increased yield losses in environments with high disease loads of the respective diseases was predicted. The effect of externally determined straw length scores, weighted with weed pressure, was weaker although significant for weeds with creeping growth habit. Higher grain yield was thus predicted for taller plants under weed pressure. The results are discussed in relation to the model framework, impact of the considered traits and use of information from conventional variety testing in organic cropping systems. 3arust diseases 3aspring barley 3acultivars 3abarley straw 3aHordeum vulgare 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3adisease resistance 3alength 3aweeds 3acrop-weed competition 3aprediction 3aDenmark 0afungal diseases of plants 0aweed pressure 0avarieties 0aweed competitiveness 0acompetitive ability1 aKristensen, Kristian1 aPinnschmidt, Hans O.1 aHansen, Preben Klarskov1 aHovmøller, Mogens S.0 tEuphytica.g2008 Oct., v. 163, no. 3 p.391-408dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-008-9714-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20080911b20081011c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/09/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03349naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001800181245012400199300001600323500023800339500002400577520161700601650002202218650001702240650001702257650001702274650000902291650002302300650001402323650001002337650002602347650003702373650001702410651001302427653001902440653002902459653002402488653001602512700002202528700001602550773009002566852000902656856008502665930003302750945002502783946001102808655001202819IND4409353720221121042516.0080822e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440935372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-008-9710-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF120 0aJ710 0aF9001 aHoad, Stephen10aSelection of cereals for weed suppression in organic agriculture: a method based on cultivar sensitivity to weed growth  ap. 355-366.  aIn the special issue: Plant breeding for organic and sustainable, low-input agriculture: dealing with genotype-environment interactions / edited by Edith T.

In this study, thirteen winter wheat cultivars, plus one spring wheat and one winter oat were assessed for their competitive ability at key growth stages, across three seasons. The natural population of weed species was allowed develop without agronomic intervention. Weed suppression ability for each cultivar (S var) was calculated as the difference between weed growth in plots for each cultivar and the maximal weed growth (W max) from adjacent uncropped areas. The sensitivity of S var in response to changes in weed growth (S var W ) was derived from the linear regression coefficient of S var plotted against W max. There was significant variation in S var between cultivars and strong evidence for cultivars to vary in S var W . Amongst groups of cultivars with similar levels of S var some could be defined as being of higher or lower sensitivity to changes in weed growth. Some cultivars also had relatively good S var at high levels of weed growth. The use of both weed suppression ability and sensitivity across different levels of weed growth or weed populations has considerable potential for selecting new cultivars suitable for organic agriculture. Ideally new cultivars will be selected on the basis of high S var and/or low S var W . This analysis provides the means to measure sensitivity of cultivar performance across a range of favourable and unfavourable conditions. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3aspring wheat 3aAvena sativa 3aoats 3aorganic production 3acultivars 3aweeds 3acrop-weed competition 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aplant growth 3aScotland 0aweed tolerance 0aweed suppression ability 0acompetitive ability 0aweed growth1 aTopp, Cairistiona1 aDavies, Ken0 tEuphytica.g2008 Oct., v. 163, no. 3 p.355-366dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-008-9710-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080911b20081011c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/09/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168072000900186072000900195072000900204072000900213100002000222245006400242300001800306500002400324506007600348520107800424506003701502650002401539650002101563650001401584650002301598650001401621650002101635650001401656650002001670650002001690650001201710650005801722650003501780650004101815650004101856650003301897650001901930653002101949653002301970653002801993653002502021700001702046700002002063700002002083700002502103700003402128773010502162852000902267856008502276930003302361945002502394946001302419655001202432IND4409364320221207095545.0080822e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440936432DNAL7 a187045882pmid7 aPMC25189492pmcid7 a10.1007/s10886-008-9527-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL001 0aL3001 aHatano, Eduardo10aDo Aphid Colonies Amplify their Emission of Alarm Pheromone  ap. 1149-1152.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhen aphids are attacked by natural enemies, they emit alarm pheromone to alert conspecifics. For most aphids tested, (E)-β-farnesene (EBF) is the main, or only, constituent of the alarm pheromone. In response to alarm pheromone, alerted aphids drop off the plant, walk away, or attempt to elude predators. However, under natural conditions, EBF concentration might be low due to the low amounts emitted, to rapid air movement, or to oxidative degradation. To ensure that conspecifics are warned, aphids might conceivably amplify the alarm signal by emitting EBF in response to EBF emitted by other aphids. To examine whether such amplification occurs, we synthesized deuterated EBF (DEBF), which allowed us to differentiate between applied and aphid-derived chemical. Colonies of Acyrthosiphon pisum were treated with DEBF, and headspace volatiles were collected and analyzed for evidence of aphid-derived EBF. No aphid-derived EBF was detected, suggesting that amplification of the alarm signal does not occur. We discuss the disadvantages of alarm signal reinforcement.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aalarm pheromones 3afarnesene 3avolatile compounds 3asynthesis 3aisotope labeling 3adeuterium 3ainsect behavior 3ainsect colonies 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aPheromonesxpharmacologyxsecretion. 2aSesquiterpenesxpharmacology 2aVolatilization 0a(E)-β-farnesene 0apheromone emission 0apheromone amplification 0asignal reinforcement1 aKunert, Grit1 aBartram, Stefan1 aBoland, Wilhelm1 aGershenzon, Jonathan1 aWeisser, W.

EO components were tentatively identified by Kováts retention indices (RIs) using gas chromatography and gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Growth of all fungi was completely inhibited at 0.3% concentration, and by 90% to 100% at 0.1% concentration. The following 13 tentatively identified compounds (relative percent) accounted for 90.4% of the total volatile oil: α-terpinene (0.9), p-cymene (2.0), benzyl alcohol (0.3), p-cresol (0.3), p-mentha-1,3,8-triene (0.2), p-cimen-8-ol (0.6), α-terpineol (0.5), (Z)-ascaridole (61.4), piperitone (0.9), carvacrol (3.9), (E)-ascaridole (18.6), (E)-piperitol acetate (0.5), and (Z)-carvyl acetate (0.3). Autobiographic thin layer chromatography of the EO to separate the principal fungitoxic fraction yielded only one fraction that completely inhibited the growth of all test fungi at a concentration of 0.1%. This fraction was characterized by RIs and GC-MS presenting a composition (%) of p-cymene (25.4), (Z)-ascaridole (44.4), and (E)-ascaridole (30.2). The results suggest ascaridoles were the principal fungitoxic components of the EO. 3achemical concentration 3achemical composition 3aFusarium 3aessential oils 3adecay fungi 3aColletotrichum 3abotanical pesticides 3aAspergillus 3aDysphania ambrosioides 3aantifungal properties 0afungal growth inhibition 0aascaridoles 0aChenopodium ambrosioides1 aJham, Gulab Newandram 1 aDhingra, Onkar Dev 1 aFreire, Marcelo Moreira 0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2008 Sept., v. 34, no. 9 p.1213-1218dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-008-9526-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090623b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/06/23  aOther US 7aarticle02696naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245006400156300001600220500001500236520149300251650000901744650001301753650000901766650001801775650001201793650001901805650002001824650000701844650001901851650001001870650001301880650001501893653001801908700002101926700002501947700001801972773013901990852000902129856007802138930003302216946001302249655001202262IND4399534420221121001342.0071230e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439953442DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.224342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyungsoo10aNucleation of gold nanoparticles on latex particle surfaces  ap. 912-925.  a2019-12-05  aGold particles were nucleated on functionalized (i.e., sulfonate or imidazole groups) latex particle surfaces. Gold ions were associated with the functional groups present on the surface of the latex particles by metal-ligand formation and were then reduced to nucleate gold particles on the particle surface. The use of imidazole groups favored the metal-ligand formation more effectively compared with sulfonic acid groups, so gold nucleation was investigated on the surface of imidazole-functionalized model latex particles. The desorption of gold atoms or their surface migration first occurred during the reduction process and then gold nanoparticles were nucleated. The utilization of strong reductants, such as NaBH₄ and dimethylamine borane (DMAB) under mildly acidic conditions (i.e., pH 4) led to the deprotonation of imidazole-rich polymer chains present on the surface of the model latex particles followed by deswelling of hydrophilic polymer surface layers. As a result, well-dispersed gold nanoparticles were embedded in the hydrophilic polymer surface. On the other hand, the use of weak reductants led to the formation of localized gold aggregates on the surface of the latex particles. The removal of residual styrene monomer is very important because gold ions can be coordinated with the vinyl groups present in styrene monomer and would then be reduced by nucleophilic water addition. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The polymers can be color-tuned by the introduction of various chromophores into the PPV-based polymer backbones. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the polymers, GePVK (containing carbazole moieties), GeMEH (containing dialkoxybenzene moieties), and GePTH (containing phenothiazine moieties), were found to exhibit blue, greenish blue, and green emissions, respectively. GePTH produces more red-shifted emission than GeMEH and GEPVK, resulting in green emission, and the solution and solid state PL spectra of GePVK consist of almost blue emission. The electroluminescence spectra of GeMEH and GePTH contain yellowy green and yellow colors, respectively. Interestingly, GePVK exhibits white emission with CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.37) due to electroplex emission in the light-emitting diodes. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the third crop, 53, 68, and 72% disease control was obtained at the 0.2, 2, and 20 kg/ha rates, respectively. There were no differences in disease incidence among treatments in the last two crops due to an increase in indigenous populations of Sporidesmium in the nontreated plots.

In response to demand from China, rubber smallholdings are being established by shifting cultivators in Northern Laos, encouraged by government land-use policy. We examine the bio-economics of smallholder rubber production in an established rubber-growing village and model the likely expansion of smallholder rubber in Northern Laos. Data were obtained from key informants, group interviews, direct observation, and a farm-household survey. Latex yields were estimated using the Bioeconomic Rubber Agroforestry Support System (BRASS). A financial model was developed to estimate the net present value for a representative rubber smallholding. This model was then combined with spatial data in a Geographical Information System (GIS) to predict the likely expansion of rubber based on resource quality and accessibility. Implications are drawn for upland development in the region. 3arubber 3acrop production 3asmall farms 3aland use change 3abioeconomic models 3alatex 3ayields 3aspatial data 3arural development 3arural economics 3aprofitability 3aLaos 0atree crops1 aCramb, R.

Therefore an increasing demand exists for varieties with specific adaptation to this farming system. In the present study we therefore conducted comparative field experiments with modern maize breeding materials under organic versus conventional farming conditions (ORG and CON, respectively) to estimate quantitative genetic parameters needed for developing optimal breeding strategies and to investigate the perspectives of selection for specific adaptation to ORG. Starting from two broad samples of elite germplasm, consisting of 178 flint and dent lines, respectively, fractions of 11 flint and 11 dent lines were selected based on their testcross performance under ORG. A corresponding set of lines was selected under CON. Testcross performance was evaluated in three regions of Germany and selection of superior lines was practiced across two stages in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The specifically selected lines were crossed in a factorial manner for production of experimental inter-pool single-cross hybrids which were field-tested under ORG and CON in two regions in 2006. Average grain yields were about 16% lower under ORG than under CON. Variance components and entry-mean heritability coefficients under ORG largely resembled those obtained under CON. Phenotypic correlations between ORG and CON were moderate for grain yield and strong for grain dry matter content. No consistent estimates were obtained for the corresponding genotypic correlation for grain yield. At the first stage of testcross selection no evidence of specific adaptation to ORG or CON was observed whereas the factorial crosses tested in 2006 displayed distinct, yet non-significant, advantages when evaluated under the respective target farming system. A small top fraction of hybrids showed outstanding performance under both ORG and CON. The chances of detecting such broadly adapted genotypes are increased if ORG test sites are included in the regular testing system. 3agermplasm 3adent corn 3aZea mays 3aflint corn 3agermplasm evaluation 3ahybrids 3adry matter content 3atestcrosses 3aphenotypic correlation 3aplant adaptation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aagronomic traits 3agrain yield 3aheritability 3aorganic production 3aartificial selection 3aGermany 0aplant breeding 0alines 0acorn 0aquantitative genetics1 aSchloen, M.1 aSchmidt, W.1 aGeiger, H.

The genetic material studied originated from various countries. In the conventional trial plots standard cultural practices (P mineral fertilization & pest control) were applied throughout the growing season, while in the organic ones no fertilizers or pest agrochemicals were applied. Significant regression, but of low value, between grain yield ranking and earliness or harvest index ranking was detected. Combined ANOVA indicated significant differences between genotypes, years, environments and genotype x environmental interactions (GEI). It was observed that under conventional management most of the genotypes had a higher yield compared to the organic one. The mean grain yield ranking of the genotypes in each of the environments revealed that some of the genotypes occupied the same ranking position at both the organic and the conventional environment (non-crossover GEI), while others exhibited a significant alteration in their ranking (crossover GEI) under the two environments. Crossover GEI and non-cross over GEI revealed two types of lentil varieties. Varieties with specific adaptation and varieties with broad adaptation. It was concluded that grain yield was in general higher when lentil varieties were grown under a conventional environment compared to the grain yield produced under an organic environment. Yet, there are lentil genotypes with a higher yielding ability under the organic management and therefore should be targeted by the breeder. 3aplant breeding 3aearly development 3avarieties 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aharvest index 3aorganic production 3aLens culinaris 3aselection criteria 3alentils 3aGreece 0acrop yield1 aRoupakias, D.

This study focused on the impacts of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana's Pearl River basin, which lies just west of Katrina's final landfall at the Louisiana-Mississippi border. Prior to landfall, composition and structure of bottomland hardwood forests in this region were studied with permanent forest inventory plots sampled in 1989, 1998, 2005 and following the storm in 2006. This enabled a direct comparison of forest structure and dynamics before and after the disturbance, including species-specific tree mortality and damage rates, biomass production, and differences among forest types having varied hydrologic regimes. Background tree mortality rate before Hurricane Katrina was 1.9%, while average annual mortality was 20.5% for the census interval including the disturbance. Change in live tree biomass estimated from allometric models demonstrated a shift from an average annual production of 3.5Mgha⁻¹ before the disturbance, to an average loss of 77.6Mgha⁻¹ from the storm. Damage associated with Hurricane Katrina varied significantly with tree species but not tree size. Flooded cypress-tupelo swamp forests sustained the least damage and frequently flooded bottomland hardwood forests sustained the highest damage. Hurricane disturbance influenced the structure and composition of these coastal forests through species-specific differences in damage and mortality rates, and varied impacts dependent on forest flooding regime. 3apopulation dynamics 3ainterspecific variation 3awind 3aQuercus 3ahurricanes 3alowland forests 3aforest damage 3avegetation structure 3aforest trees 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3acommunity structure 3aequations 3amodels 3aflooded conditions 3aNyssa aquatica 3aforest communities 3atree mortality 3awetlands 3ahardwood 3aallometry 3aTaxodium distichum 3atree damage 3aGulf of Mexico region 3aLouisiana 0aspecies differences1 aChambers, Jeffrey Q.1 aRibbeck, Kenny F.1 aBaker, Dave B.1 aTobler, Mark A.1 aZeng, Hongcheng1 aWhite, David A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 Aug. 20, v. 256, no. 5 p.883-889dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2008.05.0573Available from publisher's Web site  a20081107b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03366naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001500175245008400190300001800274500002400292520197000316650001602286650001702302650001702319650001202336650001702348650001602365650001402381650001602395650002602411651001202437653002602449653001602475653001902491700002102510700001902531700002002550700002502570773011102595852000902706856008802715930003302803945002502836946001102861655001202872IND4409311420221120164110.0080822e20080820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440931142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2008.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aB2001 aGaul, Dirk10aEffects of experimental drought on the fine root system of mature Norway spruce  ap. 1151-1159.  aIncludes references  aNorway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) is an economically important, but relatively drought-sensitive tree species that might suffer from increasing drought intensities and frequencies, which are predicted to occur in parts of central Europe under future climatic change. In a throughfall exclusion experiment using sub-canopy roofs, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced drought leads to an increase in fine root mortality, and also to a higher, subsequent fine root growth. Fine root production and mortality were assessed using two independent approaches, sequential soil coring (organic layer) and direct observations in minirhizotrons (organic layer plus upper mineral soil). Six weeks of throughfall exclusion resulted in mild drought stress, i.e. a reduction in average soil moisture from 20 to 12vol.% during the treatment. Based on the sequential coring data, experimental drought did not result in significant changes in fine root biomass during the 6-week treatment period, but caused an increase in fine root mortality by 61% in the 6 weeks following the drought treatment. Remarkably, fine root production showed a synchronous increase in this period, which more than compensated for the loss due to increased mortality. The minirhizotron data confirmed that the drought treatment increased fine root loss in the organic layer. Based on this method, however, root loss occurred during the drought period and was not compensated by increased root production. The mild drought stress was mainly restricted to the organic layer and did not significantly influence fine root dynamics in the mineral soil. We calculated that the drought event resulted in an extra input of about 28gCm⁻² and 1.1gNm⁻² to the soil due to increased fine root mortality. We conclude that even periods of mild drought significantly increase fine root mortality and the associated input of root-derived C to the soil organic matter pool in temperate Norway spruce forests. 3aPicea abies 3aforest trees 3aroot systems 3adrought 3awater stress 3aroot growth 3amortality 3athroughfall 3aplant-water relations 3aGermany 0athroughfall exclusion 0asoil coring 0aminirhizotrons1 aHertel, Dietrich1 aBorken, Werner1 aMatzner, Egbert1 aLeuschner, Christoph0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 Aug. 20, v. 256, no. 5 p.1151-1159dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2008.06.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20081107b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03825naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002400184245016200208300001800370500002400388520237900412650002102791650001502812650002202827650002502849650002202874650002002896650001702916650002002933650002502953650002402978650001603002650003003018651001203048700001803060773011103078852000903189856008803198930003303286945002503319946001103344655001203355IND4409312020221120164136.0080822e20080820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440931202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2008.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP050 0aF300 0aK001 0aJ2001 aBraunisch, Veronika10aUsing ecological forest site mapping for long-term habitat suitability assessments in wildlife conservation--Demonstrated for capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus)  ap. 1209-1221.  aIncludes references  aAlthough key factors for vegetation composition and structure, site and soil condition have received little attention as predictors of habitat suitability in wildlife ecology to date. Using the example of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), an indicator species for open, well-structured forest habitats, we evaluated the potential use of ecological forest site mapping for the identification of areas where the preferred vegetation structures are supported by the prevailing soil conditions. These are sites that we, therefore, expected to be of long-term relevance to the species. Employing an expert model, we evaluated data from the state's forest site and soil condition database including soil texture, soil type, humus type, nutrient status and hydrological regime. The data were aggregated to a soil condition index (I s), quantifying the potential to support capercaillie-relevant vegetation types. First, we assessed the correlation of I s with the current vegetation conditions in the study area. Subsequently, we evaluated the short-term (15 years) and long-term (100 years) changes to the capercaillie distribution with respect to I s at different spatial scales and calculated a threshold for the prediction of long-term capercaillie presence. Although the vegetation structure in the study area was largely influenced by forestry, I s was correlated with all investigated vegetation structure variables that determine habitat suitability for capercaillie. Soil condition proved to be an important indirect predictor of long-term capercaillie inhabitation, performing best when considering an area exceeding the size of a large capercaillie home range. The long-term range contractions corresponded significantly with the spatial pattern of suitable soil conditions, the short-term development demonstrated a similar trend. The results indicated an ongoing retreat from degenerating secondary habitats, created by historic land use techniques on sites with low I s, to sites with high I s values, which should be considered when defining priority areas for conservation. Forest ecological site mapping provides detailed, area-wide data that allow for a spatially explicit evaluation of the vegetation development. Therefore, it can facilitate the integration of conservation targets in forest management, for species dependent upon specific vegetation conditions. 3aTetrao urogallus 3awild birds 3aindicator species 3aspatial distribution 3awildlife habitats 3aforest habitats 3aforest soils 3asoil properties 3avegetation structure 3ahabitat preferences 3acorrelation 3aforest-wildlife relations 3aGermany1 aSuchant, Rudi0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 Aug. 20, v. 256, no. 5 p.1209-1221dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2008.06.0273Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03658naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001700166245012400183300001800307500002400325520225100349650002202600650002702622650001402649650001702663650001302680650001002693650001302703650001002716650001102726650001502737650002002752650001902772650001202791650002002803650001802823650001902841650001502860651001202875773011102887852000902998856008803007930003303095945002503128946001103153655001203164IND4409311620221120164046.0080822e20080820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440931162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2008.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aK0011 aHansen, O.K.10aMating patterns, genetic composition and diversity levels in two seed orchards with few clones--Impact on planting crop  ap. 1167-1177.  aIncludes references  aPaternity analyses using microsatellites were conducted in two conifer clonal seed orchards (CSOs). The aim was to study mating patterns and potential dysfunctions such as unbalanced male contribution, and how these factors influence genetic diversity. The effect of unequal male contribution was quantified by the status number (N S), which reflects build up of coancestry in the seed orchard crop due to low number of clones and unequal male contribution. This approach was also used to quantify the effect of clonal differences in germination percentages on effective population sizes. Furthermore the genetic diversity of the Abies alba and Larix kaempferi CSOs was compared to other alternative seed sources via observed heterozygosity and allelic richness. Both CSOs had a low pollen contamination rate (1.4% and 2.8%). The CSO with 12 A. alba clones showed a very skewed distribution of paternal contributions, where four clones (25%) sired more than 80% of the offspring, resulting in a status number of (N S)=4.6. The CSO with 10 L. kaempferi clones showed a much more equal distribution of paternal contributions, with (N S)=10.2. For both CSOs the paternal contributions varied significantly with sampling site within the seed orchards. The amount of selfing in the CSO seed crops was 4.7% in A. alba and 3.1% in L. kaempferi and selection against selfing could be observed. The relative self-fertility was estimated to 59% in A. alba and 33% in L. kaempferi. A study of early versus late germinating seedlings in two L. kaempferi clones indicated no increased proportion of selfed individuals in late germinating individuals. Clonal differences in germination percentages in the two CSOs had little impact on effective population sizes. The level of heterozygosity was not significantly different between CSOs and the alternative seed sources. Fixation indices (F is) were significantly negative in the seed crops from both CSOs, indicating heterozygote excess. There were substantial differences in allelic richness between CSO seed crops and alternative seed sources. The number of alleles was 57% higher in the alternative A. alba seed source Mt.

This work describes the development of a procedure for the detection of PrPres in stools which is based on a detergent-based extraction and immunoprecipitation (IP). The procedure was evaluated by analyzing TSE-spiked sheep and mice faeces, and proved to be specific for PrPres with sensitivities of 5-10μg of infected brain tissue. In order to analyze the shedding of prions, we studied stools from orally inoculated mice over 4-days post-inoculation and also stools from terminally sick scrapie-infected mice. PrPres was only detected in stools shortly after the oral ingestion of TSE agents. The procedure described could be a useful tool for studying the excretion of prions and for evaluating potential environmental contamination by prions. 3adiagnostic techniques 3asheep 3afood contamination 3adisease transmission 3amice 3ascrapie 3afeces 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3aanimal models 3adietary exposure 3aoral administration 3aexcretion 3aprions 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aCattle 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEncephalopathy, Bovine Spongiformxmetabolism 2aFecesxchemistry 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aPrPSc Proteinsxisolation & purification 2aPrionsxisolation & purification 2aScrapiexmetabolism 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 0amethodology 0anew methods 0aprion shedding1 aGrassi, Jacques1 aSimon, Stéphanie.1 aHerva, Maria Eugenia1 aTorres, Juan Maria1 aPumarola, Marti1 aGirones, Rosina0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Sept. 18, v. 131, no. 1-2 p.205-211dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.02.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20081027b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/07  aNon-US 7aarticle04331naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001900185245009900204300001600303500002400319500001500343520197800358650004502336650002302381650002202404650001402426650001302440650001402453650001202467650001002479650001102489650001302500650002302513650003102536650001002567650003702577650001402614650002502628650001402653650002402667650002402691650001202715650001802727650002502745650002602770650004102796650003502837650002402872650001302896650002802909650004602937650002402983650006903007650007603076650002903152653001203181700002603193700002103219700001703240700002103257700001903278773009803297852000903395856008803404930003303492945002503525946001103550655001203561IND4409315220221120144308.0080822e20080918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440931522DNAL7 a184173002pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aX3801 aTasara, Taurai10aActivatable Shiga toxin 2d (Stx2d) in STEC strains isolated from cattle and sheep at slaughter  ap. 199-204.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aShiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) harbouring the stx ₂d₋activatable gene and expressing the mucus- and elastase-activatable phenotype have been associated with severe outcomes of human disease. However, there is limited data available on the occurrence of such strains in livestock reservoirs. In this study, we analyzed 11 STEC strains isolated from healthy cattle and sheep at slaughter that were originally detected to contain the stx ₂c allele, for the presence of the stx ₂d₋activatable genotype. Ten of the eleven strains displayed the stx ₂d₋activatable genotype as determine by PstI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 890-bp fragments of their stx genes. However, only in 6 of the 10 strains whose stx genes were sequenced, the presence of stx ₂d₋activatable could be confirmed based on the predicted amino acid sequence of their StxA subunits; the remaining four strains contained Stx2c A subunit. Five of the six strains which contained stx ₂d₋activatable displayed the activatable phenotype on Vero cells. Genes for adhesins such as the outer membrane protein intimin (eae), which is essential for the intimate attachment and the formation of attaching-and-effacing lesions on intestinal epithelial cells, or the STEC autoagglutinating adhesin (saa), potentially important in eae-negative STEC, were not detected. Moreover, all the strains tested negative for EHEC-hlyA encoding enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) hemolysin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the presence of STEC harbouring stx ₂d₋activatable and producing the activatable Stx2d in fecal samples of sheep. Therefore both cattle and sheep are reservoirs of such strains and potential sources of human infections. This is of particular importance, because in contrast to other eae-negative STEC, strains producing Stx2dactivatable may cause severe diseases such as bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3adisease reservoirs 3aShiga-like toxins 3aslaughter 3azoonoses 3aphenotype 3aalleles 3asheep 3acattle 3aadhesins 3astrain differences 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3afeces 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aincidence 3abacterial infections 2aAbattoirs 2aAdhesins, Bacterial 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattlexmicrobiology 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDisease Reservoirsxveterinary 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSheepxmicrobiology 2aShiga Toxin 2xbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aShiga-Toxigenic Escherichia colixisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aVero Cellsxmicrobiology 0astrains1 aBielaszewska, Martina1 aNitzsche, Sabine1 aKarch, Helge1 aZweifel, Claudio1 aStephan, Roger0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Sept. 18, v. 131, no. 1-2 p.199-204dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.03.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20081023b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02209naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001200138245012500150300001600275520100200291650002301293650002101316650001701337650004401354650002301398650001301421650001601434650002201450650001401472700001301486700001801499700001801517700001601535773013901551852000901690856007801699930003301777946001301810655001201823IND4399061220221120144348.0071216e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439906122DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.224182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Li10aLinear π-conjugated polymers containing 2,4,6-tris(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine unit: Synthesis and optical properties  ap. 702-712.  aSome linear π-conjugated polymers containing 2,4,6-tris(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine unit were synthesized via Sonogashira or Suzuki reaction for the first time and characterized by IR, NMR, and GPC. Because of the introduction of 2,4,6-tris(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine unit into π-conjugated system, all polymers exhibited good thermal stability with high decomposition temperature. Their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. Based on the 2,4,6-tris(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine unit linked with different aromatic rings, the polymers showed the tunable fluorescence from blue to blue-green emission with satisfied quantum yield. Cyclic voltammetry measurement indicated that the LUMO and HOMO levels of the polymers could be adjustable through the main-chain structural modification. All polymers had low LUMO level (-2.86 to -3.06 eV) due to the high-electron affinity of triazine unit. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Synthesis of π-conjugated polymers with controlled molecular weight and low polydispersity  ap. 753-765.  aWe describe the development of chain-growth condensation polymerization for the synthesis of well-defined π-conjugated polymers via a new polymerization mechanism, catalyst-transfer polymerization. We first studied the condensation polymerization of Grignard-type hexylthiophene monomer with a Ni catalyst as a part of our research on chain-growth condensation polymerization, and found that this polymerization also proceeded in a chain-growth polymerization manner. However, the polymerization mechanism involving the Ni catalyst was different from that of previous chain-growth condensation polymerizations based on substituent effects; the Ni catalyst catalyzed the coupling reaction of the monomer with the polymer, followed by the transfer of Ni(0) to the terminal C----Br bond of the elongated molecule. This catalyst-transfer condensation polymerization is generally applicable for the synthesis of polythiophene with an etheric side chain and poly(p-pheneylene), as well as for the synthesis of polyfluorene via the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The monomer-reactivity ratios were calculated according to the general copolymerization equation using Kelen-Tüdõs and Finemann-Ross linearization methods. The reactivity ratios indicated a tendency toward random copolymerization. The polydispersity indices of the polymers, determined with gel permeation chromatography, suggested a strong tendency for chain termination by disproportionation. The thermal behaviors of copolymers with various compositions were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The glass-transition temperature of the copolymers increased with increasing MCTMA content in the copolymers. Also, the apparent thermal decomposition activation energies were calculated by the Ozawa method with a Shimadzu TGA 60 thermogravimetric analysis thermobalance. All the products showed moderate activity against different strains of bacteria and fungi. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Polyethenes produced with 1/MAO had considerable, ca. 10% amount of trans-vinylene end groups, resulting from the chain end isomerization prior to the chain termination. When ethene was copolymerized with 1-hexene or 1-hexadecene using 1/MAO, molar mass of the copolymers varied from high to moderate (531-116 kg/mol) depending on the comonomer feed. At 50% comonomer feed, ethene/1-olefin copolymers with high hexene or hexadecene content (around 10%) were achievable. In the series of catalysts, polyethenes with highest molar mass, up to 985 kg/mol, were obtained with sterically most crowded 2/MAO, but the catalyst was only moderately active to copolymerize higher olefins. Catalyst 3/MAO produced polyethenes with extremely small amounts of trans-vinylene end groups and relatively low molar mass 1-hexene copolymers (from 157 to 38 kg/mol) with similar comonomer content as 1. These results indicate that the catalyst structure, which favors chain end isomerization, is also capable to produce high molar mass 1-olefin copolymers with high comonomer content. In addition, an exceptionally strong synergetic effect of the comonomer on the polymerization activity was observed with catalyst 3/MAO. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Each exfoliated MMT nanoplatelet had a thickness of ~ 1 nm, carried ~ 1.8 cation/nm², and acted like a two-dimensional electrolyte. The DSSC with the LiI/I₂/tertiary butylpyridine electrolyte system gelled by this polymer nanocomposite had higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) compared to that gelled by the neat PNIPAAm. The former has a Jsc of 12.6 mA/cm², an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.59, which harvested 5.4% electricity conversion efficiency (η) under AM 1.5 irradiation at 100 mW/cm², whereas the latter has Jsc = 7.28 mA/cm², Voc = 0.72 V, FF = 0.60, and η = 3.17%. IPCE of the nanocomposite-gelled DSSC were also improved. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the DSSCs revealed that the nanocomposite-gelled electrolytes significantly decreased the impedances in three major electric current paths of DSSCs, that is, the resistance of electrolytes and electric contacts, impedance across the electrolytes/dye-coated TiO₂ interface, and Nernstian diffusion within the electrolytes. The results were also consistent with the increased molar conductivity of nanocomposite-gelled electrolytes. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Elements involved in photosynthesis, sugar content, water oxidation, net photosynthetic rate, activity of enzyme and gene expression have therefore been studied in Homjan (HJ), salt-tolerant, and Pathumthani 1 (PT1), salt-sensitive, varieties of rice. Fructose-1,6-biphosphatase (FBP) and fructokinase (FK) genes were rapidly expressed in HJ rice when exposed to salt stress for 1-6 h and to a greater degree than in PT1 rice. An increase in FBP enzyme activity was found in both roots and leaves of the salt-tolerant variety after exposure to salt stress. A high level of sugar and a delay in chlorophyll degradation were found in salt-tolerant rice. The total sugar content in leaf and root tissues of salt-tolerant rice was 2.47 and 2.85 times higher, respectively, than in the salt-sensitive variety. Meanwhile, less chlorophyll degradation was detected. Salt stress may promote sugar accumulation, thus preventing the degradation of chlorophyll. Water oxidation by the light reaction of photosynthesis in the salt-tolerant variety was greater than that in the salt-sensitive variety, indicated by a high maximum quantum yield of PSII (F v/F m) and quantum efficiency of PSII (ΦPSII) with low nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), leading to a high net photosynthetic rate. In addition, the overall growth performances in the salt-tolerant variety were higher than those in the salt-sensitive variety. The FBP gene expression and enzyme activity, sugar accumulation, pigment stabilization, water oxidation and net photosynthetic rate parameters in HJ rice should be further investigated as multivariate salt-tolerant indices for the classification of salt tolerance in rice breeding programs. 3abreeding 3achlorophyll 3adefense mechanisms 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth performance 3aleaves 3aoxidation 3aphotosystem II 3arice 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asugar content 3asugars 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aCharoenpanich, A.1 aRoytrakul, S.1 aKirdmanee, C.0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2009 May, v. 31, no. 3 p.477-486dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-008-0256-1 7aarticle02681naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001300138245011000151300001600261520131900277650002801596650001101624650004401635650002301679650001301702650001501715650001301730650001201743650003701755700002001792700001501812700001601827700001501843700001601858700001501874700001401889700001401903700002001917700001401937773013901951852000902090856007802099930003302177946001302210655001202223IND4398770220221120093501.0071209e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439877022DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.223652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMens, R.10aNMR study of the nanomorphology in thin films of polymer blends used in organic PV devices: MDMO-PPV/PCBM  ap. 138-145.  aThe disclosure of the nanomorphology of thin films in organic solar cells, prepared from blends of conjugated polymers and PCBM, is of key importance for a better understanding of the occurring photovoltaic (PV) mechanisms. Hereto solid-state NMR relaxometry has been evaluated as a complementary technique to traditional microscopic techniques like atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It is demonstrated that proton wide-line solid-state NMR relaxometry is a useful and innovative tool to study the phase morphology of blends used in semi-conducting polymer based PV devices. Attention is focused on the influence of the blend composition and casting conditions on the resulting phase morphology. Two different casting techniques, i.e. spincoating and Doctor Blading, were compared. To demonstrate the applicability of NMR relaxometry in this field, MDMO-PPV/PCBM blends where used, since these are known for their significant phase separation behavior in combination with toluene as solvent. In films prepared from blends in toluene with a PCBM content >=70 wt %, a fraction of the PCBM is phase separated into crystalline domains, whereas the remaining part remains homogeneously mixed with the MDMO-PPV. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This species has wide use in folk-medicine practice on the islands, especially as diuretic. So the aim of our study is to evaluate the diuretic activity of an aqueous and a methanol extract of this species. Material and methods: Three infusions doses (250, 500 and 750mg/kg) and two methanol extract doses (100 and 200mg/kg) were orally administered to laboratory rats. Water excretion rate, pH, density, conductivity, and content of Na⁺ and K⁺ were measured in the urine of saline-loaded rats. Results: Water excretion rates were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner by both hot water infusions and the alcohol extract. The electrolytic excretion was also dose-dependent, although potassium excretion was markedly reduced when using the alcohol extract compared with that observed for the infusion. Conclusions: Smilax canariensis presents a notable diuretic effect which appeared to be related both to its potassium content and to the presence of polar organic compounds. The present results provide a quantitative basis explaining the traditional folk-medicine use of Smilax canariensis as a diuretic agent by the Canary Island population. 3aSmilax 3amedicinal plants 3aherbal medicines 3adiuretics 3amedicinal properties 3arats 3aanimal models 3adosage 3aplant extracts 3aherbal tea 3aurine 3aexcretion 3apH 3adensity 3aelectrical conductivity 3asodium 3apotassium 3adose response 3aorganic compounds 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aDiureticsxadministration & dosagexisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aMice 2aPlant Extractsxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aPotassiumxurine 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSmilaxxchemistry 2aSodiumxurine 2aToxicity Tests, Acute 2aWaterxadministration & dosage 3aCanary Islands 0aSpain 0aSmilax canariensis1 aMartín-Herrera, D.1 aBenjumea, D.1 aPérez-Paz, P.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2008 Sept. 2, v. 119, no. 1 p.12-16dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2008.05.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02643naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001200138245011200150300001600262520155700278650003901835650001001874650001301884650002101897650001501918650000701933650001301940700001201953700001101965700001601976700001701992773013902009852000902148856007802157930003302235946001302268655001202281IND4398769620221120093623.0071209e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439876962DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.223632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xia10aNovel designed polymer-acyclovir conjugates with linker-controlled drug release and hepatoma cell targeting  ap. 117-126.  aTo develop designed polymer-drug conjugates, where the rate of drug liberation and hepatoma cell targeting function could be rationally and widely controlled, we facilely synthesized a series of novel, galactose-functionalized polymer-acyclovir conjugates with different linkers and first reported the effect of the linker structure including the type of acyclovir-linked bond (an ester bond or an amide bond) and relative length of the linker between acyclovir and the polymer main chain on release rate and targeting ability of conjugates. In vitro release studies showed that the cumulative released acyclovir from these polymer-acyclovir conjugates was between 24 and 65% in pH 1.2 glycine solution after 7 days. The ester bond more easily underwent hydrolysis than the amide bond. The longer the relative linker length was, the faster the acyclovir was released. The cell recognition experiments visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy exhibited that the resultant galactose-functionalized polymer-acyclovir conjugates had evident targeting to hepG2 cells, and targeting ability was also in connection with the relative length of linker. By choosing appropriate linker, cellular internalization of acyclovir could be well achieved. We consider these results to be helpful for the design of multifunctional polymeric prodrugs, in which the required release rate and targeting ability could be rationally controlled by predetermined molecular architecture. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Lipolytic activity was assayed spectrophotometrically using p-nitrophenyl palmitate. One percent (v/v) of sesame oil provided the highest activity with 80 and 98% enhancements with respect to 1% (v/v) concentrations of linoleic acid and triolein as the favored fatty acid and triglyceride, respectively. Glucose presented a repressive effect on lipase production.

The present work reports, for the first time, that the lipolytic activity of a B. subtilis strain can be improved by using inexpensive vegetable oils; and also that B. subtilis lipase is suitable for use in detergents. 3aBacillus subtilis 3aGram-positive bacteria 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3alipolysis 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aculture media 3avegetable oil 3afatty acid composition 3atriacylglycerols 3aglucose 3adetergents 2aBacillus subtilisxclassificationxenzymologyxisolation & purification. 2aDetergentsxpharmacology 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aLipasexisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aLipidsxpharmacology 2aLipolysisxdrug effects 2aPlant Oilsxpharmacology 2aTriglyceridesxpharmacology0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2008 Sept., v. 35, no. 9 p.1019-1025dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-008-0377-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090430b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/04/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03084naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001400189245008000203300001600283500002400299500001500323520122900338650001701567650001901584650001701603650001101620650001401631650001501645650001301660650003001673650002501703650001601728650002801744650004401772650003001816650004601846650001101892650001901903650001101922650002501933650003401958650002301992650001902015650002002034650003202054650001602086653001702102653001602119653001302135653002002148773012402168852000902292856007602301930003302377945002502410946001102435655001202446IND4385112020221120083350.0061112e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438511202DNAL7 a171055422pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.2006.00725.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aChate, A.12aA pilot audit of weight loss in upper gastrointestinal oncology outpatients  ap. 447-450.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPatients with upper gastrointestinal malignancies have a high incidence of weight loss and malnutrition which has been associated with a reduced quality of life, performance status, increased risk of chemotherapy induced toxicity and decreased response to treatment. The aim of the pilot audit was to identify how many patients attending an upper gastrointestinal oncology outpatient clinic had lost weight or had nutritional problems. A short questionnaire on present weight, weight loss and occurrence of symptoms was completed by 40 patients attending an upper gastrointestinal oncology outpatient clinic. Nutritional screening, including weight, was not routinely carried out on all patients. Only 40% of patients had been weighed at their clinic visit and 65% self-reported that they had lost weight. The frequency of symptoms in the weight loss group was higher than in the nonweight loss group and the incidence of nausea and dysphagia was significantly higher. Only 35% of patients had received dietary advice, but 68% of the remaining patients would have liked some. A significant number of patients reported weight loss and this was linked with a higher occurrence of symptoms influencing appetite and oral intake. 3amalnutrition 3aquestionnaires 3adrug therapy 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3ametastasis 3apatients 3adigestive system diseases 3anutrition assessment 3aweight loss 3adietary recommendations 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxetiology. 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aGastrointestinal Neoplasmsxcomplications 2aHumans 2aMass Screening 2aNausea 2aNutrition Assessment 2aNutrition Disordersxetiology 2aNutritional Status 2aPilot Projects 2aQuality of Life 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aWeight Loss 0achemotherapy 0aoutpatients 0aoncology 0ahuman nutrition0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2006 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.447-450dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2006.00725.x3electronic resource  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle04588naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245010900157300001600266500001500282520271300297592002803010650001903038650002003057650001003077650001803087650001403105650002203119650001503141650001703156650001403173650001903187650001203206650001303218650001903231650001003250650001803260650000903278650002303287650001503310650002303325650001003348650001803358650001203376650002103388650003103409650001103440650001903451650001303470650002203483653003103505653002203536653003103558653002803589653002503617653003303642653001603675653001603691700001803707773010403725856007603829852000903905655001203914IND4477521920221118123025.0151127e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447752192DNAL7 a10.1614/P2002-133A2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Adam S.10aCropping system effects on giant foxtail (Setaria faberi) demography: I. Green manure and tillage timing  ap. 919-929.  a2019-12-05  aManipulation of cropping systems to improve weed management requires a better understanding of how crop- and soil-related factors affect weed life cycles. Our objective was to assess the impacts of timing of primary tillage and use of legume green manure on giant foxtail demography and soil properties. We measured giant foxtail seed survival and dormancy, seedling emergence and survival, and fecundity, in addition to soil phytotoxicity, chemical properties affecting soil fertility and soil water, in the transition between the wheat and corn phases of a wheat––corn––soybean crop sequence. Postdispersal predation of giant foxtail seeds was measured in all three phases of the crop sequence. Wheat was grown either as a sole crop (W) or underseeded with red clover (R), and residues from this phase were rototilled either in the fall (FT) or in spring (ST). There were strong interactions between Red clover and Tillage timing in their effects on giant foxtail recruitment and fecundity in corn. Giant foxtail seedling emergence was 30%% lower, and time to 50%% emergence was more than 1 wk later, in the ST/R treatment than in the ST/W, FT/W, and FT/R treatments, which did not differ. However, fecundity of giant foxtail was 200%% greater in the ST/R treatment than in the other three treatments because of suppressed early corn growth. The net effect of the ST/R treatment on giant foxtail demography in corn was to greatly increase inputs to the seedbank compared with the ST/W, FT/W, and FT/R treatments. Giant foxtail demography in the wheat phase was also affected by Red clover. There was a 200%% increase in daily rates of postdispersal seed predation in the wheat phase of the R treatment compared with the W treatment. High-seed predation in the wheat phase and low fecundity in the corn phase of the FT/R treatment suggest that population growth rate of giant foxtail will be lower in this treatment than in the other treatments. The degree of soil phytotoxicity from red clover residues, the changes in the amount of interference from the corn crop early in the growing season, and the differential suitability of crop residues in the different rotations as habitat for seed predators all contributed to changes in giant foxtail demography. Understanding the effects of cropping system characteristics on entire weed life cycles will facilitate the design of integrated suites of complementary weed management tactics.Nomenclature: Giant foxtail, Setaria faberi Herrm.

Because suppression of insect transmitted plant diseases relies on sensible insect vector management, the life table parameters of B. cockerelli reared on tomato under both laboratory and field conditions in southern Texas were determined and the population dynamics were estimated according to the life table results. Generally, B. cockerelli reared on tomato in the laboratory had greater survival, fecundity, and longevity than those reared on tomato in the field, and the intrinsic mortality was the primary factor contributing to population decrease. In contrast, up to 74.2% of B. cockerelli were missing in the field. B. cockerelli reared under field conditions had a longer developmental time, shorter preoviposition and oviposition periods, shorter adult longevity, lower fecundity and higher mortality than those reared under laboratory conditions. Therefore, the intrinsic rate of increase (rm finite rate of increase (λ), and net reproductive rate (R₀) of field-reared B. cockerelli in south Texas were lower than the laboratory reared. These results could help in the understanding of B. cockerelli population dynamics under natural conditions in tomato fields, as well as suggest possible biotic and abiotic mortality factors that may contribute to sound insect vector management, and a better understanding of the epidemiology of B. cockerelli related diseases of tomato in south Texas and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3alife tables 3atomatoes 3aCandidatus Liberibacter 3aplant diseases and disorders 3alongevity 3aoviposition 3arearing 3aBactericera cockerelli 3afecundity 3amarkets 3aplant pathogens 3ainsect vectors 3aTriozidae 3apopulation dynamics 3amortality 3aadults 3aTexas 0ainsects 0apsyllid yellows 0apotato psyllid 0alife table 0aHemiptera 0atomato psyllid1 aZhang, Yong-Mei1 aHenne, Donald C.1 aLiu, Tong-Xian0 tFlorida entomologist.g2013 Sept., v. 96, no. 3 p.904-913dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F024.096.03263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245011400157300001600271500001500287520247000302592002802772650001902800650001702819650001802836650001002854650001402864650001402878650001102892650000902903650002402912650001302936650001002949650002202959650001402981650001502995650002303010650001003033650002203043653001903065653003503084653003103119653002103150653001603171653001803187653002403205700002103229700001803250773010403268856007603372852000903448655001203457IND4477522020221118123032.0151127e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447752202DNAL7 a10.1614/P2002-133C2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Adam S.10aCropping system effects on giant foxtail (Setaria faberi) demography: II. Retrospective perturbation analysis  ap. 930-939.  a2019-12-05  aCropping system characteristics affect weed management by altering key demographic rates of weeds, including recruitment, seedling survival, fecundity, and seed survival. To facilitate the design and improvement of cropping systems that limit weed population growth, analytical methods are needed to identify weed management ““choke points”” (weed life stages that vary in response to management and whose variation strongly affects weed population growth rate). The objectives of this study were to (1) determine whether wheat––red clover green manure can limit giant foxtail population growth rate (λλ) in a wheat––corn––soybean crop sequence and (2) identify choke points in the giant foxtail life cycle with respect to the green manure treatment. Demographic data were used to construct a periodic matrix model of giant foxtail population growth in a wheat––corn––soybean crop sequence, with either a wheat sole crop (W) or a wheat––red clover intercrop (R) in the wheat phase. Identification of choke points was accomplished by adapting the life-table response experiment (LTRE) design for retrospective perturbation analysis of the periodic matrix model. The difference in λλ (ΔΔλλ) between the two treatments was decomposed into contributions from each parameter in each rotation phase of the periodic model. Each LTRE contribution was equal to the product of the sensitivity of λλ to changes in a given parameter by the treatment difference in that parameter. Those parameters making large contributions to ΔΔλλ represented weed management choke points. Giant foxtail population growth rate in the simulation was more than twice as great in the W treatment (λλ == 2.54) than in the R treatment (λλ == 1.16). Retrospective perturbation analysis indicated that the proportion of seeds surviving predation in the wheat phase made the largest LTRE contribution (0.55) to ΔΔλλ, followed by seedling recruitment in the soybean (0.41) and corn (0.20) phases. By identifying weed management choke points within a given system, retrospective perturbation analysis can target research and management efforts for greater reductions in weed population growth.Nomenclature: Giant foxtail, Setaria faberi Herrm.

Different plant species and soil microbiota will likely shift their ranges at different rates, giving rise to novel communities of plants and soil organisms. However, the ecological consequences of such novel plant–soil interactions are poorly understood. We experimentally simulated scenarios for novel interactions arising between high‐ and low‐elevation plants and soil biota following asynchronous climate change range shifts, asking to what extent the ability of plants to coexist depends on the origin of the soil biota. In a greenhouse experiment, we grew pairs of low‐ (Poa trivialis and Plantago lanceolata) and high‐ (Poa alpina and Plantago alpina) elevation plant species alone and against a density gradient of con‐ or heterospecific neighbours. Plants grew on sterilized field soil that was inoculated with a soil community sampled from either low or high elevation in the western Swiss Alps. We used the experiment to parameterize competition models, from which we predicted the population‐level outcomes of competition in the presence of the different soil biota. In the absence of neighbours, three of the four species produced more biomass with the low‐elevation soil biota. As a result of generally similar responses across plant species, soil biota tended not to affect plant interaction outcomes, with the low‐elevation species generally predicted to competitively exclude high‐elevation species irrespective of the soil biota origin. However, the low‐elevation grass Poa trivialis was only able to invade communities of Poa alpina in the presence of a low‐elevation soil biota. This suggests that, at least in some cases, the outcome of novel competitive interactions between plants following climate change will depend on whether shifts in the distribution of plants and soil organisms are asynchronous. Synthesis. Our results indicate that the changing soil communities that plants encounter during range expansion can influence plant performance. However, this is only likely to alter expectations for the ability of plants to coexist following climate change if plant species respond differently to the change in the soil community.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aPoa alpina 3aPoa trivialis 3aaltitude 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental impact 3agrasses 3agreenhouse experimentation 3amodels 3aplant communities 3asoil 3asoil biota 3asoil ecology 3asoil-plant interactions 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland1 aHart, Simon P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7957-86891 aAlexander, Jake M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2226-79130 tjournal of ecology.g2018 Sept., v. 106, no. 5 p.1853-1863dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.130293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012100176300001600297520175900313592002802072650002602100650000902126650001002135650001602145650001302161650002402174650001302198650001502211650001402226650001002240650001402250650001402264650001402278650002002292650002302312650001402335651001202349700002102361700001902382700002202401773014002423856008502563852000902648655001202657IND60517714520221122145754.0160405e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051771452DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2015.11317392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Brandon C.10aUsing Radiotelemetry to Compare the Initial Behavior and Mortality of Hatchery-Reared and Wild Juvenile Florida Bass  ap. 374-385.  aStocking evaluations for pellet-reared, advanced-fingerling Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides often result in low contribution and survival, but little information exists on their survival and behavior soon after release. This study investigated the behavior and mortality of pellet-reared, advanced-fingerling (90–120 mm TL) Florida Bass M. floridanus immediately after they were stocked in Lake Carlton, Florida. A radiotelemetry experiment was conducted to compare initial movement, habitat use, growth, and mortality between stocked hatchery and wild fish. In year 1, we inserted radio transmitters into 50 hatchery fish; in year 2, we tagged 30 hatchery fish and 20 wild fish. All mortality we observed for hatchery fish (from both years) resulted from predation by fish and birds, and most occurred in the first 7 d after tagging. When compared directly with tagged wild fish (n = 20), tagged hatchery fish (n = 30) exhibited greater movement (75 and 124 m/d, respectively), greater proportion of locations offshore (8% and 23%, respectively), slower growth (1.73% and 0.41% of their body weight gained per day, respectively), and higher predation (47% and 0%, respectively). Results of this study suggest that pellet-reared, hatchery Florida Bass suffer more predation than wild bass of similar size initially following their release into the lake. Causes of predation could include less-developed antipredator skills and inefficiency in foraging observed through greater movement, as well as the use of offshore habitat and slower growth. We recommend research that investigates acclimating advanced-fingerling Florida Bass to predators and live prey before release to determine whether initial predation can be reduced after stocking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicropterus salmoides 3abass 3abirds 3abody weight 3aforaging 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahatcheries 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3amortality 3apredation 3apredators 3aradio telemetry 3aradio transmitters 3awild fish 3aFlorida1 aPorak, Wesley F.1 aLeone, Erin H.1 aAllen, Micheal S.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 145, no. 2 p.374-385dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.11317393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245007500179300001500254520141000269592002801679650001001707650002201717650001701739650001801756650001101774650001601785650001401801650002401815650001501839650002601854650002201880650001101902650002101913650001901934650001201953650001501965650001601980650001601996653001102012653001102023653001502034653001702049653001202066653001402078700002902092700006602121700003702187700003602224773010802260856008602368852000902454655001202463IND60611957520221122232515.0190401e20181219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061195752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMejía-Espejel, Lizbeth10aElicitors on steviosides production in Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni calli  ap. 95-102.  aStevia rebaudiana Bertoni produces glycosides known as steviosides and they have increased their demand. Biotechnological techniques are used as an alternative to increase the production of these compounds. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of elicitors on the synthesis of steviosides in the calli of S. rebaudiana. To meet this goal, a completely randomized experimental design with four replicates was used for each elicitor. Calli obtained from leaf segments were cultured on medium containing salicylic acid (10 and 100 mM), methyl jasmonate (10 and 100 mM), citric acid (200 mg L−1), ascorbic acid (100 mg L−1), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (1.5 mg L−1), and benzylaminopurine (1.5 mg L−1), under red, blue or white light for 24-h, at 25 or 28 °C. The calli cultivated at 28 °C or with 100 mM of salicylic acid increased their stevioside production by 9.8 times compared to that of the leaves of plants grown under greenhouse conditions. The concentration of rebaudioside A exhibited the highest values (34.6 times higher than in leaves) by applying 10 mM of salicylic acid. Steviol accumulated in the presence of antioxidants and growth regulators and by combining 100 mM of salicylic acid and 28 °C. Salicylic acid, certain types of exogenous antioxidants, growth regulators, and temperature may promote the accumulation of steviosides.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aStevia rebaudiana 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acallus 3acitric acid 3aelicitors 3aexperimental design 3aglycosides 3agreenhouse production 3agrowth regulators 3aleaves 3amethyl jasmonate 3asalicylic acid 3asteviol 3astevioside 3atemperature 3awhite light 0aStevia 0aCallus 0aStevioside 0aRebaudiose A 0aSteviol 0aElicitors1 aRobledo-Paz, Alejandrina1 aLozoya-Gloria, Edmundo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7096-03551 aPeña Valdivia, Cecilia Beatriz,1 aAlfredo Carrillo-Salazar, José0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 Dec. 19, v. 242 p.95-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245010200159300001600261520132500277592002801602650002901630650002401659650001101683650001401694650001801708650001601726650001601742650001001758650001601768700001701784700005601801700001401857700001901871700006401890700001901954700005301973773014402026856007602170852000902246655001202255IND60680978320221120165648.0200110e20191212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068097832DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b126262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xiaozhou10aPauli Paramagnetism of Stable Analogues of Pernigraniline Salt Featuring Ladder-Type Constitution  ap. 641-648.  aPolyaniline derivatives represent one of the most widely used classes of conductive polymers. The fundamentally important electronic properties of pernigraniline salts, the fully oxidized and acid-doped derivatives of polyanilines, however, are still not well-understood due to their poor stability and configurational uncertainty. To address these issues and to synthetically access stable analogues of pernigraniline salts, ladder-type constitution was imparted into a series of model oligomer analogues with rigid backbones constituted by up to 27 fused rings. The syntheses were achieved through iterative cross-coupling reactions followed by cyclization and oxidation. In contrast to their unstable non-ladder-type counterparts, these ladder-type pernigraniline-like molecules all adopt a well-defined all-trans configuration and demonstrate an excellent chemical stability after protonation, rendering it possible to reveal the intrinsic electronic and magnetic properties of molecules resembling pernigraniline. Protonated salts of these oligomers feature a significant diradicaloid open-shell resonance contribution. A dominant temperature-independent Pauli paramagnetism was observed in the solid state, an indication of the delocalization nature of the polarons in ladder-type analogues of pernigraniline salt.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-coupling reactions 3amagnetic properties 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aparamagnetism 3apolyaniline 3aprotonation 3asalts 3auncertainty1 aXie, Haomiao1 aZhu, Congzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1302-71871 aZou, Yang1 aMu, Anthony U.1 aAl-Hashimi, Mohammed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6015-21781 aDunbar, Kim R.1 aFang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4757-56640 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Dec. 12, v. 142, no. 1 p.641-648dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b126263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006300145245010200208300001800310500002000328520236100348592002802709650001602737650001102753650001102764650001102775650002202786650002202808650001902830650002302849650002302872650001102895650001902906650001102925650001102936650001102947650001002958650001502968650001302983650001702996651001303013700002203026773012203048856007903170852000903249655001203258IND60608923220221118203042.0180814e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060892322DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.129522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Kelsey A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5729-948610aAcclimation of leaf traits in seasonal light environments: Are non‐native species more plastic?  ap. 2019-2030.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn temperate deciduous forests, understorey light environments vary dramatically throughout spring, summer and autumn due to tree canopy leaf display. This variability in light level is a physiological challenge for understorey species that produce sun‐adapted leaves in the spring before being shaded by the tree canopy. Similarly, some understorey species display leaves late into autumn after the tree canopy senesces. Many species in North American deciduous forests with extended leaf display are not native to North America. Since many non‐native species have been shown to have greater plasticity than natives, we hypothesized that leaves of non‐native species may be more plastic with respect to seasonal light changes than natives, and that this plasticity may allow them to assimilate more carbon in the same environment. We measured leaf traits and photosynthetic capacity of 17 native and 13 non‐native understorey shrub species in a common garden in Syracuse, New York, during spring, summer and autumn. We tested for the contribution of seasonal mean and variance (plasticity) of leaf traits to a species’ average photosynthetic rate and total leaf production. We also analysed the extent to which leaf adjustments depended on whether plants continued to produce new leaves over the growing season. Leaf traits of both native and non‐native species varied seasonally, but plasticity varied in extent and contribution to overall carbon gain. Non‐native species had the highest seasonal plasticity, but, contrary to our hypothesis, such plasticity did not contribute to their overall carbon gain. However, leaf trait plasticity was adaptive for native species that continued to produce leaves throughout the year, primarily due to increases in quantum efficiency and electron transport rate in leaves produced mid‐year compared to leaves produced early in the year. Synthesis. Despite large adjustments in leaf traits across seasonal light environments for both native species and non‐native species, we found little evidence that leaf‐level plasticity drives non‐native invasion or contributes strongly to annual carbon gain or productivity in understorey species. Instead, differences in mean leaf traits across seasons are sufficient to explain carbon gain advantages of non‐native woody species in deciduous forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aautumn 3acanopy 3acarbon 3adeciduous forests 3aelectron transfer 3agrowing season 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3ashrubs 3aspring 3asummer 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avariance 3awoody plants 3aNew York1 aFridley, Jason D.0 tjournal of ecology.g2018 Sept., v. 106, no. 5 p.2019-2030dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.129523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010100169300001600270520192400286592002802210650001602238650001402254650002002268650001102288650001402299650002302313650000902336650001302345650001502358650002402373650001102397650002002408650001302428650001402441650001502455651001202470700002002482700001902502700002602521700002802547773014002575856008502715852000902800655001202809IND60517714720221122145741.0160405e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051771472DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2015.11317412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Joy M.10aSpawning Site Fidelity, Catchment, and Dispersal of Common Snook along the East Coast of Florida  ap. 400-415.  aA population's fidelity to spawning sites and variation in the strength of site fidelity among individuals are influential components of fish population dynamics. The literature on fidelity to aggregation sites is dominated by studies on marine species, whereas less is known about the fidelity of euryhaline species to spawning aggregation sites. We used passive acoustic telemetry to quantify intra-annual and interannual site fidelity and resident habitat associated with spawning sites (inlets) for 280 sexually mature Common Snook Centropomus undecimalis through an array of more than 200 receivers deployed in rivers, estuaries, inlets, and nearshore waters along 320 km of Florida's Atlantic coast. Fish were detected four times as often at and made twice as many trips to a primary spawning inlet than to secondary inlet sites. Fish displayed interannual site fidelity, returning to the primary inlet for as many as five consecutive reproductive seasons. Overall, individuals returned to their primary inlet (return rate [RR] = 0.54) more often than they changed sites between years (straying rate [SR] = 0.29), but variation in RRs and SRs between inlets suggested a spatial effect on interannual site fidelity. During the nonspawning season, fish generally resided less than 40 km to the northwest of their primary inlet. The 95% kernel density estimates (KDEs) for catchment area and dispersal area averaged 220 km ² and overlapped greatly for five out of six inlets. The 50% KDE did not overlap between inlets, suggesting that each spawning site had a corresponding winter resident habitat supporting a group of fish that were primarily associated with that inlet. The inclusion of telemetry data in traditional measures of site fidelity allowed for the identification and accurate description of behavioral polymorphism and may be applied to other fish species when spatial substructuring is suspected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentropomus 3aacoustics 3abreeding season 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3aeuryhaline species 3afish 3ahabitats 3aphilopatry 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers 3asexual maturity 3aspawning 3atelemetry 3awatersheds 3aFlorida1 aYeiser, Beau G.1 aAult, Erick R.1 aWhittington, James A.1 aDutka-Gianelli, Jynessa0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 145, no. 2 p.400-415dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.11317413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009400171300001600265520153200281592002801813650001301841650001201854650001501866650001101881650001401892650002001906650001301926650002401939650001501963650001101978700002001989773008002009856008602089852000902175655001202184IND60085044120221119115053.0141101e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008504412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.12.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStröm, Henrik12aA computationally efficient particle submodel for CFD-simulations of fixed-bed conversion  ap. 808-817.  aFixed-bed conversion is one of the standard methods for conversion of biofuels. However, in several cases the performance observed in applications of fixed-bed conversion of biomass and waste is far from optimal. Mathematical modeling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has a large potential to assist in the optimization of the fuel conversion processes, with regard to parameters such as burnout, emissions, fuel flexibility and material wear. To this end, computationally efficient models that can handle the most important features of the fuel conversion processes are needed. In the present work, a model is derived for the first conversion stages of a woody biofuel: drying and devolatilization in an inert atmosphere. The model predictions are compared to experimental data and to the predictions of similar models of higher and lower degrees of computational complexity. It is shown that the proposed model is able to predict the correct drying and devolatilization behavior by using a small number of variables and a relatively coarse resolution of the particle interior. It is also shown that a simpler model cannot accurately describe the conversion processes as observed in experiments. Moreover, by using a shrinking-core model to describe the char combustion, the particle mass loss can be predicted correctly also during this phase. Finally, it is outlined how the current model can be extended to include effects on spatial scales significant to that of the fuel bed, such as bed collapses and channeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acombustion 3adrying 3aemissions 3afluid mechanics 3afuel bed 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3awastes1 aThunman, Henrik0 tApplied energy.g2013 Dec., v. 112 p.808-817dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.12.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245011400157300001600271500001500287520169400302592002801996650002402024650002402048650001702072650001802089650000902107650003602116650001702152650001502169650002202184650001202206650001702218650001602235650001502251650002702266651001002293653003302303653003502336653002802371653001602399653001502415653001602430653001402446700001702460700001502477700001902492700001802511700001802529700001702547700001802564773011002582856007802692852000902770655001202779IND60127354520221121234339.0151110e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012735452DNAL7 a10.1653/024.096.03322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Jianya10aStatus of Insecticide Resistance of the Whitebacked Planthopper, Sogatella furcifera (Hemiptera: Delphacidae)  ap. 948-956.  a2019-12-04  aFrequent outbreaks and widespread transmission of rice black-streaked dwarf virus by Sogatella furcifera (Horváth) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) have aggravated yield losses of rice in eastern China. The use of insecticides for suppression of the vector has been a fundamental approach to prevent epidemics of the virus disease. However, the status of insecticide resistance in S. furcifera has not been examined recently in China. In this study, dose responses of S. furcifera to buprofezin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, chlorpyrifos and pymetrozine were evaluated. Most populations in eastern China have developed moderate resistance to buprofezin (up to 25-fold). Approximately 32% of field populations exhibited moderate resistance to imidacloprid, while other field populations showed minor changes (7.6-fold) in their susceptibility to this insecticide. Low variation of susceptibility to thiamethoxam (<6-fold) was observed among field populations, and no obvious resistance to this product was observed. Obvious variation (10.2-fold) of susceptibility to chlorpyrifos existed in field populations of which 8% displayed moderate resistance, and 32% exhibited low level resistance. Most populations (72%) were susceptible to pymetrozine, and relatively low variation of susceptibility to it was detected among the field populations of S. furcifera. Frequent and extensive use of buprofezin had driven the rapid development of resistance, and buprofezin resistance is widespread in the field populations of S. furcifera in China. To prevent further development of the resistance, use of buprofezin should be limited and rotated with alternative insecticides with different modes of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanism of action 3aSogatella furcifera 3achlorpyrifos 3adose response 3arice 3aRice black streaked dwarf virus 3athiamethoxam 3abuprofezin 3adisease outbreaks 3aviruses 3aimidacloprid 3apymetrozine 3apopulation 3ainsecticide resistance 3aChina 0asaltahojas de espalda blanca 0aresistencia a los insecticidas 0awhitebacked planthopper 0apimetrozina 0atiametoxam 0aclorpirifos 0aHemiptera1 aWang, Zhiwei1 aZhang, Kai1 aTian, Xiangrui1 aYin, Yanqiong1 aZhao, Xueqing1 aShen, Aidong1 aGao, Cong Fen0 tFlorida entomologist.g2013 Sept., v. 96, no. 3 p.948-956dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F024.096.03323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009700173300001800270520111500288592002801403650001601431650001601447650001101463650002401474650002101498700001601519700002301535700002101558700002701579773010601606856004801712852000901760655001201769IND50059353720221119135036.0130325e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005935372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-011-0656-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega-Gálvez, Antonio10aEffect of Selected Pretreatments on Convective Drying Process of Blueberries (var. O’neil)  ap. 2797-2804.  aThe effects of different pretreatments on the convective drying kinetics of blueberries (var. O’Neil) at 70 °C were investigated. The sodium hydroxide, enzymatic, microwaves, and high hydrostatic pressure pretreatments were applied and compared with control samples (non-pretreated). In order to simulate experimental drying data, the following mathematical models were selected: logarithmic, two terms, modified Henderson–Pabis, Midilli–Kucuk, and Weibull. Fick’s second law of diffusion was applied to determine the water diffusion coefficient for all the treatments. All pretreatments decreased significantly the drying time of the control samples. High hydrostatic pressures together with microwave pretreatments presented lower drying times than non-pretreated samples. Moreover, based on statistical test results, Weibull and modified Henderson–Pabis models presented the best fit for the experimental drying curves. Thus, both models can be satisfactorily applied to estimate the drying time of blueberries as well as to evaluate the effects of different pretreatments on fruit drying rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablueberries 3adiffusivity 3adrying 3amathematical models 3asodium hydroxide1 aLara, Elena1 aFlores, Verónica,1 aDi Scala, Karina1 aLemus-Mondaca, Roberto0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2012 Oct., v. 5, no. 7 p.2797-2804dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-011-0656-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008400172300001600256520136100272592002801633650002901661650002401690650002301714650001601737650001401753650001701767650000901784650000901793650001801802650000901820650001701829650001801846650001001864650002401874653002901898653001901927653001801946653000801964653002401972653002701996653002102023700002302044700002202067700002602089700002702115700002102142700002402163700002302187700002302210700002802233700002402261700002202285773012102307856008502428852000902513655001202522IND60535300920221121022015.0190401e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053530092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabrielli, Simona10aChronic polyarthritis associated to Cercopithifilaria bainae infection in a dog  ap. 401-404.  aDespite the widespread distribution of Cercopithifilaria bainae among canine and tick populations worldwide, this filarioid is currently considered of ‘minor importance’ in veterinary medicine, particularly when compared to related filarioids, such as Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens. To date, only a single case of dermatological alterations possibly associated to infection by C. bainae had been reported in a dog. In the present study, we describe the first case of systemic alterations associated to C. bainae infection in a dog suffering from diffused chronic polyarthritis. The animal had a previous history of reluctance to move and stiff gait and displayed multiple joint pain during manipulation of limbs. No biochemical, haematological and X-ray alterations were detected; microfilariae were observed in the synovial fluids collected from the joints. In spite of the morphological and molecular identification of these microfilariae as C. bainae, the dog did not respond to multiple microfilaricidal treatments with milbemicyn oxyme. The potential role of C. bainae in the pathogenesis of this clinical condition is discussed. Given the potential pathogenicity of this parasite, improved knowledge of this little known tick-borne nematode is warranted in order to assist the development of novel and effective treatment strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercopithifilaria bainae 3aDirofilaria immitis 3aDirofilaria repens 3aX-radiation 3aarthritis 3adog diseases 3adogs 3agait 3amicrofilariae 3apain 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3aticks 3aveterinary medicine 0aCercopithifilaria bainae 0aSynovial fluid 0aPolyarthritis 0aDog 0aTick-borne diseases 0aDifferential diagnosis 0aMilbemicyn oxime1 aGiannelli, Alessio1 aBrianti, Emanuele1 aDantas-Torres, Filipe1 aBufalini, Massimiliano1 aFraulo, Maurizio1 aLa Torre, Francesco1 aRamos, Rafael A.N.1 aCantacessi, Cinzia1 aLatrofa, Maria Stefania1 aCancrini, Gabriella1 aOtranto, Domenico0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 205, no. 1-2 p.401-404dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013000168300001600298520138000314592002801694650001701722650001501739650001101754650001101765650001601776650001501792651001001807653003301817653005601850653003601906653000901942653002101951700001701972700001501989700002002004700001402024700001802038773009602056856008502152852000902237655001202246IND60724266020221120193606.0210305e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072426602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.01.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Shengli10aDaily peak shaving operation of cascade hydropower stations with sensitive hydraulic connections considering water delay time  ap. 970-981.  aThe increasing peak-valley differences pose a major threat to safe operation of the thermal-dominant power grid in China. Cascade hydropower stations, especially for one-reservoir and multi-cascade hydropower stations (OMHS), as the second largest power supply in China form an important part of peak shaving operation. However, nonconvex and nonlinear constraints have made it deeply difficult to perform the daily peak shaving operation (DPSO) of OMHS. In this paper, an improved DPSO model of OMHS considering water delay time is formulated and solved. Firstly, the confluence coefficient method (CCM) is developed to accurately describe the water delay time of OMHS. Secondly, to reduce the errors and water spillage, aggregation of nonlinear constraints, selection of the linearized area and periodic hypothesis are performed. Finally, an MIQP model integrated CCM is established by considering one-reservoir and six-cascade hydropower stations from the Hongshui River of China as a case study. The optimization results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately simulate real-world system, and the optimized peak-valley differences on typical days in dry season and wet season reduce by 25% and 33%, respectively. Moreover, the CCM can produce more realistic and executable generation scheduling than the state-of-the-art description method of water delay time.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adry season 3amodels 3arivers 3awater power 3awet season 3aChina 0aDaily peak shaving operation 0aOne-reservoir and multi-cascade hydropower stations 0aSensitive hydraulic connections 0aMIQP 0aWater delay time1 aLiu, Zhanwei1 aLiu, Benxi1 aCheng, Chuntian1 aWu, Xinyu1 aZhao, Zhipeng0 tRenewable energy.g2021 May, v. 169 p.970-981dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.01.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011900173300001800292500001100310520116500321592002801486596002301514650001801537650002301555650001301578650001201591650001301603650000901616650002601625651002101651700005801672700005801730700005701788773014501845856008201990852000902072655001202081IND60685834420221119141622.0200310e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068583442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10448-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo Giudice, Angelina10aPeculiarities of extracellular polymeric substances produced by Antarctic bacteria and their possible applications  ap. 2923-2934.  aReview  aExtracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) possess diversified ecological role, including the cell adhesion to surfaces and cell protection, and are highly involved in the interactions between the bacterial cells and the bulk environments.

In this context, Antarctic bacteria have not been given the attention they deserve as producers of EPS molecules and a very limited insight into their EPS production capabilities and biotechnological potential is available in literature to date. Antarctic EPS-producing bacteria are mainly psychrophiles deriving from the marine environments (generally sea ice and seawater) around the continent, whereas a unique thermophilic bacterium, namely Parageobacillus thermantarcticus strain M1, was isolated from geothermal soil of the crater of Mount Melbourne. This mini-review is aimed at showcasing the current knowledge on EPS-producing Antarctic bacteria and the chemical peculiarities of produced EPSs, highlighting their biotechnological potential and the yet unexplored treasure they represent for biodiscovery.  aPublisher supplied data  aPNRA16_00020cPNRA 3acell adhesion 3amarine environment 3apolymers 3asea ice 3aseawater 3asoil 3athermophilic bacteria 3aAntarctic region1 aPoli, Annarita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6465-47651 aFinore, Ilaria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3606-51401 aRizzo, Carmen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4340-38330 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Apr., v. 104, no. 7 p.2923-2934dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10448-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010800208300001600316500001900332520136000351592002801711596006801739650002201807650001601829650001701845650001701862650001901879650001001898650002101908650001101929650001201940650000901952650000901961651001401970651001001984773012601994856008302120852000902203655001202212IND60728036820221119091621.0210217e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072803682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-020-10153-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBöhme, Michaela1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6477-269X10a‘Milk from the purest place on earth’: examining Chinese investments in the Australian dairy sector  ap. 327-338.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis article explores the emerging intersections between the shift towards higher quality food consumption in China and Chinese investment in overseas farmland. Based on an ethnographic study of a Chinese company acquiring one of Australia’s largest dairy farms, the article argues that the linkage between imported Australian milk and perceptions of safety and quality has served as a powerful driver of Chinese investment in overseas farmland—a linkage that has largely been overlooked by literature on China’s role in the global land rush. Drawing on the notion of ‘quality imaginaries’, the paper shows how images of Australian farmland as natural, pure, and geographically isolated have been mobilized by the investor company to position itself as provider of fresh, premium milk in the Chinese market. While such place-based qualities constitute a prized advantage, ironically, they also present a looming risk as the investor company struggles to reconcile fresh milk’s perishability with the farm’s location at the ‘edge of the world’. Thus, the case study not only demonstrates how cultural meanings tied to food and eating shape the ways in which investors imagine land’s affordances and possibilities but also draws attention to land’s materiality as a factor that both facilitates and destabilizes investment in farmland.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFB 1199, sub-project C04cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DE) 3aagricultural land 3aagriculture 3aanthropology 3acase studies 3adairy industry 3afarms 3afood consumption 3ahumans 3amarkets 3amilk 3arisk 3aAustralia 3aChina0 tAgriculture and human values.g2021 Feb., v. 38, no. 1 p.327-338dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl35543x0889-048X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-020-10153-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04051naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010100167300001800268520166600286592002801952596012801980596012802108596011702236596011102353596010702464596010702571596010702678596008702785596011102872650002502983650002103008650001803029650001903047650001203066700001403078700001703092700001603109700001403125700001403139700001803153700005403171700005403225700005603279773012803335856008503463852000903548655001203557IND60778880020221120154948.0220601e20220517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077888002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.2c002522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Baomei10aMulti-analyte High-Throughput Microplate-SERS Reader with Controllable Liquid Interfacial Arrays  ap. 7528-7535.  aHigh-throughput surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) reader, especially for liquid sample testing, is of great significance and huge demand in biology, environment, and other analytical fields. Inspired by the principle of microplate reader, herein, we developed a microplate-SERS reader for semiautomatic and high-throughput assays by virtue of three-dimensional liquid interfacial arrays (LIAs). For the first time, the formation of LIA in oil-in-water state, water-in-oil state, and two-dimensional plane state is realized by operating the hydrophilicity (contact angle) of the container. Through the force analysis of LIA, the effect of organic (O) phase density on the relative position of LIA was quantified. In addition, the optimized reader offers fast and continuous semiautomatic detection of 12 samples below 10 min with great signal reproducibility (calibration with the characteristic peak of O phase as the internal standard). The isolated wells in the microplate prevent analyte cross talk, allowing accurate quantification of each sample. Multiplex analysis capability highlights that this reader has the ability of rapid identification and quantification of samples containing various analytes and concentrations. The results demonstrate high-resolution dual and triple analyte detection with fully preserved signal and Raman features of individual analytes in a mixture, which implies that it also has excellent anticounterfeiting applications. This microplate-SERS reader combines the superior advantages of the LIA, microplate, and SERS techniques to retrieve the molecular vibrational fingerprints of various chemicals in complex media.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFC1605900cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2021YFD1601101cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  aSKLTOF20210105cState Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Biology and Utilizationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100015016  a202104a07020013cAnhui Provincial Key Research and Development Plandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100017668  aJZ2021HGQA0243cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  aJZ2021HGTA0171cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  aPA2020GDJQ0030cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  a2108085QB84cNature Science Research Project of Anhui Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA  aKJ2021A0303cKey project of Natural Science research in Universities of Anhui Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanalytical chemistry 3achemical species 3acontact angle 3ahydrophilicity 3aliquids1 aQu, Cheng1 aDu, Shanshan1 aGao, Wanjun1 aZhang, Yu1 aDing, Yan1 aWang, Hongyan1 aHou, Ruyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4423-694X1 aSu, Mengke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4839-35821 aLiu, Honglin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0910-24440 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 May 17, v. 94, no. 21 p.7528-7535dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c002523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01550naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245015700171500001900328520029300347592002800640650003300668650002500701650001200726653003000738653003200768653002500800653002100825653002900846700002400875700002100899700002000920700002300940700002000963773010200983856008201085852000901167655001201176IND60707402320221120223911.0201023e20201009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070740232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2020.1314982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbero, Margherita10aDiastereoselective synthesis of 3-(α-aryl)alkenylindoles from the direct dehydrative coupling of indoles and ketones: A synthetic and theoretical study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA representative library of 3-(α-aryl)alkenylindoles has been prepared via a Brønsted-acid catalysed dehydrative coupling reaction between alkyl aryl ketones and some indoles.

Yet in most regions of the world their geographic, categorical, and institutional evolution remains poorly understood. Here, we report on changes in protected areas in the Southwestern US from 1890 to 2005. Our analysis used the dates of protection of individual parcels in the region to analyze changes by: (a) designating authority (e.g., congressional, administrative), (b) managing agency, (c) protected area types (e.g., wilderness), (d) elevation, (e) ecoregion, and (f) land cover class. In the 1990s, protected area additions tripled compared with the previous decade. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) managed the most protected area after 1990, surpassing that of the US Forest Service. Prior to 1990, most protected areas were found at high elevations, but more recent additions occurred at lower elevations. Land cover types represented in protected areas changed significantly over the last century, with protected areas in forest and woodland systems added prior to 1930 and shrubland, steppe, and savanna systems added after 1980. Additions by BLM occurred mostly by administrative designation. These areas are not permanently protected and so do not provide the level of protection afforded other additions. However these additions are critical for conservation of biodiversity across the region because they occur at elevations and in ecoregions and land cover types that are minimally protected otherwise. Our analysis yielded new insights about permanency, level of protection, and spatial distribution of protected areas, characteristics critical for biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aecoregions 3aevolution 3aforests 3aland cover 3aland management 3asavannas 3ashrublands 3asteppes 3atemporal variation 3awilderness 3awoodlands 3aSouthwestern United States1 aHicke, Jeffrey A.1 aJennings, Michael1 aAycrigg, Jocelyn0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2013 Feb., v. 22, no. 2 p.343-356dSpringer-Verlagx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-012-0403-2  aDNAL 7aarticle01193naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009600161300001200257520026700269592002800536650002900564650001100593650001400604650001200618651001300630700001600643700001300659773013200672856007800804852000900882655001200891IND60623999620221119060227.0181130e20170316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062399962DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-BR-16-00562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaske, T.

However, few studies have been carried out to explore the spatial variability of the results at sub-basin scale. The aim of this study is to explore the spatial variability of relative contributions from climate variability and change in catchment properties to streamflow change within a mesoscale basin using three methods, namely elasticity and decomposition methods based on the Budyko framework, and the dynamic hydrological modeling method. The Upper Hanjiang River Basin (UHRB) is chosen as the study area, which presents a significantly decreasing trend of annual streamflow since 1990. We partitioned change in catchment properties into vegetation-induced change and non-vegetation-induced change in the hydrological modeling method, and climate conditions into precipitation and potential evaporation in the elasticity method. The results of the three methods suggest that climate variability is a greater contributor to streamflow decrease than change in catchment properties for the UHRB, whereas the relative contribution from change in catchment properties increases from 17% in the upper parts to 54% in the lower parts, which is likely linked to the population growth. The relative climate contribution estimated from the hydrological model is greater than these from the two Budyko framework based methods, and the estimated relative climate contribution from the decomposition method is the smallest in the three methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3aevaporation 3ahydrologic models 3apopulation growth 3astream flow 3awatersheds 0aStreamflow decrease 0aClimate variability 0aCatchment properties 0aBudyko framework 0aHydrological model1 aTian, Fuqiang1 aYang, Long1 aHu, Heping0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Jan. 16, v. 508 p.170-180dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014900175300001800324520160600342592002801948650002301976650001701999650001202016650001002028650001202038650001702050650001902067650001102086650001502097650001202112650001102124650001102135700006002146773014502206856008202351852000902433655001202442IND60685834620221119141600.0200310e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068583462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10443-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChattopadhyay, Atrayee10aEfficient xylose utilization leads to highest lipid productivity in Candida tropicalis SY005 among six yeast strains grown in mixed sugar medium  ap. 3133-3144.  aSix local isolates of yeasts were screened for cell mass and lipid production in mixed glucose and xylose medium. Candida tropicalis SY005 and Trichosporon (Apiotrichum) loubieri SY006 showed significant lipid accumulation of 24.6% and 32% (dry cell weight), respectively when grown in medium containing equal mass of both the sugars. SY005 produced relatively higher cell mass of 9.66 gL⁻¹ due to higher rate of sugar consumption, which raised the lipid productivity of the organism to 0.792 gL⁻¹day⁻¹ as compared to 0.446 gL⁻¹day⁻¹ in SY006. When grown with each sugar separately, the xylose consumption rate of SY005 was found to be 0.55 gL⁻¹ h⁻¹ after 4 days as compared to 0.52 gL⁻¹ h⁻¹ for SY006. Transcript expression of the high affinity xylose transporter (Cthaxt), xylose reductase (Ctxyl1), and xylitol dehydrogenase (Ctxyl2) of SY005 was monitored to unravel such high rate of sugar consumption. Expression of all the three genes was observed to vary in mixed sugars with Cthaxt exhibiting the highest expression in presence of only xylose. Expression levels of both Ctxyl1 and Ctxyl2, involved in xylose catabolism, were maximum during 24–48 h of growth, indicating that xylose utilization started in the presence of glucose, which was depleted in the medium after 96 h. Together, the present study documents that C. tropicalis SY005 consumes xylose concomitant to glucose during early period of growth, and it is a promising yeast strain for viable production of storage lipid or other high-value oleochemicals utilizing lignocellulose hydrolysate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida tropicalis 3aTrichosporon 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3alignocellulose 3alipids 3ametabolism 3axylitol 3axylose 3ayeasts1 aMaiti, Mrinal K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7803-43560 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Apr., v. 104, no. 7 p.3133-3144dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10443-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03453naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012400166300001600290520190400306592002802210650002502238650001102263650002602274650001602300650001902316650001602335650000902351650001802360650000902378650001402387650001102401650002002412650002602432650001402458650001802472650001102490650001702501650001402518650001202532653002602544653001702570653001302587653001502600653002302615653002502638700001502663700001802678773012102696856008502817852000902902655001202911IND60535301020221121002237.0190401e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053530102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoyle, E.K.10aNutrient partitioning of Merino sheep divergently selected for genetic difference in resistance to Haemonchus contortus  ap. 175-185.  aThis research was designed to determine if divergent genetic selection for resistance to Haemonchus contortus had produced correlated changes in the metabolism of amino-nitrogen in the absence or presence of H. contortus infection. Partitioning of amino acid-nitrogen between tissues was determined in 42 Merino weaner wethers from the CSIRO Haemonchus selection flock, increased resistance to Haemonchus (IRH), decreased resistance to Haemonchus (DRH) and random bred control (C) selection lines. Weaner wethers were fed a restricted diet (9.8MJME/kgDM, 86gMP/kgDM) calculated to allow a gain of 125g/d bodyweight throughout the experimental period and were either worm-free or trickle infected with H. contortus. At 8 weeks post-infection animals were injected with 15N-labelled duckweed directly into the abomasums. Animals were euthanased at either 6 or 24h after the injection to collect tissue samples for calculation of percentage recovery of 15N in tissue and to determine abomasal worm counts. Worm egg count and worm counts at week 8 of infection were lower in animals from the IRH line. IRH animals had a lower N digestibility, increased oxidation of amino acids and lower N balance but whole-body protein flux was unaffected. Amino acid metabolism, as assessed from 15N uptake and excretion in response to H. contortus infection, differed between IRH and DRH animals. In IRH animals a greater recovery of 15N in the thymus and abomasal smooth muscle indicated greater partitioning of amino acids towards the immune response. In DRH animals an increased recovery of 15N in the spleen, in response to infection, may be a possible adaptation. It appears that divergent selection for worm egg count has not been associated with symmetrical changes in amino acid metabolism, but rather the partitioning of amino acid resources reflects each selection line's independent response to infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aMerino 3aamino acid metabolism 3aamino acids 3aamino nitrogen 3abody weight 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aeggs 3aexcretion 3aflocks 3aimmune response 3anutrient partitioning 3aoxidation 3asmooth muscle 3aspleen 3athymus gland 3aweanlings 3awethers 0aNutrient partitioning 0a15N labelled 0aDuckweed 0aResistance 0aNematode infection 0aHaemonchus contortus1 aKahn, L.P.1 aMcClure, S.J.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 205, no. 1-2 p.175-185dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013700155300002000292520033600312592002800648650002300676650002300699650001900722650001400741650002100755650000700776700001700783700001600800700001300816700001700829700001700846700001600863700001300879700001600892773013700908856007401045852000901119655001201128IND60616631120221120073258.0181018e20180911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061663112DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc04420a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Yanli10aUltra-pH-responsive split i-motif based aptamer anchoring strategy for specific activatable imaging of acidic tumor microenvironment  ap. 10288-10291.  aA non-blocking split i-motif based aptamer anchoring strategy was developed as a general platform for sensing weakly acidic tumor microenvironment.

Hyperspectral images of salmon samples were acquired at different storage times. Spectral information within regions of interest (ROIs) of images were extracted to relate to reference LAB values measured by standard pour plate method. Least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithm was used to calibrate the full NIR range spectral data, resulting in regression coefficients of prediction (RP) of 0.929 with root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.515. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm was employed to reduce the spectral redundancy and identify the most informative wavelengths (MIWs) most related with LAB prediction across the whole wavelength range. Eight individual MIWs at 1155nm, 1255nm, 1373nm, 1376nm, 1436nm, 1641nm, 1665nm and 1689nm were finally selected from the full 239 wavelengths. Based on the selected MIWs, a new optimised model named CARS-LS-SVM was established, leading to RP of 0.925 with RMSEP of 0.531. At last, the CARS-LS-SVM model was transferred to each pixel of hyperspectral images of samples and colour maps were generated for visualising the LAB spoilage process in salmon flesh. The overall results indicated that NIR hyperspectral imaging is very potential and could be used as a rapid, non-destructive and efficient technique for LAB evaluation in salmon flesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3acold storage 3acolor 3afarmed fish 3ahyperspectral imagery 3alactic acid bacteria 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aprediction 3asalmon 3aspoilage 3asupport vector machines 3awavelengths 0aHyperspectral imaging 0aNear-infrared (NIR) 0aLactic acid bacteria (LAB) 0aSalmon 0aLeast squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) 0aCompetitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS)1 aSun, Da-Wen1 aWu, Di0 tFood research international.g2014 Aug., v. 62 p.476-483dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.03.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245009700202300001800299500002000317520183500337592002802172650001202200650001502212650002602227650001302253650001502266650001402281650001902295700005902314700006202373700005302435700006402488700002402552773013102576856007702707852000902784655001202793IND60789610420221120132407.0220822e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078961042DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JC0123402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGregor, Shayne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3222-704210aFactors influencing the skill of synthesized satellite wind products in the tropical Pacific  ap. 1072-1089.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGiven the importance of tropical Pacific winds to global climate, it is interesting to examine differences in the mean and trend among various wind products, and their implications for ocean circulation. Past analysis has revealed that despite the assimilation of observational data, there remain large differences among reanalysis products. Thus, here we examine if satellite‐based synthesis products may provide more consistent estimate than reanalysis. Reanalysis product winds are, however, typically used as a background constraint in constructing the synthesis products to fill spatiotemporal gaps and to deal with satellite wind direction ambiguity. Our study identified two important factors that influence both the mean and trends from synthesized wind products. First, the choice of background wind product in synthesized satellite wind products affects the mean and long‐term trends, which has implications for simulations of ocean circulation, sea level, and presumably SST. Second, we identify a clear need for developing a better understanding of, and correcting differences between in situ observations of absolute winds with the satellite‐derived relative winds prior to synthesizing. This correction requires careful analysis of satellite surface winds with existing colocated in situ measurements of surface winds and currents, and will benefit from near‐surface current observations of the proposed Tropical Pacific Observing System. These results also illustrate the difficulty in independently evaluating the synthesis wind products because the in situ data have been utilized at numerous steps during their development. Addressing these identified issues effectively, will require enhanced collaborations among the wind observation (both satellite and in situ), reanalysis, and synthesis communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3ageophysics 3aobservational studies 3aresearch 3asatellites 3asea level 3awind direction1 aSen Gupta, Alex1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5226-871X1 aDommenget, Dietmar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5129-77191 aLee, Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9817-29081 aMcPhaden, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8423-58051 aKessler, William S.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Feb., v. 122, no. 2 p.1072-1089dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC0123403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015000163500001900313520075500332592002801087650002501115650002701140650001101167653002201178653002701200653002101227653002001248700002401268700002301292700002101315700002301336700002201359700001901381773010201400856008201502852000901584655001201593IND60707402620221120223925.0201023e20201023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070740262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2020.1315012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Doris10aEfforts towards Rh(II)-catalyzed N-alkoxyazomethine ylide generation: Disparate reactivities of O-tethered α-diazo keto and -β-ketoester oximes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAzomethine ylide [3 + 2]-cycloaddition reactions are among the most powerful and well-studied chemical transformations to construct five-membered nitrogen-containing frameworks. However, cycloadditions of azomethine ylides bearing N-alkoxy substituents have largely been overlooked. This has been the case despite the potential for (1) accessing heterocycles with good regio- and diastereocontrol, (2) the presence of a cleavable tether which can be manipulated downstream via N–O bond cleavage, and (3) the promise of interesting structural diversity. Herein, we describe our efforts toward dirhodium-catalyzed intramolecular N-alkoxyazomethine ylide generation from α-diazoketo and -β-ketoester oximes and the disparate reactivities observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleavage (chemistry) 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aoximes 0aAzomethine ylides 0aDipolar cycloadditions 0aRhodium carbenes 0aDiazo compounds1 aJones, Elizabeth V.1 aRocke, Benjamin N.1 aFlick, Andrew C.1 aWright, Stephen W.1 aTrujillo, John I.1 aFrance, Stefan0 tTetrahedron.g2020 Oct. 23, v. 76, no. 43 p.131501-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2020.1315013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009500167300001600262520145400278592002801732650002101760650001901781650001501800650001001815650002401825650003401849650001301883650002001896650001801916650004301934650005201977650002402029650003502053650001002088650003602098650003602134650002702170653001302197653000902210653000902219653001102228653001002239653001002249653000802259653001102267653000802278653000902286653001002295653001302305653000802318653001602326653000902342653001902351700001402370700001302384700001702397700001702414700001402431773008802445856008302533852000902616655001202625IND60635167020221117185042.0190425e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063516702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2019.03.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhengzheng10aGenomic variant in porcine TNFRSF1A gene and its effects on TNF signaling pathway in vitro  ap. 105-109.  aOur initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to immune traits in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A) gene, suggesting the association of this gene with immune function in pigs. To better understand the immune functions of the TNFRSF1A gene, SNPs within the TNFRSF1A gene were detected by sequencing. One SNP (c.1394C > T) in exon 6 of TNFRSF1A was identified, and association analysis in two pig populations was subsequently performed. The results showed that this SNP was significantly associated with CD4−CD8−CD3−, CD4+CD8−CD3+, and CD4+/CD8+ (P = 0.0038, P = 0.0007, and P = 0.0076, respectively). Based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the TNFRSF1A mRNA was shown to be widely expressed in six different tissues. Finally, functional verification of the TNFRSF1A gene was performed in vitro to better understand its role. RNAi was used to generate a porcine PK15 cell line with a silenced TNFRSF1A gene, and a vector was also constructed to assess overexpression of TNFRSF1A. RT-qPCR was then used to detect changes in the expression levels of five critical genes. Our results indicated that TNFRSF1A activated the TNF signaling pathway and inhibited the NFκB signaling pathway in vitro. These findings provide evidence for an immune-related regulatory function for porcine TNFRSF1A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aanimal tissues 3acell lines 3aexons 3agene overexpression 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3aimmune response 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aswine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor receptors 3atumor necrosis factors 0aTNFRSF1A 0aGWAS 0aSNPs 0aTNF-α 0aTNFR1 0aTRAPS 0aHNC 0aNF-Κb 0aCDS 0aTLR3 0aLPS-G 0aTNFRSF1A 0aSNP 0aAssociation 0aRNAi 0aOverexpression1 aLi, Hejun1 aXie, Rui1 aWang, Shiwei1 aYin, Zongjun1 aLiu, Yang0 tGene.g2019 June 05, v. 700 p.105-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2019.03.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245018900215500001900404520076600423592002801189650002801217650001301245650001401258650001701272650001501289650001101304653002001315653001801335700001901353700001501372700002101387700002001408700002101428773011101449856008501560852000901645655001201654IND60707402820221120223933.0201023e20200917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070740282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1522672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakabatake, Tetsuhiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7420-194610aAnticancer agent synthesis designed by artificial intelligence: Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed one-pot preparation of biphenyls and its application to a concise synthesis of various diazofluorenes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe successfully synthesized the antitumor agent 1-methoxydiazofluorene via an artificial intelligence (AI)-proposed design.

As a result, several novel diazofluorenes, which have a stronger cytotoxic activity than cisplatin against various human epithelial cancer cells, were found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3abiphenyl 3acisplatin 3acytotoxicity 3aepithelium 3ahumans 0aAntitumor agent 0aDiazofluorene1 aTomita, Hiroki1 aOkada, Syo1 aHayashi, Natsumi1 aMasuko, Takashi1 aToyota, Masahiro0 tTetrahedron letters.g2020 Sept. 17, v. 61, no. 38 p.152267-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1522673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245016700211520091300378592002801291650002801319650001801347650003401365650001301399650001201412650001101424650001401435650001701449650001701466650001301483650001801496650001701514650001501531650001901546650002301565650001101588653002501599653001501624653001901639653002301658653002101681700002001702700006001722700002101782773011301803856008801916852000902004655001202013IND60672166720221123030808.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067216672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2019.1094382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheiri, Mariem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1930-852910aDevelopment of sequential and simultaneous bacterial cultures to hydrolyse and detoxify wood pre-hydrolysate for enhanced acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) production  aThe use of microorganisms is a promising option for an eco-efficient and successful conversion of hardwood hemicelluloses to biofuels. The focus of this work is the treatment of hemicellulosic pre-hydrolysate by flocculation, followed by simultaneous or separate detoxification with Ureibacillus thermosphaericus and Cupriavidus taiwanensis co-culture, and hydrolysis with Paenibacillus campinasensis. A reduction of phenolic compounds was achieved mainly after flocculation, applied as a first detoxification step, but no increase in sugars concentration was observed. The ABE fermentation of the hydrolysate obtained from the simultaneous hydrolysis and detoxification produced 6.8 g L⁻¹ of butanol after 116 h, which was higher than that generated with xylose synthetic medium. The higher biofuel concentration in the hydrolysate is attributed to the existence of carbon sources, other than xylose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCupriavidus taiwanensis 3aPaenibacillus 3aUreibacillus thermosphaericus 3abiofuels 3abutanol 3acarbon 3acoculture 3afermentation 3aflocculation 3ahardwood 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3amicroorganisms 3aphenolic compounds 3axylose 0aMicrobial consortium 0aHydrolysis 0aHemicelluloses 0aPhenolic compounds 0aABE fermentation1 aChadjaa, Hassan1 aMarinova, Mariya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7603-29121 aJolicoeur, Mario0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2020 Feb., v. 133 p.109438-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2019.1094383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245014400207300001600351520177700367536012002144592002802264650001202292650001902304650001302323650001502336650001602351650001702367650002302384650002502407650001202432650001202444653001802456653001902474653001902493700006002512700006002572773011302632856008202745852000902827655001202836IND60759888320221123004937.0211214e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075988832DNAL7 a10.1177/002367722110251662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunt, Michael W1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9975-868410aAttitudes of laboratory animal professionals and researchers towards carbon dioxide euthanasia for rodents and perceived barriers to change  ap. 531-539.  aEvidence indicates that carbon dioxide (CO₂) induces negative affective states (including anxiety, fear and distress) in laboratory rodents, but many countries still accept it for euthanasia. Alternative methods (e.g. inhalant anaesthetic) may represent a refinement over CO₂ but are not widely adopted. We conducted an online survey of Canadian and European laboratory animal professionals and researchers (n = 592) to assess their attitudes towards the use of CO₂ and alternative methods for rodent euthanasia using quantitative 7-point scale (from 1 (= strongly oppose) to 7 (= strongly favour) and qualitative (open-ended text) responses. CO₂ was identified as the most common method used to kill rodents, and attitudes towards this method were variable and on average ambivalent (mean ± SD score on our 7-point scale was 4.4 ± 1.46). Qualitative analysis revealed four themes relating to participant attitude: (a) the animal’s experience during gas exposure; (b) practical considerations for humans; (c) compromise between the animal’s experience and practical considerations; and (d) technical description of the procedure or policies. Many participants (51%) felt that there were alternatives available that could be considered an improvement over CO₂, but perceived barriers to implementing these refinements. Qualitative analysis of these responses revealed five themes: (a) financial constraints; (b) institutional culture; (c) regulatory constraints; (d) research constraints; and (e) safety concerns. In conclusion, concerns regarding the use of CO₂ often focused on the animal’s experience, but barriers to alternatives related to operational limitations. New research is now required on to how best to overcome these barriers.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3acarbon dioxide 3adistress 3aeuthanasia 3afearfulness 3alaboratories 3alaboratory animals 3aqualitative analysis 3arodents 3asurveys 0aMixed methods 0aanimal welfare 0ahumane killing1 aAméndola, Lucia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0743-51171 aWeary, Daniel M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0917-39820 tLaboratory animals.g2021 Dec., v. 55, no. 6 p.531-539dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/002367722110251663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009200173500001900265520101300284592002801297650001301325650001201338650001301350650002501363650001301388650001901401650001401420650001101434650001501445650001301460653002601473653001301499653002201512653002401534653002501558700002101583700002201604700002001626700002301646700001701669700001801686773010601704856008701810852000901897655001201906IND60724266620221121083204.0210223e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072426662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1246632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoareau, Morgane10aOxygen-reducing bidirectional microbial electrodes designed in real domestic wastewater  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrobial electrodes were designed in domestic wastewaters to catalyse the oxidation of organic matter (anode) and the reduction of oxygen (cathode) alternately. The successive aeration phases (cathode) enhanced the anodic efficiency, resulting in current densities of up to 6.4 Am⁻² without the addition of any substrate. Using nitrogen during the anodic phases affected the microbial populations and the electrodes showed a lower ability to subsequently turn to O₂ reduction than the microbial anodes formed in open-to-air conditions did. No strong difference was observed between internal and external biofilm, both of which showed a very large variety of taxa in terms of abundance as well as variance. They comprised a mix of aerobic and anaerobic species, many of which have already been identified separately in bioelectrochemical systems. Such a large diversity, which had not been observed in aerobic bidirectional bioelectrodes so far, can explain the efficiency and robustness observed here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3abiofilm 3acathodes 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3atechnology 3avariance 0aElectroactive biofilm 0aBioanode 0aMicrobial snorkel 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aMicrobial population1 aErable, Benjamin1 aChapleur, Olivier1 aMidoux, Cédric1 aBureau, Chrystelle1 aGoubet, Anne1 aBergel, Alain0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Apr., v. 326 p.124663-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1246633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245008700201300001600288500002000304520155600324592002801880596004101908650001101949650001501960650001301975650001601988650002502004650001302029650001002042650001502052651001502067700005702082700002202139700002202161700001902183700002602202773012902228856007702357852000902434655001202443IND60789610820221120142515.0220822e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078961082DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JC0124662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalter, Ryan K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1907-001X10aLocal diurnal wind‐driven variability and upwelling in a small coastal embayment  ap. 955-972.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe oceanic response to high‐frequency local diurnal wind forcing is examined in a small coastal embayment located along an understudied stretch of the central California coast. We show that local diurnal wind forcing is the dominant control on nearshore temperature variability and circulation patterns. A complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis of velocities in San Luis Obispo Bay reveals that the first‐mode CEOF amplitude time series, which accounts for 47.9% of the variance, is significantly coherent with the local wind signal at the diurnal frequency and aligns with periods of weak and strong wind forcing. The diurnal evolution of the hydrographic structure and circulation in the bay is examined using both individual events and composite‐day averages. During the late afternoon, the local wind strengthens and results in a sheared flow with near‐surface warm waters directed out of the bay and a compensating flow of colder waters into the bay over the bottom portion of the water column. This cold water intrusion into the bay causes isotherms to shoal toward the surface and delivers subthermocline waters to shallow reaches of the bay, representing a mechanism for small‐scale upwelling. When the local winds relax, the warm water mass advects back into the bay in the form of a buoyant plume front. Local diurnal winds are expected to play an important role in nearshore dynamics and local upwelling in other small coastal embayments with important implications for various biological and ecological processes.  aPublisher supplied data  aOCE‐1436522 and OCE‐1334398cNSF 3acoasts 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3awater 3awind speed 3aCalifornia1 aReid, Emma C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9247-57991 aDavis, Kristen A.1 aArmenta, Kevin J.1 aMerhoff, Kevin1 aNidzieko, Nicholas J.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Feb., v. 122, no. 2 p.955-972dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC0124663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008700170300001600257520145900273592002801732650001801760650001801778650001601796650001101812650000901823650001301832650001001845650001601855650001301871650001901884650001001903650001101913650001401924650001701938650001601955650000901971650001801980650001201998650001402010650000902024650002002033650001002053651001402063653003002077653001202107653001902119653001402138700001602152700001602168700001702184700001802201700002002219700001302239700001702252773012102269856008502390852000902475655001202484IND60535301520221121022123.0190401e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053530152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.06.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasqualetti, M.10aSusceptibility of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) to Trichinella patagoniensis  ap. 397-400.  aTrichinella spp. is a genus of parasites that is widespread all over the world. In Argentina, T. spiralis was for years the only species involved in human and animal outbreaks. During the last decade, T. patagoniensis, a new Trichinella species, was discovered in Argentina. Up to now, this species has only been found in cougars (Puma concolor). Experimental infections in pigs, cats, mice and rats with this new genotype showed that cats and mice were the most susceptible hosts. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the susceptibility of chickens to infection with T. patagoniensis. In order to study the intestinal and muscular phase, and the histopathological changes, 27 Leghorn chickens were inoculated per os with 1000 muscle larvae of T. patagoniensis and were euthanized on days 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Adult worms of T. patagoniensis were recovered from the small intestine of chickens up to day 14p.i. Gross examination of small intestine showed a moderate congestive appearance. Microscopically, an inflammatory response with lymphocytes and eosinophils in lamina propria, slight hyperemia, oedema and some haemorrhagic areas were detected. Lesions observed in chickens were similar to those described in different animal species during the intestinal phase. No muscular larvae were recovered from the muscle samples. These results suggest that T. patagoniensis is not capable to complete its entire life cycle in chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallus gallus 3aPuma concolor 3aTrichinella 3aadults 3acats 3achickens 3aedema 3aeosinophils 3agenotype 3ahistopathology 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ahyperemia 3ainflammation 3alymphocytes 3amice 3amuscle larvae 3amuscles 3aparasites 3arats 3asmall intestine 3aswine 3aArgentina 0aTrichinella patagoniensis 0aChicken 0aHistopathology 0aInfection1 aFariña, F.1 aFalzoni, E.1 aCardillo, N.1 aAronowicz, T.1 aKrivokapich, S.1 aRosa, A.1 aRibicich, M.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 205, no. 1-2 p.397-400dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.06.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016600166300001800332520182300350592002802173596004602201650002302247650003302270650002602303650001502329650002402344650002202368650003202390650001002422650003002432650001802462650002102480650001302501650002402514650001302538650003002551650001402581650001802595650001402613650002702627650001302654651002002667700001502687700001502702700005402717773014502771856008202916852000902998655001203007IND60685835220221119141436.0200310e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068583522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10415-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhichao10aBiogeographic pattern of the nirS gene-targeted anammox bacterial community and composition in the northern South China Sea and a coastal Mai Po mangrove wetland  ap. 3167-3181.  aFunctional genes, namely hzo/hao, nirS, hzs, and ccs gene, are efficient with high specificity for detecting anammox bacteria. Sc-nirS and An-nirS primer sets were proposed for targeting Scalindua/non-Scalindua anammox bacterial groups; previously, they have not been assessed for biogeographic study on marine-terrestrial transitional systems, specifically marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we report phylogenetic distribution pattern of anammox bacteria in both northern South China Sea (nSCS) and Mai Po wetland (a coastal mangrove) using nirS gene-based primers. A well-delineated biogeographic distribution pattern from ocean to continental shelf was evident by combining both gene-based analyses as previously depicted using 16S rRNA as the biomarker. Furthermore, factors affecting the abundance and composition of An-nirS genes in Mai Po wetland were identified as substrate (NO₃⁻/NO₂⁻ concentration) and anoxic/oxic condition in association to depth. An-nirS gene abundance was from 2.6 × 10³ to 1.2–1.4 × 10⁴ copies/g dry sediment in nSCS; and it was around 5 × 10³ and 1–2 × 10⁴ copies/g dry sediment in surface and subsurface sediments of Mai Po wetland, respectively. In addition, nirS gene abundance and distribution pattern of denitrifiers and anammox bacteria in the wetland indicates a competition relationship between them. Mangrove vegetation affected the community composition of An-nirS gene considerably, and a more homogeneous distribution pattern was observed in the mangrove forest than intertidal mudflats. Sc/An-nirS gene-based biogeographic insights on anammox bacteria have shed lights on the compositional and potential functional dynamics and emphasized the importance of molecular tools on refining the current microbial ecological patterns.  aPublisher supplied data  a701913cHong Kong Research Grants Council 3aaerobic conditions 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacterial communities 3abiomarkers 3acommunity structure 3acontinental shelf 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3alittoral zone 3amangrove forests 3anitrates 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awetlands 3aSouth China Sea1 aChen, Jing1 aGu, Wenjie1 aGu, J.-D.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7082-97840 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Apr., v. 104, no. 7 p.3167-3181dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10415-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01631naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016900158300001600327520057400343592002800917650002300945650002300968650001100991650002201002650001601024700002001040700002101060700001701081700002001098773010301118856007501221852000901296655001201305IND60578691320221122104622.0170813e20140103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057869132DNAL7 a10.1021/ol403234q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanai, Naoyuki10aDithiophene-Fused Tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethanes (DT-TNAPs): Synthesis and Characterization of π-Extended Quinoidal Compounds for n-Channel Organic Semiconductor  ap. 240-243.  aDithiophene-fused tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethanes (DTTNAPs) were synthesized and evaluated as n-channel organic semiconductors. DTTNAPs, regardless of isomeric structures and substituents, have low-lying LUMO energy levels (∼4.6 eV below the vacuum level), suitable for stable n-channel field-effect transistors (FETs) under ambient conditions. In fact, α-DTTNAP derivatives afforded solution-processed FETs showing an electron mobility of 10–³ cm² V–¹ s–¹, indicating that DTTNAPs are a potential molecular framework for n-channel organic semiconductors.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aenergy 3aorganic compounds 3atransistors1 aMori, Takamichi1 aShinamura, Shoji1 aOsaka, Itaru1 aTakimiya, Kazuo0 tOrganic letters.g2014 Jan. 03, v. 16, no. 1 p.240-243dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fol403234q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008400171300001600255520192400271592002802195650002002223650001402243650001102257650001702268650001102285650001402296650001602310653001502326653002302341653002502364653001802389700002002407700002002427700003402447773010802481856008602589852000902675655001202684IND60539667620221121083829.0190318e20140116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053966762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.10.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheviron, Bruno10aCalculation of river sediment fluxes from uncertain and infrequent measurements  ap. 364-373.  aThis paper addresses feasibility issues in the calculation of fluxes of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from degraded-quality data for flow discharge (Q) and sediment concentration (C) under the additional constraints of infrequent and irregular sediment concentration samplings. A crucial setting of the scope involves establishing the number of data required to counterbalance limitations in the measurement accuracy and frequency of data collection. This study also compares the merits and drawbacks of the classical rating curve (C=aQb) with those of an improved rating curve approach (IRCA: C=aQb+a1δS) in which the correction term is an indicator of the variations in sediment storage, thus relating it to flow dynamics. This alternative formulation remedies the known systematic underestimations in the classical rating curve and correctly resists the degradation in data quality and availability, as shown in a series of problematic though realistic cases. For example, monthly concentration samplings (in average) with a random relative error in the [−30%, +30%] range combined with daily discharge records with a systematic relative error in the [−5%, +5%] range still yield SPM fluxes within factors of 0.60–1.65 of the real value, provided that 15years of data are available. A shorter 5-day time interval (on average) between samplings lowers the relative error in the SPM fluxes to below 10%, a result directly related to the increased number of Q–C pairs available for fitting. For regional-scale applications, this study may be used to define the data quality level (uncertainty, frequency and/or number) compatible with reliable computation of river sediment fluxes. Provided that at least 200 concentration samplings are available, the use of a sediment rating curve model augmented to account for storage effects fulfils this purpose with satisfactory accuracy under real-life conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ahydrology 3amodels 3aparticulates 3arivers 3asediments 3auncertainty 0aRiver flow 0aSediment transport 0aUncertainty analysis 0aRating curves1 aDelmas, Magalie1 aCerdan, Olivier1 aMouchel, J.-M.q(Jean-Marie),0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Jan. 16, v. 508 p.364-373dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.10.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010000156300001600256500002000272520161900292592002801911650003201939650001501971650002201986650001602008650000902024650001902033650000902052650001402061650001302075650003002088650002402118650001502142650001902157700001902176700001602195700001402211700001502225700001702240773013402257856007402391852000902465655001202474IND60587346120221116145404.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058734612DNAL7 a10.1111/jsap.126762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerlach, M.10aEfficacy of feline anti‐parvovirus antibodies in the treatment of canine parvovirus infection  ap. 408-415.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: This prospective, randomised, placebo‐controlled, double‐blinded study aimed to evaluate efficacy of commercially available feline anti‐parvovirus antibodies in dogs with canine parvovirus infection. METHODS: First, cross‐protection of feline panleukopenia virus antibodies against canine parvovirus was evaluated in vitro. In the subsequent prospective clinical trial, 31 dogs with clinical signs of canine parvovirus infection and a positive faecal canine parvovirus polymerase chain reaction were randomly assigned to a group receiving feline panleukopenia virus antibodies (n=15) or placebo (n=16). All dogs received additional routine treatment. Clinical signs, blood parameters, time to clinical recovery and mortality were compared between the groups. Serum antibody titres and quantitative faecal polymerase chain reaction were compared on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. RESULTS: In vitro, canine parvovirus was fully neutralised by feline panleukopenia virus antibodies. There were no detected significant differences in clinical signs, time to clinical recovery, blood parameters, mortality, faecal virus load, or viral shedding between groups. Dogs in the placebo group showed a significant increase of serum antibody titres and a significant decrease of faecal virus load between day 14 and day 0, which was not detectable in dogs treated with feline panleukopenia virus antibodies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: No significant beneficial effect of passively transferred feline anti‐parvovirus antibodies in the used dosage regimen on the treatment of canine parvovirus infection was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3aantibodies 3ablood composition 3ablood serum 3acats 3across immunity 3adogs 3amortality 3aplacebos 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprospective studies 3aviral load 3aviral shedding1 aProksch, A.

METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. RESULTS: Mixed‐breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease‐specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aehrlichiosis 3aenteritis 3ahematocrit 3ahypoproteinemia 3aleishmaniasis 3aleukocyte count 3amedical records 3amixed breeds 3apathogens 3aprotein content 3aretrospective studies 3aMediterranean region1 aAngelidou, E.1 aKarnezi, D.1 aOikonomidis, I.

This animal was immunized subcutaneously on the dorsal neck for the development of monoclonal antibodies seven months before presentation. The animal was euthanized and necropsy was performed. Histopathology of the mass showed a well demarcated, multilobulated, unencapsulated, highly cellular, neoplastic mass composed of spindle cells arranged in interlacing streams and bundles, with a moderate amount of fibrovascular stroma. The neoplastic cells exhibited indistinct cell borders and a moderate to large amount of eosinophilic, fibrillar cytoplasm, marked anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, binucleated and multinucleated cells, and high mitotic rate. Based on the histomorphologic features of the mass, and the presence of renal tubular hyaline globules and myeloid hyperplasia in the bone marrow, a diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma was made. The presumptive diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, upon which the neoplastic cells showed strong immunoreactivity for the histiocytic cell markers Iba1 and CD11b. Histiocytic sarcomas have been reported in Syrian (Mesocricetus auratus) and Siberian dwarf (Phodopus sungorus) hamsters but, to our knowledge, the current report represents the first case of histiocytic sarcoma described in an Armenian hamster. It is plausible to consider the animal’s experimental immunization history and the development of the histiocytic sarcoma to be related. An association between adjuvanted vaccines and soft-tissue sarcomas has been described in cats and referred to as feline injection-site sarcomas.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded in part by a NIH/NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (grant number P30 CA008748).  aPublisher supplied data  aP30 CA 008748cNIH/NCI Cancer Center Support Grant 3aCricetulus 3aMesocricetus auratus 3aPhodopus 3abone marrow 3acats 3acytoplasm 3ahamsters 3ahistopathology 3ahyperplasia 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainjection site 3alaboratories 3amales 3amitosis 3aneck 3anecropsy 3asarcoma 0aArmenian hamster (Cricetulus migratorius) 0ainjection-site sarcomas 0ahistiocytic sarcoma 0amonoclonal antibody production1 aKitz, Sarah V1 aMonette, Sébastien0 tLaboratory animals.g2021 Dec., v. 55, no. 6 p.560-567dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/002367722110336723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006900167300001400236520078400250592002801034650002201062650001501084650001301099650001601112650003801128650001101166650001901177650002101196650001901217650001001236651001201246653002201258653001901280653001001299653001201309700005701321700005801378700001801436700005301454700001201507773011901519856008501638852000901723655001201732IND60535301920221121021839.0190401e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053530192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerhelst, D.10aSeroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in domestic sheep in Belgium  ap. 57-61.  aEven though infected sheep are a potential source of Toxoplasma gondii infection in humans, information is lacking concerning the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in sheep in Belgium.

The present study is the first report that analyzed the prevalence of T. gondii infection in sheep in Belgium and confirms the high prevalence of Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies in the sheep population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflocks 3ahuman diseases 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aseroprevalence 3asheep 3aBelgium 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aSeroprevalence 0aSheep 0aBelgium1 aDe Craeye, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4101-91091 aVanrobaeys, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5563-72691 aCzaplicki, G.1 aDorny, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5381-79871 aCox, E.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 205, no. 1-2 p.57-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245011800203300001800321500002000339520102800359592002801387650001201415650001501427650001101442650001301453650001201466651001701478651001801495700002401513700005701537700005701594773013101651856007701782852000901859655001201868IND60789611420221120152603.0220822e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078961142DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JC0121282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUngermann, Mischa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2437-422110aImpact of the ice strength formulation on the performance of a sea ice thickness distribution model in the Arctic  ap. 2090-2107.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe impact of a subgrid‐scale ice thickness distribution (ITD) and two standard ice strength formulations on simulated Arctic sea ice climate is investigated. To this end, different model configurations with and without an ITD were tuned by minimizing the weighted mean error between the simulated and observed sea ice concentration, thickness, and drift speed with an semiautomatic parameter optimization routine. The standard ITD and ice strength parameterization lead to larger errors when compared to the simple single‐category model with an ice strength parameterization based on the mean ice thickness. Interestingly, the simpler ice strength formulation, which depends linearly on the mean ice thickness, also reduces the model‐observation error when using an ITD. For the ice strength parameterization that makes use of the ITD, the effective ice strength depends strongly on the number of thickness categories, so that introducing more categories can lead to overall thicker ice that is more easily deformed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3asea ice 3aArctic Ocean 3aArctic region1 aTremblay, L.-Bruno,1 aMartin, Torge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0882-87801 aLosch, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3824-52440 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Mar., v. 122, no. 3 p.2090-2107dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC0121283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245015800171300001600329520110800345592002801453650001701481650002101498650002201519650002101541650000901562650001701571651001101588700002101599700002401620700002901644700002301673773010501696856004801801852000901849655001201858IND50071515220221118021425.0140101e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007151522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-013-0840-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranada, Camille E.10aDiversity of native rhizobia isolated in south Brazil and their growth promotion effect on white clover (Trifolium repens) and rice (Oryza sativa) plants  ap. 123-132.  aIn this study, rhizobia strains isolated from white clover (Trifolium repens) root nodules were evaluated in an effort to identify an efficient nitrogen-fixing rhizobia strain that can also improve the growth of rice plants (Oryza sativa). White clover plants were collected from seven sites in south Brazil, and 78 native rhizobia isolates were obtained. The genetic diversity analysis of those isolates was carried out by BOX-polymerase chain reaction. Overall, the native rhizobia isolated showed a high genetic diversity, but when the bacterial isolates from the same site were compared, the diversity was lower. One native rhizobia, POA3 (isolated from the Porto Alegre locality), was able to promote the growth of both plants and is therefore a good candidate for new inoculant formulation. Finally, we can conclude that the community of native rhizobia symbiont of white clover plants in southern Brazil is highly diverse and the growth promotion effect of rhizobia inoculation on rice plants was more pronounced in a poor nutrient substrate condition than in a rich nutrient substrate condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aTrifolium repens 3agenetic variation 3agrowth promotion 3arice 3aroot nodules 3aBrazil1 aArruda, Letícia1 aLisboa, Bruno Brito1 aPassaglia, Luciane M.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of raw materials on the microstructure and water distribution in cooked pasta using 1H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as bright field and polarized light microscopy. The MRI parameters initial intensity (I0) and transverse dephasing time (T2⁎) serve as indicators of the local water concentration and water–macromolecule interactions through chemical exchange, respectively. These parameters were mapped throughout the whole pasta volume with a spatial resolution of 78μm in all three dimensions. MRI was combined with light microscopy to link I0 and T2⁎ to microstructure components such as fiber particles and the extent of starch gelatinization. Four commercial spaghetti samples were analyzed which were made of durum wheat flour, both plain and enriched with wheat fiber, as well as with wholegrain and soft wheat flour. Although all pasta samples showed similar macroscopic water absorption as measured by weight increase, the sample structures differed at the microscopic scale. Compared to durum wheat spaghetti, the presence of fiber particles decreased T2⁎, while spaghetti enriched with soft wheat flour increased T2⁎. In addition, light microscopy showed that large fiber particles partly acted as barriers against water migration and protected starch granules from swelling. Smaller wheat fiber particles did not affect local starch swelling. Thus, the combination of light microscopy and MRI is a powerful tool to study the microstructure and water distribution in pasta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adurum wheat 3agelatinization 3alight microscopy 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amanufacturing 3amicrostructure 3apasta 3apolarized light 3araw materials 3astarch granules 3awheat flour 0aSpaghetti 0aMicrostructure 0aLight microscopy 0aMRI 0aDietary fiber 0aT2⁎1 aBernin, Diana1 aRöding, Magnus1 aNydén, Magnus1 aMoldin, Annelie1 aTopgaard, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9373-63481 aLangton, Maud1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1565-69960 tFood research international.g2014 Aug., v. 62 p.644-652dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013100170520129300301592002801594650001401622650001801636650001201654650001501666650001601681650000901697650002801706650001501734650002201749650001001771650001601781651001001797653001901807653002601826653001901852653001701871653002001888653001201908700002101920700001901941700002101960773011201981856008502093852000902178655001202187IND60743025020221120063619.0211114e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074302502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2021.1025402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJochem, Dominik10aNational wood fiber balances for the pulp and paper sector: An approach to supplement international forest products statistics  aIn recent years, several studies have found indications for data gaps and errors in the forestry production and trade section of the widely used FAOSTAT database. This manuscript focusses on inconsistencies in data on recovered pulp production, which have not yet been investigated in much detail. We develop national wood fiber balances for the pulp and paper sector for eleven countries. Our balances compare the wood fiber input (i.e. virgin and recovered pulp) in the paper and paperboard sector with the output (i.e. paper products) of this sector. By doing so, we are able to identify data gaps and errors and to determine the recovered pulp production as a residual volume in each country. For instance, we calculate a recovered pulp production of about 8.9 million tons for India in 2018. According to FAOSTAT, this production amounted to only 1.2 million tons. This is obviously too low considering that in the same year an apparent consumption of recovered paper of more than 10.1 million tons was reported. Moreover, we calculate ratios between virgin and recycled fibers in the paper production of the investigated countries. Our analysis provides a basis for better understanding of material flows in the pulp and paper sector and for supplements of international statistics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aforest policy 3aforests 3apaperboard 3apapermaking 3apulp 3apulp and paper industry 3astatistics 3atimber production 3atrade 3awood fibers 3aIndia 0aRecovered pulp 0aWood fiber equivalent 0aRecycling rate 0aWood balance 0aRecovered paper 0aFAOSTAT1 aBösch, Matthias1 aWeimar, Holger1 aDieter, Matthias0 tForest policy and economics.g2021 Oct., v. 131 p.102540-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2021.1025403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03570naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012200178300001600300520223200316592002802548650001302576650001502589650002002604650001802624650002102642650001102663650002902674651001002703653001802713653003602731653003902767653002302806653003402829700002202863700001702885700001902902700002402921773010802945856008603053852000903139655001203148IND60539668220221121083856.0190318e20140116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053966822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerulero Serrano, Raul10aImpact of two geostatistical hydro-facies simulation strategies on head statistics under non-uniform groundwater flow  ap. 343-355.  aWe present a numerical study keyed to the analysis of the impact on hydraulic head statistics of two selected methodologies for the stochastic simulation of hydro-facies spatial arrangement. We analyze the distribution of hydraulic heads in a confined aquifer under steady-state convergent three-dimensional flow to a fully penetrating well, superimposed to a mean uniform regional gradient. The heterogeneous structure of the system is modeled on the basis of available field information comprising detailed lithological data collected within an aquifer system located in northern Italy. These data are grouped into five litho-type categories and the aquifer system is modeled as a random composite medium. Monte Carlo realizations of the three-dimensional geo-material distributions are generated through the Sequential Indicator and the Truncated Plurigaussian Simulation methods. The latter enables one to integrate geological conceptual information in the simulation procedure, while the former relies mainly on a variogram-based analysis. Point and vertically averaged hydraulic heads, corresponding to typical observations collected within screened boreholes, are analyzed by evaluating the dependence of their sample probability distributions on (i) the hydro-facies generation scheme, (ii) the extent of the vertical averaging interval and (iii) the relative distance between the location of observation boreholes, hydrological boundaries and the source term. Theoretical probability density function models are fitted against numerically simulated distributions within a maximum likelihood context. Our results indicate that hydraulic heads associated with the Truncated Plurigaussian Simulation method exhibit increased variability when compared to their counterparts evaluated upon relying on a Sequential Indicator based modeling strategy of the system heterogeneity. Covariance matrices and probability distributions of point and vertically averaged hydraulic heads display similar key representative features and patterns. This suggests that typical measurements collected in screened boreholes can be used to infer qualitative information about the correlation structure and the statistical properties of heads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acovariance 3adata collection 3ageostatistics 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 3aItaly 0aGeostatistics 0aSequential Indicator Simulation 0aTruncated Plurigaussian Simulation 0aMonte Carlo method 0aHead probability distribution1 aGuadagnini, Laura1 aRiva, Monica1 aGiudici, Mauro1 aGuadagnini, Alberto0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Jan. 16, v. 508 p.343-355dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01486naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011200175500002900287520046500316592002800781650001800809650001600827650001400843653002400857653002300881653002600904653001600930700002100946773011100967856008501078852000901163655001201172IND60707403820221120223809.0201023e20200917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070740382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1523512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSravanthi, Kadavergu10aBrønsted acid-induced synthesis of methyl benzofurans via Grob type fragmentation of norbornyl derivatives  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aAn efficient Brønsted acid-induced one-pot syntheses of 2-methylbenzofurans from norbornyl derivatives have been reported.

These defensive responses, which are most effective when aphids receive early warning of an approaching predator, are often initiated before the predator reaches the aphid. Although described before, the process of predator detection has practically never been experimentally investigated in aphids and it is currently unknown whether they can distinguish approaching predators from harmless insects, and which senses they use for pre-encounter predator detection. I therefore addressed these two questions by comparing seven behavioral responses of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) to approaching predators (ladybugs) and non-predators (variegated caper bugs), to the plant-borne vibrations they generate and to visual cues. Aphids kicked, raised their bodies, withdrew their stylets and dropped more often in response to approaching ladybugs. Visual cues elicited only antennal movements. Body raising and antennal movements were more frequent in response to ladybug vibrations compared to caper bug vibrations. I found no evidence for predator-odor detection. Stylet withdrawal (preparation for escape) and dropping occurred in response to climbing insects but not to vibrations. I conclude that pea aphids use multimodal cues to detect approaching coccinellid predators. While visual cues alert the aphid without triggering defensive responses, vibrational cues are used to distinguish predators from non-predators. Future research on vibration patterns that aphids interpret as signs of danger may lead to the development of novel management techniques for one of the world’s worst crop pests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3ainsects 3aparasitoids 3apeas 3astylets 3avibration0 tJournal of pest science.g2021 Sept., v. 94, no. 4 p.1209-1219dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870064x1612-47587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-020-01323-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245008400198300001800282500002000300520153600320592002801856650001201884650001201896650004701908650001501955650001501970650001901985650000902004650001302013650001302026650003002039650001002069650001602079650001502095700001302110700001602123700005402139700005202193773013102245856007702376852000902453655001202462IND60789611920221120152707.0220822e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078961192DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JC0121302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuimbard, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5856-438110aSeasonal and interannual variability of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Fresh Pool  ap. 1749-1771.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Eastern Pacific Fresh Pool (EPFP) is a large region of low sea surface salinity (SSS) defined by values lower than 34 practical salinity scale within (5°S–30°N, 75°W–180°W). The fresh pool dynamically responds to strong regional and seasonally varying ocean‐atmosphere‐land interactions (including monsoon rain, trade and gap winds, and strong currents). Using more than 5 years of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) and complementary satellite wind, rain, currents, and sea surface temperature data together with a historical ensemble of in situ products, the present study explores the seasonal and interannual dynamics of the fresh pool over the period 2004–2015. An important interannual variability of the maximal surface extension of the EPFP over the past decade is revealed with two extreme events (2012, 2015) occurring during the SMOS satellite period. These extremes are found to be related to the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases and associated anomalies of precipitation, surface currents, and trade wind in the central Pacific. In 2012 (La Niña), stronger trade winds coupled with a deficit of precipitation induced a minimum extension of the pool during the rainy season. Whereas, during the strong El Niño 2014–2015, the EPFP extension reached an unprecedented maximum value. A modification of the atmospheric freshwater fluxes and ocean surface currents during winter 2014 is found to have favored the onset of this abnormal fresh event.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aSoil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite 3afreshwater 3ageophysics 3amonsoon season 3arain 3aresearch 3asalinity 3asurface water temperature 3atrade 3atrade winds 3awet season1 aReul, N.1 aChapron, B.1 aUmbert, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0748-75661 aMaes, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6532-71410 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Mar., v. 122, no. 3 p.1749-1771dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC0121303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010900155300001800264500001900282520123800301592002801539650002801567650002201595650001201617650001401629650002301643650001901666650001601685650002301701650001301724700001901737700001601756700001501772700001601787700001901803700001401822700001501836700001601851700001601867700001801883700001801901700002001919700001801939700001801957700001801975700001801993773013102011856007402142852000902216655001202225IND60711047320221122181829.0200916e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071104732DNAL7 a10.1039/d0bm00842g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Bing10aOn/off switchable epicatechin-based ultra-sensitive MRI-visible nanotheranostics – see it and treat it  ap. 5210-5218.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanotechnology has a remarkable impact on the preclinical development of future medicines. However, the complicated preparation and systemic toxicity to living systems prevent them from translation to clinical applications. In the present report, we developed a polyepicatechin-based on/off switchable ultra-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visible theranostic nanoparticle (PEMN) for image-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) using our strategy of integrating polymerization and biomineralization into the protein template. We have exploited natural polyphenols as the near infra-red (NIR) switchable photothermal source and MnO₂ for the MRI-guided theranostics. PEMN demonstrates excellent MRI contrast ability with a longitudinal relaxivity value up to 30.01 mM⁻¹ s⁻¹. PEMN has shown great tumor inhibition on orthotopic breast tumors and the treatment could be made switchable with an on/off interchangeable mode as needed. PEMN was found to be excretable mainly through the kidneys, avoiding potential systemic toxicity. Thus, PEMN could be extremely useful for developing on-demand therapeutics via ‘see it and treat it’ means with distinguished MRI capability and on/off switchable photothermal properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomineralization 3abreasts 3amagnetism 3aphotothermotherapy 3apolymerization 3apolyphenols 3aprecision medicine 3atoxicity1 aZhou, Xiaoxuan1 aXu, Hongxia1 aZhang, Wei1 aXu, Xiaodan1 aTian, Fengjuan1 aQian, Yue1 aYu, Feidan1 aPu, Cailing1 aHu, Hongjie1 aZhou, Zhuxian1 aLiu, Xiangrui1 aPatra, Hirak K.1 aSlater, Nigel1 aTang, Jianbin1 aGao, Jianqing1 aShen, Youqing0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 8, no. 18 p.5210-5218dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00842g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011000160300001600270520063100286592002800917650001500945650001100960650001300971650001400984650000900998650000701007650001701014650001601031653002601047653002301073653002701096653002501123700001901148700005801167773012601225856008301351852000901434655001201443IND60644847220221118233511.0190815e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064484722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.05.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wei14aThe interface adsorption behavior in a Pickering emulsion stabilized by cylindrical polystyrene particles  ap. 230-235.  aIn this study, cylindrical polystyrene particles were applied as a particulate stabilizer to prepare a Pickering emulsion of decane (oil)/water.

With this in mind, we studied five main grain-producing regions of China: Sanjiang Plain, Songnen Plain, Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, the middle Yangtze River and Jianghuai region and Sichuan Basin. Using GIS technology, we evaluated the comprehensive agricultural drought situation based on major crops, the basic drought resistance by integrating multiple indicators and the comprehensive drought resistance against background agricultural drought. We chose spring wheat, winter wheat, early rice, late rice, single-season rice and maize as the research objects and calculated a crop composite drought index to determine that the agricultural drought degree was highest in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and slightly lower in the Sanjiang and Songnen Plains. The drought degree was relatively low in the middle Yangtze River and Jianghuai region and the Sichuan Basin. A remarkable difference was observed in agricultural drought resistance among the grain-producing areas. The entire Sanjiang Plain had the lowest agricultural drought resistance, and that of the Songnen Plain was slightly higher. In the Sichuan Basin, many areas had lower and intermediate values of drought resistance. In the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and middle Yangtze River and Jianghuai region, resistance was stronger. The ranking of comprehensive drought resistance from strongest to weakest was Huang-Huai-Hai Plain > middle Yangtze River and Jianghuai region > Sichuan Basin > Songnen Plain > Sanjiang Plain. Finally, the sensitivity analysis was carried out to discuss the sensitive factors significantly affecting the agricultural drought resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acorn 3acrops 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afood security 3ageographic information systems 3arice 3aspring wheat 3awinter wheat 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aZhang, Hongqi0 tSustainability.g2016 Apr. 08, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80403463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01528naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245018600161300001600347520038800363592002800751650001700779650001600796651001100812651001600823651000900839651001700848653001300865653002000878653001400898700002100912700002900933773013000962856007701092852000901169655001201178IND60775780220221122132703.0220429e20220428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077578022DNAL7 a10.3157/021.130.02042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Jerry L.12aA New Species of Triozocera Pierce, 1909 (Strepsiptera: Corioxenidae) from Oman, with a New Distribution Record for Mengenilla Arabica Kinzelbach, 1979 (Strepsiptera: Mengenillidae)  ap. 157-167.  aTriozocera longipalpis n. sp. is described as the first species in this genus from Oman and the Middle East.

(Celastraceae): a tropical woody species in a transitional evolutionary stage of the gynodioecy–dioecy pathway  ap. 1693-1707.  a‘Gynodioecy–dioecy’ is one of the pathways by which dioecy can arise from hermaphroditism. Studies on sex determination and development of gynodioecious systems have focused on temperate and/or annual species. Little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of gynodioecy and dioecy in perennial tropical species, where these systems have more frequently evolved. Maytenus obtusifolia is an abundant species in restingas in southeastern Brazil. The sexual system of M. obtusifolia was investigated by studying the floral structure and reproductive biology. We considered the sexual system as an intermediate step in the pathway gynodioecy-dioecy. The characterization of the hermaphrodite morph was complex, because of a gradient of variation in floral morphology and reproductive characteristics (sizes of the style and stigmatic surface, pollen viability, embryo sacs containing hypertrophied synergids, and fruit set). This variation leads to different proportions of functional male and female flowers among hermaphrodite plants and is responsible for the different levels of reproductive success. Female reproductive success and pollen viability were negatively correlated with the hermaphrodite morph (r = −0.67). The higher fruiting intensity and fruit/flower ratio of females (41 %) compared to hermaphrodites (2 %) and the fact that female plants produce more and better-quality seeds support the female compensation. We suggest that female sterility may be linked to the set of changes in the carpels. The differences in the quality and quantity of pollen grains of hermaphrodite plants, and the similar individual rates of pollen viability observed for three consecutive flowering events, may indicate a relationship with nuclear cytoplasmic sex determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaytenus 3acarpels 3acorrelation 3adioecy 3afemale flowers 3afemales 3aflowering 3afruit set 3agynodioecy 3ahermaphroditism 3apollen 3aseeds 3asex determination 3aviability 3awoody plants 3aBrazil1 aHaddad, Isabella V.

However, the molecular mechanisms of FA production in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (FOC) are largely unknown. In this study, FoFUB4, a F. verticillioides FUB4 homolog was cloned from banana pathogenic fungus FOC and its deletion mutants were generated using homologous recombination. Our null mutation results showed that FoFUB4 did not affect fungal development and conidiation, but was essential for virulence on banana plantlets compared with wild type (WT) strain. Biochemical analysis showed that production of FA was not detected in mutant ΔFoFUB4 and FA production by WT was significantly reduced in Czapek Dox medium containing 6 compared with 120 mM NaNO₃. Moreover, transcriptional analysis indicated that the expression levels of FoFUB4 were reduced in WT in Czapek Dox medium containing 6 compared with 120 mM NaNO₃. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence for the vital roles of FA in virulence, and that nitrogen source regulated FA biosynthesis in FOC.  aPublisher supplied data  a20163103cNatural Science Foundation of Hainan Province  a2016hzs1J016cBasic Scientific Research Expenses for the Central Scientific Research Institutes  a2017hzs1J007cBasic Scientific Research Expenses for the Central Scientific Research Institutes  a31371900cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31471738cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31571957cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense 3abananas 3abiosynthesis 3aconidiation 3afungi 3afusaric acid 3ahomologous recombination 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3anitrogen 3aphytotoxicity 3aplantlets 3asodium nitrate 3atranscription (genetics) 3avascular wilt 3avirulence 3avirulent strains1 aYang, Laying1 aWang, Guofen1 aGuo, Lijia1 aLiu, Lei1 aWang, Jun1 aHuang, Junsheng0 tTropical plant pathology.g2018 Aug., v. 43, no. 4 p.297-305dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:19494x1983-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40858-018-0230-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245008700160300001600247520121700263592002801480650001201508650002201520650001801542650001501560650002101575650002301596650000901619650001001628650001201638650001201650650001301662650001201675650001501687650001201702650001001714653001101724653001401735653001501749653002101764653001101785773013001796856007701926852000902003655001202012IND60775780420221122101812.0220429e20220428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077578042DNAL7 a10.3157/021.130.02062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutlu, Çetin10aSpider (Araneae) Fauna of Some Field Crops in Southeastern Anatolia Region, Turkey  ap. 182-192.  aSpider diversity is an important pillar of biological control in agriculture, which has attracted the attention of ecologists globally. Despite its economic and ecological importance in agriculture, limited work is available from Turkey regarding spider diversity. This study investigated spider fauna of some major (wheat, maize and vegetables) and minor (sunflower, groundnut, tobacco, sesame and potato) field crops in southeastern Anatolia region, Turkey. Spider samples were collected from 16 different localities (115 fields) with sweep net and D-Vac machine. A total 212 specimens were classified as 41 species and 21 genera belonging to 18 families. The most commonly observed families were Philodromidae, Salticidae and Thomisidae. The highest spider diversity was found in cereal crops (23 species) followed by vegetable crops (22 species), while sunflower, lentil and potato (2 species each) had the lowest diversity. Thanatus sp., Evarcha sp., Phlegra sp. were the most abundant species in wheat. Cyclosa algerica Simon, 1885 was the first record in spider fauna from maize fields in Turkey. The current study improves the knowledge on spider diversity in Turkey, which can be used in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEvarcha 3aHelianthus annuus 3aPhilodromidae 3aThomisidae 3aTurkey (country) 3abiological control 3acorn 3afauna 3alentils 3apeanuts 3apotatoes 3aspiders 3asweep nets 3atobacco 3awheat 0aSpider 0adiversity 0anew record 0aCyclosa algerica 0aTurkey0 tEntomological news.g2022 Apr. 28, v. 130, no. 2 p.182-192dAmerican Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44723x0013-872X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3157/021.130.02063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100003200183245006900215300001400284506007600298520104400374592002801418506003701446650002601483650001401509650003601523650001401559650002101573650002901594650001101623650001201634650001301646650002201659700001901681700006401700773014201764856007601906852000901982655001201991IND60680975820221207100711.0200110e20191216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068097582DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b112822doi7 aPMC70673562pmcid7 a318416232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa e Silva, Felipe Cesar10aDirect C–H α-Arylation of Enones with ArI(O₂CR)₂ Reagents  ap. 64-69.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aα-Arylation of α,β-unsaturated ketones constitutes a powerful synthetic transformation. It is most commonly achieved via cross-coupling of α-haloenones, but this stepwise strategy requires prefunctionalized substrates and expensive catalysts. Direct enone C–H α-arylation would offer an atom- and step-economical alternative, but such reports are scarce. Herein we report the metal-free direct C–H arylation of enones mediated by hypervalent iodine reagents. The reaction proceeds via a reductive iodonium Claisen rearrangement of in situ-generated β-pyridinium silyl enol ethers. The aryl groups are derived from ArI(O₂CCF₃)₂ reagents, which are readily accessed from the parent iodoarenes. The reaction is tolerant of a wide range of substitution patterns, and the incorporated arenes maintain the valuable iodine functional handle. Mechanistic investigations implicate arylation via an umpoled “enolonium” species and show that the presence of a β-pyridinium moiety is critical for the desired C–C bond formation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aarylation 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3across-coupling reactions 3aiodine 3aketones 3amoieties 3asilyl enol ethers1 aVan, Nguyen T.1 aWengryniuk, Sarah E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4797-01810 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Dec. 16, v. 142, no. 1 p.64-69dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b112823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002400151245009500175300001600270520119000286592002801476650002501504650001501529650001701544650001901561650001001580650001201590650001201602650003501614650002401649650001301673650002301686650001101709650001601720650001601736650000901752650001701761651001101778700002201789700002501811700002401836700003001860700003201890773009001922856008702012852000902099655001202108IND4475800320221119133715.0150808e20121010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447580032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.06.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiannini, Tereza C.10aPollination services at risk: Bee habitats will decrease owing to climate change in Brazil  ap. 127-131.  aNative bees are important providers of pollination services, but there are cumulative evidences of their decline. Global changes such as habitat losses, invasions of exotic species and climate change have been suggested as the main causes of the decline of pollinators. In this study, the influence of climate change on the distribution of 10 species of Brazilian bees was estimated with species distribution modelling. We used Maxent algorithm (maximum entropy) and two different scenarios, an optimistic and a pessimistic, to the years 2050 and 2080. We also evaluated the percentage reduction of species habitat based on the future scenarios of climate change through Geographic Information System (GIS). Results showed that the total area of suitable habitats decreased for all species but one under the different future scenarios. The greatest reductions in habitat area were found for Melipona bicolor bicolor and Melipona scutellaris, which occur predominantly in areas related originally to Atlantic Moist Forest. The species analysed have been reported to be pollinators of some regional crops and the consequence of their decrease for these crops needs further clarification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelipona scutellaris 3aalgorithms 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3acrops 3aentropy 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aintroduced species 3amodels 3apollination 3apollinators 3arisk 3aspatial data 3aBrazil1 aAcosta, André L.1 aGarófalo, Carlos A.1 aSaraiva, Antonio M.1 aSantos, Isabel Alves dos,1 aImperatriz-Fonseca, Vera L.0 tEcological modelling.g2012 Oct. 10, v. 244 p.127-131dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009400165300001600259520074000275592002801015650003401043650003001077650002301107650001701130650001701147650001901164650001101183650002601194650001901220650002101239650001701260653002801277653001401305653003001319653003901349653001701388653001401405700001901419700001801438700001701456700002001473700002001493700002001513773012501533856008401658852000901742655001201751IND60121765320221121020245.0150324e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012176532DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2013.7855292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Song10aTerpenoids from the Chinese liverwort Plagiochila pulcherrima and their cytotoxic effects  ap. 473-481.  aThree new pimarane-type diterpenoids, 7β,11α-dihydroxypimara-8(14),15-diene (1), 1β,11α-dihydroxypimara-8(14),15-diene (2), and 11α-hydroxypimara-8(14),15-diene (3), five 2,3-secoaromadendrane-type sesquiterpenoids, including a new one, ethyoxyplagiochiline A ₂ (4), and three known fusicoccane-type diterpenoids were isolated from the Chinese liverwort Plagiochila pulcherrima .

Both persistence and incidence levels of its causal agent are lower in soils with red to reddish tonalities. These tones are associated with the presence of oxidized iron forms. The aim of this research was to assess the antimicrobial potential of different chemical forms of iron on phytopathogenic isolates of Nocardia sp., and evaluate its effect on the symptom expression of false broomrape in tobacco plants. Susceptibility to iron salts of four isolates was assessed in vitro by the minimal inhibitory concentration test. In in vivo experiments, soil inoculated with phytopathogenic isolates was treated with FeSO₄.7H₂O and symptom expression of false broomrape was evaluated as the average degree of affection, which considers grades of growth of tumours and buds developed on roots. We found that phytopathogenic isolates from four tobacco areas of Cuba with high incidence of the disease showed in vitro susceptibility to free iron in its oxidized forms of Fe⁺² and Fe⁺³. It was shown that the application of 1000 ppm of FeSO₄.7H₂O on the roots of tobacco seedlings and in the soil where they were transplanted reduces expression of the symptoms of false broomrape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNocardia 3abuds 3ain vivo studies 3airon 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aneoplasms 3aoxidation 3aroots 3asalts 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil inoculation 3atobacco 3aCuba1 aTrémols-González, Abdón Joaquín1 aDomínguez-Larrinaga, Rosario1 aCarrillo-Benites, María Guadalupe1 aCabrera-Alfonso, José Ramón0 tTropical plant pathology.g2018 Aug., v. 43, no. 4 p.333-340dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:19494x1983-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40858-018-0213-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007100161300001800232500001900250520188400269592002802153650002702181650002602208650001302234650001602247650001702263650002802280650001802308650001502326650001102341650001502352650002002367650001402387650001302401650000902414650001002423650001702433650001402450700001802464700002102482700002202503700001402525700001502539700001802554773013102572856007402703852000902777655001202786IND60711047820221120130658.0200916e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071104782DNAL7 a10.1039/d0bm00935k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalil, Islam A.10aCiprofloxacin-loaded bioadhesive hydrogels for ocular applications  ap. 5196-5209.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe management of corneal infections often requires complex therapeutic regimens involving the prolonged and high-frequency application of antibiotics that provide many challenges to patients and impact compliance with the therapeutic regimens. In the context of severe injuries that lead to tissue defects (e.g. corneal lacerations) topical drug regimens are inadequate and suturing is often indicated. There is thus an unmet need for interventions that can provide tissue closure while concurrently preventing or treating infection. In this study, we describe the development of an antibacterial bioadhesive hydrogel loaded with micelles containing ciprofloxacin (CPX) for the management of corneal injuries at risk of infection. The in vitro release profile showed that the hydrogel system can release CPX, a broad-spectrum antibacterial drug, for up to 24 h. Moreover, the developed CPX-loaded hydrogels exhibited excellent antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two bacterial strains responsible for the most ocular infections. Physical characterization, as well as adhesion and cytocompatibility tests, were performed to assess the effect of CPX loading in the developed hydrogel. Results showed that CPX loading did not affect stiffness, adhesive properties, or cytocompatibility of hydrogels. The efficiency of the antibacterial hydrogel was assessed using an ex vivo model of infectious pig corneal injury. Corneal tissues treated with the antibacterial hydrogel showed a significant decrease in bacterial colony-forming units (CFU) and a higher corneal epithelial viability after 24 h as compared to non-treated corneas and corneas treated with hydrogel without CPX. These results suggest that the developed adhesive hydrogel system presents a promising suture-free solution to seal corneal wounds while preventing infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3aantibiotics 3abioadhesives 3abiocompatible materials 3aciprofloxacin 3acompliance 3acornea 3aepithelium 3aex vivo studies 3ahydrogels 3amicelles 3arisk 3aswine 3atherapeutics 3aviability1 aSaleh, Bahram1 aIbrahim, Dina M.1 aJumelle, Clotilde1 aYung, Ann1 aDana, Reza1 aAnnabi, Nasim0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 8, no. 18 p.5196-5209dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00935k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009000162520127900252592002801531650001901559650001501578650001101593650001101604650001301615650001001628650001101638650001001649700002301659700003001682773012601712856007301838852000901911655001201920IND60651794720221119122153.0190712e20160412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065179472DNAL7 a10.3390/su80403522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntosiewicz, Marek10aInput <em>vs.</em> Output Taxation—A DSGE Approach to Modelling Resource Decoupling  aEnvironmental taxes constitute a crucial instrument aimed at reducing resource use through lower production losses, resource-leaner products, and more resource-efficient production processes. In this paper we focus on material use and apply a multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to study two types of taxation: tax on material inputs used by industry, energy, construction, and transport sectors, and tax on output of these sectors. We allow for endogenous adoption of resource-saving technologies. We calibrate the model for the EU27 area using an IO matrix. We consider taxation introduced from 2021 and simulate its impact until 2050. We compare the taxes along their ability to induce reduction in material use and raise revenue. We also consider the effect of spending this revenue on reduction of labour taxation. We find that input and output taxation create contrasting incentives and have opposite effects on resource efficiency. The material input tax induces investment in efficiency-improving technology which, in the long term, results in GDP and employment by 15%–20% higher than in the case of a comparable output tax. We also find that using revenues to reduce taxes on labour has stronger beneficial effects for the input tax.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aemployment 3aenergy 3aincome 3aindustry 3alabor 3amodels 3ataxes1 aLewandowski, Piotr1 aWitajewski-Baltvilks, Jan0 tSustainability.g2016 Apr. 12, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80403523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011500170300001400285520123300299592002801532650001201560650001301572650001301585650001301598650001501611650001601626653002101642653001501663653001401678653002201692653002101714700001901735773011001754856008501864852000901949655001201958IND60611110020221120202058.0180830e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061111002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2016.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPagliaro, J.L.10aHydrocarbon flame inhibition by C6F12O (Novec 1230): Unstretched burning velocity measurements and predictions  ap. 10-17.  aThis study experimentally and numerically determined the unstretched laminar burning velocity of premixed CH4-air and C3H8-air flames with added C6F12O (Novec 1230). High-speed shadowgraphy of spherically expanding flames provided the burning velocity as a function of stretch, which was extrapolated to zero-stretch conditions using non-linear methods. Unstretched burning velocities predicted using a recently assembled kinetic mechanism were generally in good agreement with the measurements, but tended to have poorer agreement for highly-inhibited very lean flames. To benchmark the performance of C6F12O, measured burning velocities were compared to previously measured burning velocities of premixed flames inhibited by CF3Br (Halon 1301). The two agents provided similar reductions in the burning velocity of rich flames, whereas CF3Br provided greater reductions when added to stoichiometric and lean flames. Lastly, experiments and simulations showed the influence of water vapor on the burning velocity of lean C3H8-air flames with added C6F12O. The presence of water vapor in the oxidizer increased the burning velocity by up to 23% when the fluorine to hydrogen ratio of the reactant mixture was greater than unity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3afluorine 3ahydrogen 3aoxidants 3aprediction 3awater vapor 0aFire suppression 0aNovec 1230 0aH/F ratio 0aHalon replacement 0aBurning velocity1 aLinteris, G.T.0 tFire safety journal.g2017 Jan., v. 87 p.10-17dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2016.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245012600215300001600341520166700357592002802024650001202052650001002064650001302074650001502087650001302102650001402115650001402129650001402143653002002157653001402177653002702191653001902218653002202237700003402259700001902293700005602312773012602368856008302494852000902577655001202586IND60644847920221119123426.0190815e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064484792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.05.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShojaei, Mohammad Javad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4927-921X10aDynamics of foam flow in a rock fracture: Effects of aperture variation on apparent shear viscosity and bubble morphology  ap. 464-475.  aThere has recently been renewed interest in understanding the physics of foam flow in permeable media. As for Newtonian flows in fractures, the heterogeneity of local apertures in natural fractures is expected to strongly impact the spatial distribution of foam flow. Although several experimental studies have been previously performed to study foam flow in fractured media, none of them has specifically addressed that impact for parallel flow in a realistic fracture geometry and its consequences for the foam’s in situ shear viscosity and bubble morphologies. To do so, a comprehensive series of single-phase experiments have been performed by injecting pre-generated foams with six different qualities at a constant flow rate through a replica of a Vosges sandstone fracture of well-characterized aperture map. These measurements were compared to measurements obtained in a Hele-Shaw (i.e., smooth) fracture of identical hydraulic aperture. The results show that fracture wall roughness strongly increases the foam’s apparent viscosity and shear rate. Moreover, foam bubbles traveling in regions of larger aperture exhibit larger velocity, size, a higher coarsening rate, and are subjected to a higher shear rate. This study also presents the first in situ measurement of foam bubbles velocities in fracture geometry, and provides hints towards measuring the in situ rheology of foam in a rough fracture from the velocity maps, for various imposed mean flow rates. These findings echo the necessity of considering fracture wall when predicting the pressure drop through the fracture and the effective viscosity, as well as in situ rheology, of the foam.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3afoams 3ageometry 3aprediction 3arheology 3aroughness 3asandstone 3aviscosity 0aFractured media 0aFoam flow 0aAperture heterogeneity 0aShear rheology 0aBubble morphology1 aRodríguez de Castro, Antonio1 aMéheust, Yves1 aShokri, Nima1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6799-48880 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 552 p.464-475dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.05.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245017200172300001600344520130600360592002801666596003901694650002801733650001301761650001101774650004301785650001401828650003001842650001501872650002001887650001401907700002401921700002101945700002301966700002101989700002402010700002202034700005802056773013202114856008202246961001302328852000902341655001202350IND60608921120221118213854.0200311e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060892112DNAL7 a10.1007/s40858-018-0216-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte Dias, Vanessa10aComparison of loop-mediated isothermal amplification, polymerase chain reaction, and selective isolation assays for detection of Xanthomonas albilineans from sugarcane  ap. 351-359.  aA loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR, and selective isolation assays for detection of Xanthomonas albilineans, the causal agent of sugarcane leaf scald. The pathogen was isolated on selective medium from 44 out of 45 (98%) samples taken from symptomatic stalks, and from 44 out of 70 (63%) samples from asymptomatic stalks that were collected from plots with symptomatic stalks. Forty-two (93%), 41 (91%), and 42 (93%) symptomatic samples tested positive by LAMP, PCR and nested PCR, respectively. The pathogen was detected in 19 (27%), 8 (11%), and 25 (36%) of the 70 asymptomatic samples by LAMP, PCR and nested PCR, respectively. Symptomatic stalks were mainly, but not always, associated with high populations of the pathogen (10⁷–10⁹ CFU/ml), and asymptomatic stalks with low populations (<10³ CFU/ml) or no bacteria. Although our LAMP and nested PCR methods detected 10 CFU/ml of X. albilineans in suspensions prepared with pure culture, they sometimes failed to detect the pathogen in samples with low pathogen populations. Isolation on selective medium along with another method should therefore be used for detection of the pathogen in asymptomatic stalks, especially in quarantine programs.  aPublisher supplied data  aF000057cFlorida Sugar Cane League 3aXanthomonas albilineans 3abacteria 3aleaves 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine 3aselective media 3asugarcane1 aFernandez, Emmanuel1 aCunha, Marcos G.1 aPieretti, Isabelle1 aHincapie, Martha1 aRoumagnac, Philippe1 aComstock, Jack C.1 aRott, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6085-61590 tTropical plant pathology.g2018 Aug., v. 43, no. 4 p.351-359dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:19494x1983-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40858-018-0216-23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009200154520133900246592002801585650001101613650002301624650001201647650001901659650001501678650001301693650001201706650002201718650001601740651001301756651001701769700002001786700001901806700002301825700001901848773012601867856007301993852000902066655001202075IND60651794820221119122016.0190712e20160412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065179482DNAL7 a10.3390/su80403562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOpitz, Ina10aToward Sustainability: Novelties, Areas of Learning and Innovation in Urban Agriculture  aGiven the search for new solutions to better prepare cities for the future, in recent years, urban agriculture (UA) has gained in relevance. Within the context of UA, innovative organizational and technical approaches are generated and tested. They can be understood as novelties that begin a potential innovation process. This empirical study is based on 17 qualitative interviews in the U.S. (NYC; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Chicago, IL, USA). The aim was to identify: (i) the most relevant areas of learning and innovation; (ii) the drivers of innovation; (iii) the applied novelties and their specific approach to overcoming the perceived obstacles; (iv) the intrinsic challenges that practitioners face in the innovation process; and (v) the novelties’ potential to contribute to sustainability and societal change. As the results of the study demonstrate, learning and innovation in UA occur predominantly in four areas, namely, “financing and funding”, “production, technology and infrastructure”, “markets and demands” and “social acceptance and cultural learning”. The described novelties include approaches to enhance the positive impacts of practicing agriculture within urban areas, and some of them have the potential to contribute to societal change and open up opportunities for social learning processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aempirical research 3afunding 3ainfrastructure 3ainterviews 3alearning 3amarkets 3aurban agriculture 3aurban areas 3aIllinois 3aPennsylvania1 aSpecht, Kathrin1 aBerges, Regine1 aSiebert, Rosemarie1 aPiorr, Annette0 tSustainability.g2016 Apr. 12, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80403563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03756naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245011000163300001600273520237400289592002802663650002502691650001302716650002202729650001102751650002402762650000902786650000902795650001802804650002402822650002402846650001502870650002102885650001602906650002302922653002402945653001902969653002302988653001803011700001303029700001303042700001803055700001403073773009203087856008603179852000903265655001203274IND60628951320221121051105.0200503e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062895132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.03.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yan14aThe application of microwave digestion in decomposing some refractory ore samples with solid fusion agent  ap. 538-544.  aIt is known that most of the refractory ore are the basis of national economy and widely applied in various fields, however, the complexity of the chemical composition and the diversity of the crystallinity in the mineral phases make the sample pre-treatment of refractory ore still remains a challenge. In this work, the complete decomposition of the refractory ore sample can be achieved just by exposing the solid fusion agent and the refractory ore sample in the microwave irradiation environment for a few minutes, and induced by a drop of water. A digestion time of 15 min for 3.0 g solid fusion agent mixture of sodium peroxide/sodium carbonate (Na₂O₂/Na₂CO₃) in a corundum crucible via microwave heating is sufficient to decompose 0.1 g refractory ore sample. An excellent microwave digestion solid agent should meet the following conditions, a good decomposition ability, an outstanding ability of absorbing microwave energy and converting it into heat quickly, a higher melting point than the decomposing temperature of the ore sample. In the research, the induction effect of water plays an important role for the microwave digestion. The energy which is released by the reaction of water and the solid fusion agent (Na₂O₂) is the key to decompose refractory ore samples with solid fusion agent, which replenished the total energy required for the microwave digestion and made the microwave digestion completed successfully. This microwave digestion technique has good reproducibility and precision, RSD % for Mo, Fe, Ti, Cr and W in the refractory ore samples were all better than 6, except RSD % for Be of about 8 because of the influence of matrix-effect. Meanwhile, the analysis results of the elements in the refractory ore samples provided by the microwave digestion technique were all in good agreement with the analysis results provided by the traditional fusion method except for Cr in the mixture ore samples. In the study, the non-linear dependence of the electromagnetic and thermal properties of the solid fusion agent on temperature under microwave irradiation and the selective heating of microwave are fully applied in this simple microwave technique. Comparing to the traditional fusion decomposition method, this microwave digestion technique is a simple, economical, fast and energy-saving sample pre-treatment technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3achromium 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3airon 3amelting point 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3amolybdenum 3asodium carbonate 3atemperature 3athermal properties 0aMicrowave digestion 0aRefractory ore 0aSolid fusion agent 0aDecomposition1 aLi, Gang1 aLiu, Wei1 aYuan, Hongyan1 aXiao, Dan0 tTalanta.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 186 p.538-544dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.03.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245011900198300001400317520071600331592002801047650001801075650001501093650001001108653001601118653001601134653002301150653001101173653001601184653001101200700006001211773016001271856007701431852000901508655001201517IND60775780920221122101824.0220429e20220224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077578092DNAL7 a10.3157/061.148.01032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaplan, Emin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9194-701810aNew and Additional Records from Bingol and Diyarbakır Provinces for the Turkish Ichneumonidae (Hymenoptera) Fauna  ap. 35-49.  aThis study is based on the material of the family Ichneumonidae collected from different localities of Bingol and Diyarbakır provinces from Turkey between 2016-2020.

Flames were generated with a porous 25mm circular burner using mixtures of methane and propane with nitrogen. The procedure was to specify a set of mass fluxes of nitrogen-fuel mixture that corresponded to the flash- fire- and extinction points and for the minimum mass flux where steady burning was achieved. The results show an increase in the critical mass flux with a decreased heat of combustion. The data fall into two regimes depending on the mixture flow rate; one buoyancy-driven (Fr<1) and one induced by momentum jet forces. The buoyancy-driven regime is geometrically consistent with the definitions of flash and fire points under natural convection conditions. The results for the momentum regime align reasonably with existing stagnant layer theory. Extinction theory is also suggested to give approximate results for the fire point. This argument is based on similar flame geometries for fire point and extinction and theoretical reasoning. An anchor point is proposed as the end point of ignition. Produced anchor point data result in a flammability diagram, below which quasi-steady burning occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acombustion 3aconvection 3afires 3aflammability 3afuels 3ageometry 3amass transfer 3amethane 3amomentum 3anitrogen 3apropane 0aCombustion 0aLaminar diffusion flame 0aHeat flux gage1 aSunderland, Peter B.1 aQuintiere, James G.1 avan Hees, Patrick1 ade Ris, John L.0 tFire safety journal.g2017 Jan., v. 87 p.18-24dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2016.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245011500206300001600321520108200337592002801419650002101447650002001468650002901488650000901517650001501526650001801541650001601559650001701575653002701592653002201619653001501641653001801656700001501674700005401689700006201743700005101805773015101856856008602007852000902093655001202102IND60783287320221123044158.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078328732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2022.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollack, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9355-923810aVariation in plastic consumption: social group size enhances individual susceptibility to an evolutionary trap  ap. 171-188.  aAnthropogenic change forces animals to navigate novel conditions, including evolutionary traps formed by decoupling cues from their previously evolved meaning. One underexplored feature that could drive variation in response to traps is social context. We looked at how group size influences the behaviour of western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, group members, including eating novel foods. Individuals in larger groups were faster to recover after experiencing a predator cue and faster to feed on known food items. Moreover, fish in larger groups were more likely to try novel foods, including microplastics, a common evolutionary trap. We also found evidence of a group level behavioural syndrome, in which a consistent proportion of individuals performed a behaviour across assays (i.e. resumed general activity following a predator cue, ate known food and ate novel food). Our results provide evidence that group size can influence the severity of an evolutionary trap and that, regardless of group size, group identity can have a strong effect on individual behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGambusia affinis 3aanimal behavior 3aanthropogenic activities 3afish 3agroup size 3amicroplastics 3anovel foods 3asocial class 0acollective personality 0aevolutionary trap 0agroup size 0amicroplastics1 aMunson, A.1 aZepeda, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4164-661X1 aCulshaw-Maurer, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2205-86791 aSih, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6161-16630 tAnimal behaviour.g2022 Oct., v. 192 p.171-188dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2022.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015400174300001600328520136800344592002801712596003401740650003001774650001101804650002501815650002001840650001301860650002101873650002001894650001001914650002001924650001301944650003601957650002201993650002802015650001102043650001102054650001402065650001502079650001502094650002502109700002002134700002202154700002402176773013202200856008202332852000902414655001202423IND60608921220221118213851.0200311e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060892122DNAL7 a10.1007/s40858-018-0217-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRockenbach, Mathias F.10aResistance of apple leaves to infection by Colletotrichum fructicola acts independently of hypersensitive reaction and PR-1 and PR-10 gene expression  ap. 360-370.  aColletotrichum fructicola is currently one of the most important fungal pathogens affecting apple production in the subtropics. This work was aimed at studying the resistance mechanisms of apple leaves during early stages of pathogen infection. Seedlings from ‘Fuji’ × ‘Gala’ crosses, resulting in resistant and susceptible plants (1:1) were used in an assay model. Disease severity reached 19% on susceptible plants at 7 days after inoculation with C. fructicola. Enzymatic activity of ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were similar between resistant and susceptible leaves, whereas glutathione reductase activity was enhanced in inoculated resistant plants. Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) leaf content showed a decrease only in inoculated resistant leaves at 12 h after inoculation (hai). H₂O₂ accumulation associated with the hypersensitive reaction (HR) was observed at a low frequency (ca. one reaction in 3000 penetration attempts) in resistant leaves. Pathogenesis-related 1 (PR-1) gene expression was not affected by inoculation with C. fructicola up to 48 hai. Whereas PR-10 gene expression was significantly increased in leaves of both genotypes at 24 and 48 hai. Results suggest that the monogenic recessive resistance of apple to GLS acts independently of HR and both PR-1 and PR-10 genes expression.  aPublisher supplied data  aPPCP-MERCOSUL 022/2011cCAPES 3aColletotrichum fructicola 3aapples 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acrop production 3acrossing 3adisease severity 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenotype 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 3amodels 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3asubtropics 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aVelho, Aline C.1 aAlaniz, Sandra M.1 aStadnik, Marciel J.0 tTropical plant pathology.g2018 Aug., v. 43, no. 4 p.360-370dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:19494x1983-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40858-018-0217-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245009300179300001400272520108700286592002801373650002201401650002101423650000901444650001901453650001001472650002201482650001601504650002101520653002101541653002001562653002301582653002501605653002201630653002301652700003501675773012801710856009001838852000901928655001201937IND60541168120221119191331.0190318e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054116812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArtíguez, Mari Luz10aInactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores by combined pulsed light and thermal treatments  ap. 31-37.  aThe combined effect of pulsed light (PL) and heat processing was evaluated on the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores. Those processes were applied separately and the time between both treatments was modified to evaluate whether the effect of the first treatment is maintained for a long time. B. subtilis spores subjected to sublethal pre-treatments were more sensitive to subsequent treatments (PL or thermal treatments) than untreated spores. Heating followed by PL was the most effective combination in reducing B. subtilis counts. Bacterial spores remained sensitized to subsequent treatment for at least 24h of storage in water, whatever the temperature was (4 or 30°C). Sensitivity of B. subtilis cells to PL or heat processing increased after germination in a nutrient broth, being equally sensitive from 3 to 24h. Vegetative cells maintained their enhanced sensitivity to subsequent processing after spore germination. The results of this work demonstrate that the combination of heating and PL treatment is a promising preservation method for microbial inactivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3abacterial spores 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3alight 3aspore germination 3atemperature 3avegetative cells 0aBacterial spores 0aDecontamination 0aCombined processes 0aSublethal treatments 0aMild preservation 0aSynergistic effect1 aMartínez de Marañón, Iñigo0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 Dec. 02, v. 214 p.31-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008200162300001400244520137700258592002801635650000901663650001501672650000901687650001301696650003501709650002501744650002001769650001201789650001601801650002601817650003201843650000901875653000801884653002701892653000801919653001801927700001501945700001701960700001401977700001701991700001702008700001502025773011002040856008302150852000902233655001202242IND60644848120221118233944.0190807e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064484812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2019.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhara, Y.10aRenal Infiltration of Macrophages in Canine and Feline Chronic Kidney Disease  ap. 53-59.  aDuring the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), macrophage infiltration is a crucial event leading to tubulointerstitial fibrosis. In the present study, macrophages infiltrating renal tissue in dogs and cats with CKD were analysed immunohistochemically. Iba-1 was used as a pan-macrophage marker, CD204 was used as a marker of M2 macrophages and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α was used as a marker of M1 macrophages. Signals for Iba1 and CD204 were observed in the interstitium of all tested kidney samples. In dogs, the signals were diffusely scattered. In cats, both diffuse and focal signals were observed. Cells that were positive for Iba1 and CD204 were also observed in the tubular lumina in cats. Co-expression of Iba1 and CD204 was also observed in the infiltrating cells by immunofluorescence labelling, and these cells were negative for TNF-α. By quantitative analysis, the indices for Iba1- and CD204-positive cells were significantly correlated with the concentrations of plasma creatinine and/or urea and the extent of interstitial fibrosis in both dogs and cats. These results demonstrated that renal infiltration of M2 macrophages plays an important role in the progression of CKD in dogs and cats. The distribution pattern of the kidney-infiltrating macrophages was unique in cats and may be associated with a cat-specific renal fibrotic process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3acreatinine 3adogs 3afibrosis 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3amacrophages 3aquantitative analysis 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aurea 0acat 0achronic kidney disease 0adog 0aM2 macrophage1 aYabuki, A.1 aNakamura, R.1 aIchii, O.1 aMizukawa, H.1 aYokoyama, N.1 aYamato, O.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2019 July, v. 170 p.53-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2019.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009400169300001600263520104100279592002801320650001601348650001001364650001401374650001601388650003101404650003001435650001001465650001301475700002801488700002801516700004001544773013201584856008201716852000901798655001201807IND60608921420221118203019.0200311e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060892142DNAL7 a10.1007/s40858-018-0227-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Rafael M.10aPlant-to-seed transmission of Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens on soybean  ap. 376-379.  aCurtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens (Cff) causes bacterial tan spot on soybeans (Glycine max), which was detected in Brazilian crops in 2012. The objective of this study was to determine the Cff transmission rate from plant to seeds in soybean cultivars with different levels of resistance to bacterial tan spot. For this, two assays were conducted under greenhouse and laboratory conditions. Inoculation in soybean plants was performed by the stem puncture method in the first assay and the toothpick method in the second assay. The Cff transmission to seed was checked by plating the suspensions extracted from seeds of the inoculated plants on semi-selective medium. Molecular identification of Cff amongst the obtained isolates was performed by PCR. The susceptible cultivars, BRS 284 and NS 5858 RR, showed zero to 1% Cff seed transmission, while the moderately resistant cultivar, BRS 388RR, showed 0% seed transmission. We concluded that Cff can be transmitted to soybean seeds of susceptible cultivars at low rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3acrops 3acultivars 3agreenhouses 3alaboratory experimentation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseeds 3asoybeans1 aFantinato, Gisele G.

A close examination of the water narratives in a Central Delhi slum reveals that these are imbued with language of developmental struggle and social injustice. This brings clear voice to otherwise tacit, abstract flows ranging from the movement of women, to the circulation of money, and distribution of water, illustrating the delineation and control of the borders and categories over which things flow. In the slum, residents mark the success of their lives, and their measure of the future, by the passing of time in waiting for water. Some residents are believed to live in a state of financial, temporal, and hydrological affluence, while others identify the flows in their lives as stagnant. These abstractions are manifested in stories of daily water struggles, reflecting identities and worldviews that shed light on perceptions of development that are otherwise difficult to express.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrology 3apoverty 3awater distribution 3awomen 3aIndia 0aAnthropology 0aIndia 0apoverty 0asustainable development 0aurban planning 0awater0 tSociety & natural resources.g2016 June 2, v. 29, no. 6 p.639-653dRoutledgex1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2016.11505343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245014600176300001400322520146700336592002801803650002701831650002601858650001301884650001201897650001801909650002601927650002601953650001801979650001801997650000902015650002002024653002302044653002102067653002702088653002602115653001702141700002202158700002302180700002202203700002002225700002102245700002402266773012802290856009002418852000902508655001202517IND60541168420221119191308.0190318e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054116842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdallah, Marwan10aImpact of growth temperature and surface type on the resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms to disinfectants  ap. 38-47.  aBiofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus on food-contact-surfaces represents a significant risk for the public health. In this context, the present study investigates the relationship between the environmental conditions of biofilm formation and the resistance to disinfectants. Therefore, a static biofilm reactor, called NEC-Biofilm System, was established in order to study the effect of growth temperature (20, 30 and 37°C), and of the surface type (stainless steel and polycarbonate), on biofilm resistance to disinfectants. These conditions were selected to mimic the biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces of food processing industries. The antibiofilm assays were performed on biofilms grown during 24h. The results showed that the growth temperature influenced significantly the biofilm resistance to disinfectants. These data also revealed that the growth temperature has a significant effect on the biofilm structure of both bacteria. Furthermore, the increase of the biofilm growth temperature increased significantly the algD transcript level in sessile P. aeruginosa cells, whereas the icaA one was not affected in S. aureus cells. Overall, our findings show that the biofilm structure and matrix cannot fully explain the biofilm resistance to disinfectant agents. Nevertheless, it underlines the intimate link between environmental conditions, commonly met in food sectors, and the biofilm resistance to disinfectants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3adisinfectants 3aenvironmental factors 3afood contact surfaces 3afood industry 3apublic health 3arisk 3astainless steel 0aBiofilm resistance 0aFood environment 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aDisinfectant1 aKhelissa, Oussama1 aIbrāhīm, ʻAlī,1 aBenoliel, Corinne1 aHeliot, Laurent1 aDhulster, Pascal1 aChihib, Nour-Eddine0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 Dec. 02, v. 214 p.38-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006300168300001400231520137200245592002801617650000901645650002301654650002501677650001601702650003101718650001301749650002301762653000801785653001901793653002301812653002201835700001801857700001401875773011001889856008301999852000902082655001202091IND60644848420221118233614.0190807e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064484842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2019.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenavente, M.A.10aExpression of Oxytocin Receptors in Canine Mammary Tumours  ap. 26-33.  aThe aims of the present study were: (1) to investigate the presence of oxytocin receptors in benign and malignant canine mammary tumours (CMTs) and to evaluate the possible association between oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression and the expression of oestrogen receptor (OR) α and ORβ, and (2) to examine associations between receptor expression and tumour size, clinical stage, histological subtype, tumour grading and lymph node status. Forty-three canine mammary tumour samples (19 benign, 24 malignant) were examined by immunohistochemistry to detect OTR, ORα and ORβ expression. Results were expressed as total score for each receptor, calculated as the sum of the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of immunolabelling. In all of the evaluated mammary tumour samples, OTRs were identified and their expression tended to be higher in benign tumours than malignant tumours. Among the malignant tumours, the expression of OTR was significantly higher in grade I and II lesions than in grade III lesions. ORα-positive tumours had a tendency towards a higher OTR total score than ORα-negative tumours. These results report for the first time that CMTs express OTRs and their expression is associated with the presence of ORα. An interaction between oxytocin and the OTR might play a role in the development and progression of this type of neoplasia.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aestrogen receptors 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alymph nodes 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3aoxytocin 3aoxytocin receptors 0adog 0amammary tumour 0aoestrogen receptor 0aoxytocin receptor1 aBianchi, C.P.1 aAba, M.A.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2019 July, v. 170 p.26-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2019.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009300162520207000255592002802325650002202353650001902375650001802394650001202412650002502424650002702449650003002476650001202506650001102518650003002529650001602559650001602575650001502591650002102606650001402627650001302641650000902654650001102663650001502674650002202689650001902711650001002730650001402740650001402754650002102768650001602789650000902805700002602814700002102840700002002861700002202881773012602903856007303029852000903102655001203111IND60651795220221119123438.0190712e20160412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065179522DNAL7 a10.3390/su80403572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandiera, Marianna10aPhytoremediation Opportunities with Alimurgic Species in Metal-Contaminated Environments  aAlimurgic species are edible wild plants growing spontaneously as invasive weeds in natural grassland and farmed fields. Growing interest in biodiversity conservation projects suggests deeper study of the multifunctional roles they can play in metal uptake for phytoremediation and their food safety when cultivated in polluted land. In this study, the responses of the tap-rooted perennial species Cichorium intybus L., Sonchus oleracerus L., Taraxacum officinale Web., Tragopogon porrifolius L. and Rumex acetosa L. were studied in artificially-highly Cd-Co-Cu-Pb-Zn-contaminated soil in a pot-scale trial, and those of T. officinale and R. acetosa in critical open environments (i.e., landfill, ditch sediments, and sides of highly-trafficked roads). Germination was not inhibited, and all species showed appreciable growth, despite considerable increases in tissue metal rates. Substantial growth impairments were observed in C. intybus, T. officinale and T. porrifolius; R. acetosa and S. oleracerus were only marginally affected. Zn was generally well translocated and reached a high leaf concentration, especially in T. officinale (~600 mg·kg−1·dry weight, DW), a result which can be exploited for phytoremediation purposes. The elevated Cd translocation also suggested applications to phytoextraction, particularly with C. intybus, in which leaf Cd reached ~16 mg·kg−1·DW. The generally high root retention of Pb and Cu may allow their phytostabilisation in the medium-term in no-tillage systems, together with significant reductions in metal leaching compared with bare soil. In open systems, critical soil Pb and Zn were associated with heavily trafficked roadsides, although this was only seldom reflected in shoot metal accumulation. It is concluded that a community of alimurgic species can serve to establish an efficient, long-lasting vegetation cover applied for phytoremediation and reduction of soil metal movements in degraded environments. However, their food use is not recommended, since leaf Cd and Pb may exceed EU safety thresholds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichorium intybus 3aEuropean Union 3aRumex acetosa 3aSonchus 3aTaraxacum officinale 3aTragopogon porrifolius 3abiodiversity conservation 3acadmium 3acopper 3aenvironmental degradation 3afood safety 3agermination 3agrasslands 3ainvasive species 3alandfills 3aleaching 3alead 3aleaves 3ano-tillage 3aphytoaccumulation 3apolluted soils 3aroads 3aroadsides 3asediments 3avegetation cover 3awild plants 3azinc1 aDal Cortivo, Cristian1 aBarion, Giuseppe1 aMosca, Giuliano1 aVamerali, Teofilo0 tSustainability.g2016 Apr. 12, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80403573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011000173300001600283520059200299592002800891650001500919650001600934650002000950650001500970650001700985650001801002650001301020650000701033650001501040650001601055650001101071650003001082650001001112653001601122653002201138653003601160653002801196653001001224700002001234700002301254700002301277700002501300773009201325856008601417852000901503655001201512IND60628951820221121081432.0200503e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062895182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKabiraz, Dulal C.10aHighly sensitive detection of clenbuterol in urine sample by using surface plasmon resonance immunosensor  ap. 521-526.  aThis study proposed the filtration method for removal of inhibitors from real urine samples for immunoassay without centrifuge.

The coupling of the bifunctional gold(III) precursor with the bifunctional aromatic compound has led to the formation of two regioisomers with either C- or N-coordination. Through monitoring by high-throughput high performance liquid chromatography, the regioselectivity of the reaction has been effectively tuned toward the formation of a single isomer, allowing easy separation of the metal complexes. The structures of the complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography, and the photophysical, electrochemical, and electroluminescence (EL) studies have been carried out. Computational study has been performed to provide insights into the nature of the excited states. Isomeric effect has been shown to have a significant influence on the EL behavior of the organic light-emitting devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaromatic compounds 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3agold 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aligands 3amonitoring 3apositional isomers 3aregioselectivity1 aTang, Man-Chung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9334-93481 aKong, Fred Ka-Wai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4137-40521 aCheung, William W.

Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) is a valid approach to study the physiology of early dwarf cashew clones, and the presented NIR methodology is expected to be an alternative for cashew germoplasm banks as a tool to support the database of images spectra for a rapid and robust phenotyping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardium occidentale 3aalgorithms 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acarotenoids 3acashew fruit 3aclones 3adatabases 3afirmness 3aflavonoids 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3agenetic improvement 3aleast squares 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apH 3aphenotype 3aphysiology 3apolyphenols 3aprediction 3aspectrometers 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 0aAnnacardium occidentale L. 0aNon destructive 0aPhenotyping 0aMultivariate calibration 0aRemote sensing1 aRibeiro, Lívia Paulia Dias1 ade Almeida Lopes, Mônica Maria1 aPuschmann, Rolf1 ade Oliveira Silva, Ebenezer0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 Aug. 19, v. 238 p.363-368dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245014100172300001400313520223600327592002802563650002602591650001202617650002202629650001102651650002802662650000702690650001602697650001602713650001302729650001202742650002002754653002402774653002902798653001702827653001602844653002002860700001902880700001802899700001802917700001902935700001802954700005702972773012803029856009003157852000903247655001203256IND60541168620221119191233.0190318e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054116862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Nam Hee10aUse of phytic acid and hyper-salting to eliminate Escherichia coli O157:H7 from napa cabbage for kimchi production in a commercial plant  ap. 24-30.  aThe aim of this study was to develop a new salting method using natural phytic acid (PA) to ensure the microbiological safety and quality of salted napa cabbage used for kimchi production. The production of salted napa cabbage involves several stages: trimming, hyper-salting (20% NaCl) for up to 1h, salting (10% NaCl for 10–18h), three sequential washes in water (30s for each), and draining (2h). Two separate experiments were performed: one to determine the appropriate treatment conditions and a second to validate applicability under commercial conditions. In Experiment I, the effects of hyper-salting with PA on Escherichia coli O157:H7 numbers were tested in the laboratory. The following variables were monitored: 1) PA concentration (1, 2, 3%, w/w); 2) the ratio of the sample weight to the total volume of the solution (1:1.5, 1:3, or 1:6); 3) the hyper-salting time (30 or 60min); and 4) the salting time (2, 5, or 8h). A procedure that achieved a >5-log reduction in the E. coli O157:H7 population was then tested in an actual kimchi processing plant (Experiment II). The results from Experiment I showed that bactericidal efficacy increased as all the measured variables increased (p<0.05). Hyper-salting with 2% PA at a sample-to-water ratio (w/v) of 1:3 and 1:6 for 60min resulted in a >5-logCFU/g reduction in the E. coli O157:H7 population. Further salting for 5h completely eliminated (<1-logCFU/g) all bacteria. Thus, hyper-salting with PA 2% at a sample-to-water ratio of 1:3 for 60min, followed by salting for 5h, was tested under large-scale production conditions. The results revealed that the initial aerobic plate counts (APC), total coliform counts (TC), and fecal coliform counts (FC) were 6.6, 3.4, and 2.8-logCFU/g, respectively. The selected protocol reduced these values by 3.7-, >2.4-, and >1.8-logCFU/g, respectively. The 5h salting step maintained the TC and FC at <1-logCFU/g; however, the APC recovered somewhat. The pH and salinity of the treated salted napa cabbages were within the ranges required for kimchi production (pH5.1–5.3 and 1.5–2.0%, respectively). These results suggest that this novel method of salting food ensures microbiological safety and reduces the production time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3acabbage 3acoliform bacteria 3akimchi 3amicrobiological quality 3apH 3aphytic acid 3aplate count 3asalinity 3asalting 3asodium chloride 0aSalted napa cabbage 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aDisinfection 0aPhytic acid 0aSodium chloride1 aJang, Seong Ho1 aKim, Soon Han1 aLee, Hee Jung1 aKim, Younghoon1 aRyu, Jee Hoon1 aRhee, Min Suk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0412-19100 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 Dec. 02, v. 214 p.24-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245015000165300001600315520070300331592002801034650001801062650001101080650001201091650002601103650000901129651002101138651001001159653001701169653002001186653001801206653001201224700002001236700002301256773016201279856007701441852000901518655001201527IND60775781620221122063424.0220429e20220427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077578162DNAL7 a10.3157/061.148.01102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Muzamil Syed10aFirst Record of the Genus Sathrophyllia Stal, 1874 (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae: Pseudophyllinae) from Western Himalaya (Jammu and Kashmir), India.  ap. 181-185.  aThe present paper includes a new record of the genus SathrophylliaStal, 1874 from Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir India, Sathrophyllia rugosa Linnaeus, 1758, the first record of genus Sathrophyllia from Western Himalaya and belonges to the tribe Cymatomerini Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1895 which are commonly called dark katydids.

We show for the first time that local extrema of the wind stress curl (WSC), generated by orography and ocean‐atmosphere interactions, help regulate circulation in the northern North Sea. While calculated transports are strongly coupled with wind stress, which itself is driven by large‐scale forcing, transports through the Norwegian Trench have higher correlations with the WSC field due to local extrema. Such WSC extrema regulate the eddy activity around the Norwegian Trench. We conclude that orography and ocean‐atmosphere interaction are two important mechanisms contributing to the generation of the WSC extrema around the Norwegian coast. Ocean‐atmosphere interaction is considered a potential mechanism developing the WSC extrema. Our results show that local winds are more important than previously documented, with important implications for regional circulation likely to result from future changes to local surface gradients, such as may arise from changing meteorological or hydro‐climatic forcing. These are additional impacts on North Sea circulation that may not be accounted for from changes in wind stress alone.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/P013902/1cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC) 3acoasts 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3awind stress 3aNorth Sea1 aPalmer, Matthew R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3227-042X1 aInall, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1624-42751 aBerx, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5459-24091 aPolton, Jeff1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0131-52500 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Mar., v. 127, no. 3 p.e2021JC018248-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC0182483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245008000168300001600248520092200264592002801186650002701214650002401241650002301265650001701288650001101305650001501316651001201331653001301343653001901356653002001375653001501395653001601410653002301426653001301449653002801462653002901490773011001519856007801629852000901707655001201716IND60127352620221120141659.0151110e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012735262DNAL7 a10.1653/024.096.03112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheffrahn, Rudolf H.10aOverview And Current Status of Non-Native Termites (Isoptera) in Florida §  ap. 781-788.  aThe origins and status of the non-endemic termite species established in Florida are reviewed including Cryptotermes brevis and Incisitermes minor (Kalotermitidae), Coptotermes formosanus, Co. gestroi, and Heteroterm.es sp.

Amature colony of an arboreal exotic, Nasutitermes acajutlae, was destroyed aboard a dry docked sailboat in Fort Pierce in 2012. Records used in this study were obtained entirely from voucher specimen data maintained in the University of Florida Termite Collection. Current distribution maps of each species in Florida are presented. Invasion history suggests that established populations of exotic termites, without human intervention, will continue to spread and flourish unabatedly in Florida within climatically suitable regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoptotermes formosanus 3aCryptotermes brevis 3aIncisitermes minor 3aNasutitermes 3ahumans 3apopulation 3aFlorida 0aIsoptera 0aKalotermitidae 0aRhinotermitidae 0aTermitidae 0anon-endemic 0aespecies invasoras 0aarbórea 0aembarcaciones de recreo 0ainspecciones reguladores0 tFlorida entomologist.g2013 Sept., v. 96, no. 3 p.781-788dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F024.096.03113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012800171300001400299520126700313592002801580650001201608650002001620650001801640650001801658650001001676650002501686650001401711650001401725650001701739653001701756653001301773653001801786653002401804700001901828700001701847773011001864856008501974852000902059655001202068IND60611110920221121135726.0180830e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061111092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2016.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlucinski, M.P.12aA methodology for comparing the relative effectiveness of suppressant enhancers designed for the direct attack of wildfires  ap. 71-79.  aSuppressant chemicals are often added to water for use in the direct attack of wildfires to extend the longevity and suppression effects of the water. There are a range of suppressants available, however there has been limited testing to determine which are the most effective. This paper presents an experimental methodology designed to enable the comparison of the relative effectiveness of wildfire suppressants applied in direct attack to fires in forest fuels. The method involves suppressants being applied onto the flaming fronts of standardised laboratory fires burning in uniform forest litter fuels within a wind tunnel through a pressurised system mounted above the burning fuel. The minimum volume of suppressant required to extinguish a standard fire is determined and used to quantify suppressant effectiveness. Examples of the method are presented for plain water and water with three types of wildland fire suppressant. Results show that repeated tests conducted with the same suppressants have low variability (coefficient of variation ~10.8%) and thus high reliability. In order to minimise effects of non-controlled variation in fire behaviour between tests, results can be normalised to produce relative values for comparison across datasets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3adata collection 3afire behavior 3aforest litter 3afuels 3afuels (fire ecology) 3alongevity 3awildfires 3awind tunnels 0aFirefighting 0aBushfire 0aDirect attack 0aAerial firefighting1 aSullivan, A.L.1 aHurley, R.J.0 tFire safety journal.g2017 Jan., v. 87 p.71-79dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2016.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245012300164300001600287520139500303592002801698650002101726650001701747650001001764650002501774650001401799650000901813650002401822650001701846650001101863650001501874650002201889650001301911650001201924650002001936651001201956653001701968653002501985653001702010653002202027653001702049653003202066653001702098653002102115700001702136700001902153700002402172773011002196856007802306852000902384655001202393IND60127352720221120151842.0151110e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012735272DNAL7 a10.1653/024.096.03122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeal, Dakshina R.10aAbundance of Adventive Thrips palmi (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) Populations in Florida During the First Sixteen Years §  ap. 789-796.  aThrips palmi Karny (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), invaded Miami Dade-county in 1990 and caused significant economic damage by defoliating various vegetable crops. It commonly occurs on the abaxial surface of host leaves where eggs are deposited individually inside the leaf tissues. Highest abundance of T. palmi was recorded on bean and eggplant in 1991–1994 in Tropical Research and Education Center research plots and commercial fields in MiamiDade County. Density of T. palmi decreased significantly in subsequent years after the use of spinosad and other effective chemical insecticides. Thrips palmi populations increased in 2008 in spite of use of spinosad and showed increasing pattern causing crops loss at economic level. Orius insidiosus Say population was low in both TREC research fields and commercial fields due to harsh chemical management program, where insecticides belonging to various chemical classes were used alone (TREC fields) or in combination (commercial fields) to control T. palmi and other insect pests. None of the commonly used available insecticides alone or in combination provided satisfactory control of T. palmi in the early stage of invasion. Amongst various insecticides tested spinosad provided significant control of T. palmi on the crops until 2008 after which there was reduced effect of the chemical due to frequent use for managing multiple pests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrius insidiosus 3aThrips palmi 3abeans 3aeducational research 3aeggplants 3aeggs 3afinancial economics 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3apopulation 3apopulation growth 3aspinosad 3atissues 3avegetable crops 3aFlorida 0amelon thrips 0apopulation abundance 0ainsecticides 0aminute pirate bug 0aThrips palmi 0aabundancia de la población 0ainsecticidas 0aOrius insidiosus1 aKumar, Vivek1 aKakkar, Garima1 aMello, Simone Costa0 tFlorida entomologist.g2013 Sept., v. 96, no. 3 p.789-796dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F024.096.03123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005300142245009100195300001600286520114000302592002801442650001301470650001301483650002201496650002401518700005001542700005701592700005501649700005701704700005901761700005801820700006001878700005101938700005301989700005602042773014402098856007602242852000902318655001202327IND60680976920221120180229.0200110e20191211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068097692DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b116972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2881-601510aTwo-Dimensional Organic–Inorganic Hybrid Rare-Earth Double Perovskite Ferroelectrics  ap. 545-551.  aAs a major branch of hybrid perovskites, two-dimensional (2D) hybrid double perovskites are expected to be ideal systems for exploring novel ferroelectric properties, because they can accommodate a variety of organic cations and allow diverse combinations of different metal elements. However, no 2D hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric has been reported since the discovery of halide double perovskites in the 1930s. Based on trivalent rare-earth ions and chiral organic cations, we have designed a new family of 2D rare-earth double perovskite ferroelectrics, A₄MᴵMᴵᴵᴵ(NO₃)₈, where A is the organic cation, Mᴵ is the alkaline metal or ammonium ion, and Mᴵᴵᴵ is the rare-earth ion. This is the first time that ferroelectricity is realized in 2D hybrid double perovskite systems. These ferroelectrics have achieved high-temperature ferroelectricity and photoluminescent properties. By varying the rare-earth ion, variable photoluminescent properties can be achieved. The results reveal that the 2D rare-earth double perovskite systems provide a promising platform for achieving multifunctional ferroelectricity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3anitrates 3aphotoluminescence 3arare earth elements1 aYe, Le1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3592-33021 aGong, Zhi-Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2587-83221 aMa, Jia-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8877-52431 aWang, Qin-Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0833-08751 aJiang, Jia-Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3866-14481 aHua, Miao-Miao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1914-84111 aWang, Chang-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6597-42181 aYu, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6024-15491 aZhang, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6375-17121 aYe, Heng-Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2276-68860 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Dec. 11, v. 142, no. 1 p.545-551dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b116973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009100157520140900248592002801657650002301685650001201708650002401720650001901744650001401763650002201777650002801799650001601827650001701843650001001860650002801870651001001898700001801908700001401926773012601940856007302066852000902139655001202148IND60651795620221119123507.0190712e20160413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065179562DNAL7 a10.3390/su80403622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Jizhong10aSolar Energy Block-Based Residential Construction for Rural Areas in the West of China  aBased on the Great Western Development Strategy and the requirement for sustainable development in the west of China, rural affordable housing, energy conservation, and environmental protection are becoming development standards in the construction field. This paper mainly explores an innovative, sustainable, residential construction method for rural areas in western China, particularly the integration of solar energy technology with modern prefabricated building techniques, formally named solar energy block-based construction. The conscious approach of using volumetric blocks provides superior adaptability and expansibility in integration with a steel structure, thereby reducing the construction time and cost. Allowing a wide variety of configurations and styles in the building layout, this approach can be customized to the end-user’s precise location and climate, making rural residential buildings much more flexible and modern. To take advantage of adequate solar energy resource in western China, the blocks are associated with active and passive solar energy technologies, thereby reducing pollution, mitigating global warming, and enhancing sustainability. Therefore, we concluded that solar energy block-based construction could bring significant benefits to the environment, economy, and society. It could also promote sustainable development in the rural regions of western China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordable housing 3aclimate 3aenergy conservation 3aglobal warming 3apollution 3apollution control 3aprefabricated buildings 3arural areas 3asolar energy 3asteel 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aChen, Huixian1 aZhu, Ting0 tSustainability.g2016 Apr. 13, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80403623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245015000177300001400327500002000341520121900361592002801580650002601608650002401634650002501658650002301683650001201706650002101718650001101739650002201750650001101772650001201783650002301795650002201818773011901840856009001959852000902049655001202058IND60682549420221118030713.0200130e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068254942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.1989.tb00069.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnania, Giovanni10aWelfare Implications of a Preferential Tariff Reduction for Agricultural Exports from Less Developed Countries vs. a Generalized Tariff Reduction  ap. 23-48.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe paper presents the results of a theoretical study focusing on a comparative evaluation of the welfare effects of a preferential tariff reduction for agricultural exports from less developed countries versus a generalized tariff reduction. The results are derived using a diagrammatic approach. The analysis is developed within a partial equilibrium framework with one commodity, three large countries (importing developed country, exporting developed country, developing country), fixed exchange rates and zero transportation costs. The theoretical model makes provisions for a country to switch from being an exporter to being an importer, or vice versa, as the equilibrium price changes. Three alternative policy scenarios are analyzed: the imposition of a non‐discriminatory tariff, a preferential tariff reduction, and a generalized tariff reduction. Two alternative definitions of the welfare functions are used. One is based on consumers' and producers' surplus, the other adds domestic income and changes in foreign exchange earnings/expenditure. Some methodological implications of the specific model used are discussed, along with the impact, in terms of welfare, of the policy scenarios considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural products 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aeconometric models 3aexports 3aforeign exchange 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aprices 3atariffs 3atheoretical models 3awelfare economics0 tAgricultural economics.g1989 Mar., v. 3, no. 1 p.23-48dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.1989.tb00069.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006900139245007300208300001600281500002000297520133200317592002801649650001601677650003001693650001101723651001101734651000901745651002401754651001501778651002501793700006001818700006101878700005901939700006201998773010202060856007402162852000902236655001202245IND60787258920221121201127.0220808e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078725892DNAL7 a10.1002/tax.126002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzitto‐Tripp, Erin A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9340-872310aRevised classification of Acanthaceae and worldwide dichotomous keys  ap. 103-153.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAcanthaceae are among the most taxonomically diverse, geographically widespread, and morphologically and ecologically variable lineages of flowering plants. Most modern workers have estimated more than 4000 species and potentially more than 5000 species worldwide, thus placing Acanthaceae among the 12 or so most diverse families of angiosperms. This diversity is marked by exceptional morphological variation, particularly with respect to floral forms, growth forms, and pollen types. The present work represents a synthesis of knowledge generated over the past two decades on the taxonomy and systematics of this complex plant family. We place all 191 accepted genera within a revised classification of the family. Dichotomous keys (nine in total) to recognize the major lineages of Acanthaceae are presented together with geographically partitioned keys to all genera, covering (a) Africa, Madagascar, the Mediterranean region, and Arabia; (b) Asia and Australasia; and (c) the Americas. Finally, we validate several new tribes, subtribes, and genera, and provide new combinations for species where generic delimitation has changed. Our hope is that the present contribution serves to benefit future research on the systematics of Acanthaceae and provides a foundation upon which future classification efforts can be built.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthaceae 3ageographical distribution 3apollen 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aAustralasian region 3aMadagascar 3aMediterranean region1 aDarbyshire, Iain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5514-95611 aDaniel, Thomas F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4497-05061 aKiel, Carrie A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6773-25191 aMcDade, Lucinda A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6504-87750 tTaxon.g2022 Feb., v. 71, no. 1 p.103-153dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:1964x0040-02627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tax.126003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010800173300001600281500001900297520153300316592002801849650002001877650001201897650003101909650001401940650001901954650001101973650001401984650002201998650002302020650001202043650002002055650001802075650001102093650004302104650002102147650001202168650001302180650002102193650001302214650001102227650001102238653003402249653003202283653000902315700001902324773013502343856008602478852000902564655001202573IND60695359520221120050443.0200516e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069535952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Hsiao-Chien10aCharacterization of guava (Psidium guajava Linn) seed polysaccharides with an immunomodulatory activity  ap. 511-520.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo clarify the property of a novel guava seed polysaccharide (GSPS), GSPS was subjected to purify using Sepharose 6B gel filtration chromatography and further characterize the property of each individual isolated fraction. GSPS further resolved into three purified fractions, guava seed polysaccharide fraction 1 (GSF1), GSF2 and GSF3. Isolated GSF1, GSF2 and GSF3 were respectively subjected to high performance size exclusion chromatography; molecular weights of three polysaccharide fractions were determined. GSPS, GSF1, GSF2 and GSF3 were suggested to be proteopolysaccharides or glycoproteins. GSPS, GSF1, GSF2 and GSF3, particularly GSF3, were found to have a Th2-inclination property and anti-inflammatory potential. Heated GSF3 did not significantly (P > .05) decreased its immunomodulatory activity, suggesting that GSF3 is a proteopolysaccharide. The deproteinated GSF3 markedly lost its immunomodulatory activity, suggesting that both protein and carbohydrate moiety in GSF3 are essential to its immunomodulatory function. Analyses of monosaccharides composition in GSF3 using a pre-column derivatization high performance liquid chromatography exhibited that GSF3 was composed of glucuronic acid (3.28%), galacturonic acid (28.13%), galactose (14.88%), mannose (3.96%), glucose (22.99%), arabinose (7.31%), ribose (1.55%), xylose (14.81%), fucose (1.68%) and rhamnose (1.43%). Overall, we evidence that GSF3 is a low molecular weight proteopolysaccharide with potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsidium guajava 3aagarose 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarabinose 3aderivatization 3afucose 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3agel chromatography 3aglucose 3aglucuronic acid 3aglycoproteins 3aguavas 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimmunomodulators 3amannose 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3arhamnose 3aribose 3axylose 0aMolecular weight distribution 0aMonosaccharides composition 0aGSF31 aLin, Jin-Yuarn0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 July 01, v. 154 p.511-520dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245010800203300001800311520100800329592002801337596004301365596005501408596013301463596005901596596005901655596005901714596006601773596006901839596014001908596007102048596006602119650002302185650001002208650002402218650001002242650004302252650001502295650001302310650001302323650003302336650002602369650002302395700001502418700001802433700001502451700001802466700001602484700001302500700001702513700001602530700001902546773014502565856008202710852000902792655001202801IND60685832720221117211137.0200310e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068583272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10379-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3555-792010aOverexpression of global regulator LaeA increases secondary metabolite production in Monascus purpureus  ap. 3049-3060.  aMonascus is a filamentous fungus that produces several secondary metabolites. Here, we investigated the effects of the global regulator LaeA on the synthesis of pigments and monacolin K in Monascus purpureus with spectrophotometer and HPLC methods. The LaeA gene was isolated from M. purpureus M1 to create an overexpression construct. An LaeA-overexpressing strain L3 was with 48.6% higher monacolin K production than the M1 strain. The L3 strain also produced higher Monascus pigments than the M1 strain. SEM showed that LaeA overexpression resulted in altered mycelial morphology. Compared with the M1 strain, the L3 strain expressed higher levels of monacolin K synthesis-related genes mokA, mokB, mokE, and mokH. Overall, these results suggest that LaeA plays a role in regulating the production of secondary metabolites and mycelial growth in Monascus. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of the LaeA gene on the secondary metabolites of M. purpureus.  aPublisher supplied data  aZ181100006218021cBeijing Nova Program  aKZ201810011015cBeijing Natural Science Foundation  aCIT&TCD201804023cSupport Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five--year Plan  a31301411cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31571801cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31401669cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFD0400802cNational Key Research and Development Program  a2016YFD0400502-02cNational Key Research and Development Program  aPXM 2016-014213-000034cThe construct of innovation service ability--Science and technology achievement transformation--Upgrade project  aZ171100002217019cBeijing Municipal Science and Technology Project  a2016000020124G025cBeijing Excellent Talents Training Project 3aMonascus purpureus 3afungi 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alovastatin 3amycelium 3apigments 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asecondary metabolites 3aspectrophotometers1 aZhang, Han1 aZhu, Qianqian1 aHao, Shuai1 aChai, Shiyuan1 aLi, Yinghui1 aJiao, Zi1 aShi, Jiachen1 aSun, Baoguo1 aWang, Chengtao0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Apr., v. 104, no. 7 p.3049-3060dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10379-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009500158300002000253500001500273520047400288592002800762650001300790650002300803650001500826650002100841650001700862650002100879650001100900653002300911700002500934700001700959700001600976700001400992700001501006700002101021700001601042773013701058856007401195852000901269655001201278IND60616629620221121182842.0181018e20180911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061662962DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc04070b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaba, Daisuke10aElectrochemical deposition of large-sized mesoporous nickel films using polymeric micelles  ap. 10347-10350.  a2019-12-06  aStable mesoporous nickel (Ni) films can be prepared using polystyrene-b-poly-(oxyethylene) (PS-b-PEO) micelles as sacrificial templates.

Using Caenorhabditis elegans as an animal model, we investigated the effect of GO exposure on protein-protein interactions. In nematodes, NLG-1/Neuroligin, a postsynaptic protein, acted only in the neurons to regulate the GO toxicity. In the neurons, DLG-1, a PSD-95 protein, and MAGI-1, a S-SCAM protein, were identified as the downstream targets of NLG-1 in the regulation of GO toxicity. PKC-1, a serine/threonine protein kinase C, further acted downstream of neuronal DLG-1 and MAGI-1 to regulate the GO toxicity. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the protein-protein interaction between NLG-1 and DLG-1 or MAGI-1. After GO expression, this protein-protein interaction between NLG-1 and DLG-1 or MAGI-1 was significantly inhibited. Therefore, our data raised the evidence to suggest the potential of GO exposure in disrupting protein-protein interactions in organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aanimal models 3agraphene oxide 3ananomaterials 3aneurons 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein kinase C 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aserine 3athreonine 3atoxicity 0aGraphene oxide 0aNLG-1/Neuroligin 0aProtein-protein interaction 0aCaenorhabditis elegans1 aChen, He1 aYang, Yunhan1 aWu, Qiuli1 aWang, Dayong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4656-74270 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 700 p.134492-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1344923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100004200145245012900187300001800316500002000334520157900354592002801933650001101961650002701972650001401999650001402013650001902027650001102046650001402057650001202071650002202083650002102105650001202126650001302138650001502151650001402166650001102180650001102191700003802202700001902240700003502259700003002294773012502324856007902449852000902528655001202537IND60587343820221122092330.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058734382DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.137682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales‐Contreras, Blanca Elizabeth10aHusk Tomato (Physalis ixocarpa Brot.) Waste as a Promising Source of Pectin: Extraction and Physicochemical Characterization  ap. 1594-1601.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHusk tomato (Physalis ixocarpa Brot. var. Rendidora) waste was evaluated as a source of specialized pectin, and pectin extracted from this waste was characterized physicochemically. Fruit was blanched for 10 or 15 min and extracted in 0.1 N HCl for 15 to 25 min. Extracted pectin was subjected to physicochemical analysis. For all extraction conditions, the percentage of anhydrogalacturonic acid exceeded 60%, indicating that husk tomato was a good source of pectin. The degree of esterification of pectin molecules was 63% to 91%. The amount of extracted pectin decreased with increasing extraction time. The apparent viscosity of husk tomato pectin showed the characteristic behavior of pseudoplastic fluids. Neutral sugars were identified, and the amounts of 6 sugars (fucose, rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, and xylose) were quantified. Sugars identified in husk tomato pectin and present in the Rhamnogalacturonan I region, arabinose, galactose, and rhamnose suggest a highly branched structure, which will influence its future applications. Molecular weight values were 542 to 699 kDa, exceeding molecular weight values reported for commercial citrus pectins from 134 to 480 kDa. The extraction process significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the physicochemical properties of pectin. Up to 19.8% from the total amount of pectin in the husk tomato was extracted by 10 min of blanching and 20 min of a more heat treatment. Our findings indicate that husk tomato can be a good alternative source of pectin having highly distinctive physicochemical characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aPhysalis philadelphica 3aarabinose 3ablanching 3aesterification 3afucose 3agalactose 3aglucose 3ahydrochloric acid 3amolecular weight 3apectins 3arhamnose 3atomatillos 3aviscosity 3awastes 3axylose1 aContreras‐Esquivel, Juan Carlos1 aWicker, Louise1 aOchoa‐Martínez, Luz Araceli1 aMorales‐Castro, Juliana0 tJournal of food science.g2017 July, v. 82, no. 7 p.1594-1601dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.137683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003800152245010000190300001600290500001900306520118400325592002801509650002701537650002801564650002801592650001501620650002001635650002501655650001701680650001401697650002301711650001201734650001301746650001301759650002101772650001901793650004401812650001301856650001301869650002201882650001401904653002601918653001601944700003301960700003401993700002502027700002002052700003402072700003702106700004502143700003202188700003002220773013502250856008702385852000902472655001202481IND60695359620221119235035.0200607e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069535962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira Silva Ribeiro, Fábio10aAnti-proliferative profile of Anacardium occidentale polysaccharide and characterization by AFM  ap. 981-987.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper explores the application of cashew gum (CG) as an in vitro antiproliferative, firstly by isolating and characterizing the gum using elemental analysis, gel-permeation chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The molar mass of isolated CG was in the order of 10³–10⁴ g/mol, with small protein traces present. Polymer characterization by NMR identified key signals correlating to galactose, glucose, rhamnose and acid-related groups. Three distinct conformational stages were observed by AFM. The impact of CG on cell morphology and viability with both tumor and non-tumor cell lines was studied by AFM and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazole)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay respectively. Antiproliferative activity was confirmed for HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma), B16F10 (melanoma) and HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia) cancer cell lines. A change in cell morphology was demonstrated as an increased surface roughness for HL60. Considering that a CG does not exhibit cytotoxicity to non-tumor lines, it can be seen that the CG shows selectivity for tumor cells and can be a promising biomaterial for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardium occidentale 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiocompatible materials 3acashew gum 3acell structures 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3agalactose 3agel chromatography 3aglucose 3aleukemia 3amelanoma 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3arhamnose 3asurface roughness 3aviability 0aCytotoxicity in vitro 0aBiomaterial1 ade França Dourado, Flaviane1 aSilva, Maria Francilene Souza1 aBrito, Lucas Moreira1 aPessoa, Claudia1 ade Lima, Laís Ramos Monteiro1 ade Paula, Regina Célia Monteiro1 ade Souza de Almeida Leite, José Roberto1 ade Araújo, Alyne Rodrigues1 ada Silva, Durcilene Alves0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 156 p.981-987dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008600161300001600247520088500263592002801148596009101176596012301267596012001390650001801510650003201528650001101560650001301571650001001584650001301594650001301607650001401620650002201634650001301656700001701669700001701686700001301703700005501716773011301771856008301884852000901967655001201976IND60728035220221119093713.0211126e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072803522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-020-04951-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Siyi10aGenomic characterization of a nebovirus strain with a novel RdRp genotype in yaks  ap. 967-972.  aNeboviruses (NeVs) are important causative agents of calf diarrhea that belong to the family Caliciviridae. In this study, we investigated the genomic characteristics of a NeV strain from yaks that has a novel RdRp genotype. The complete genome of this strain (YAK/NRG-A9/19/CH) is 7454 nt in length and shares 68.3%-79.7% nt sequence identity with those of other NeVs. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of this strain shares 66.5%-78.5% nt sequence identity (74.0%-89.3% aa sequence identity) with the eight available complete NeV RdRp sequences, and a phylogenetic analysis based on these sequences showed that the new strain formed an independent branch, indicating that the RdRp of strain YAK/NRG-A9/19/CH may represent a novel RdRp genotype of NeV.

Both techniques offer several advantages over conventional extraction methods. These two alternatives have been separately employed on numerous ocassions, however, until now, they have never been combined for the extraction of secondary metabolites from natural sources, despite properties that complement each other perfectly. Herein, we present the first application of an IL-based dynamic supercritical CO₂ extraction of six cannabinoids (CBD, CBDA, Δ⁹-THC, THCA, CBG and CBGA) from industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.). Various process parameters were optimized, i.e., IL-based pre-treatment time and pre-treatment temperature, as well as pressure and temperature during supercritical fluid extraction. In addition, the impact of different ILs on cannabinoid extraction yield was evaluated, namely, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, choline acetate and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate. This novel technique exhibits a synergistic effect that allows the solvent-free acquisition of cannabinoids from industrial hemp, avoiding further processing steps and the additional use of resources. The newly developed IL-based supercritical CO₂ extraction results in high yields of the investigated cannabinoids, thus, demonstrating an effective and reliable alternative to established extraction methods. Ultimately, the ILs can be recycled to reduce costs and to improve the sustainability of the developed extraction process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3aacetates 3acarbon dioxide 3acholine 3agreen chemistry 3ahemp 3aionic liquids 3asecondary metabolites 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3asynergism 3atemperature1 aSainz Martinez, Aitor1 aSchnürch, Michael,1 aHalbwirth, Heidi1 aBica-Schröder, Katharina0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 Dec. 13, v. 23, no. 24 p.10079-10089dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc03516a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245007900179300001800258500000900276500001500285520175600300592002802056650001802084650001902102650001302121650001402134650001302148650002002161650002102181650002602202650001302228653001002241700001702251773012402268852000902392856009802401655001202499IND2043615720221117180101.0191122e199409  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204361572DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1994.0011183X003400050022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewald, C.

(Andropogoneae), are limited by scarcity of fertile female florets and excessive maleness in its monoecious inflorescence. Gynomonoecious variants, with sex reversal in formerly male spikelets and reactivation of suppressed female florets, are known that have a greater seed production potential than monoecious forms. Sexual reproduction is exclusively observed in diploid eastern gamagrass, whereas facultative apomictic reproduction is the rule in polyploid forms. This study was designed to combine recessive genes for gynomonoecy from diploids with genes for apomixis from polyploids to develop true breeding (apomictic), prolific seed producing (gynomonoecious) lines. Diploid parents with allele(s) for gynomonoecy were used in each of three generations of interploidy matings to transfer gynomonoecy from diploid to triploid eastern gamagrass. A first generation fertile triploid hybrid and a second generation BIII derived tetraploid hybrid were used as intermediates for genetic transfer. Ninety triploid progeny from the third generation of cytotype intermatings yielded three gynomonoecious individuals, one with relatively good female fertility and two that failed to set seed. The low percentage (3.3%) of triploid progeny that inherited the gynomonoecions trait indicates a strong selection force against gynomonoecy at the triploid level. The breeding strategy employed is considered a practical method to move genes from diploid to higher ploidy levels for subsequent stabilization by apomixis.

We measured total dissolved gas pressure, carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration, major ion concentration, isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ¹³CDIC), and other physicochemical parameters. CO₂ is the dominant dissolved gas in this lake and results mainly from carbonate dissolution during the interaction of acidic water with wall rocks, followed by diffusive and advective transport through the water column. The δ¹³CDIC values suggest that the biological contribution is comparatively small. Maximum CO₂ concentrations higher than 0.1 M (∼5000 mg/L) have been measured, which are only comparable to those found in volcanic crater lakes. The corresponding gas pressures of CO₂ alone (pCO₂ ∼3.6 bar) imply 60% saturation relative to local pressure at 50 m depth. High CO₂ concentrations have been observed in other pit lakes of the region. We recommend gas-specific monitoring in acidic pit lakes and, if necessary, the design of feasible degassing strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adissolved gases 3adissolved inorganic carbon 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aphysicochemical properties 3arocks 3aSpain1 aBoehrer, Bertram1 aYusta, Iñaki0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 48, no. 8 p.4273-4281dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50067973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003300113040001800146100002200164245011000186300001500296500001500311520193800326592002802264650001602292650001802308650001502326650002602341650001602367650002302383650002802406650001502434650001602449650003002465650001402495650001602509650002902525650002202554650002502576650002002601650001102621650001102632650002202643651001602665653001302681653001702694653001702711653001102728653002002739653001502759700002002774773010502794856011202899856008103011961001303092852000903105655001203114IND4438582020221121100139.0151127e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443858202DNAL7 a10113/434032hdl7 a10.1614/WT-D-09-00044.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, Krishna N.10aWeed Control and Yield Comparisons of Twin- and Single-Row Glyphosate-Resistant Cotton Production Systems  ap. 95-101.  a2019-12-06  aA 2-yr field study was conducted during 2007 and 2008 at Stoneville, MS, to determine the effect of twin-row (two rows 38 cm apart on 102-cm beds) and single-row (on 102-cm beds) patterns and glyphosate POST applications with and without fluometuron ++ S-metolachlor PRE on cotton canopy closure, weed control, and lint yield in two cultivars (‘‘DP117B2RF’’, early maturity, hairy leaf; ‘‘DP164B2RF’’, mid to full maturity, smooth leaf) under an irrigated environment. The experiment was conducted in a split––split plot arrangement of treatments in a randomized complete block design with row pattern as the main plot, cultivars as the subplot, and herbicide programs as the subsubplot. Cotton canopy closed 2 wk earlier in the twin-row pattern compared to the single-row pattern. Canopy closure was unaffected by cultivars and herbicide programs. Control of nine predominant weeds was sufficient (≥≥ 95%%) to support cotton production. Total weed dry biomass was reduced by 35%% in twin rows compared to the single-row pattern, 15%% in DP117B2RF compared to DP164B2RF cultivar, and ≥≥ 97%% with glyphosate early POST (EPOST), EPOST followed by (fb) mid-season POST (MPOST), EPOST fb MPOST fb late POST (LPOST) following PRE herbicides or three applications of glyphosate POST only without PRE herbicides compared to no herbicide. Cotton grown in twin-row pattern produced 6%% higher lint yield than single-row cotton. Cultivar DP117B2RF produced 23%% higher lint yield than cultivar DP164B2RF. Lint yields were higher with glyphosate EPOST fb MPOST, EPOST fb MPOST fb LPOST following PRE herbicides or three applications of glyphosate POST only without PRE herbicides (1,210 to 1,230 kg/ha) compared to glyphosate EPOST following PRE herbicides (1,130 kg/ha). These results demonstrated that cotton grown in twin-rows closed canopy early and produced higher lint yields than cotton grown in single-rows.  aPublisher supplied data 3afiber crops 3aplant density 3acrop yield 3afield experimentation 3afluometuron 3aGossypium hirsutum 3adry matter accumulation 3aglyphosate 3ametolachlor 3apostemergent weed control 3acultivars 3arow spacing 3apreemergent weed control 3airrigated farming 3aherbicide resistance 3acrop management 3acotton 3acanopy 3aeconomic analysis 3aMississippi 0awide row 0aweed control 0aweed biomass 0aCanopy 0aweed management 0apaired row1 aBoykin, J.

The successful incorporation of GO nanosheets into PCL polymer nanofibers improved the thermal and mechanical properties of the nanofibers because of the intrinsic properties developed due to the interactions of GO and PCL. In order to estimate the biocompatibility of PCL/GO composite scaffolds, mouse marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) and low-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12-L) cells were cultured. Initial adhesion and spreading of the mMSCs and PC12-L cells on PCL/GO composite scaffolds with moderate addition of GO (0.3 and 0.5 wt%) were significantly superior to those on pure PCL scaffolds, and the cells exhibited typical fibroblast- and neuron-like morphologies with obvious pseudopods and mature appearance, respectively. A small amount of GO did not restrain the proliferation and viability of the mMSCs and PC12-L cells, which indicated appreciable cell affinity of GO. Moreover, the hybridization of GO nanosheets and PCL polymer dramatically enhanced the differentiation of the mMSCs and PC12-L cells into osteo- and neuro-like cells, respectively. All these results suggest that PCL/GO composite nanofibers could be a promising alternative material as biocompatible scaffolds for tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiocompatibility 3abiocomposites 3acarbon 3acultured cells 3agraphene oxide 3amechanical properties 3amice 3ananofibers 3ananosheets 3apolymers 3arats 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3atissue scaffolds 3aviability 0aPolycaprolactone 0aGraphene oxide 0aElectrospinning 0aBiocomposite nanofiber scaffolds 0aCell behaviors 0aTissue engineering1 aGao, Huichang1 aZhu, Guanglin1 aCao, Xiaodong1 aShi, Xuetao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9919-89311 aWang, Yingjun0 tCarbon.g2015 Dec., v. 95 p.1039-1050dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245008600211300001200297520132400309592002801633650002401661650002701685650001601712650001901728650001501747650000901762650002001771650001101791650002201802650000901824650001701833653001001850653000801860653001501868653000801883653001501891653000801906653001201914700002801926700006701954773009602021856008102117852000902198655001202207IND60612006120221119164112.0210114e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061200612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2018.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrabb, Helen Kathleen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5550-383410aDoes only the age of the hen matter in Salmonella enterica contamination of eggs?  ap. 1-9.  aContamination of eggs with Salmonella enterica is a significant risk factor contributing to foodborne disease. Periods of peak egg contamination were identified by conducting longitudinal environmental and egg sampling in 7 layer flocks until they were 50 weeks of age. A total of 714 environmental samples and 8958 eggs were cultured using standard methods for the detection of salmonellae. Pooled egg contamination with Salmonella Typhimurium or Salmonella Infantis was detected at a true prevalence (TP) of 0.002 (95% CI = 0.001, 0.004) or 0.005 (95% CI = 0.004, 0.007), respectively. S. Typhimurium and S. Infantis were detected in individual egg components; in shell rinse at a TP of 0.014 (95% CI = 0.005, 0.038), in shell and membrane at a TP of 0.01 (95% CI = 0.003, 0.032), and in albumen and yolk content at a TP of 0.007 (95% CI = 0.001, 0.027). The concentration of salmonellae in all fractions was <1 CFU/mL. The TP of Salmonella enterica in eggs was highest at the onset of lay. Higher egg prevalence was associated with a lower body weight, higher egg production, higher egg weight and mass than the breed standard for age, and poorer feed conversion efficiency. Flock physiology appears to have an important influence on the detection of eggs contaminated with Salmonella enterica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Infantis 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3abody weight 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3afeed conversion 3aflocks 3afoodborne illness 3ahens 3arisk factors 0aLayer 0aEgg 0aSalmonella 0aAge 0aPrevalence 0aHen 0aChicken1 aGilkerson, James Rudkin1 aBrowning, Glenn Francis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0903-24690 tFood microbiology.g2019 Feb., v. 77 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2018.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245016200176300001600338500001900354500002000373520127800393592002801671650001601699650003701715650002201752650001101774650001301785650002601798700001501824700002001839700002201859700002201881700002001903773011901923856008802042852000902130655001202139IND60734356320221119102258.0210417e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073435632DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00912.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatia, Naveen P.10aElemental mapping using PIXE shows the main pathway of nickel movement is principally symplastic within the fruit of the hyperaccumulator Stackhousia tryonii  ap. 479-488.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Metal concentrations within reproductive tissues of metallophytes are rarely reported. Here, the spatial distribution of nickel (Ni) within the fruits (seeds) of the Ni hyperaccumulator Stackhousia tryonii was investigated. • Two microanalytical techniques, energy dispersive x‐ray spectrometry (EDXS) and nuclear microprobe (micro‐proton‐induced x‐ray emission spectrometry; micro‐PIXE) were employed for qualitative and quantitative assessment, respectively, of localized Ni, within the fruits of S. tryonii. The results were compared with quantitative analysis made using inductively coupled plasma‐optical emission spectrometry (ICP‐OES). • Nickel analysis made using micro‐PIXE was consistent with bulk (ICP‐OES) analysis (at 1800 µg g⁻¹ d. wt), however, a beam resolution of approx. 2 × 2 µm² allowed tissue localization. Nickel was partitioned to the fruit wall (pericarp) (4433 µg g⁻¹), while endospermic and cotyledonary tissues possessed little Ni (309 and 182 µg g⁻¹ d. wt, respectively). • This distribution is consistent with the interpretation that principal pathway of Ni movement within the fruit is symplastic rather than apoplastic (as the filial generation lacks symplastic connection with the parent).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahyperaccumulators 3anickel 3apericarp 3aquantitative analysis1 aOrlic, Ivo1 aSiegele, Rainer1 aAshwath, Nanjappa1 aBaker, Alan J.

BoNTs are released together with several auxiliary proteins as progenitor toxin complexes (PTCs) to become highly potent oral poisons. Here, we report the structure of a ∼760 kDa 14-subunit large PTC of serotype A (L-PTC/A) and reveal insight into its absorption mechanism. Using a combination of X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and functional studies, we found that L-PTC/A consists of two structurally and functionally independent sub-complexes. A hetero-dimeric 290 kDa complex protects BoNT, while a hetero-dodecameric 470 kDa complex facilitates its absorption in the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract. BoNT absorption is mediated by nine glycan-binding sites on the dodecameric sub-complex that forms multivalent interactions with carbohydrate receptors on intestinal epithelial cells. We identified monosaccharides that blocked oral BoNT intoxication in mice, which suggests a new strategy for the development of preventive countermeasures for BoNTs based on carbohydrate receptor mimicry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium botulinum 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3abotulinum toxin 3abotulism 3aelectron microscopy 3aintestinal mucosa 3amice 3amonosaccharides 3amuscles 3aparalysis 3apathogens 3apoisoning 3areceptors 3aserotypes 3atoxicity1 aGu, Shenyan1 aJin, Lei1 aLe, Thi Tuc Nghi1 aCheng, Luisa W.1 aStrotmeier, Jasmin1 aKruel, Anna Magdalena1 aYao, Guorui1 aPerry, Kay1 aRummel, Andreas1 aJin, Rongsheng1 aStebbins, C.

On mid—slopes where Abies grandis appears, and still higher in the mountains where Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, and Abies lasiocarpa occur, soil drouth appears to be of minor ecologic importance. In mesophytic forest areas early stages in secondary succession that are characterized by overly dense stands of slowgrowing individuals may develop intense soil drouth during this stagnation phase. On the upper parts of south—facing slopes, even high in the forested mountain, small parks with grassland climaxes containing Agropyron spicatum and Festuca idahoensis represent local areas of soil drouth comparable with that of steppe on the basal plain where the same grasses dominate. Climax vegetation types thus closely reflect soil moisture regimes, whereas altitude above sea level is very unreliable. Three grasses native to areas too dry for even the most xerophytic trees were found to germinate in autumn, develop slowly during the winter and so be sufficiently mature by early summer to endure several month of enforced aestivation. Trees, in contrast, do not germinate until spring and so are not far enough developed for their tap roots to descend more rapidly than the soil desiccates. Since they are incapable of enduring prolonged soil drouth they perish as the dry zone extends downward and overtakes their root tips.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies grandis 3aAbies lasiocarpa 3aFestuca idahoensis 3aPinus ponderosa 3aPseudoroegneria spicata 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aThuja plicata 3aTsuga heterophylla 3aaltitude 3aautumn 3aestivation 3aforests 3agrasses 3ahills 3aindigenous species 3amountains 3aparks 3aroot tips 3asecondary succession 3asoil water 3asoil water regimes 3aspring 3asteppes 3asummer 3atap roots 3atrees 3awinter 3aIdaho0 tEcology.g1968 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.431-438dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19341093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01544naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245011800157300001800275520033200293592002800625650002200653650001300675650001500688650000800703700002100711700012900732700014200861700001701003773012801020856007301148852000901221655001201230IND60658340720221119224022.0190817e20081202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065834072DNAL7 a10.1039/b814801e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSetaka, Wataru10aFormation of a stannylstannylene via intramolecular carbene addition of a transient stannaacetylene (RSnCR′)  ap. 6558-6560.  aPhotolysis of diazomethylstannylene [1, Me₃SiC(N₂)(Ar)Sn:, Ar = C₆H₃-2,6-Tip₂, Tip = C₆H₂-2,4,6-(i-Pr)₃] afforded unusual stannylstannylene 3via intramolecular carbene addition to an aromatic π bond of stannaacetylene 2; the structures of compounds 1 and 3 were fully characterized by X-ray crystallography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbenes 3aphotolysis 3atin1 aHirai, Katsuyuki1 aTomiokaPresent Address: Department of Applied Chemistry, Aichi Institute of Technology, Toyota, Aichi 470-0392, Japan, Hideo1 aSakamotoPresent Address: Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Shizuoka University, Suruga-ku, Shizuoka 422-8529, Japan., Kenkichi1 aKira, Mitsuo0 tChemical communications.g2008 Dec. 2, , no. 48 p.6558-6560dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b814801e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03667naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245018000202300001600382500002000398520186000418592002802278596004702306650002502353650000802378650002702386650001802413650001202431650002802443650001602471650002302487650002302510650002202533650002502555650001502580650000902595650001002604650001302614650002502627650003002652650001302682650001502695650003002710650003002740650003802770651001202808651001502820700001202835700001902847700002202866773013102888856007303019852000903092655001203101IND60616235420221120115728.0181015e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061623542DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.130642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLichtemberg, P.S.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3406-354X10aUsing Allele‐specific PCR for detecting multiple amino acid substitutions associated with SDHI resistance in Alternaria alternata causing Alternaria late blight in pistachio  ap. 506-512.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlternaria late blight caused by Alternaria alternata is a major disease affecting pistachios grown in California and to some degree those grown in Arizona. Alternaria alternata is prone to quick fungicide resistance selection when single‐mode of action fungicides are used. For the specific detection of five possible amino acid alterations associated with Alternaria alternata resistance to succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors used in California and Arizona pistachio orchards, we have designed five primer sets to be used as an allele‐specific PCR assay (AS‐PCR). Within a couple of hours from DNA extraction, the new specific‐primers amplify the different PCR product sizes, according to the chosen target, allowing their differentiation on gel agarose. In our study, the AS‐PCR assay consistently detected the mutations H277L and H277R at the AaSdhB gene, the mutations H134R and S135R at the AaSdhC gene, and the mutation D123E at the AaSdhD gene from A. alternata isolates collected from pistachio orchards in California and Arizona. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides a rapid and cost‐effective way to identify five different genotypes associated with Alternaria alternata resistance to succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors fungicides, used to control Alternaria late blight in pistachio. With the allele‐specific method developed here, users will be able to identify genotypes with nucleotide substitutions which lead to a reduced sensitivity or resistance selection using a one‐step PCR assay, without the use of restriction enzymes which elevates the reaction costs and the chance for errors. In addition, this study formally includes the identification and sequence accession for SdhB‐H277L and SdhC‐S135R amino acid substitution in A. alternata sampled from California and Arizona pistachio orchards.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia Pistachio Research Board (CPRB) 3aAlternaria alternata 3aDNA 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aPistacia vera 3aagarose 3aamino acid substitution 3aamino acids 3acost effectiveness 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afungicide resistance 3afungicides 3agels 3agenes 3agenotype 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aorchards 3apistachios 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aArizona 3aCalifornia1 aLuo, Y.1 aDoussoulin, H.1 aMichailides, T.J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2018 Nov., v. 67, no. 5 p.506-512dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.130643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013100163300001600294520102500310592002801335650002201363650001701385650002501402650001901427650001901446650001501465653003601480653001901516653002201535653001301557653001901570700001701589700001701606700001601623773009901639856008501738852000901823655001201832IND60733963020221120182908.0210506e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073396302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lu10aEffect of graphene oxide on early hydration and compressive strength of Portland cement-copper tailing powder composite binder  ap. 428-436.  aThe effect of graphene oxide (GO) on early hydration, compressive strength, hydration products and microstructure of Portland cement-copper tailing powder composite binder (CTB) were investigated by applying the isothermal calorimeter, compressive strength, X-ray diffraction analysis, thermos gravimetric and differential thermos analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that GO accelerated early hydration and shortened the reaction process of CTB. Moreover, GO was beneficial to the development of compressive strength of CTB specimens prepared with a lower w/b ratio. The addition of GO had limited influence on the quantity of the hydrates of all samples at 3 days. However, at 90 days, incorporating small dosage of GO in CTB could promote the hydration of copper tailing powder, and consumed Ca(OH)₂. The effect depended on the GO content, where excess GO could have a negative effect on hydration properties by changing the hydrates' morphology and making the spatial distribution uneven.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalorimeters 3acompression strength 3agraphene oxide 3amicrostructure 3atechnology 0aCopper tailing composite powder 0aGraphene oxide 0aHydration process 0aStrength 0aMicrostructure1 aLi, Qiaoling1 aSong, Junwei1 aLiu, Shuhua0 tPowder technology.g2021 July, v. 386 p.428-436dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009800177300001600275520163300291592002801924650002001952650001701972650001801989650001402007650003502021650001102056650002202067650001202089650001902101650001502120650001402135650002702149650001602176650000902192650001302201653003102214653003502245653002502280653001802305653002402323653001902347700001902366700001802385700006102403700001702464773011802481856008602599852000902685655001202694IND60628417920221120052943.0220816e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062841792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVēlāyutan̲, T. A.,10aHazardous contaminants in the environment and their laccase-assisted degradation – A review  ap. 253-264.  aIn recent years, owing to the serious ecological risks and human health-related adverse effects, the wide occurrence of hazardous contaminants along with their potential to enter the environment have gained great public concerns. In this context, significant actions are urgently required to tackle the ignorance and inefficient monitoring/removal of emerging/(re)-emerging contaminants (ECs) in the environment from different routes of concerns, i.e., industrial waste, pharmaceutical, personal care products (PCPs), toxic effluents, etc. Laccases are multinuclear copper-containing oxidoreductases and can carry out one electron oxidation of a broad spectrum of environmentally related contaminants. In biotechnology, this group of versatile enzymes is known as a green catalyst/green tool with enormous potentialities to tackle ECs of high concern. In this review, we endeavored to present up-to-date literature concerning the potential use of immobilized laccases for the degradation and remediation of various types of environmental pollutants present in the environment. Both, pristine and immobilized, laccases have shown great capacity to oxidative degradation and mineralization of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDs) in batch treatment processes as well as in large-scale continuous reactors. These properties make laccase as particularly attractive biocatalysts in environmental remediation processes, and their use might be advantageous over the conventional treatments. This review summarizes the most significant recent advances in the use of laccases and their future perspectives in environmental biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abiocatalysts 3abiotechnology 3aeffluents 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3ahumans 3aindustrial wastes 3alaccase 3amineralization 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3apersonal care products 3aremediation 3arisk 3atoxicity 0aEnvironmental contaminants 0aEndocrine disrupting chemicals 0aHazardous pollutants 0aBio-catalysis 0aImmobilized laccase 0aBioremediation1 aRasheed, Tahir1 aNabeel, Faran1 aIqbal, Hafiz M.N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4855-27201 aZhao, Yuping0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 234 p.253-264dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245011800195300001600313500002000329520196300349592002802312596004802340596006302388596005402451650002202505650001602527650002402543650001202567650003202579650002602611650001702637650001802654650001502672650001002687650001402697650001602711650002002727650001402747650002402761650001602785650001702801650001402818700001602832773013102848856007302979852000903052655001203061IND60616235520221120110525.0181015e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061623552DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.130572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazado, C.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2823-266910aPathogenic characteristics of Aeromonas veronii isolated from the liver of a diseased guppy (Poecilia reticulata)  ap. 476-483.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite the significant development on their diagnoses and control, aeromonad infection is still a problem in aquaculture. This study described the key bacteriological and pathogenic features of a presumptive Aeromonas sp. isolated from the liver of a diseased guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Molecular identification revealed that the isolate was an Aeromonas veronii (A. veronii PR). It was able to grow in a wide range of temperatures and salt concentrations, and was capable of auto‐aggregation and biofilm formation, with temperature as an influencing factor. Some of the extracellular enzymes that may be involved in its virulence include caseinase, gelatinase and lipase. The infection rate was relatively progressive, and fish with prior infection showed marginal resistance to secondary infection. Handling stress differentially influenced the infection kinetics at the early stages; however, the final mortality rates did not significantly differ between the groups. A comparative infection trial revealed that zebrafish (Danio rerio) were more susceptible to A. veronii PR than guppy. The presented intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing the pathogenicity of A. veronii PR lay the foundation for future research to better understand this pathogen in freshwater ornamental fish aquaculture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Aeromonad infections continue to affect the fish farming industry. Several new species of Aeromonads in freshwater ornamental fish have been identified in the last years. In this study, we have characterized an Aeromonas veronii isolate from a diseased guppy. The series of experiments identified the intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to the pathogenic characteristics of the isolate. It has been shown to be pathogenic to both guppy and zebrafish. The results offer foundational knowledge in the development of preventive and therapeutic measures to combat this pathogen in the ornamental fish industry.  aPublisher supplied data  cRamat Negev Research and Development Center  cCentral and Northern Arava Research and Development Center  cJacob Blaustein Center for Scientific Cooperation 3aAeromonas veronii 3aDanio rerio 3aPoecilia reticulata 3abiofilm 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aextracellular enzymes 3afish culture 3afish industry 3afreshwater 3aliver 3amortality 3anew species 3aornamental fish 3apathogens 3asecondary infection 3atemperature 3atherapeutics 3avirulence1 aZilberg, D.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2018 Nov., v. 67, no. 5 p.476-483dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.130573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01155naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245012300158300001800281520019300299592002800492650001400520650002300534650001200557650001700569650001800586700002200604700001600626773012900642856007300771852000900844655001200853IND60658340820221119224002.0190817e20081126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065834082DNAL7 a10.1039/b814804j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatō, Atsushi,10aPrimary amino acid lithium salt as a catalyst for asymmetric Michael addition of isobutyraldehyde with β-nitroalkenes  ap. 6242-6244.  aPhenylalanine lithium salt was found to be an effective catalyst for asymmetric Michael addition of isobutyraldehyde with β-nitroalkenes to give quaternary carbon-containing nitroalkanes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3alithium 3anitroalkanes 3aphenylalanine1 aYoshida, Masanori1 aHara, Shoji0 tChemical communications.g2008 Nov. 26, , no. 46 p.6242-6244dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b814804j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016600166300001400332500001400346520124700360536017901607592002801786596002201814596001601836650000901852650001601861650001801877650001501895650001301910650001601923650001301939650001501952650000901967650001101976650001001987653002401997653002302021653001702044653002602061700001902087773014302106856008502249852000902334655001202343IND60722357620210331000000.0210101e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072235762DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2019.17083332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yongli10aOptimal calculation of nitrogen recovery efficiency for obtaining high crop yield with low environmental costs in long-term wheat and maize rotations (2008-2014)  ap. 38-52.  aNAL-light  aQuantification of the recovery efficiency of applied N (REN) is essential for optimal N management in croplands. Our specific objectives were to test the feasibility of several new substitution methods for evaluating REN and to find an optimal method for evaluating REN for long-term crop rotations. The ratio method (RM), the soil N balance method (SNBM), and the traditional subtraction method (SM) were used to evaluate crop N utilization in a 7-year positioning wheat-maize rotation experiment. The SNBM obtained the highest value of cumulative REN (61.8–119.7%), followed by the RM (45.2–74.5%), and then by the SM (30.0–53.6%), under the annual N rates of 165–495 kg N ha⁻¹. The inter-annual variation in cumulative REN, as indicated by the coefficient of variation, was lower in SNBM (11.8–17.2%) and RM (12.2–19.6%) than in SM (27.2–35.1%). Both SM and RM based cumulative REN were negatively correlated with annual N rate, but not for SNBM-based REN. The SNBM-based REN was more sensitive to the change of crop yield and apparent N loss than the other two methods. The SNBM-based cumulative REN could be a promising method for evaluating crop N use due to its theoretical orientation for a sustainable soil N supply.  aThis work was supported by the Special funds for discipline construction [GAU-XKJS-2018-196];the scientific research start-up funds for openly recuited doctors [2017RCZX-33].  aPublisher supplied data  aGAU-XKJS-2018-196  a2017RCZX-33 3acorn 3acorrelation 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3acropland 3amethodology 3anitrogen 3aobjectives 3asoil 3asupply 3awheat 0arecovery efficiency 0asubtraction method 0aratio method 0asoil N balance method1 aYang, Xianlong0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 67, no. 1 p.38-52dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.17083333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245004900169300001600218520089500234592002801129650001501157650002101172650001001193650000901203650004101212650002101253650002201274650004001296650002201336651001801358700002101376700002301397700002601420773011601446856008301562852000901645655001201654IND60624125420221118212314.0181201e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062412542DNAL7 a10.1177/01154265060210055052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaloga, Gary P.10aTrans Fatty Acids and Coronary Heart Disease  ap. 505-512.  aEpidemiologic evidence has linked trans fatty acids (TFAs) in the diet to coronary heart disease in human populations. It has been estimated that dietary TFAs from partially hydrogenated oils may be responsible for between 30,000 and 100,000 premature coronary deaths per year in the United States. Although it is known that TFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (markers of coronary heart disease), there is little known about the mechanisms by which TFAs actually function at the cellular level. It is unknown what levels of TFAs are clinically significant and it is unclear how TFAs are associated with cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. We hypothesize that TFAs affect membrane structure, thus altering enzymatic pathways that may subsequently induce cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarrhythmia 3acoronary disease 3adeath 3adiet 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahuman population 3ahydrogenated oils 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3atrans fatty acids 3aUnited States1 aHarvey, Kevin A.1 aStillwell, William1 aṢiddīqī, Rafʻat,0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 21, no. 5 p.505-512dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01154265060210055053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013100171300001800302520176700320592002802087650001702115650002302132650001202155650002202167650001502189650001202204651001102216700002202227700001902249700002302268700001902291700002802310700002202338700002002360700002202380700002302402700002202425700001902447700002402466700002202490700002002512700001902532700002302551700002302574710002602597773011102623856008102734852000902815655001202824IND60523526020221122202003.0160623e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052352602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-016-1127-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNesshöver, Carsten14aThe Network of Knowledge approach: improving the science and society dialogue on biodiversity and ecosystem services in Europe  ap. 1215-1233.  aThe absence of a good interface between scientific and other knowledge holders and decision-makers in the area of biodiversity and ecosystem services has been recognised for a long time. Despite recent advancements, e.g. with the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), challenges remain, particularly concerning the timely provision of consolidated views from different knowledge domains. To address this challenge, a strong and flexible networking approach is needed across knowledge domains and institutions. Here, we report on a broad consultation process across Europe to develop a Network of Knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem services (NoK), an approach aiming at (1) organising institutions and knowledge holders in an adaptable and responsive framework and (2) informing decision-makers with timely and accurate biodiversity knowledge. The consultation provided a critical analysis of the needs that should be addressed by a NoK and how it could complement existing European initiatives and institutions at the interface between policy and science. Among other functions, the NoK provides consolidated scientific views on contested topics, identification of research gaps to support relevant policies, and horizon scanning activities to anticipate emerging issues. The NoK includes a capacity building component on interfacing activities and contains mechanisms to ensure its credibility, relevance and legitimacy. Such a network would need to ensure credibility, relevance and legitimacy of its work by maximizing transparency and flexibility of processes, quality of outputs, the link to data and knowledge provision, the motivation of experts for getting involved and sound communication and capacity building.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aecosystem services 3aexperts 3aissues and policy 3amotivation 3asociety 3aEurope1 aVandewalle, Marie1 aWittmer, Heidi1 aBalian, Estelle V.1 aCarmen, Esther1 aGeijzendorffer, Ilse R.1 aGörg, Christoph,1 aJongman, R.

Surprisingly, 100 nM hPTH38-84 and hPTH45-84 increased the accumulation of cAMP in osteoblasts treated with increasing amounts of hPTH1-84. Human PTH28-84 had no effects on cAMP activity alone or in combination with hPTH1-84. Conversely, 100 nM hPTH38-84, hPTH45-84, and hPTH28-84 blocked the activation of alkaline phosphatase activity by hPTH1-84.The data show that the short carboxyl-terminal hPTH peptides, hPTH38-84 and hPTH45-84, increase the amount of cellular cAMP generated in cultured osteoblasts in response to treatment with full-length hPTH1-84 when compared to full-length hPTH1-84 alone. Human PTH28-84 had no effect on cAMP activity alone or in combination with hPTH1-84. Human PTH28-84, hPTH38-84 and hPTH45-84 reduced the effects of hPTH1-84 in osteoblasts with respect to the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity compared to hPTH1-84 alone. Short carboxyl peptides of human PTH are biologically inert but when administered together with full-length hPTH1-84 modulate the bioactivity of hPTH1-84 in osteoblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abioactive properties 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amice 3aosteoblasts 3aparathyroid hormone 3apeptides 3arenal failure 3arenal function 3aresearch 0ahPTH1-84 0ahPTH28-84 0ahPTH38-84 0ahPTH45-84 0aCarboxyl-terminal hPTH peptides 0acAMP 0aMouse osteoblasts1 aSingh, Ravinder J.1 aCraig, Theodore A.1 aHines, Jolaine M.1 aKumar, Rajiv1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3497-30570 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 572 p.15-19dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.07.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012200168300001600290520157000306592002801876650002701904650002001931650002501951650002001976650001101996650001902007650003002026650001902056650001102075650002602086650001202112650001202124650001402136650001402150650001402164650001702178650001402195650001402209653002002223653002702243653003202270700002602302700002402328700002302352773009202375856008402467852000902551655001202560IND60547596920221117173430.0160903s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054759692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.2642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhini, Raquel10aElevated Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentration Increases Eucalyptus Plantlets Growth and Reduces Diseases Severity  ap. 206-207.  aThe impacts from elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations on forest systems have to be evaluated in order to develop adaptation strategies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of high CO2 concentration on eucalypt plantlets growth and on the severity of eucalypt rust (Puccinia psidii), Ceratocystis wilt (Ceratocystis fimbriata) and leaf-spot (Cylindrocladium candelabrum). The experiments for each pathogen were performed in open-top chambers (OTC) and closed chambers (CC). Two clones with different levels of rust resistance were studied in the experiments with rust and Ceratocystis wilt: a Eucalyptus urophylla x E. camaldulensis hybrid and an E. urophylla. For leaf-spot, seedling of E. urophylla were tested. The experiments were repeated twice. The plantlets were cultivated under ambient and high CO2 concentrations (ranging from 520 to 1,147ppm) for at least 30 days before the inoculation of the pathogens. High CO2 concentrations resulted in a decrease in diseases severity. Plant growth was stimulated by up to 23% in height and 26% in stem diameter in OTCs. Leaf area, dry matter mass and carbon content of the plants was greater at higher CO2 concentrations. In this study, increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2 favourably affected eucalypt growth and reduced diseases severity. This effect could potentially compensate for negative impacts from other environmental variables that are affected by climate change and should be considered in the development of adaptation strategies to address climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratocystis fimbriata 3aCylindrocladium 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3aPuccinia psidii 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3aclones 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3ahybrids 3aleaf area 3aleaf spot 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3aplantlets 3aseedlings 0aPuccinia psidii 0aCeratocystis fimbriata 0aCylindrocladium candelabrum1 aMacLeod, Rodrigo E.O.1 aSantos, Michelli S.1 aSilva, Carlos E.O.0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2015, v. 29 p.206-207dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.2643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014200169300001800311520055900329592002800888650001400916650002300930650002300953650001200976650001800988650001301006650001701019650002701036650001101063650001401074653002001088653002601108653001901134653002601153653001401179700001901193700002201212773008101234856008101315852000901396655001201405IND60551364720221117220846.0161018e20140603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055136472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirouzu, Hiroshi10aSynthesis of modified pyrimidine nucleosides via Vorbrüggen-type N-glycosylation catalyzed by 2-methyl-5-phenylbenzoxazolium perchlorate  ap. 3635-3639.  aSeveral acidic azolium salts prepared from oxazole, thiazole, and imidazole derivatives were investigated as catalysts in N-glycosylation reaction using a silylated modified pyrimidine and an acylated ribose or glucose to afford the corresponding pyrimidine nucleoside.

The present study aimed to assess trends and food sources of AS intake among a cohort of older Australians during 15 years of follow‐up. METHODS: Dietary data from participants of the Blue Mountains Eye Study (1264 men and 1614 women), aged ≥49 years at baseline, were collected. Dietary intakes were assessed at 5‐yearly intervals (1992–94 to 2007–09) using a 145‐item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). AS content of FFQ food items was estimated using a stepwise systematic method. Trends for AS intake between baseline and the three follow‐up periods were assessed using linear mixed modelling. RESULTS: In men, the mean (SEM) percentage of energy provided by AS intake (EAS%) declined from 10.4% (0.1%) at baseline to 9.4% (0.2%) at 15‐year follow‐up (Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.028). Women's mean (SEM) EAS% intake at baseline and 15‐year follow‐up was 9.2% (0.1%) and 8.8% (0.2%), respectively (Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.550). EAS% intake of men was significantly higher than that of women for 10 years (P < 0.05). Sugar products (table sugar, syrup, jam and honey) were the major sources of AS at all‐time points and contributed to more than 40% and 35% of AS intake in men and women, respectively. Intake of sugar products decreased in men during follow‐up (Pₜᵣₑₙd < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An overall downward trend was observed in AS intake in both genders, however, was only significant for men during 15 years of follow‐up. Table sugar and sugar‐containing spreads represent the major source of AS in this cohort of older Australians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3aelderly 3aenergy 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3ahoney 3amen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asugars 3asyrups 3awhite sugar 3awomen1 aLouie, J.

The study was conducted using a mixed-method sequential methodology, with a quantitative survey of 613 small rural and urban businesses in Israel, followed by 13 in-depth interviews with rural entrepreneurs who were selected from the quantitative sample. This study found an advantage of double-layered network embeddedness employed by rural business owners, i.e. both local and outside of the region, for the growth of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The contribution of this study is expansion of the concept of extra-local embeddedness to enhance growth of SMEs in rural-peripheral regions. The main theoretical contribution of this paper is the description of double-layered network embeddedness employed by rural business owners, who are embedded in local and regional networks, alongside extra-regional and national (extra-local) networks, in an attempt to overcome some of the distance-related obstacles of their location. Furthermore, our findings suggest that this type of embeddedness, as well as the embeddedness of family members in small businesses, can enhance the growth potential of the local businesses, as does the location of the business in the owner's home or in its close proximity. We propose a spatial model of the embeddedness of small rural businesses at various levels of proximity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentrepreneurship 3ahuman resources 3ainterviews 3amodels 3arural areas 3asmall and medium enterprises 3asmall businesses 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aIsrael 0aRural entrepreneurship 0aEmbeddedness 0aSmall businesses 0aActivity networks1 aFarja, Yanay1 aGimmon, Eli0 tJournal of rural studies.g2018 Aug., v. 62 p.174-182dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2018.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01783naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011100165300001400276520044600290592002800736650001300764650003100777650001100808650003200819650002400851650001700875650002200892653001700914653002100931653003300952653001400985700001400999700001501013700001801028700001801046700001901064700001901083700001901102700001901121700001601140773007601156856008401232852000901316655001201325IND60560459020221117225834.0170307e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056045902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2016.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hai10aNew phenylpropanoid derivatives from the fruits of Xanthium sibiricum and their anti-inflammatory activity  ap. 11-15.  aThe fruits of Xanthium sibiricum Patr yielded five phenylpropanoid derivatives, named as xanthiumnolics A–E (1–5).

Yet little is known about the processes that originated its remarkable richness of endemic species. Here we present results of a large‐scale survey of the genetic variation at the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of the pitviper, jararaca lancehead (Bothrops jararaca), and two closely related insular species (Bothrops insularis and Bothrops alcatraz), endemic of this region. Phylogenetic and network analyses revealed the existence of two well‐supported clades, exhibiting a southern and a northern distribution. The divergence time of these two phylogroups was estimated at 3.8 million years ago, in the Pliocene, a period of intense climatic changes and frequent fragmentation of the tropical rainforest. Our data also suggest that the two groups underwent a large size expansion between 50 000 and 100 000 years ago. However, the southern group showed a more marked signal of population size fluctuation than the northern group, corroborating evidences that southern forests may have suffered a more pronounced reduction in area in the late Pleistocene. The insular species B. alcatraz and B. insularis presented very low diversity, each one sharing haplotypes with mainland individuals placed in different subclades. Despite their marked morphological and behavioural uniqueness, these two insular species seem to have originated very recently and most likely from distinct costal B. jararaca populations, possibly associated with late Pleistocene or Holocene sea level fluctuations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBothrops jararaca 3aclimate change 3acytochrome b 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3ahaplotypes 3aislands 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3apopulation size 3asea level 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atropical rain forests 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aBothropsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCytochromes bxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrial 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 0aBrazil1 aMONZEL, MARKUS1 aECHEVERRIGARAY, SERGIO1 aBONATTO, SANDRO L.0 tMolecular ecology.g2006 Nov., v. 15, no. 13 p.3969-3982dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03057.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245005500179300001800234500000900252520116100261592002801422650001401450650001301464650002101477650002001498650001501518650001201533650001401545650003601559651001001595700001801605773012401623852000901747856009801756655001201854IND2043616620221117180111.0191122e199409  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204361662DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1994.0011183X003400050026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLingle, S.

The present study was conducted to determine (i) what changes sugar accumulation occur in individual internodes during ripening, and (ii) if changes in sucrose synthase (SS) activity accompany natural ripening in sugarcane. Sugar concentrations and SS activities were determined in elongating and sucrose-storing internodes of two sugarcane cultivars sampled at monthly intervals during the 1989–1990 and 1990–1991 harvest seasons in South Texas. Ripening was indicated by a decrease in elongation rate, increase in total sugar concentration, and increase in sucrose percent of total sugar over successive sampling dates. These changes occurred earlier and to a greater extent in ‘CP 70-321’, an early ripening cultivar, than in ‘LCP 81-10’, which ripens later in the season. The specific activity of SS did not change significantly during this same period. In this study, changes in SS activity did not appear to be related to ripening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3aripening 3asucrose synthase 3aenzyme activity 3ainternodes 3asucrose 3acultivars 3achemical constituents of plants 3aTexas1 aIrvine, J.

No pre-existing metal or semiconductor catalyst particles are required on the substrate prior to the deposition process. Instead, the in situ grown SiC crystallites serve as the catalyst for the growth of TGCs. Thanks to the easy formation of SiC on various substrates, the process is compatible with a wide range of substrates, i.e. Si, diamond, 2H–SiC, GaN, and SiO2, but not only limited to them. In addition to developing the approach, the mechanism for the formation of TGCs is also proposed. When Si is used as the substrate, the 3C–SiC crystallites grow epitaxially on the surface, which further initiate the epitaxial growth of graphene with its basal plane parallel to the {111} planes of 3C–SiC. The further expansion of graphene is constrained by the 3C–SiC crystallites, leading to the formation of curved graphene layers, i.e. onion-like or bowl-shaped graphene-based carbon. These curved graphene layers are believed to be the possible nucleation sites for the growth of TGCs. Inclusion of boron in the gas phase promotes the growth rates and the final yields of TGCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acrystallites 3agraphene 3asemiconductors 3asilica 3asilicon 3asilicon carbide 3avapors 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aSiC 0aGraphene 0aMetal-catalyst-free 0aMicrowave plasma chemical vapor deposition1 aYang, Bing1 aZhang, Lei1 aHeuser, Steffen1 aJiang, Xin0 tCarbon.g2015 Dec., v. 95 p.824-832dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007500156300001800231520145100249592002801700650001001728650002001738650003201758650001401790650001001804650001101814650001801825650001801843650002401861700002601885773013801911856007302049852000902122655001202131IND60535797320170606000000.0160805e20140506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053579732DNAL7 a10.1021/es404008g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Carla A.10aBioaccumulation of Perfluorinated Alkyl Acids: Observations and Models  ap. 4637-4648.  aIn this review, we consider the two prevailing hypotheses for the mechanisms that control the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs). The first assumes that partitioning to membrane phospholipids, which have a higher affinity for charged species than neutral storage lipids, can explain the high bioaccumulation potential of these compounds. The second assumes that interactions with proteins-including serum albumin, liver fatty acid binding proteins (L-FABP), and organic anion transporters-determine the distribution, accumulation and half-lives of PFAAs. We consider three unique phenomena to evaluate the two models: (1) observed patterns of tissue distribution in the laboratory and field, (2) the relationship between perfluorinated chain length and bioaccumulation, and (3) species- and gender-specific variation in elimination half-lives. Through investigation of these three characteristics of PFAA bioaccumulation, we show the strengths and weaknesses of the two modeling approaches. We conclude that the models need not be mutually exclusive, but that protein interactions are needed to explain some important features of PFAA bioaccumulation. Although open questions remain, further research should include perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) beyond the long-chain PFAAs, as these substances are being phased out and replaced by a wide variety of PFASs with largely unknown properties and bioaccumulation behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3abioaccumulation 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3ahalf life 3aliver 3amodels 3aphospholipids 3aserum albumin 3atissue distribution1 aHungerbühler, Konrad0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 May 06, v. 48, no. 9 p.4637-4648dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es404008g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007000169300001600239520183700255592002802092650002802120650001602148650001302164650002002177650001702197650001502214650001602229650001802245650002002263650001402283650002102297650001702318650002002335650002302355650002302378650001302401650001902414650001802433650001102451651000902462700002402471700001702495700001902512700002102531773011602552856008302668852000902751655001202760IND60624125620221118213109.0181201e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062412562DNAL7 a10.1177/01154265060210055182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseini, Saeed10aNutrition Status of Patients During Hospitalization, Tehran, Iran  ap. 518-521.  aBackground: We assessed the nutrition status of patients on admission and monitored changes during hospitalization at Shariatri Educational Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Methods: One hundred fifty-six randomly selected patients from 9 different wards were assessed. Body mass index (BMI) and body composition (based on bioelectrical impedance) were measured on admission and discharge. A questionnaire was also completed to evaluate general physical, psychological, and living status of the patients. Medical records were audited to identify when nutrition consultation, nutrition support, and nutrition-related laboratory factors (serum levels of total lymphocyte count [TLC] and albumin) were ordered. Frequency and paired t-test were used to analyze data. Results: Undernutrition (BMI <18.5 kg/m²) was present in 5.7% of the patients on admission, and severe undernutrition (BMI <16 kg/m²) existed in 0.6%. When discharged, 11% of patients were undernourished, and the prevalence of severe undernutrition increased to 1.3%. Average body weight and BMI decreased significantly during hospitalization (p < .001). Body composition analysis showed a significant reduction in body protein mass (p < .001). During hospitalization, body water percentile decreased and body fat percentile increased but not significantly. Only 1 patient was supported with parenteral nutrition (PN) and 1 with enteral nutrition. Orders for nutrition consultation were present in 1.9%, TLC levels in 10.8%, and serum albumin levels in 7% of the patient medical records surveyed. Conclusions: Undernutrition increased in patients during hospitalization. According to the low rate of nutrition-related orders, one potential cause of worsening nutrition status may be inadequate medical staff awareness about the importance of nutrition in hospitalized patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrical impedance 3ablood serum 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3abody protein 3abody water 3abody weight 3adata analysis 3aenteral feeding 3ahospitals 3alymphocyte count 3amalnutrition 3amedical records 3anutritional status 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3aserum albumin 3at-test 3aIran1 aAmirkalali, Bahareh1 aNayebi, Neda1 aHeshmat, Ramin1 aLarijani, Bagher0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 21, no. 5 p.518-521dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01154265060210055183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01077naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245005400157300001600211520021600227592002800443650002700471650001100498650001400509700001600523700001600539700002600555773012500581856007200706852000900778655001200787IND60658341020221119224249.0190817e20090204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065834102DNAL7 a10.1039/b814840f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chih-Hsiu10aIterative synthesis of acenes via homo-elongation  ap. 803-805.  aStarting from aromatic ortho-dialdehydes, we devised a homo-elongation protocol that combines a Wittig olefination and subsequent intramolecular Knoevenagel condensation to produce acene diesters and dinitriles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensation reactions 3aesters 3asynthesis1 aLin, Ke-Han1 aPal, Bikash1 aTsouDeceased., Li-Der0 tChemical communications.g2009 Feb. 4, , no. 7 p.803-805dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b814840f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010100162300001600263520087400279592002801153650001501181650001101196650004401207650001401251650002101265650001301286650001401299700002401313700002001337700002401357700002201381700002901403773010201432856007501534852000901609655001201618IND60534061920170629000000.0160802e20130221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053406192DNAL7 a10.1021/ef301588r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbosa, Lúcio L.10aApplication of Low-Field NMR for the Determination of Physical Properties of Petroleum Fractions  ap. 673-679.  aWe propose the use of the low-field ¹H NMR technique to predict various properties of petroleum fractions with °API ranging from 21.7 to 32.7. The experimental data obtained by standard methodologies (ASTM D-1218, D 445-06, D-664-06, D-2892, and D-4052) were correlated with the mean values of the ¹H transverse relaxation time in the range between 25 and 675 ms. Results of the present work showed good correlations between the NMR relaxation data with viscosity, total acid number, refractive index, and API gravity. The main advantage of the proposed method is its nondestructiveness, together with its speed and the fact that it does not require solvents/dilution. This allows the assessment of several properties of petroleum fractions simultaneously, based on the output of only one NMR experiment, leading to large economy in terms of energy, time, and costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid value 3aenergy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apetroleum 3arefractive index 3asolvents 3aviscosity1 aKock, Flávio

In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of NGO discourses in bringing about social change. We focus on animal advocacy: welfarist NGOs primarily seek to improve the conditions in which animals are raised and reduce meat consumption, whereas abolitionist NGOs categorically reject animal use and call for a vegan society. We design an experiment to study the respective impact of welfarist and abolitionist discourses on participants' beliefs regarding pro‐meat justifications and their actions, namely their propensity to engage in the short run in animal welfare (charity donation, petition against intensive farming) and plant‐based diets (subscription to a newsletter promoting plant‐based diets, petition supporting vegetarian meals). We first show that both welfarist and abolitionist discourses significantly undermine participants' pro‐meat justifications. Second, the welfarist discourse does not significantly affect participants' actions, although we detect a potential backlash effect of the abolitionist discourse. We show that the NGOs' positive standard effect on actions through the change in beliefs is outweighed by a negative behavioral response to the discourses (reactance effect). Last, greater public‐good contributions are associated with greater engagement in animal welfare in the presence of an NGO discourse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvocacy 3aagricultural economics 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3ameat consumption 3asocial change 3asociety 3avegan diet1 aTreich, Nicolas0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2021 Aug., v. 103, no. 4 p.1478-1501dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajae.121563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245018000171500001900351520090000370592002801270650001301298650001501311650002101326650002001347650001301367650001901380650001501399650001801414650002201432650001101454650002501465653004001490653002601530653002401556653002601580700001901606700001601625700001901641700001701660700001601677700001801693773009101711856009001802852000901892655001201901IND60702712020221121154946.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070271202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2020.1060452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Taeyong10aSimultaneous effects of silver-decorated graphite nanoplatelets and anisotropic alignments on improving thermal conductivity of stretchable poly(vinyl alcohol) composite films  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs), known as a thermally conductive and anisotropic carbon material, was used with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as matrix, which is a hydrophilic and biodegradable polymer. In order to expect enhanced thermal conductivity, silver nanoparticle-decorated graphite nanoplatelets (Ag-GNPs) were fabricated by adding silver acetate as a precursor using ‘mix-and-heat’ method. Polyvinyl alcohol composite films containing pristine GNPs and Ag-GNPs were prepared using solution casting method. The prepared composite films were uniaxially stretched to induce the filler alignment along the stretching direction as well as the strain-induced crystallization in polymer chains. The effects of the particle size of GNPs, the silver nanoparticle on the surface of GNPs, and the stretching ratios on the thermal conductivity of the composite films were investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanisotropy 3abiodegradability 3acrystallization 3agraphene 3ahydrophilicity 3ananosilver 3aparticle size 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asilver 3athermal conductivity 0aA.

In our study, we applied a set of different relative and absolute criteria to evaluate the performance of the model Assessment Tool for Metals in Soils. In this process, the uncertainty of the model output and the sensitivity of model parameters were also assessed. The study includes data from 123 agricultural used top soils which are characterized by the application of different fertilizers (mineral and farmyard fertilizers, sewage sludge) resulting in diverse metal inputs into the soil. Although the most common validation criteria (coefficient of determination, error ratio between prediction and observation) indicated a good model performance in predicting the metal contents over a simulation period, the absolute measure (mean absolute difference between prediction and observation) showed that the informational value of the validation results was limited for several sites. Therefore sites with short simulation periods and/or low metal inputs are not suitable for validation, because the model uncertainty covers the metal concentration changes. Excluding such sites from the validation statistics led to evaluable and quite better validation results. Although the calculated output uncertainty was low, a further reduction can be realized by improving the database for the identified sensitive parameters (initial soil metal content and fertilizers metal concentration).  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3afertilizer application 3aheavy metals 3amineral fertilizers 3amodel uncertainty 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3asewage sludge 3atopsoil1 aGäth, Stefan1 aJulich, Stefan0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2012 Sept., v. 223, no. 7 p.3589-3599dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-012-1083-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03881naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245013000211246005300341500001500394506007600409520207000485592002802555506003702583650002502620650002202645650001302667650001502680650001102695650001402706650001502720650001602735650001802751650001002769650001202779650001202791650001502803650001802818650001402836651001202850653001702862700001402879700002402893700002102917700002602938700002402964700002502988700002203013700002603035700003103061773007903092856008403171961001503255852000903270655001203279IND60121637320221207103614.0150316e20120621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012163732DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.ppat.10027862doi7 aPMC33809302pmcid7 a227370762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzmin, Ivan V.10aMolecular Inferences Suggest Multiple Host Shifts of Rabies Viruses from Bats to Mesocarnivores in Arizona during 2001–20093 aShifts of Rabies Viruses from Bats to Carnivores  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn nature, rabies virus (RABV; genus Lyssavirus , family Rhabdoviridae) represents an assemblage of phylogenetic lineages, associated with specific mammalian host species. Although it is generally accepted that RABV evolved originally in bats and further shifted to carnivores, mechanisms of such host shifts are poorly understood, and examples are rarely present in surveillance data. Outbreaks in carnivores caused by a RABV variant, associated with big brown bats, occurred repeatedly during 2001–2009 in the Flagstaff area of Arizona. After each outbreak, extensive control campaigns were undertaken, with no reports of further rabies cases in carnivores for the next several years. However, questions remained whether all outbreaks were caused by a single introduction and further perpetuation of bat RABV in carnivore populations, or each outbreak was caused by an independent introduction of a bat virus. Another question of concern was related to adaptive changes in the RABV genome associated with host shifts. To address these questions, we sequenced and analyzed 66 complete and 20 nearly complete RABV genomes, including those from the Flagstaff area and other similar outbreaks in carnivores, caused by bat RABVs, and representatives of the major RABV lineages circulating in North America and worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that each Flagstaff outbreak was caused by an independent introduction of bat RABV into populations of carnivores. Positive selection analysis confirmed the absence of post-shift changes in RABV genes. In contrast, convergent evolution analysis demonstrated several amino acids in the N, P, G and L proteins, which might be significant for pre-adaptation of bat viruses to cause effective infection in carnivores. The substitution S/T 242 in the viral glycoprotein is of particular merit, as a similar substitution was suggested for pathogenicity of Nishigahara RABV strain. Roles of the amino acid changes, detected in our study, require additional investigations, using reverse genetics and other approaches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconvergent evolution 3aRabies lyssavirus 3agenetics 3amonitoring 3arabies 3aphylogeny 3aChiroptera 3aamino acids 3apathogenicity 3agenes 3aviruses 3amammals 3acarnivores 3aglycoproteins 3apathogens 3aArizona 0aRabies virus1 aShi, Mang1 aOrciari, Lillian A.1 aYager, Pamela A.1 aVelasco-Villa, Andres1 aKuzmina, Natalia A.1 aStreicker, Daniel G.1 aBergman, David L.1 aRupprecht, Charles E.1 aSchnell, Matthias Johannes0 tPLOS pathogens.g, v. 8, no. 6dPublic Library of Sciencex1553-73747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.10027863Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/APHIS  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245014000169520137600309592002801685650001801713650002501731650002701756650001701783650001801800650001301818650001401831650002401845650001801869650001601887650002101903650001301924650001801937650002001955650001101975650001001986650000901996650001902005650001202024650002002036650000902056650003602065700002002101700002302121700002302144700003102167700002502198700002002223700002402243700002002267700002702287700002002314700002402334700003102358700002402389700001902413773012502432856007802557852000902635655001202644IND60702286620221122051212.0200717e20200324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070228662DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90302682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCentrone, Mariangela 10aIn Vitro and In Vivo Nutraceutical Characterization of Two Chickpea Accessions: Differential Effects on Hepatic Lipid Over-Accumulation  aDietary habits are crucially important to prevent the development of lifestyle-associated diseases. Diets supplemented with chickpeas have numerous benefits and are known to improve body fat composition. The present study was undertaken to characterize two genetically and phenotypically distinct accessions, MG_13 and PI358934, selected from a global chickpea collection. Rat hepatoma FaO cells treated with a mixture of free fatty acids (FFAs) (O/P) were used as an in vitro model of hepatic steatosis. In parallel, a high-fat diet (HFD) animal model was also established. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that both chickpea accessions showed a significant antioxidant ability. However, only MG_13 reduced the lipid over-accumulation in steatotic FaO cells and in the liver of HFD fed mice. Moreover, mice fed with HFD + MG_13 displayed a lower level of glycemia and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than HFD mice. Interestingly, exposure to MG_13 prevented the phosphorylation of the inflammatory nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) which is upregulated during HFD and known to be linked to obesity. To conclude, the comparison of the two distinct chickpea accessions revealed a beneficial effect only for the MG_13. These findings highlight the importance of studies addressing the functional characterization of chickpea biodiversity and nutraceutical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiodiversity 3ablood glucose 3abody fat 3achickpeas 3adietary supplements 3aeating habits 3afatty liver 3afree fatty acids 3ahepatoma 3ahigh fat diet 3ain vivo studies 3alipids 3aliver 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aobesity 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aGena, Patrizia 1 aRanieri, Marianna 1 aDi Mise, Annarita 1 aD’Agostino, Mariagrazia 1 aMastrodonato, Maria 1 aVenneri, Maria 1 aDe Angelis, Davide 1 aPavan, Stefano 1 aPasqualone, Antonella 1 aSummo, Carmine 1 aFanelli, Valentina 1 aValenti Nigrini, Giovanna,1 aCalamita, Giuseppe 1 aTamma, Grazia 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Mar. 24, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90302683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007800155300001800233500002000251520104400271592002801315650002701343650002101370650001301391650001601404650001101420650001901431650001201450650000901462650001601471651001301487773014601500856007401646852000901720655001201729IND60743128620221121000952.0210707e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074312862DNAL7 a10.1111/ajae.121992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yu Na10aDoes Aversion to Price Risk Drive Migration?

Moreover, the significant relationship between aversion to price risk and migration is more pronounced in villages that lack daily markets and food aid, implying that the negative welfare effects of food price volatility may be amplified by underdeveloped market mechanisms and poor local infrastructure. A battery of robustness checks and falsification tests provide strong suggestive evidence to conclude that migration is a household strategy to manage price risk. This article is among the first to highlight the link between price risk and migration, and complements the literature on income risk and migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3acommodity prices 3afood aid 3afood prices 3aincome 3ainfrastructure 3amarkets 3arisk 3auncertainty 3aEthiopia0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2021 Aug., v. 103, no. 4 p.1268-1293dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajae.121993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245010100163300001800264520106700282592002801349650001901377650001901396650001501415650001301430650001401443650001401457650002401471700001301495700001701508700001601525700001201541773009501553856008501648990002301733852000901756655001201765IND60098329320221120084717.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009832932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xu10aDistinctive microRNA signature associated of neoplasms with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway  ap. 2805-2811.  aAs the crucial biological regulators, microRNAs that act by suppressing their target genes are involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes. It is generally accepted that microRNAs are often dysregulated in many types of neoplasm and other human diseases. In neoplasm, microRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. As constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is a common feature of neoplasm and contributes to its development, progression and metastasis in various cancers, numerous studies have revealed that microRNA-mediated gene regulation are interconnected with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, forming a Wnt/β-catenin–microRNA regulatory network, which is critical to successful targeting of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway for oncotherapy. In this review, we aim to accumulate recent advances on microRNAs that work in tandem with Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumorigenesis, with particular focus on how microRNAs affect Wnt/β-catenin activity as well as how microRNAs are regulated through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3ahuman diseases 3ametastasis 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3asignal transduction1 aHe, Yong1 aHuang, Cheng1 aMa, Tao-Tao1 aLi, Jun0 tCellular signalling.g2013 Dec., v. 25, no. 12 p.2805-2811dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.09.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014200170300001600312500001900328520158100347592002801928650001901956650001601975650001601991650001202007650003602019650002502055650000902080650001402089650001302103650001502116650001702131650002002148650001402168650002402182650001302206650001602219650001202235650001302247650002502260650001402285650000902299653002602308653001702334700002002351773012302371856008502494852000902579655001202588IND60722356520221118215414.0210101e20210225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072235652DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2020.18453672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsgari, Farzad10aEffects of silicon on some morphological and physiological traits of rose (Rosa chinensis var. minima) plants grown under salinity stress  ap. 536-549.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMiniature rose (Rosa chinensis) is an ornamental and commercial plant having many applications, especially in green space design. One of the major environmental factors limiting the cultivation of this plant is salinity. This study investigated the effect of silicon application on the morphological and physiological responses of miniature rose under the salinity stress conditions in 2018. A factorial experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replications. Experimental factors were including the salinity (0, 3 and 6 m mos/m) and silicone fertilizer (0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/L nano silicon, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/L potassium silicate). The results indicated that salinity stress leads to a significant reduction in the plant height, leaf area, vase life, fresh weight of the plant, number of flowers, stem diameter, peduncle, open flower diameter, flower life on plants and chlorophyll a and b concentrations. Under the salinity of 6 dS/m without applying silicon, the activity of glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase enzymes was 2.44 and 2.25 fold with respect to the control, respectively. Upon applying the silicon treatment, the concentration decrement of potassium, phosphorous, iron and zinc was reduced in the shoots of rose. Application of potassium silicate and nano silicon at concentrations of 1000 mg/L had the greatest effect on the improvement of studied traits. Therefore, adding the silicate fertilizers to saline soils can reduce the negative effects of salinity stress on the miniature rose plant var. minima.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa chinensis 3achlorophyll 3afertilizers 3aflowers 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3agreen infrastructure 3airon 3aleaf area 3apeduncle 3aphosphorus 3aplant height 3aplant nutrition 3apotassium 3apotassium silicates 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asilicon 3asilicone 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avase life 3azinc 0aglutathione reductase 0anano silicon1 aDiyanat, Marjan0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2021 Feb. 25, v. 44, no. 4 p.536-549dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2020.18453673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245013900207300001600346500002000362520170200382592002802084650004402112650002402156650002902180650001702209650002202226650001002248650000902258650000902267650001302276650001302289650001802302650000702320650001302327650001702340650003702357650002102394700001602415773013102431856007302562852000902635655001202644IND60616234720221120065216.0181015e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061623472DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.130552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel‐Kareem, M.

Biological method for synthesis of AuNPs by Trichoderma hamatum SU136 aqueous mycelial extract was achieved. The culture filtrate of the fungus was exposed to three different concentrations of gold chloride. The culture filtrate of the fungus was exposed to three different concentrations of gold chloride (0·25, 0·5 and 1·0 mmol l⁻¹). In all cases, the gold ions (Au³⁺) were reduced to Au⁰, leading to the formation of stable AuNPs. The AuNPs were identified by UV–visible spectrometry, TEM and FT‐IR. The presence of a surface plasmon band around 530 nm indicates AuNPs synthesis. Trichoderma hamatum SU136 synthesized 5–30 nm sized; spherical, pentagonal and hexagonal morphologies of AuNPs by TEM. The existence and binding of proteins with nanoparticles was approved by FT‐IR study. Parameters optimization showed the smallest size of AuNPs was obtained with (0·5 mmol l⁻¹ gold chloride, pH 7 at 38°C). Interestingly, AuNPs exhibited antimicrobial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains in the presence of the standard antibiotic, streptomycin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mycosynthesis of AuNPs by Trichoderma hamatum would provide some useful data for oriented biosynthesis of AuNPs. In addition, the applications of mycosynthesized AuNPs were studied against some pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, the gained results detect that these antimicrobial nanoparticles could be explored as hopeful candidates for a variety of biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. This study should provide a further prudence for the fungal‐mediated synthesis of AuNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aTrichoderma hamatum 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiosynthesis 3aculture filtrates 3afungi 3agold 3aions 3amycelium 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aproteins 3astreptomycin 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avirulent strains1 aZohri, A.A.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2018 Nov., v. 67, no. 5 p.465-475dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.130553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245020500154300001600359500002000375520115700395592002801552650002801580650001901608650002801627650001801655650001701673650001801690650001401708650001401722650002501736650002601761650001801787700002301805700001801828700001701846700001801863773012201881856007302003852000902076655001202085IND60572152020221120084548.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057215202DNAL7 a10.1111/jhn.124152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnvani, S.10aAdherence to the Healthy Eating Index and Alternative Healthy Eating Index dietary patterns and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease and cancer: a meta‐analysis of observational studies  ap. 216-226.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: This meta‐analysis investigated the association of diet quality indices, as assessed by HEI and AHEI, and the risk of all‐cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. METHODS: We used PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar to search for eligible articles published before July 2015. A total of 12 cohort studies (38 reports) and one cross‐sectional study (three reports) met the inclusion criteria and were included in our meta‐analysis. RESULTS: The highest level of adherence to the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of all‐cause mortality [relative risk (RR) = 0.77, 95% confidence intterval (CI) = 0.76–0.78], cardiovascular mortality (RR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.74–0.80) and cancer mortality (RR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.81–0.86). Egger regression tests provided no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that high adherence to HEI and AHEI dietary patterns, indicating high diet quality, are associated with reduced risk of all‐cause mortality (as well as cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality).  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular diseases 3acohort studies 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3ahealthy diet 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3anutritional adequacy 3aobservational studies 3arelative risk1 aHaghighatdoost, F.1 aSurkan, P.

In these products, the lipid materials are present in rather complicated physical states such as mixtures of solid and liquid lipids or emulsified with water phases. In addition, various external influences are applied during actual production in a factory.

The objective of this research was to characterize canopy development and yield of two cotton leaf types grown in varying plant population densities. Field experiments were conducted in 1991, 1992, and 1993 with both the okra-leaf (low LAI) and normal-leaf (high LAI) isolines of ‘DES 24-8ne’ cotton with selected plant population densities (5, 10, and 15 plants m⁻²). Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) interception (1991–1992) LAI (1991–1993) were determined periodically and final lint yield was determined at maturity. Averaged across years, yields of okra-leaf in narrow rows were 6 to 7% greater at 10 and 15 plants m⁻² than at 5 plants m⁻². In 1991 and 1992, early-season PPFD interception of okra-leaf at 10 and 15 plants m⁻² was greater than at 5 plants m⁻². In 1992 and 1993, okra-leaf at 10 and 15 plants m⁻² attained an LAI of 4.0 to 4.5 whereas the 5 plants m⁻² density failed to reach 4.0. Therefore, both PPFD interception and LAI limited yield of okra-leaf at 5 plants m⁻². In contrast to okra-leaf, lint yields of normal-leaf were 4 to 8% greater at 5 plants m⁻² than at 10 and 15 plants m⁻². In 1991 and 1992, the lower yields of normal-leaf at 10 and 15 plants m⁻² were apparently associated with late-season LAI values of 5.0 or greater, whereas the 5 plants m⁻² density developed late-season LAI values ranging from 4.0 to 4.8. These findings indicate that (i) optimal plant density was higher for okra-leaf than for normal-leaf and (ii) a maximum LAI between 4.0 and 5.0 was required to maximize cotton lint yields in this environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3asolar radiation 3alint cotton 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aleaf area index 3aplant density 3acrop yield 3agenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant morphology 3aleaves 3aMississippi 0apopulation density0 tCrop science.g1994 Sept., v. 34, no. 5 p.1291-1297dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1994.0011183X003400050028x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02605naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011100151300001600262500002000278520115300298592002801451650002501479650001501504650001101519650001401530650001201544650001001556650002001566650001001586650001201596650001301608650000901621650001001630650003001640650002801670650003501698650002601733700001401759700001801773700001301791700001401804700001701818700001601835700001701851700002001868773011701888856007302005852000902078655001202087IND60585650820221117235018.0171112e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058565082DNAL7 a10.1111/jph.126582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Yi10aCandidate genes associated with resistance to Valsa canker identified via quantitative trait loci in apple  ap. 848-857.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aValsa canker is a destructive fungal disease for the apple industry, especially in Asian regions. Here, individuals in “Jonathan” × “Golden Delicious” hybrid population were phenotyped by off situ inoculation with Valsa mali isolates 03‐8 and xc56 from 2012 to 2015. Thirty‐one QTLs for the resistance were detected using high‐density genetic maps. Based on year‐stable and isolate‐robust QTLs, resistant loci G13‐1 and G13‐2 were mapped on chromosome 13 of the male parent, meanwhile locus J15‐1 was mapped on chromosome 15 of the female parent. Using the parental whole‐genome resequencing SNP databases, eighteen SNPs that could change predicted cis‐elements of gene or led to non‐synonymous substitution were screened in the three loci. After segregation analysis in hybrids and gene expression verification, three SNPs in an RNA‐binding protein gene, a serine/threonine‐protein kinase gene and a MYB transcription factor gene showed a close relationship to Valsa canker resistance in apple. These results will be useful for the application of marker‐assisted selection for Valsa canker resistance in apple.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aValsa mali 3aapples 3adatabases 3afemales 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahybrids 3aindustry 3aloci 3amales 3amarker-assisted selection 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription factors1 aShen, Fei1 aChen, Ruiting1 aWang, Yi1 aWu, Ding,1 aLi, Tianhong1 aXu, Xuefeng1 aHan, Zhenhai1 aZhang, Xinzhong0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2017 Dec., v. 165, no. 11-12 p.848-857dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.126583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012000207300001600327520116900343592002801512650003401540650002201574650002501596650001601621650002101637650002501658650002201683650001401705650002201719650001501741650002201756650001301778650002101791650004401812650001201856650002201868650001001890650002101900650001801921650001401939653003301953653004301986653004202029653004602071653004802117653003802165653004302203653003402246653003502280653001502315653001102330653002102341653000802362653002202370653003202392700001802424700002202442700001902464700001902483700005502502773010802557856008602665852000902751655001202760IND60629114420221121000544.0190329e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062911442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.12.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatova, O.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5236-486710aStructural, rheological and antioxidant properties of pectins from Equisetum arvense L. and Equisetum sylvaticum L.  ap. 239-249.  aThe pectins were isolated from sterile stems of E. arvense (EA, yield 5.9%) and E. sylvaticum (ES, yield 4.8%) (Equisetaceae) using ammonium oxalate extraction after preliminary treatment with dilute HCl (рH 4.0). The pectins possessed high molecular weight (Mw, 340–360 kDa), high GalA content (ca. 85%), low degrees of methyl-esterification (14–16%) and acetylation (3–8%). NMR analysis indicated extensive regions of partially methyl-etherified and 3-O-acetylated HG and minor regions of low branched RG in the fragment isolated after hydrolysis of pectin EA by pectinase. Pectin EA produced a higher viscosity solution, formed a stronger and more rigid ionotropic hydrogel than pectin ES. The pectins scavenged DPPH and hydroxyl radicals, but not the superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide. Phenolic compounds (0.11 and 0.23%) associated with polysaccharide moieties were apparently responsible for the differences in the anti-DPPH scavenging activity of pectins EA and ES (63 and 49%). The findings suggested that pectin from E. arvense should be more perspective than pectin from E. sylvaticum on their use as components of wound healing remedies.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aEquisetum arvense 3aEquisetum sylvaticum 3aacetylation 3aammonium oxalate 3aantioxidant activity 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apectins 3apolygalacturonase 3astems 3asuperoxide anion 3atissue repair 3aviscosity 0aEthanol (PubChem CID: 702) 0aHydrochloric acid (PubChem CID: 313) 0aSodium chloride (PubChem CID: 5234) 0aCalcium chloride (PubChem CID: 5284359) 0ad-galacturonic acid (PubChem CID: 439215) 0a3,5-Xylenol (PubChem CID: 7948) 0aHydrogen peroxide (PubChem CID: 784) 0aTrolox (PubChem CID: 40634) 0aXanthine (PubChem CID: 1188) 0aHorsetails 0aPectin 0aCharacterization 0aNMR 0aTextural property 0aRadical scavenging activity1 aSmirnov, V.V.1 aGolovchenko, V.V.1 aVityazev, F.V.1 aShashkov, A.S.1 aPopov, Sv.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1763-88980 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 209 p.239-249dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.12.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245009300156520137900249592002801628650002001656650001901676650002101695650001301716650001801729650002101747650001901768650001101787650002101798650002401819650001501843650001401858650001601872650003201888650001001920651001601930700001601946700001701962700001801979700001601997700001802013700002402031700002002055700001602075700001802091700001702109773011902126856007202245852000902317655001202326IND60648830820221119031830.0190701e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064883082DNAL7 a10.3390/f90301552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiao, Dongfan10aDevelopment of an Integrated DBH Estimation Model Based on Stand and Climatic Conditions  aUsing Korean National Forest Inventory (NFI) data, our study developed a model to estimate stand mean diameter at breast height (DBH) reflecting the influence of site and climate factors on forest growth for the major tree species in South Korea. A DBH estimation model was developed using stand-level variables (stand age, site index and number of trees per hectare) as independent factors. The spatial autocorrelation of residuals of the model was identified using semi-variogram analysis for each tree species. Further, a residual model, in which residuals were estimated by climatic factors (mean temperature, sum temperature in the growing season and precipitation), was developed assuming that the spatial autocorrelation of residuals reflects the differences in regional climatic conditions. Linear regression analysis showed that residuals of all tree species were significantly correlated with temperature and precipitation. The DBH and residual models were integrated to estimate the current DBH under different climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) and stand-level variables. This model had high reliability (R2 = 0.74–0.79), and no obvious dependencies or patterns in residuals were noted. Our results indicated that temperature increases caused by climate change would negatively affect the DBH estimate of coniferous trees, but not of oak species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aconifers 3aforest growth 3aforest inventory 3agrowing season 3amodels 3anational forests 3aregression analysis 3asite index 3astand age 3atemperature 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Moonil1 aChoi, Go-Mee1 aMoon, Jooyeon1 aYu, Hangnan1 aLee, Woo-Kyun1 aWang, Sonam Wangyel1 aJeon, Seong Woo1 aSon, Yowhan1 aSon, Yeong-Mo1 aCui, Guishan0 tForests.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90301553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001400192245007500206300001800281506007600299520172000375592002802095506003702123650002102160650001502181650003102196650001302227650001302240650001302253650001802266650001702284650000902301650002102310650002002331650001302351650001802364650002402382650001302406653001802419653001202437653002102449653002202470653001802492653002602510653001702536700002502553700001702578700002402595700002102619700002002640700001802660700002002678773009902698856008602797852000902883655001202892IND60585403320221207115212.0190401e20171218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058540332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.0812doi7 aPMC57541922pmcid7 a291502082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Yawei10aDevelopment of a synthetic Vi polysaccharide vaccine for typhoid fever  ap. 7121-7126.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTyphoid fever remains a serious public health problem with a high impact on toddlers and young children. Vaccines against the Vi capsular polysaccharide are efficacious against typhoid fever demonstrating that antibodies against Vi confer protection. The currently licensed Vi typhoid vaccines have however limited efficacy and are manufactured by a complex process from wild-type bacteria. Due to these inherent issues with the current vaccines, an alternative vaccine based on an O-acetylated high molecular weight (HMW) polygalacturonic acid (GelSite-OAc™) was generated. The HMW polygalacturonic acid shares the same backbone as the Vi polysaccharide of Salmonella Typhi. The GelSite-OAc™ has a high molecular weight (>1 × 106 Da) and a high degree of O-acetylation (DOAc) (>5 μmole/mg), both exceeding the potency specifications of the current Vi vaccine. Studies in Balb/c mice demonstrated that GelSite-OAc™ was highly immunogenic, inducing a strong antigen-specific antibody response in a DOAc- and dose-dependent manner which was comparable to or higher than those induced by the licensed Vi vaccine. Importantly, the GelSite-OAc™ was shown to be fully protective in mice against lethal challenge with Salmonella Typhi. Furthermore, the GelSite-OAc™ demonstrated a boosting effect or memory response, exhibiting a >2-fold increase in antibody levels upon the second immunization with either GelSite-OAc™ or the Vi vaccine. This novel boosting effect is unique among polysaccharide antigens and potentially makes GelSite-OAc™ effective in people under 2 years old. Together these results suggest that the GelSite-OAc™ could be a highly effective vaccine against Salmonella Typhi.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella Typhi 3aantibodies 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3aantigens 3abacteria 3achildren 3adose response 3aimmunization 3amice 3amolecular weight 3apolysaccharides 3atoddlers 3atyphoid fever 3avaccine development 3avaccines 0aTyphoid fever 0aVaccine 0aSalmonella Typhi 0aVi polysaccharide 0aO-acetylation 0aPolygalacturonic acid 0aAnimal model1 aSpringer, Michael J.1 aGuo, Jianhua1 aFinger-Baker, Isaac1 aWilson, James P.1 aCobb, Ronald R.1 aTurner, Debra1 aTizard, Ian R.,0 tVaccine.g2017 Dec. 18, v. 35, no. 51 p.7121-7126dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245016500210300001400375520185900389592002802248650002702276650002702303650001402330650002002344650001602364650001102380650002302391650001702414650002702431650003002458650001402488650001002502650001602512650001402528650002102542650001202563650001402575653004102589653001102630653001702641653001302658700002102671700002802692700002002720700002802740700002602768773011802794856008302912852000902995655001203004IND60612005520221119162108.0190405e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061200552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2018.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkbarinejad, Vahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6979-282210aActivator of Mitochondrial Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (Alda-1) Could Enhance Quality of Equine Cooled Semen by Ameliorating Loss of Mitochondrial Function Over Time  ap. 63-70.  aEquine sperm energy metabolism is mainly dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, causing abundant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reacting with fatty acids, ROS result in formation of aldehydes, which diminish sperm viability and motility. Aldehyde dehydrogenases are responsible for removal of aldehydes. Aldehyde dehydrogenase(Alda-1) is the activator of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase and has been shown to alleviate the detrimental effects of aldehydes in different tissues. The present study was conducted to evaluate the influence of Alda-1 on cooled stallion semen over a 72-hour period. Motility was evaluated using computer-assisted sperm analysis. Viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and superoxide anion production were assessed using flow cytometry–based methods by SYBR14 plus propidium iodine, JC-1, and dihydroethidium, respectively. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was measured using a luciferase-based ATP bioluminescent assay. Preliminarily, 50 μM dose of Alda-1 was found to be effective on equine cooled semen based on the greater progressive motility observed after exposure to 50 μM Alda-1 as compared with control group (P < .05). Furthermore, it was revealed that Alda-1 (50 μM) ameliorated the decrease in viability, motility, velocity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP production during 72-hour preservation of equine cooled semen (P < .05). In addition, proportion of sperm positive for superoxide anion was higher in Alda-1 than the control group (P < .05), which was interpreted as positive impact of Alda-1 on sperm mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, the present study showed that Alda-1 could enhance cooling preservation of equine semen by maintaining mitochondrial function and mitigating reduction in ATP generation, motility, and viability over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aaldehydes 3abioluminescence 3afatty acids 3aiodine 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3apropidium 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3astallions 3asuperoxide anion 3atissues 3aviability 0aMitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 0aAlda-1 0aCooled semen 0aStallion1 aFathi, Rouhollah1 aShahverdi, Abdolhossein1 aEsmaeili, Vahid1 aRezagholizadeh, Alireza1 aGhaleno, Leila Rashki0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2018 Nov., v. 70 p.63-70dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2018.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012700175300001600302520139600318592002801714650001101742650001401753650002301767650002101790650002201811650002401833650001301857650002101870650001101891650003101902650001701933650001201950650001401962650001101976650001101987650001701998650001602015653002202031653002202053653002002075653000802095653002102103653001802124700006202142700001902204700002002223700001602243700002302259700002502282700002902307700002102336773007102357856008402428852000902512655001202521IND60559512820221120103240.0161216e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055951282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerazzolo, Valentina10aNitrogen and sulfur doped mesoporous carbon as metal-free electrocatalysts for the in situ production of hydrogen peroxide  ap. 949-963.  aMesoporous carbons (MCs) are highly porous materials, which offer high surface area and higher electrochemical performance than traditional carbon materials. Doped carbons are particularly interesting materials due to their possible use as metal-free ORR catalysts. In this paper, nitrogen and sulfur doped or co-doped MCs were prepared according to a hard template approach consisting in pyrolysis of powders obtained by liquid impregnation of mesoporous silica with different heterocyclic condensed aromatic precursors. The synthetized MCs show round shaped particles with mesoporosity of 3–4 nm diameter, a BET surface area higher than 850 m2/g and nitrogen and sulfur contents ranging between 3–8% and 4–14%, respectively. Final doping has been demonstrated by core level photoemission spectra. The effect of the pyrolysis temperature on the physico-chemical properties of the resulting MCs has been investigated as well as the role of the dopant heteroatoms on their catalytic performances towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Electrochemical tests show that both the oxygen-, sulfur- and nitrogen-containing groups can induce an electrocatalytic activity of MCs for ORR. The catalytic activity shows a linear dependence from the nitrogen content and a prevalent 2 electron reduction process leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide, both in acid and alkaline solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrogen production 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporous media 3apowders 3apyrolysis 3asilica 3asulfur 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aMesoporous carbon 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aNitrogen doping 0aORR 0aElectrocatalysis 0aSulfur doping1 aDurante, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8764-12191 aPilot, Roberto1 aPaduano, Andrea1 aZheng, Jian1 aRizzi, Gian Andrea1 aMartucci, Alessandro1 aGranozzi, G.q(Gaetano),1 aGennaro, Armando0 tCarbon.g2015 Dec., v. 95 p.949-963dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle09936naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245004600169300001600215520778300231592002808014650002808042650001308070650001408083650002308097650002308120650001308143650001808156650002408174650001108198650001008209650001808219650001008237650002508247650001008272650002208282650002108304650001508325650001208340650001408352650001308366650001008379650001908389650001108408650001908419650002008438650001208458650002008470650001408490650002308504650001008527650001008537650001508547650000908562650001508571650001108586650001708597650002408614650001508638650001808653650001208671650001908683650001408702650001408716650001308730650001508743650001308758650001908771650001008790650001108800650002008811650001008831650001108841651001908852773011908871856008308990852000909073655001209082IND60676799820221121063635.0200503e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067679982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crvi.2019.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastin, Philippe14aThe trypanosome journey in the tsetse fly  ap. 273-275.  aTrypanosoma brucei is a flagellated parasite responsible for sleeping sickness in central Africa. It is transmitted from one host to another via the bite of the tsetse fly (Glossina genus), which is the major mode of contamination. The tsetse fly (Fig. 1), both male and female, feeds exclusively on blood and exhibits unique features such as viviparous reproduction and lactation. It should be considered as a real host for trypanosomes, since the parasites differentiate and proliferate in several fly tissues such as the gut, the proventriculus, and the salivary glands. Trypanosomes adapt to these various environments by modifications in their cell surface composition, metabolism, and morphogenesis. One of the most prominent characteristics of trypanosomes is the presence of a flagellum that is attached to the cell body and drives parasite movement, but also dictates cell morphology. Its length varies according to the life cycle stage, ranging from 3 to 30μm. This organelle is essential for parasite survival. Here, we will discuss the different aspects of trypanosome development in the tsetse fly, with focus on flagellum function.Human African Trypanosomiasis is a disease characterised by two phases, one with rather unspecific symptoms such as bouts of fever, headaches, weakness or lymphadenopathy, and a second one with severe neurological symptoms including disruption of the sleeping pattern, hence the historical name of the disease, sleeping sickness. It is due to a parasitic protist called Trypanosoma brucei, with only two subspecies being responsible for human infections: T. b. gambiense (98% of the cases) and T. b. rhodesiense. Under the microscope, this extracellular parasite exhibits a long motile flagellum that is attached to the cell body. It performs multiple functions such as motility, morphogenesis and adhesion to specific tissues. The parasite possesses a typical eukaryotic nucleus (35 Mo) and a single mitochondrion whose large genome is condensed in a structure called the kinetoplast. The parasite escapes the host immune response thanks to a sophisticated process of antigenic variation. The disease is exclusively encountered in sub-Saharan Africa because the parasite is transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly (Fig. 1), an insect that is not found outside this region.Glossina flies have unique biological peculiarities. In contrast to most insects, they are not oviparous. Mating occurs from five days after birth and larval development takes place into the female uterus. After 14 days, the female lays a single pupa that is lightly buried in the ground. Development continues for 28 days before hatching and emergence, which is completed in only a few minutes. Like other insects, the tsetse fly is often termed a vector, but it should be considered as real host for at least two reasons. First, trypanosomes undergo a long trip in the tsetse fly, developing in a very precise order in different tissues with a lot of specific morphological, genetic, and biochemical adaptations. Second, trypanosomes are likely to have been parasites of insects well before affecting other organisms. The term of vector is probably more appropriate in the case of mechanical transfer of pathogens from one host to the other, as observed with the bite of tabanids and the transmission of Trypanosoma evansi, for example. This parasite is lacking several mitochondrial genes normally encoded on kinetoplast DNA and is unable to develop in the tsetse fly, yet can be passively transferred from one host to the other. Finally, it should be pointed out here that, although the presence of trypanosomes can affect the tsetse fly, the insect itself does not suffer from sleeping sickness. Therefore, it is preferable to say that the tsetse fly transmits trypanosomes, and not the disease. In the laboratory, tsetse flies are bred in netted cages and fed with heated sheep blood using a membrane to mimic the presence of the skin. Flies do not feed directly on blood.Trypanosomes are ingested with blood when the fly feeds on an infected host and reach the crop where they have to resist dehydration. Next, the “paste” containing blood and trypanosomes is moved to the gut. The parasites differentiate to adapt to this new environment, where they have to face digestive enzymes and exhibit new molecular, biochemical, and metabolic features. They proliferate in the posterior midgut and then need to migrate to the proventriculus. This is a challenging trip for a trypanosome. If we compare with humans, it would be equivalent to swimming seven kilometres in a highly viscous environment like jelly… This is achieved by active forward motility, with the beating flagellum driving migration [1]. The parasite next moves to the salivary glands, a process also likely to be governed by the flagellum. However, this could not be experimentally proven given the failure of motility mutants to reach the proventriculus. None of these parasite stages are able to infect mammals. Once trypanosomes arrive in the salivary glands, they therefore need to differentiate in an infective stage. For this, they attach to the epithelium of the salivary glands before starting the differentiation process. This prevents them from being released prematurely with the saliva. This adhesion takes place via the flagellum, which develops unique and complex membrane extensions that wrap around microvilli of the fly epithelial cells. The parasite then undergoes an asymmetric division, with the daughter cell inheriting the old flagellum, which remains attached to the epithelium and the other daughter inheriting the new flagellum, which adopts different morphology and biochemical composition [2]. This latter cell differentiates to the infectious stage and is released in the saliva. It is now ready to infect a new host.After landing on skin, the tsetse fly does not find immediately blood vessels for feeding. Rather, it probes by scratching and dilacerating tissues. During this process, the fly injects saliva and, if it contains trypanosomes, these are delivered in the skin. It was long accepted that trypanosomes rapidly move to the lymph, then to the blood, where they would spend most of their time before reaching the nervous system. However, recent development in imaging techniques allowed researchers to visualise parasite progression in mouse models. Strikingly, trypanosomes are mostly present in the skin, including in cases where they were not detected in the blood. They are highly motile, possibly to escape phagocytic cells. Moreover, skin trypanosomes have been shown to infect naïve tsetse flies, demonstrating their role in parasite transmission [3,4]. Analysis of skin biopsies from human patients coming from endemic areas for human African trypanosomiasis revealed the presence of trypanosomes, suggesting that the same phenomenon could occur in humans [3]. This is an amazing finding that could change the paradigm of African trypanosomiasis given the fact that diagnosis is based on the detection of parasites in the blood. This means that trypanosome carriers might go undetected and could contribute to parasite transmission. This could be highly significant in the current context of HAT elimination [5].Trypanosomes show remarkable adaptations to live within different tissues of the tsetse fly with the final aim to ensure their transmission to mammalian hosts. The flagellum is a key organelle to this success, as it drives motility but also controls cell morphogenesis, which is suited to each particular tissue where the parasite develops. Cilia and flagella are known to function as sensory organelles in other organisms and it would not be surprising to see it exploited by trypanosomes to detect their environment [6].  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican trypanosomiasis 3aGlossina 3aTabanidae 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aTrypanosoma evansi 3aadhesion 3aanimal models 3aantigenic variation 3abiopsy 3ablood 3ablood vessels 3acages 3achemical composition 3acilia 3adigestive enzymes 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afemales 3aflagellum 3ahatching 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aimmune response 3ainsects 3akinetoplast DNA 3alactation 3alarval development 3alymph 3amales 3ametabolism 3amice 3amicrovilli 3amidgut 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genes 3amolybdenum 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3anervous system 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apatients 3aphagocytes 3aprotists 3aproventriculus 3apupae 3asaliva 3asalivary glands 3asheep 3auterus 3aCentral Africa0 tComptes rendus.g2019 Sept.,  Oct., v. 342, no. 7-8 p.273-275dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:12404x1631-06917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crvi.2019.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245009400163300001600257520182900273592002802102653002602130653001502156653001302171653002102184653002402205653003002229653001602259773012402275856007802399852000902477655001202486IND60130368420221122060450.0151127e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013036842DNAL7 a10.2983/035.028.03012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDame, Richard F.10aShifting Through Time: Oysters and Shell Rings in Past and Present Southeastern Estuaries  ap. 425-430.  aOysters and oyster reefs are important components in the rich and productive southeastern US marsh-estnarine ecosystems. In recent decades, ecological research has shown that these complex systems can be driven by external biotic and abiotic perturbations or internal system dynamics that cause the system to rapidly reorganize into another alternate state or regime. Such shifts may have happened on a much larger scale several thousand years ago along the southeastern coast of North America. Beginning about 4,500 B.P., the coastal Native Americans built complex structures or oyster shell rings on the landward side of the southeastern sea islands of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The construction of shell rings is believed to symbolize the conversion of nomadic hunter-gatherers to coastal fisherfolk and is considered a pivotal stage in the evolution of preEuropean contact culture in the United States. But, by about 3000 B.P., the shell rings were abandoned and the Native Americans dispersed. With the objective of learning from the past to help manage for the future, the Fig Island and Sewee shell ring systems near Charleston, South Carolina are analyzed using ecological comparisons with modern oyster systems, published archaeological and geological data, as well as reverse engineering approaches. In just a few years, the Indians built the Fig Island 1 shell ring using over 1.2 billion oysters. Had these oysters not been removed from the system, they would have cleared or filtered a water volume the size of North Inlet estuary near Georgetown, South Carolina about 6 times per day. This exercise examines the evidence on how the prehistoric system might have changed or shifted in response to the massive removal of oysters to build shell rings and concurrent changes in the natural environment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCrassostrea virginica 0ashell ring 0aHolocene 0aNative Americans 0areverse engineering 0amarsh-estuarine ecosystem 0aphase shift0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2009 Aug., v. 28, no. 3 p.425-430dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.028.03013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01135naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245007900158300001600237520029700253592002800550650001300578650001600591650001100607650001300618650001800631700002100649773009500670856007100765852000900836655001200845IND60518489220221117000918.0160417e196805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051848922DNAL7 a10.2307/19341342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherman, Kenneth10aPontellid Copepods as Indicators of an Oceanic Incursion over Georges Bank  ap. 582-584.  aThe distribution of pontellid copepods was used to delineate the region of mixing between coastal and oceanic surface waters during an incursion of Gulf Stream water over Georges Bank.

The farmed Chinese giant salamanders presented typical clinical symptoms that included ecchymoses or swollen areas on the head and limbs, necrosis of the limbs, and skin ulceration. Bacteriological and pathologic examinations further proved the possibility of ranavirus infection of the Chinese giant salamanders. The virus was isolated via inoculation in the epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. The virus multiplied and caused cytopathogenic effects (CPE) at 25°C in the EPC cells and it was sensitive to chloroform treatment, trypsinase treatment, heating at 56°C for 30min, acidity (pH 3.0), and alkalinity (pH=10.0). Treatment with 5-bromouracil deoxyriboside (5-BrdU) inhibited viral replication, which suggested that the viral genome contained DNA. After the viral inoculation in the cell, samples were collected and made the ultrathin sections, and then the iridovirus-like particles could be observed in the cytoplasm and nuclei by electron microscopy. Using the isolated viral DNA as the template for PCR, we amplified, cloned, and analyzed target sequences in three different genomic regions, i.e., the major capsid protein (MCP), DNA polymerase, and neurofilament triplet H1-like protein (NF-H1). Subsequent multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the newly isolated virus was closely related to KRV-1, soft-shelled turtle iridovirus, Rana grylio iridovirus, and FV3. In the pathogenicity tests, the challenged salamanders showed similar clinical symptoms to the natural infections. Our data suggested that the virus isolate was a novel member of the genus Ranavirus, family Iridoviridae. We tentatively named the virus as Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). CGSV-L was able to cause serious systemic disease and it was capable of killing 80% of Chinese giant salamanders (body weight=300.0±15.0g).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aIridovirus 3aRana 3aRanavirus 3aacidity 3aalkalinity 3acoat proteins 3acytopathogenicity 3acytoplasm 3aelectron microscopy 3ahead 3anecrosis 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asalamanders and newts 3aturtles 3avirus replication 3aviruses 3aChina 0aCharacteristics 0aChinese giant salamander 0aIridoviridae 0aRanavirus1 aGeng, Y.1 aLiu, X.X.1 aRen, S.Y.1 aZhou, Y.1 aWang, K.Y.1 aHuang, X.L.1 aChen, D.F.1 aPeng, X.1 aLai, W.M.0 tAquaculture.g2013 Mar. 25, v. 384-387 p.66-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011300170300001400283520153900297592002801836650001301864650001101877650000901888650000901897650001401906650000901920650001501929650001501944650001501959650000901974650001001983650001101993650001302004653001002017653001502027653000902042653000902051653001002060653001302070700002202083700002202105700002402127700005902151700002102210700001902231700001902250773011802269856008302387852000902470655001202479IND60612005620221119162143.0190405e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061200562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaure, Sébastien14aThe Influence of Different Hind Shoes and Bare Feet on Horse Kinematics at a Walk and Trot on a Soft Surface  ap. 76-83.  aAlthough often discussed in practice, there is a paucity of scientific evidence as to the effect of different shoes on equine locomotion on soft ground, especially in hind limbs. Our objectives were to determine the effect of different shoeing conditions on the locomotion of sound horses on a soft surface. Two-dimensional kinematic video analysis was performed in six horses during walk and trot in hand on the same sand surface under seven different shoeing conditions: (1) front feet shod with aluminum shoes and hind feet with steel racehorse shoes, same front shoes in combination with (2) hind egg bar shoes (EGB), (3) hind reverse shoes (REV); and (4) hind covered toe shoe (COV); (5) all four feet unshod; (6) fore feet unshod and hind steel race shoes; and (7) front aluminum shoe and hind feet unshod (hind bare feet [HBF]). We showed that, in comparison to condition 1 which was used as the reference, HBF increased stifle, hip and fore fetlock extension, the fore shod conditions increased carpus and shoulder flexion, COV showed little effect, REV increased elbow and shoulder extension, and EGB increased stifle and hip extension. For main limitations, the results could be different in other speeds, gaits, and surfaces. In conclusion, on sand, shod conditions and hind shoes largely influence upper limb joint motion and have a relatively small influence on distal limb joint motion. This needs to be considered when horses are shod to improve kinematics for performance purposes or when addressing clinical problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acarpus 3aeggs 3afeet 3ahindlimbs 3ahips 3akinematics 3alocomotion 3aracehorses 3asand 3asteel 3astifle 3atrotting 0aHorse 0aKinematics 0aShoe 0aFoot 0aJoint 0aFarriery1 aMortagne, Perrine1 aLeveillard, Denis1 aBlanville, Faustine1 aCarro, Marielle1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8861-28181 aCousty, Matthieu1 aSalazar, Diana1 aWeller, Renate0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2018 Nov., v. 70 p.76-83dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245008700184300001600271520067100287592002800958650002000986650001401006650001501020650001501035650001601050650001201066650001701078650000901095650001301104650001301117650003601130650003701166650003101203650001201234650000901246650000901255650004301264650003101307650004401338650003601382773010801418856008201526852000901608655001201617IND60113518920221118042358.0141111e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011351892DNAL7 a237472672pmid7 a10.1016/j.cvsm.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuandt, Jane10aAnalgesia, Anesthesia, and Chemical Restraint in the Emergent Small Animal Patient  ap. 941-953.  aAppropriate stabilization of the critically ill animal before sedation or anesthesia is imperative to minimize anesthetic complications.

Use of a balanced anesthesia technique should be considered to minimize potential deleterious effects of single-use drug therapy. Using a combination of different classes of analgesics may be more effective in treating established pain than using a single agent.

Research focused on the high-risk population has been limited, particularly related to racial disparities in vaccination. We explore a broad range of demographic, racial, and psychosocial factors to identify predictors of vaccination among high-risk adults, with a focus on identify differences between Black and White adults.We conducted an online survey in March 2015, utilizing international research firm GfK’s KnowledgePanel, for a nationally representative sample of Black and White adults (≥18, USA) and limited analysis adults with high-risk of influenza-related complications. Using two-way ANOVA, we assessed demographic, racial, and psychosocial predictors across vaccine uptake in the past five years and across racial group.424 (52.2%) Black and 388 (47.8%) White respondents with high-risk complications completed the survey. 383 (47.3%) reported vaccination annually, 99 (12.2%) most years, 104 (12.9%) once/twice, and 223 (27.6%) never.ANOVA confirmed significant differences in vaccine behavior for most demographic predictors (except education), all racial factors (including racial fairness, experiences of discrimination, etc.), and most psychosocial factors (including vaccine attitudes, trust in the vaccine, etc.). ANOVA confirmed significant differences for most factors by race. We observed significant interaction effects between race and vaccine behavior for subjective social status, access to medical care, knowledge of vaccine recommendations, vaccine attitudes, perceived side effect risks, descriptive norms, subjective norms, flu vaccine hesitancy, and flu vaccine confidence, thus implying racial differences in the connection between vaccine uptake and key demographic, racial, and psychosocial factors.This study provides a novel examination of flu vaccine behavior among high-risk Blacks and Whites that identified factors influencing vaccine uptake.We found significant differences by race. Health care professionals can use this information to more effectively target high-risk adults during flu season.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBlacks 3aWhites 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aanalysis of variance 3aattitudes and opinions 3aeducation 3ahealth care workers 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apsychosocial factors 3arisk 3asocioeconomic status 3asurveys 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0aInfluenza vaccination 0aHigh-risk population 0aChronic conditions 0aRacial disparities 0aAfrican Americans1 aJamison, Amelia M.1 aFreimuth, Vicki S.1 aAn, Ji1 aHancock, Gregory R.0 tVaccine.g2017 Dec. 18, v. 35, no. 51 p.7154-7159dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03868naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245006600174300001600240520241400256592002802670650002702698650001202725650001402737650001402751650001002765650001402775650001502789650001302804650001502817650001502832650001202847650001102859650001402870650001402884650001502898650001502913650001202928650001502940650001102955650001002966650001602976650002202992651001803014651001203032651001103044651002003055651001903075700001803094700002403112773010203136856005503238852000903293655001203302IND4476695920221120195718.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447669592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.01963.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, Carly J.10aBiological Flora of the British Isles: Campanula rotundifolia  ap. 821-839.  a1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Campanula rotundifolia L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivory and disease, history, and conservation. 2. Campanula rotundifolia is a slender, rhizomatous, prostrate to erect herb with long‐stalked roundish basal leaves, linear stem leaves, and a blue, bell‐shaped corolla. It is widespread in the British Isles though absent from parts of Ireland. Globally, C. rotundifolia has a circumpolar distribution extending from the Arctic Circle to northern Mexico and North Africa. It forms a polyploid complex with some characters linked to ploidy level. Populations in the British Isles are predominantly tetraploid and hexaploid, with occasional pentaploids. The distribution of these cytotypes in the British Isles has a strong spatial structure. 3. Campanula rotundifolia has a wide ecological amplitude, tolerating very dry conditions but also occasionally occurring in permanently saturated habitats, and it grows on a very wide range of soil types, from coarse sands through loams to heavy clays and pure peats. However, C. rotundifolia is rarely found on fertile lowland clays where competition from more vigorous species may limit growth. Campanula rotundifolia is found in a range of grassland, heath, mire, scrub and sand dune communities spanning a wide range of soil pH. 4. Campanula rotundifolia is perennial and spreads by seed and by rhizome. Plants generally overwinter as frost‐resistant green rosettes. As the spring season progresses, plants make slow vegetative growth. Erect flowering stems develop from June onwards. Campanula rotundifolia is largely self‐incompatible, and is insect pollinated, regularly producing large quantities of viable seed. 5. Although C. rotundifolia is a widespread and locally very common species there is some evidence from Britain and across Europe that it is in decline. These losses are likely to be due to a number of factors including agricultural intensification, reversion of grassland to scrub and woodland, disturbance, and atmospheric pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampanula rotundifolia 3acorolla 3acytotypes 3adune sand 3aflora 3aflowering 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3ahexaploidy 3ainsects 3aleaves 3aphenology 3apollution 3arangelands 3ashrublands 3asoil pH 3asoil types 3aspring 3astems 3atetraploidy 3avegetative growth 3aArctic region 3aIreland 3aMexico 3aNorthern Africa 3aUnited Kingdom1 aWilson, Julia1 aMcAllister, Hugh A.0 tjournal of ecology.g2012 May, v. 100, no. 3 p.821-839dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.01963.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245006900173300001800242520112900260592002801389650001701417650002301434650001701457650001501474650003201489650002201521650002001543650004401563650002001607653003801627653001801665653001701683653001901700700002101719700002301740700002101763700003001784773008101814856008101895852000901976655001201985IND60551363920221117220844.0161018e20140429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055136392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIntaraudom, Chakapong10a3-Oxyanthranilic acid derivatives from Actinomadura sp.

Four independent experiments were completed to test ability of select Enterobacteriaceae isolates to induce GI inflammation. Experiments 1 and 2 included a non-inoculated control (NC), and a low (L), medium (M), or high (H) day of hatch (DOH) oral inoculation level. In experiment 1, birds in L1, M1, and H1 received 10² to 10⁴ CFU of a mixed dose of 2 species of Citrobacter and Salmonella Enteritidis LB (SE). In experiment 2, birds in L2, M2, and H2 received 10³ to 10⁵ CFU of E. coli LG (LG) and included NC. Body weight was recorded on d 0, 7, and 14, with blood collected for chicken serum alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (A1GP) measurements on d14. Neither experiment resulted in differences in BWG, however, A1GP was increased (P < 0.05) on d 14 when DOH inoculation dose 10³ CFU/chick was used compared to NC. This observed increase in A1GP resulted in selection of 10³ CFU/chick for DOH inoculation in experiments 3 and 4. Experiment 3 consisted of NC, E. coli Huff (Huff), and SE. On d 0, 7 and 15, BW was measured, with blood collected on d 15 for A1GP. Both d 15 A1GP and BWG from d 7 to 15 were reduced in inoculated chicks, Huff and SE, in experiment 3 (P < 0.05). Experiment 4 evaluated NC and LG with BW measured on d 0, 2, 7 and 14. Yolk sacs were evaluated for retention and bacterial enumeration, and blood for serum A1GP were collected on d 2 and 14. Experiment 4 resulted in no differences in yolk sac parameters or A1GP, whereas there was an increase in BWG for LG from d 0 to 14 (P < 0.05). When evaluated over time, serum A1GP increased between d 2 and d 14 by nearly 46% in LG, compared to negligible changes in NC (P = 0.111). Mild GI inflammation induced by early Enterobacteriaceae exposure may not drastically impact growth or inflammation parameters but may increase susceptibility to opportunistic infection necessitating further study of this model.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrobacter 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3achickens 3achicks 3agastrointestinal system 3aglycoproteins 3agrowth performance 3ainflammation 3amicrobial colonization 3amodels 3aopportunistic infection 3aoral administration 3aplate count 3ayolk sac 0aEnterobacteriaceae 0agastrointestinal inflammation 0aalpha-1-acid glycoprotein 0aopportunistic disease1 aMcGovern, K.1 aDuff, A.F.1 aGraham, B.D.1 aBriggs, W.N.1 aRodrigues, D.R.1 aTrombetta, M.1 aWinson, E.1 aBielke, L.R.0 tPoultry science.g2021 July, v. 100, no. 7 p.101193-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2021.1011933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245009300214300001300307506007600320520142000396592002801816506003701844650002601881650002001907650001301927650001601940650002801956650001401984650001601998650002002014650000902034651001202043700002002055773010902075856004802184852000902232655001202241IND50071306620221207114528.0140121e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007130662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1706-y2doi7 aPMC38983522pmcid7 a244825452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Jonathan W.

This paper describes a benchmarking exercise to comparatively assess potential differences in environmental management decision making resulting from application of different sustainability appraisal tools ranging from simple (qualitative) to more quantitative (multi-criteria and fully monetized cost-benefit analysis), as outlined in the SuRF-UK framework. The appraisal tools were used to rank remedial options for risk management of a subsurface petroleum release that occurred at a petrol filling station in central England. The remediation options were benchmarked using a consistent set of soil and groundwater data for each tier of sustainability appraisal. The ranking of remedial options was very similar in all three tiers, and an environmental management decision to select the most sustainable options at tier 1 would have been the same decision at tiers 2 and 3. The exercise showed that, for relatively simple remediation projects, a simple sustainability appraisal led to the same remediation option selection as more complex appraisal, and can be used to reliably inform environmental management decisions on other relatively simple land contamination projects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acost benefit analysis 3adecision making 3agasoline 3agroundwater 3ahuman health and safety 3apetroleum 3aremediation 3arisk management 3asoil 3aEngland1 aKerrison, Gavin0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2013 Dec., v. 224, no. 12 p.1706-1706dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1706-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245007700170300001600247520147100263592002801734653002201762653001301784653001101797653001601808653002501824653002501849700002401874700002301898773012401921856007802045852000902123655001202132IND60130368720221122060538.0151127e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013036872DNAL7 a10.2983/035.028.03042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSummerhayes, Stephen A.10aSpatial Patterns of Wild Oysters in the Hawkesbury River, NSW, Australia  ap. 447-451.  aThe native Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, is under increasing threat from QX disease, competition with nonnative Crassostrea gigas and coastal development. Knowledge of the distribution and population structure of S. glomerata and C. gigas is essential if oysters and their ecosystem services are to be successfully managed. We determined spatial patterns of abundance, condition, and size-structure of S. glomerata and C. gigas, across two key habitats, mangroves, and rocky shores of the Hawkesbury River, a highly modified estuary 50 km north of Sydney. Sampling of five sites per habitat, spanning a 15 km stretch of river, revealed abundant populations of S. glomerata, averaging 514 ±± 185 m⁻², in mangroves and on rocky shores. The native oyster accounted for 99% of all oysters sampled, with C. gigas found only at two of the five sites sampled within each habitat. Overall, rocky shores supported over eight times the oyster cover as mangroves. Among rock sites, live oyster cover and condition generally decreased with distance upstream. Although, at present, the Hawkesbury River estuary supports abundant wild oyster populations, ongoing monitoring of oyster populations is required to ensure that appropriate management strategies are established to ensure the persistence of this important component of the ecosystem. Our sampling of two key oyster habitats provides an important baseline against which future studies can assess change.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCrassostrea gigas 0amangrove 0aoyster 0arocky shore 0aSaccostrea glomerata 0aspatial distribution1 aKelaher, Brendan P.1 aBishop, Melanie J.0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2009 Aug., v. 28, no. 3 p.447-451dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.028.03043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013800172300001600310520188800326592002802214650002302242650001802265650001702283650002902300650001902329650001702348650001702365650001502382650001002397650001102407650001102418650002202429650001302451650001402464650001902478650001302497650001402510650001302524650001902537653002002556653003102576653001802607653002502625653002102650700001702671700001802688773009102706856008902797852000902886655001202895IND60606358220221123000510.0180725e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060635822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Huacheng10aDepth-dependent variations of sedimentary dissolved organic matter composition in a eutrophic lake: Implications for lake restoration  ap. 551-559.  aDissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a significant role in regulating nutrients and carbon cycling and the reactivity of trace metals and other contaminants in the environment. However, the environmental/ecological role of sedimentary DOM is highly dependent on organic composition. In this study, fluorescence excitation emission matrix-parallel factor (EEM–PARAFAC) analysis, two dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D–COS), and ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT–ICR–MS) were applied to investigate the depth-dependent variations of sediment-leached DOM components in a eutrophic lake. Results of EEM–PARAFAC and 2D–COS showed that fluorescent humic-like component was preferentially degraded microbially over fulvic-like component at greater sediment depths, and the relative abundance of non-fluorescent components decreased with increasing depth, leaving the removal rate of carbohydrates > lignins. The predominant sedimentary DOM components derived from FT–ICR–MS were lipids (>50%), followed by lignins (∼15%) and proteins (∼15%). The relative abundance of carbohydrates, lignins, and condensed aromatics decreased significantly at greater depths, whereas that of lipids increased in general with depth. There existed a significant negative correlation between the short-range ordered (SRO) minerals and the total dissolved organic carbon concentration or the relative contents of lignins and condensed aromatics (p < 0.05), suggesting that SRO mineral sorption plays a significant role in controlling the composition heterogeneity and releasing of DOM in lake sediments. Higher metal binding potential observed for DOM at deeper sediment depth (e.g., 25–30 cm) supported the ecological safety of sediment dredging technique from the viewpoint of heavy metal de-toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon cycle 3adissolved organic matter 3aeutrophication 3afluorescence 3aheavy metals 3aionization 3alakes 3alignin 3alipids 3amass spectrometry 3aminerals 3anutrients 3aorganic carbon 3aproteins 3asediments 3asorption 3atrace elements 0aSedimentary DOM 0aEEM–PARAFAC and 2D–COS 0aFT–ICR–MS 0aSRO mineral sorption 0aLake restoration1 aGuo, Laodong1 aJiang, Helong0 tChemosphere.g2016 Feb., v. 145 p.551-559dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle08518naa a2200985 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007600168300001600244520594100260592002806201650001906229650003806248650002106286650001206307650001806319650001606337650001606353650001706369650001006386650001406396650001306410650000906423650001106432650002106443650001206464650002306476650002006499650001906519650001806538650000906556650002206565650001606587650001406603650001406617650001506631650001806646650002006664650001506684650001006699650002906709650001606738650000906754650002006763650001106783650002206794650001606816650001806832650002006850650001906870650001206889650002206901650001306923650001206936650000906948650002406957650001406981650001806995650001907013650001507032650000907047650002007056650001207076650002007088650002007108650002207128650000907150650001707159650001907176650001307195650002807208650001007236650001607246651001107262651001807273651001807291773011907309856008307428852000907511655001207520IND60676800020221119020943.0200503e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067680002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crvi.2019.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubert, Antoine10aIndustrial insect production as an alternative source of animal protein  ap. 276-277.  aBy 2050, the World Resources Institute projects a 70% human food calorie gap [1].

Legislative decisions taken by EU policy makers constituted decisive factors that contributed to boost the advancement of the sector.We urgently need to address the entire food chain and make it possible to produce a better, high-quality product–with lower cost inputs. This means zeroing in on earlier stages of the food production process: namely how farmed fish and, ultimately, poultry and cattle are fed. Livestock consume roughly 20% of global proteins and compete with humans for ocean fish stocks, water, land, and soil resources (FAO, 2016). Poultry, pigs, aquaculture and some pets are fed diets that include fishmeal and fish oils, which are produced from ocean-caught fish and fish trimmings. Aquaculture plays a critical role in human nutrition, growing faster than any other protein source for human consumption. Around half of the fish we eat today comes from farmed sources. Yet fishmeal, the primary food source for farmed fish, is in crisis because it is derived from fast-depleting ocean fish stocks.By replacing traditional animal and fish-based diets with insect protein, we can offset the growing competition for the ocean fish stock required to be able to feed 2 billion more people by 2050. This further serves to reduce fish, water, and soil depletion, as well as agriculture's 25% share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Insects are part of a natural diet for fish, birds and some mammals; they contain high levels of essential proteins and nutrients, which are optimal for animal growth. Today, the feed given to farmed animals does not include this sustainable protein.However, due to the rising costs of traditional feed ingredients, coupled with the increased production of farmed fish, feed nutritionists and manufacturers have reduced the amount of fishmeal in aquaculture diets, replacing it with plant-based ingredients, especially soy. Mostly imported to Europe from the Americas, soy bean production carries a huge environmental cost resulting in, among other things, deforestation and soil erosion. It is pretty crazy to be feeding the animals we eat with one of the most expensive forms of protein in the world. This is why we need to focus on the start of the food chain. Insects could make up the protein shortfall without requiring us to acquire dramatic new tastes in food.Insects can be a sustainable alternative to soy and fishmeal in particular. Not only are insects already part of the natural diet of cattle, pigs, poultry, and fish, but insects deliver an important source of high-quality protein and polyunsaturated fats.Farming insects is also hugely cost-efficient and suitable for many climates. I first began breeding Molitor/mealworm larvae at Ÿnsect, the company I co-founded in 2011, and discovered just how energy efficient it was. Insects require very little water, can be grown in the dark all year round, have no impact on sea or freshwater biodiversity, and even lead to improvements in land use productivity.Specialists and scientists have known about the Molitor species for a long time. The mealworm (the larval form of the Tenebrio Molitor beetle) is comprised of more than 70% protein and is a natural source of nutrients for a wide array of animals, including fish, poultry, pigs, dogs, and cats.It is also the insect species most suited to industrial development. It is a naturally gregarious, nocturnal species, which, from a practical standpoint, makes breeding easier. It brings real added value to the market for alternative protein sources thanks to its nutrient-packed content and unique health benefits for plants and animals.Our chosen technology and insect species allow us to fully focus on sustainable development: to do more with less; to use fewer resources to feed plants and animals; to use fewer antibiotics and pesticides; to reduce our physical footprint.Given its intrinsic qualities, the Molitor is perfectly placed to promote a circular economy. The mealworm consumes all sorts of organic matter, even low-grade materials. It grows quickly and requires less space, less earth and less water than other animal protein sources. It also releases less ammonia and fewer greenhouses gases than other premium animal proteins. The entire production system is modelled on a circular economy with zero-waste. The Molitor protein is produced using fewer antibiotics and chemical fertilizers and the final product is 72% protein, with proven nutritional and health benefits for aquaculture and pets. With two billion more people to feed within a matter of 30 years and fish being the fastest-growing source of protein for human consumption globally, insect protein can play a pivotal role in closing the gap.I envision a time when insect protein is at the start of the food chain for almost everything consumers eat. And even our plants will be supercharged with fertilizers derived from insects applied to increase yields.Putting insects back to their rightful place at the start of the food chain will give our planet much more breathing space than misguidedly trying to force everyone to give up meat and dairy. With insect farming, we are creating a new and highly sustainable agrifood industry, backed by extremely innovative tried-and-tested production facilities. Hopefully, the big brand beasts at the top of the global food chain will soon realize this, and will back the logical solution to the protein crisis rather than simply jumping on the popular bandwagon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aTenebrio molitor 3aammonia 3aanimal growth 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3abreathing 3abreeding 3acats 3acattle 3acircular economy 3aclimate 3acost effectiveness 3acrop production 3adairy products 3adeforestation 3adogs 3aenergy efficiency 3afarmed fish 3afish meal 3afish oils 3afood chain 3afood industry 3afood production 3afreshwater 3agases 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouses 3aheat 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3aindustrialization 3aingredients 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect proteins 3ainsect rearing 3ainsects 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amarkets 3ameat 3amineral fertilizers 3anutrients 3anutritionists 3aorganic matter 3apesticides 3apets 3aplants (botany) 3apoultry 3aprotein content 3aprotein sources 3aprotein synthesis 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asoil resources 3asoybeans 3asustainable development 3aswine 3azero wastes 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aSouth America0 tComptes rendus.g2019 Sept.,  Oct., v. 342, no. 7-8 p.276-277dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:12404x1631-06917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crvi.2019.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014600164300001800310520100900328592002801337650001201365650002401377650001101401650001701412650001601429650001801445650001101463650002101474650001101495650001201506650001401518650001401532650001301546650001301559650003701572700001601609700002001625700002401645700002101669700002201690700002301712773008101735856008101816852000901897655001201906IND60551364020221117220843.0161018e20140429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055136402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCmoch, Piotr10aSynthesis and structure–activity relationship study of cytotoxic lupane-type 3β-O-monodesmosidic saponins with an extended C-28 side chain  ap. 2717-2730.  aA concise synthesis of lupane triterpenes with an elongated carbon chain at the C-28 position, as well as saponins containing d-mannose, l-arabinose, and l-rhamnose moieties at the C-3 position is described. The overall synthesis of the new triterpenes involved seven linear steps starting from natural betulin: selective protection of a hydroxyl group, oxidation, elongation of the carbon chain by Grignard reaction, and deoxygenation. O-Glycosides were obtained by glycosylation of triterpenes with classical Schmidt's donors. Additionally, all new compounds were evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxic activities. Several triterpenes and the corresponding saponins exhibited an interesting cytotoxic activity profile against human cancer cell lines. The therapeutical index of active triterpenes is very high, since almost none of them were cytotoxic for normal BJ fibroblasts. These results open the way to the synthesis of various lupane-type saponin derivatives as potentially bioactive compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abetulin 3abioactive compounds 3acarbon 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3alupane 3amannose 3aneoplasms 3aoxidation 3arhamnose 3asaponins 3astructure-activity relationships1 aKorda, Anna1 aRárová, Lucie1 aOklešťková, Jana1 aStrnad, Miroslav1 aLuboradzki, Roman1 aPakulski, Zbigniew0 tTetrahedron.g2014 Apr. 29, v. 70 p.2717-2730dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2014.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002400168245009400192300001600286520097600302592002801278650001701306650001701323650001901340650001201359650001401371650001001385650001301395650001401408650001301422650001601435650001501451650001501466650001201481650001001493650001201503650002201515650002801537650001801565650001101583650001701594650002701611650001101638650002401649650000901673650000901682650001601691650003201707650001001739650001601749651001001765651001601775651001101791651001001802651001601812651001101828700001701839700002201856700001701878700002401895773008401919856008502003852000902088655001202097IND4468347520221119015613.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446834752DNAL7 a221727652pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHersleth, Margrethe10aLamb meat — Importance of origin and grazing system for Italian and Norwegian consumers  ap. 899-907.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the importance of geographic origin and grazing system for Norwegian and Italian consumers' probability of buying lamb meat. The study consisted of a qualitative part with focus groups followed up with a quantitative survey in each country. Included in the survey was a conjoint design with origin of the meat (Norway, Italy and New Zealand) and pasture (lowland pasture and mountain pasture) as factors, plus questions about consumers' motives underlying selection of food. Results from the study shows that country of origin is important for consumers' buying probability of lamb meat, in both countries domestic meat was preferred. In addition, a higher probability of buying meat from lamb grazing on mountain pasture than from lamb grazing on lowland pasture was identified. It is important for producers of lamb meat to increase the communication of these elements in a competitive national and international food market.  aPublisher supplied data 3afocus groups 3afood choices 3afood marketing 3agrazing 3alamb meat 3alambs 3alowlands 3amountains 3apastures 3aprobability 3aprovenance 3apurchasing 3asurveys 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aConsumer Behavior 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aFocus Groups 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMale 2aMeat 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSheep 2aYoung Adult 3aItaly 3aNew Zealand 3aNorway 0aItaly 0aNew Zealand 0aNorway1 aNæs, Tormod1 aRødbotten, Marit1 aLind, Vibeke1 aMonteleone, Erminio0 tMeat science.g2012 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.899-907dElsevier Ltdx0309-17407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011000172500001900282520085300301592002801154650001301182650001701195650001901212650001701231653002101248653002001269653001201289653002101301653002701322700002601349700001901375700002301394773013401417856008501551852000901636655001201645IND60702710920221121122927.0200831e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070271092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2020.1058032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotawe, Zeinab Y.10aPRE-084 as a tool to uncover potential therapeutic applications for selective sigma-1 receptor activation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe discovery of a highly selective putative sigma-1 (σ1) receptor agonist, PRE-084, has revealed the numerous potential uses of this receptor subtype as a therapeutic target. While much work has been devoted to determining the role of σ1 receptors in normal and pathophysiological states in the nervous system, recent work suggests that σ1 receptors may be important for modulating functions of other tissues. These discoveries have provided novel insights into σ1 receptor structure, function, and importance in multiple intracellular signaling mechanisms. These discoveries were made possible by σ1 receptor-selective agonists such as PRE-084.

Logarithmic phase cells of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43895) were exposed to EGCG and citric acid respectively. The results of RT‐real time PCR showed that both EGCG and citric acid increased stx2 and oxyR expression and decreased stx1, recA and Q expression. The result of Western blotting for RecA protein further indicated that both EGCG and citric acid decreased RecA production. Both EGCG and citric acid increased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species and H₂O₂ production and decreased superoxide dismutase activity. Therefore, EGCG and citric acid might induce stx2 production by increasing oxidative stress response and inhibit stx1 production by suppressing SOS response. In our study, the differential effects of the two antimicrobials were observed. EGCG reduced ompC and rpoS expression. However, citric acid caused an increase in ompC and rpoS expression. Membrane permeability is associated with toxin release. Citric acid increased the outer membrane permeability of E. coli O157:H7. However, the outer membrane of E. coli O157:H7 remained unaffected by EGCG. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Shiga toxins are the major virulence factors of Escherichia coli O157:H7. The use of antimicrobials triggering Shiga toxin production is controversial. (‐)‐epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate (EGCG) citric acid are often used singly or in combination to prevent micro‐organisms in some food products. This study evaluated toxin induction in E. coli O157:H7 in response to EGCG and citric acid and investigated the potential mechanism of action. The findings may contribute to the proper use of EGCG and citric acid as antimicrobials.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC1600103cNational Key R&D Program of China  a31471660cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aShiga toxin 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-infective agents 3acitric acid 3aenzyme activity 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3afoods 3agene expression 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amechanism of action 3amembrane permeability 3amicroorganisms 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoxidative stress 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avirulence1 aTang, C.B.1 aXiao, J.1 aDu, W.F.1 aLi, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2707-327X0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2018 Nov., v. 67, no. 5 p.435-441dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.130583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007900160300001800239520135000257592002801607650001101635650001001646650001001656650001001666650001301676650001201689650000901701650001301710650001201723650001201735650001301747650000901760650001101769650001501780650001101795650001401806650001301820650001701833650000901850650001401859650001201873650001101885650000901896650001101905650000901916650001301925650002101938650002301959650000901982700002201991700002302013773010402036856007502140852000902215655001202224IND60534061120170630000000.0160802e20130221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053406112DNAL7 a10.1021/ef30111462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiinikka, Henrik10aEmissions of Heavy Metals during Fixed-Bed Combustion of Six Biomass Fuels  ap. 1073-1080.  aFew studies examine heavy metal emissions during the small-scale combustion of various solid biofuels. This issue may become more important, as one can expect new regulations governing such emissions from biomass combustion similar to those governing waste incineration. This paper investigates the emissions of particulate-associated heavy metals (i.e., Sb, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, Tl, V, Hg, and Zn) during the fixed-bed combustion of six solid biofuels (i.e., stemwood from birch and pine/spruce, bark from birch and pine, salix, and oat grains) and of peat and bituminous coal for comparison. The results indicate that the flue gas concentration (normalized to 11% O₂) of the sum of all measured metals (Zn excluded) during the biomass combustion tests ranged from 57 μg Nm–³ for birch stemwood to 198 μg Nm–³ for birch bark. The concentration of Zn in the flue gas was generally considerably higher than those of the other metals, ranging from 646 μg Nm–³ for spruce/pine stemwood to 7948 μg Nm–³ for birch bark. Compared with coal and peat, the biomass fuels produced higher Zn emissions, but lower or similar emissions of the sum of the other metals. The volatile behavior and concentration of the metal in the flue gases as a function of the heavy metal in the fuel are also presented for selected heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aPicea 3aPinus 3aSalix 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3abark 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoal 3acobalt 3acombustion 3acopper 3aemissions 3aflue gas 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3anickel 3aoats 3aoxygen 3apeat 3astemwood 3asuperoxide anion 3awaste incineration 3azinc1 aGrönberg, Carola1 aBoman, Christoffer0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Feb. 21, v. 27, no. 2 p.1073-1080dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef30111463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245020100158300002000359520130600379592002801685650002001713650002501733650001201758650001601770650001801786700001501804700001701819700001701836700001801853700001801871700001501889700001701904773014501921856007402066852000902140655001202149IND60671175920221118171232.0191002e20150922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067117592DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta04469c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shaojun10aNew insights into multi-shape memory behaviours and liquid crystalline properties of supramolecular polyurethane complexes based on pyridine-containing polyurethane and 4-octyldecyloxybenzoic acid  ap. 19525-19538.  aBoth liquid crystalline polymers and shape memory polymers are attractive to researchers. This paper describes the development of a supramolecular liquid crystalline complex exhibiting a multi-shape memory effect and liquid crystalline properties. 4-n-Octyldecyloxybenzoic acid (OOBA) is connected to a pyridine-containing polyurethane (PySMPU), forming a new PySMPU/OOBA complex. The results of this study demonstrate that the complex maintains the intrinsic crystallization and liquid-crystalline properties of OOBA and combines the shape memory effects of PySMPUs. Shape memory investigations demonstrate that the PySMPU/OOBA complexes have a good multi-shape memory effect, exhibiting triple- and quadruple-shape memory behaviours. For the triple-shape memory behaviours, the strain fixity at the first stage is lower than that at the second stage, while the strain recovery at the first stage is higher than that at the second stage. Overall, increasing the OOBA content improves the strain fixity but reduces the strain recovery due to the lubrication of the OOBA long chains. The successful combination of the liquid crystalline properties and multi-shape memory effect makes the PySMPU/OOBA complexes potentially applicable in smart optical devices, smart electronic devices and smart sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aelectronic equipment 3aliquids 3alubrication 3apolyurethanes1 aMo, Funian1 aChen, Shiguo1 aGe, Zaochuan1 aYang, Haipeng1 aZuo, Jiandong1 aLiu, Xinke1 aZhuo, Haitao0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Sept. 22, v. 3, no. 38 p.19525-19538dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta04469c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245007100173300001600244520125900260592002801519650001701547650001601564650002301580650002401603650001401627650001701641650002301658650001301681650002101694650001301715650001901728650001901747650002201766773011601788856008301904852000901987655001201996IND60624124920221118212808.0181201e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062412492DNAL7 a10.1177/01154265060210054302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrankenfield, David10aEnergy Expenditure and Protein Requirements After Traumatic Injury  ap. 430-437.  aTraumatic injury induces hypermetabolism. The degree of hypermetabolism can be variable, depending on the type of injury, the degree of inflammation, body composition, age, and treatment regimens. To estimate metabolic rate in some types of injury, predictive equations have been published. Some of these equations have been tested in validation studies. For other types of injury, equations do not exist. Some expert panels have recommended measuring in lieu of estimating metabolic rate, though studies have not been performed to determine whether clinical outcome is affected by the method used to determine energy requirements. Traumatically injured patients are usually catabolic, but protein needs after traumatic injury continue to be debated. Some suggest that 1.5 g protein per kg body weight is adequate and that any additional protein is simply oxidized, adding to the nitrogen load to be excreted. Alternately, protein intake >2.0 g/kg body weight increases the absolute rate of body protein synthesis, and achievement of nitrogen balance has been associated with survival. Thus, provision of high-protein feeding to achieve nitrogen balance might be worthwhile, even if that balance is achieved at the cost of additional nitrogen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody protein 3abody weight 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy requirements 3aequations 3ainflammation 3ametabolic diseases 3anitrogen 3anitrogen balance 3apatients 3apollution load 3aprotein intake 3aprotein synthesis0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 21, no. 5 p.430-437dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01154265060210054303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011700176300001800293520144300311592002801754650001801782650001901800650001601819650002801835650001401863650001201877650001801889650001901907650001401926650002601940650001001966650001101976650002401987650001702011650001302028651001002041653001402051653001302065653002502078653001202103653001302115653002302128700003202151700003002183700002702213700003802240773009902278856008602377852000902463655001202472IND60585403720221121102324.0190401e20171218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058540372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDios-Guerra, Caridad10aPrevalence and factors associated with influenza vaccination of persons over 65 years old in Spain (2009–2014)  ap. 7095-7100.  aInfluenza is a major public health problem. Achieving 65% coverage in people over 65 years old is a health policy priority in Spain.To determine the coverage of influenza vaccination in Spain in 2014 for people over 65 years and to analyze the factors associated with coverage and its progression between 2009 and 2014.A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted that included 18,442 non-institutionalized individuals over 65 years who had participated in the National Health Survey in Spain in 2011 and in the European Health Survey in Spain in 2009 and 2014. Socio-demographic variables, health variables, and influenza vaccination data were used. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the variables associated with anti-influenza vaccination.Influenza vaccination coverage has declined from 2009 (74.5%) to 2014 (57.4%). There are significant differences in the vaccination coverage among the different Spanish autonomous communities in the different years studied. Influenza vaccination was associated with males, low social class, and low level of education. There is greater participation in other preventive measures, such as assessing blood pressure, blood glucose, and cholesterol, than in influenza vaccination.Fewer people over 65 years old than recommended by the WHO participated in the influenza vaccination campaign in Spain in 2014.

Routine detection of the disease is traditionally accomplished by the use of the Ray/Makin assay, using Fluid Thioglycollate Medium (RFTM). A simple real-time quantitative PCR assay was developed as a diagnostic tool to detect and quantify P. marinus, to complement and serve as an alternate to the RFTM method. Using a dual-labeled probe approach, a sensitive assay was designed to accurately detect a range of one to several thousand P. marinus organisms present in oyster tissues. A simple extraction method was used to increase throughput of the assay. Cultured P. marinus cells were quantified prior to DNA extraction, generating a standard curve and allowing cell counts to be derived from PCR cycle threshold values. Direct comparison of the RFTM and real-time PCR methods was accomplished by using tissue samples from the same oyster for both tests. Plotting cycle threshold values against the known Mackin index value generated a standard curve with a coefficient of regression of 0.9. Our results indicate that correlations could be made between this molecular based approach and traditional methods, allowing results generated from the PCR assay to be easily translated into the understood Mackin scale.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDermo 0aPerkinsus marinus 0areal-time PCR 0aRFTM 0aeastern oyster 0aCrassostrea virginica1 aSmolowitz, Roxanna M.1 aRoberts, Stevenq(Steven Beyer),0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2009 Aug., v. 28, no. 3 p.459-464dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.028.03063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012200169300001600291520103200307592002801339650002101367650004401388650002601432650002201458650001701480650002901497650002801526650002901554650001901583650001801602650002501620650003301645650001301678650002201691650002101713650001801734653003701752653002301789653001001812653002901822653001801851700001601869700001501885700001601900700001501916700001301931700005301944773010801997856008602105852000902191655001202200IND60629114820221121005947.0190329e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062911482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.12.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Yongsheng10aFacile fabrication of novel konjac glucomannan films with antibacterial properties via microfluidic spinning strategy  ap. 469-476.  aThe exploration of methods to produce biomaterials with antibacterial properties in ultra-small scales is of great scientific and technological interest. Here, we reported a microfluidic spinning approach to prepare a novel film combined with konjac glucomannan (KGM), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. This film was transparent, orderly, thermally stable, and uniform in size, with an average width less than 1 μm. Also, the film exhibited excellent antibacterial efficiency (97.1% against E. coli, 99.7% against S. aureus, 97.3% against S. enterica and 99.9% against B. subtilis) in our antibacterial test. In addition, the film promoted wound healing with the advanced development of neovascularization and hair follicles. This strategy provides a facile and green pathway for the construction of biomaterial films for medical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aangiogenesis 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatible materials 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3ahair follicles 3akonjac mannan 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspinning 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atissue repair 0aMicrofluidic spinning technology 0aKonjac glucomannan 0aFilms 0aAntibacterial properties 0aWound healing1 aLin, Wanmei1 aMu, Ruojun1 aWu, Chunhua1 aLin, Zheya1 aChen, Su1 aPang, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7061-52330 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 208 p.469-476dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.12.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010900155300001600264500002000280520168700300592002801987650002302015650002002038650001302058650001002071650001302081650001702094650002702111650001102138650001402149650002002163650001502183650001602198650002302214650001402237650001402251650001202265650002902277650002502306650002102331700002002352773011202372856007302484852000902557655001202566IND60585651220221117234834.0171112e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058565122DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.123922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoluša, J.10aPathogen's level and parasitism rate in Ips typographus at high population densities: importance of time  ap. 768-779.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe compared the levels of pathogen infection in parental beetles, parasitism of the offspring, abundance of predators and breeding performance success of univoltine populations of Ips typographus in plots characterized by short‐term (2–3 years) outbreaks vs. those with long‐term (>10 years) outbreaks on two localities at ca. 1100 m altitude in the Šumava Mts. The numbers of I. typographus were high in all plots, whether the plots were characterized by long‐term outbreaks or short‐term outbreaks. The numbers of maternal galleries in the sample areas ranged from 300 to 400 per m². The density of parental beetle galleries, abundance of surviving specimens of I. typographus, and length of maternal galleries did not differ between plots. The short‐term outbreaks had only fewer ectoparasitoids of I. typographus and a lower percentage of parasitism and infection level of Mattesia schwenkei than the long‐term outbreaks even though the maternal gallery densities and beetle production were the same. The most mortality appeared to be caused by intraspecific larval competition, and the identical reproductive success in plots with short‐term and long‐term outbreaks indicates that the negative feedback resulting from parasitoids and entomopathogens does not substantially reduce beetle numbers. Although entomopathogenic fungi as Beauveria bassiana occur naturally in the galleries of spruce bark beetles, there was no evidence of its presence in the studied population. The low levels of predation and/or parasitism in both kinds of plots indicate that natural enemies did not play a significant role in reducing outbreak numbers of I. typographus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aIps typographus 3aMattesia 3aPicea 3aaltitude 3abark beetles 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3alarvae 3amortality 3anatural enemies 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apopulation density 3apredation 3apredators 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3areproductive success 3aunivoltine habit1 aLukášová, K.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2017 Nov., v. 141, no. 9 p.768-779dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.123923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245009500158300001600253520123900269592002801508653002301536653001101559653001201570653001101582653001101593700001801604700002001622700001501642700001401657700001601671700001401687700001601701773012401717856007801841852000901919655001201928IND60130369020221122060547.0151127e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013036902DNAL7 a10.2983/035.028.03072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhifeng, Gu10aGrowth of Cultured Pearl Oyster (Pinctada martensii) in Li'an Lagoon, Hainan Island, China  ap. 465-470.  aGrowth of pearl oysters, Pinctada martensii was studied from June 2003 to March 2005 in Li'an Lagoon of Hainan Island in China.

Especially, in recent years, it's aimed to produce plants which are more resistant to abiotic stress factors and have high nutritional value, productivity.In this study, it's aimed to induce salt stress tolerant mutants of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) which is one the most important agricultural products in the world, by gamma radiation. For this purpose, appropriate mutation doses determined by irradiating Guadalupe wheat seeds with various gamma radiation doses and then seeds irradiated by mutation dose and control planted to experimental land for 3 years to generate M2 and M3 generations.Mature embryos of seeds belonging to M3 generation experimental group which were harvested from experimental land. Then we have been focusing on selecting putative salt tolerant mutant under tissue culture conditions and characterizing them using ISSR markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagricultural land 3agamma radiation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutants 3amutation 3anutrient requirements 3anutritive value 3aplanting 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseeds 3atissue culture 3awheat 0aWheat 0aSalt Tolerance 0aGamma Radiation 0aISSR1 aŞen, Ayşe,1 aALIKAMANOGLU, SEMA0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2015, v. 29 p.196-196dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.2583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245010500161300001600266520160700282592002801889650001001917650002501927650001901952650001101971650001301982650002401995650001302019650001202032650002402044650001002068773009502078856007102173852000902244655001202253IND60518489620221116235930.0160417e196805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051848962DNAL7 a10.2307/19341082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSturman, William A.10aDescription and Analysis of Breeding Habitats of the Chickadees, Parus Atricapillus and P. Rufescens  ap. 418-431.  aThe breeding habitats of Parus rufescens and P. atricapillus are largely nonoverlapping. A multiple regression analysis was used to describe carefully their breeding habitats and to analyze the extent of their coexistence. The abundance of P. rufescens is most highly correlated with the percent of the upper story canopy volume which is coniferous and the average height of the upper story conifers; taken together, these 2 variables account for more than 90% of the variability in the observed abundances. For P. atricapillus, the canopy volume of all trees, all bushes, and middle story trees together most accurately predict its abundance; the regression of these 3 variables on abundance accounts for over 90% of the variability in the observed abundances of P. articapillus on the study areas. Evidence is presented which supports the view that it is these features of the habitat to which the chickadees respond in selecting a breeding habitat. On the San Juan Islands, from which P. atricapillus is absent, P. rufescens was seen to breed in a broadleafed area. On the mainland it was not seen to breed in a comparable situation. However, P. rufescens appears to be more abundant on the island, and this greater abundance may have caused some individuals to select the "vacant" broadleafed area instead of the preferred conifers. Further observations in the broadleafed trees on Vancouver Island are needed to test further the idea that the absence of P. Atricapillus from it and the San Juan Islands has led to a modification in the habitat selection mechanism of P. rufescens on these islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus 3aPoecile atricapillus 3abreeding sites 3acanopy 3aconifers 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aislands 3aregression analysis 3atrees0 tEcology.g1968 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.418-431dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19341083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012800178300001600306520124700322592002801569650001301597650001501610650001701625650002701642650001101669650001401680650002301694650002201717650001701739650002101756650002301777653002401800653001601824653002101840653001201861653002101873700002201894700001801916700001901934773011701953856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60112543420221120134550.0190410e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011254342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2012.10.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInarejos-García, A.M.10aEvaluation of minor components, sensory characteristics and quality of virgin olive oil by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy  ap. 250-258.  aChemometric analyses of NIR spectral data (12,500–4000cm−1) combined with analytical and sensory parameters measured in monovarietal Cornicabra virgin olive oils (VOOs) (n=97) produced in the PDO (Protected Denomination of Origin) “Montes de Toledo” geographic area were used to generate calibration and validation models in order to be able to predict the minor composition of VOO, in particular its phenolic and volatile compounds as well as its organoleptic attributes, and thereby the global quality of the product. Acceptable multivariate algorithms were obtained for VOOs' degree of unsaturation (fatty acid profile) (r=0.84–0.96), several minor components – in particular hydroxytyrosol derivatives (r=0.86–0.88) and C6 alcohols (r=0.69–0.80) – as well as for positive sensory attributes — ‘fruity’ (r=0.87) and ‘bitter’ (r=0.85). The results establish that near infrared is a very useful technique that allows rapid screening of VOO samples to estimate their minor composition and sensory characteristics, and thereby their quality and commercial grade. Furthermore, it may give real time information about olive oil composition during processing in order to automatically control technological parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aalgorithms 3achemometrics 3afatty acid composition 3amodels 3ascreening 3asensory properties 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3avirgin olive oil 3avolatile compounds 0aNear infrared (NIR) 0aChemometric 0aMinor components 0aSensory 0aVirgin olive oil1 aGómez-Alonso, S.1 aFregapane, G.1 aSalvador, M.D.0 tFood research international.g2013 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.250-258dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2012.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012200162300001800284520105700302592002801359650001101387650001901398650001301417650001101430650003801441650000901479650001201488650002101500650001101521650001401532650001101546650001501557650001601572650002401588650002201612650002101634700002101655700002301676700002201699773012101721856007401842852000901916655001201925IND60664453320221119095824.0190912e20130402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066445332DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40356d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhaskar, Aiswarya10aThermal stability of Li₁₋ΔM₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ (M = Fe, Co, Ni) cathodes in different states of delithiation Δ  ap. 5909-5916.  aThe thermal stability of sol–gel synthesized Li₁₋ΔM₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ (M = Fe, Co, Ni) electrodes with different degrees of delithiation were analyzed with TG-DSC and in situ synchrotron diffraction under an Ar atmosphere and compared. The onset temperatures for structural degradation are dependent on the amount of lithium 1−Δ in the sample. The Li₁₋ΔFe₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ electrode exhibited the highest thermal stability among the three materials with different dopant M. The reason for this difference is discussed with respect to the oxidation states of the transition metals. The mechanism of degradation for M = Fe, Co was found to be through gas evolution, mainly CO₂ and O₂, and the carbon conductive additive was found to play a major role in the thermal degradation process. For delithiated Li₁₋ΔNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ the temperature induced degradation includes phase separation into Mn₃O₄ with spinel structure and LiₓNi₁₋ₓO with rock-salt structure together with oxygen and carbon dioxide release.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acathodes 3acobalt 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3airon 3alithium 3amanganese oxides 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aseparation 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aGruner, Wolfgang1 a, Daria Mikhailova1 aEhrenberg, Helmut0 tRSC advances.g2013 Apr. 2, v. 3, no. 17 p.5909-5916dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra40356d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245008000215300001800295520158200313592002801895650003501923650002001958650001001978650000901988650002401997650001702021650002202038650001302060650001302073650001402086650001702100650003002117650002002147650002102167650000902188650002802197650002402225650002602249650001802275650001202293700001902305700002202324700001902346700002202365700001902387700002402406773009502430856008502525990002302610852000902633655001202642IND60098328420221120095544.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009832842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.09.0012doi7 aPMC38181232pmcid7 a240180412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBansal, Geetanjali13aIL-22 activates oxidant signaling in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells  ap. 2727-2733.  aReactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate cell-signaling processes in response to various ligands and play important roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The present study reports that interleukin-22 (IL-22) elicits signal transduction in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) through a ROS-dependent mechanism. We find that pulmonary artery SMCs express IL-22 receptor alpha 1 and that IL-22 activates STAT3 through this receptor. IL-22-induced signaling is found to be mediated by NADPH oxidase, as indicated by the observations that the inhibition and siRNA knock-down of this enzyme inhibit IL-22 signaling. IL-22 triggers the oxidative modifications of proteins through protein carbonylation and protein glutathionylation. Mass spectrometry identified some proteins that are carbonylated in response to IL-22 stimulation, including α-enolase, heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, mitochondrial 60kDa heat shock protein, and cytoplasmic 2 actin and determined that α-tubulin is glutathionylated. Protein glutathionylation and STAT3 phosphorylation are enhanced by the siRNA knock-down of glutaredoxin, while IL-22-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation is suppressed by knocking down thioredoxin interacting protein, an inhibitor of thioredoxin. IL-22 is also found to promote the growth of SMCs via NADPH oxidase. In rats, pulmonary hypertension is found to be associated with increased smooth muscle IL-22 expression. These results show that IL-22 promotes the growth of pulmonary vascular SMCs via a signaling mechanism that involves NADPH oxidase-dependent oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aactin 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3ahypertension 3amass spectrometry 3amyocytes 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apathogenesis 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aphosphorylation 3apulmonary artery 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3asmooth muscle 3atubulin1 aDas, Dividutta1 aHsieh, Cheng-Ying1 aWang, Yi-Hsuan1 aGilmore, Brent A.1 aWong, Chi-Ming1 aSuzuki, Yuichiro J.0 tCellular signalling.g2013 Dec., v. 25, no. 12 p.2727-2733dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01295naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245010900163300001600272520023300288592002800521650002500549650002100574650001800595653001900613653002600632653002400658653001700682700001300699700002100712773015000733856007700883852000900960655001200969IND60521681620221119144502.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052168162DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1982-07172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBukovits, G.

The objective of this research was to develop a decision support tool predicting the impact of biochar additions on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat). Four different kinds of biochar were added to four different textured soils (coarse sand, fine sand, loam, and clay texture) to assess these effects at the rates of 0%, 1%, 2%, and 5% (w/w). The Ksat of the biochar amended soils were significantly influenced by the rate and type of biochar, as well as the original particle size of soil. The Ksat decreased when biochar was added to coarse and fine sands. Biochar with larger particles sizes (60%; >1mm) decreased Ksat to a larger degree than the smaller particle size biochar (60%; <1mm) in the two sandy textured soils. Increasing tortuosity in the biochar amended sandy soil could explain this behavior. On the other hand, for the clay loam 1% and 2% biochar additions universally increased the Ksat with higher biochar amounts providing no further alterations. The developed model utilizes soil texture pedotransfer functions for predicting agricultural soil Ksat as a function of soil texture. The model accurately predicted the direction of the Ksat influence, even though the exact magnitude still requires further refinement. This represents the first step to a unified theory behind the impact of biochar additions on soil saturated conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3abiochar 3abiomass 3aclay 3aclay loam soils 3adecision support systems 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apedotransfer functions 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3asand 3asandy soils 3asoil amendments 3asoil texture 3atexture 0aBiochar 0aSaturated hydraulic conductivity 0aSoil texture1 aSpokas, K.A.1 aFeyereisen, G.1 aNovak, J.M.0 tChemosphere.g2016 Jan., v. 142 p.136-144dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.06.0693Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007800170300001600248520089900264592002801163650001601191650001301207650002401220650001601244653002901260653001301289653001501302700002401317773007101341856008401412852000901496655001201505IND60559511620221120123848.0161216e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055951162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.08.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArao, Yoshihiko10aHigh-rate production of few-layer graphene by high-power probe sonication  ap. 802-808.  aGraphene can be obtained via sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation, but the production rate of few-layer graphene (FLG) is still low. A high-power probe sonicator was used in this study to improve the production rate of FLG, and its performance was optimized by controlling processing parameters such as the initial graphite concentration, surfactant concentration and liquid volume. By optimizing processing parameters, production rate of FLG dispersions in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were greater than 1 g/h, which is the best value achieved in the sonication-assisted exfoliation process. In the case of liquid exfoliation in water/surfactant solution, production rate of FLG was achieved approximately 0.28 g/h. Our work here demonstrates that graphene concentration in a probe-sonication process does not depend on the shape of vessel, and it is predictable by power law models.  aPublisher supplied data 3adispersions 3agraphene 3amathematical models 3asurfactants 0aLiquid-phase exfoliation 0aGraphene 0aSonication1 aKubouchi, Masatoshi0 tCarbon.g2015 Dec., v. 95 p.802-808dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.08.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011700164300001600281520141600297592002801713650001701741650002401758650001901782650001801801653003301819653001901852653001701871653001301888653001701901700001401918700001501932700001801947700001801965700001301983773009001996856008502086852000902171655001202180IND60560457220221117225918.0180830e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056045722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.12.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Hang14aThe impact of pitch motion of a platform on the aerodynamic performance of a floating vertical axis wind turbine  ap. 369-383.  aThe flow-field around the offshore floating vertical axis wind turbines (OF-VAWTs) is affected by the six-degrees of freedom (6-DOF) movement of the platforms. Understanding the impact of a certain DOF motion on the aerodynamics is beneficial to the design of wind turbines. In this paper, the aerodynamics and performance of a scale OF-VAWT in pitch motion are investigated. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method with the turbulence model of improved delayed detached eddy simulation (IDDES) and the overset mesh technique are employed to analyze the characteristics of pitch motion of wind turbines. The CFD model is verified by the experimental data from available literature when the turbine has no-pitch motion. Then, the aerodynamic forces, power, and wake of an OF-VAWT in periodical pitch motion are analyzed. Because of the varying wave loads, an unsteady aerodynamic analysis considering the pitch motion with different periods and amplitudes is performed. The results show that the pitch motion can improve the power output of the OF-VAWTs, and enlarge the variation ranges of aerodynamic force coefficients. Meanwhile, the graphs of the vortex structure show that the complex flow interaction emerges around the rotor blades. Additionally, the power coefficient and the instantaneous aerodynamic forces coefficients sensitively change with different pitching periods and pitching amplitudes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3amathematical models 3aturbulent flow 3awind turbines 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aFloating VAWTs 0aPitch motion 0a3D IDDES 0aAerodynamics1 aZhou, Dai1 aLu, Jiabao1 aChen, Caiyong1 aHan, Zhaolong1 aBao, Yan0 tEnergy.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 119 p.369-383dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.12.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100004000144245013300184300001800317500002000335520181300355592002802168596008702196650001202283650001402295650003602309650002202345650001002367650001202377650002402389650001802413650001502431650004302446650001202489650002202501650001302523650002002536650001602556700003002572700002502602700002102627700001802648773012002666856007802786852000902864655001202873IND60616234020221121124808.0181015e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061623402DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2018002202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForoughbakhshfasaei, Mohammadhassan10aEnantiomeric quality control of R‐Tofisopam by HPLC using polysaccharide‐type chiral stationary phases in polar organic mode  ap. 2566-2574.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA novel, fast and economic chiral HPLC method was developed and validated for the resolution of the four isomers of tofisopam. The separation capacity of eleven different chiral columns: six polysaccharide‐type including three amylose‐based (Chiralpak AD, Chiralpak AD‐RH and Chiralpak AS) and three cellulose‐based (Chiralcel OD, Chiralcel OJ and Lux Cellulose‐4); three cyclodextrin‐ (Quest‐BC, Quest‐C2 and Quest‐CM) and two macrocyclic glycopeptide antibiotic‐type (Chirobiotic T and Chirobiotic TAG) were screened using polar organic or reversed‐phase mode. Chiralpak AD, based on amylose tris(3,5‐dimethylphenylcarbamate) as chiral selector with neat methanol was identified as the most promising system. In order to improve resolution, an orthogonal experimental design was employed, altering the concentration of 2‐propanol, column temperature, and flow rate in a multivariate manner. Using the optimized method (85/15 v/v methanol/2‐propanol, 40°C, flow rate: 0.7 mL/min) we were not only able to separate the four isomers but also detect 0.1% S‐enantiomer as chiral impurity in R‐tofisopam. This is important since the latter is under development as a single enantiomeric agent. Thermodynamic investigation revealed an unusual entropy and enthalpy‐entropy co‐driven controlled enantioseparation on Chiralcel OJ and on Chiralpak AD column, respectively. Our newly developed HPLC method was validated according to the ICH guidelines and its application was tested on a pharmaceutical formulation containing the racemic mixture of the drug. As a further novelty, a separate circular dichroism method was applied for the investigation of the interconversion kinetics of tofisopam conformers, which proved to be crucial for sample preparation and method validation.  aPublisher supplied data  aÚNKP‐17‐4 New National Excellence ProgramcEmberi Eroforrások Minisztériuma 3aamylose 3acellulose 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3aentropy 3aexperimental design 3aglycopeptides 3aguidelines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aisomers 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amethanol 3aquality control 3atemperature1 aSzabó, Zoltán‐István1 aMirzahosseini, Arash1 aHorváth, Péter1 aTóth, Gergő0 tElectrophoresis.g2018 Oct., v. 39, no. 20 p.2566-2574dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2018002203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001900161245006100180300001800241500000900259500001500268520171300283592002801996650001802024650001002042650002202052650001802074650001502092650002202107650002202129650002302151650002002174650001902194651001102213653002202224653001802246700002002264773012402284852000902408856009802417655001202515IND2043620320221118011144.0191122e199409  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204362032DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1994.0011183X003400050035x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteiner, J.

Bieb.) is a slow-establishing rhizomatous perennial that has lower seed yields the year after establishment than in subsequent years of production. For new forage crops such as kura clover to be utilized, adequate seed supplies must be available. The objective of this research was to determine whether ‘Rhizo’ kura clover grown for seed can be established with intercropped wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to increase seed grower net income. Kura clover was planted in spring 1989 and 1990. The clover was grown alone (sole-cropped) and intercropped with companion-planted wheat in 15- and 30-cm rows and with relay-planted wheat in 20- and 40-cm rows. The clover was established with sprinkler irrigation. Sole-crop kura clover establishment was superior to clover intercropped with wheat. When clover was grown with intercropped wheat, establishment was superior with wide-spaced compared to narrow-spaced wheat. The delay in clover establishment from spring-planted clover relay-intercropped with fall-planted wheat was similar to spring-planted clover companion-intercropped with wheat. Kura clover was more tolerant of relay- than companion-intercropping because clover seedlings were allowed to establish before the onset of wheat crop competition. Spring-planted kura clover relay-intercropped with fall-planted wheat in 40-cm rows had the greatest economic return of all treatments. Depending on seed price, all kura clover production systems could be made profitable. However, none of the profitable clover production systems had net income returns equal to wheat grown alone.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control analysis. The quality of 145 embryos after PBB was compared to 276 embryos of the same group of women without biopsy. SETTING: University-based tertiary-care medical center. PATIENT(S): Women with inherited genetics disease. INTERVENTION(S): Laser PBB of IVF embryos for genetic diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The study and control embryos were compared for fertilization rate, pronuclear grading, and cleavage-stage parameters on days 1, 2, and 3 after oocyte retrieval. RESULT(S): The study embryos demonstrated higher rates of cleavage arrest (3.6% vs. 0.7%), higher rate of significant fragmentation on day 2 (9.5% vs. 3.0%), and lower rate of good cleavage embryos on day 2 (69.1% vs. 78.4%) compared with control embryos. On day 3, the study embryos had lower cleavage rates (six or more blastomeres; 56.5% vs. 74.5%), higher fragmentation (11.7% vs. 3.9%), higher rate of embryos presenting inferior cleavage pattern (57.2% vs. 38.5%), and lower mean blastomere number (5.8 ± 2.1 vs. 6.6 ± 1.9) compared with control embryos.

P. mali),” the causal agent of apple proliferation, were developed. The assays amplify a fragment of the imp gene and amplimers were detected either by fluorescence in real‐time mode (TwistAmp®exo assay) using a fluorophore‐labelled probe or by direct visualization employing a lateral flow device (TwistAmp®nfo assay/Milenia®HybriDetect). The RPA assays specifically amplified DNA from “Ca. P. mali” strains, and cross‐reactivity with other phytoplasmas or plant DNA was not observed. The limit of detection was determined with a cloned imp standard, and positive results were obtained down to 10 copies with both RPA assay formats. In comparison with a TaqMan real‐time PCR assay based on the same target gene, the RPA assays were equally sensitive, but results were obtained faster. Simplified nucleic acid extraction procedures from plant tissue with Tris‐ and CTAB‐based buffers revealed that crude Tris–DNA extracts were a suitable source for RPA tests while larger concentrations of CTAB were inhibitory. This is the first report of RPA‐based assays for the detection of “Ca. P. mali”. The assays are suitable for high‐throughput screening of plant material and point‐of‐care diagnostic and can be potentially combined with a simplified DNA extraction procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandidatus Phytoplasma mali 3aDNA 3aapples 3abuffers 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3agenes 3aplant tissues 3apoint-of-care systems 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3ascreening1 aSchneider, Bernd0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2017 Dec., v. 165, no. 11-12 p.762-770dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.126163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04055naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245009300153300001600246520267000262592002802932650001502960650001102975650001302986650001302999650002003012650001903032650002603051650001303077650001303090650001103103650001403114650001803128650002603146650001503172650000903187650001703196650002403213650001503237650001903252650001503271650002003286650001603306650001503322650001003337650001403347773009603361856007103457852000903528655001203537IND60518488420221116235844.0160417e196803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051848842DNAL7 a10.2307/19344592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebb, L. J.10aEnvironmental Relationships of the Structural Types of Australian Rain Forest Vegetation  ap. 296-311.  aThe physiognomic—structural features used to classify Australian rain forest vegetation into 20 structural types vary along different gradients. The high correlation demonstrated between the structural types and the climatic and edaphic factors enables the identificatin of habitat types which are defined by limits of mean annual temperature and rainfall, and soil mineral status and soil drainage. The physiognomic—structural features are arranged in a hierarchical table. The primary division into vine, fern, and moss forests corresponds with tropical—subtropical, warm temperate (submontane), and cool temperate (montane) thermal regions, respectively. The temperate forms are strictly evergreen. Further subdivision of the vine forests into evergreen (including associated sclerophyll forests) and raingreen (more of less deciduous) types is correlated with differences in soil mineral status as inferred from topography, depth of soil, and parent materials. The tropical forms are differentiated from the sub—tropical forms by a higher proportion of mesophyll than notophyll leaf sizes. Further differentiation of vine forests with complex, mixed, and simple structure is correlated with inferred soil nutrient status defined as eutrophic, mesotrophic, and enriched obligotrophic. Obligotrophic soils do not support rain forest vegetation. Climatic and topographic factors tend to outweigh soil nutrient availibility at the climate extremes of the monsoonal and cool temperate regions. The structure types are finally differentiated by differences in height of canopy closure, nature of emergents, or proportion of deciduous species, and are further correlated with variations in soil moisture availability and drainage, or local exposure in montane situations. A field key to the habitat types associated with the different structural types is given. The inter—relationships thus established enable the prediction of either the type of vegetation, climate, or soil once any two of these are known. Deviations from the inferred distribution of rain forest are related to the past influence of wildfires which favor the regeneration of eucalypts and other scle sclerophylls after the destruction of the mostly fire—sensitive rain forest species. Destruction by surface fires in the tropical—subtropical region, or by running—crown fires of the mass—ignition type in the temperate regiion results respectively in abrupt ecotones, or diffuse ecotones and the virtual absence of climax rain forest vegetation. The practical implications of the ecological relationships established are briefly discussed in relation to land use and conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3acanopy 3adrainage 3aecotones 3aedaphic factors 3aeutrophication 3aferns and fern allies 3ahabitats 3aland use 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3amineral soils 3amosses and liverworts 3aprediction 3arain 3arain forests 3asclerophyll forests 3asoil depth 3asoil nutrients 3asoil water 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atopography 3avines 3awildfires0 tEcology.g1968 Mar., v. 49, no. 2 p.296-311dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19344593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245007700158520142400235592002801659650001601687650002401703650002601727650001901753650001101772650001401783650002001797650001401817650001301831650002001844650002701864650001301891651001301904700002601917700001801943700002101961700001701982700001901999700001902018773011902037856007202156852000902228655001202237IND60648830020221119033604.0190701e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064883002DNAL7 a10.3390/f90301472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShannon, Joseph10aWater Level Controls on Sap Flux of Canopy Species in Black Ash Wetlands  aBlack ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) exhibits canopy dominance in regularly inundated wetlands, suggesting advantageous adaptation. Black ash mortality due to emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) will alter canopy composition and site hydrology. Retention of these forested wetlands requires understanding black ash’s ecohydrologic role. Our study examined the response of sap flux to water level and atmospheric drivers in three codominant species: black ash, red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.), in depressional wetlands in western Michigan, USA. The influence of water level on sap flux rates and response to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was tested among species. Black ash had significantly greater sap flux than non-black ash at all water levels (80–160% higher). Black ash showed a significant increase (45%) in sap flux rates as water levels decreased. Black ash and red maple showed significant increases in response to VPD as water levels decreased (112% and 56%, respectively). Exploration of alternative canopy species has focused on the survival and growth of seedlings, but our findings show important differences in water use and response to hydrologic drivers among species. Understanding how a replacement species will respond to the expected altered hydrologic regimes of black ash wetlands following EAB infestation will improve species selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer rubrum 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aBetula alleghaniensis 3aFraxinus nigra 3acanopy 3ahydrology 3alowland forests 3amortality 3asap flow 3aseedling growth 3avapor pressure deficit 3awetlands 3aMichigan1 aVan Grinsven, Matthew1 aDavis, Joshua1 aBolton, Nicholas1 aNoh, Nam Jin1 aPypker, Thomas1 aKolka, Randall0 tForests.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90301473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245008900166300001600255500001500271520203300286592002802319650001702347650001902364650001002383650001802393650001402411650001002425650001602435650001902451650002202470650001202492650002402504650001202528650001802540651001102558651001102569653001602580700002302596700002302619700001902642773010502661856008402766852000902850655001202859IND4447623420221119095044.0141111e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444762342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShenoy, Aditi10aPersistent effects of fire severity on early successional forests in interior Alaska  ap. 381-390.  a2019-12-06  aThere has been a recent increase in the frequency and extent of wildfires in interior Alaska, and this trend is predicted to continue under a warming climate. Although less well documented, corresponding increases in fire severity are expected. Previous research from boreal forests in Alaska and western Canada indicate that severe fire promotes the recruitment of deciduous tree species and decreases the relative abundance of black spruce (Picea mariana) immediately after fire. Here we extend these observations by (1) examining changes in patterns of aspen and spruce density and biomass that occurred during the first two decades of post-fire succession, and (2) comparing patterns of tree composition in relation to variations in post-fire organic layer depth in four burned black spruce forests in interior Alaska after 10–20 years of succession. We found that initial effects of fire severity on recruitment and establishment of aspen and black spruce were maintained by subsequent effects of organic layer depth and initial plant biomass on plant growth during post-fire succession. The proportional contribution of aspen (Populus tremuloides) to total stand biomass remained above 90% during the first and second decades of succession in severely burned sites, while in lightly burned sites the proportional contribution of aspen was reduced due to a 40-fold increase in spruce biomass in these sites. Relationships between organic layer depth and stem density and biomass were consistently negative for aspen, and positive or neutral for black spruce in all four burns. Our results suggest that initial effects of post-fire organic layer depths on deciduous recruitment are likely to translate into a prolonged phase of deciduous dominance during post-fire succession in severely burned stands. This shift in vegetation distribution has important implications for climate-albedo feedbacks, future fire regime, wildlife habitat quality and natural resources for indigenous subsistence activities in interior Alaska.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant growth 3aboreal forests 3astems 3aPicea mariana 3awildfires 3atrees 3afire regime 3aglobal warming 3awildlife habitats 3aburning 3aPopulus tremuloides 3abiomass 3afire severity 3aCanada 3aAlaska 0arecruitment1 aJohnstone, Jill F.1 aKasischke, Eric S.1 aKielland, Knut0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 261, no. 3 p.381-390dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245006300163300001600226520166500242592002801907650001701935650001001952650001101962650001901973650001901992650002202011650001802033650004202051650001402093650002902107650002402136650003102160650002502191650001802216700002202234700001602256700002702272700002302299700001602322773012502338856008302463852000902546655001202555IND60624123820221118212356.0181201e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062412382DNAL7 a10.1177/01154265060210043232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sang10aCurrent Clinical Applications of Ω-6 and Ω-3 Fatty Acids  ap. 323-341.  aBackground: Recent years have brought a resurgence of research interest in fatty acids, with studied fields running the gamut of human disease. This movement has run in parallel with an increased interest in using nutrition modalities as therapeutic measures, as opposed to their conventional role as energy sources. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a basic review of current clinical applications of ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids, with a particular focus on the latter. Methods: A selective review of the voluminous literature, including randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, population studies, and case reports, was used to compile data and identify trends in pertinent clinical applications of fatty acid therapy. Conclusions: There are a myriad of disorders and maladies that seem to benefit from fatty acid supplementation, specifically ω-3 fatty acids. It has clearly been shown that ω-3 fatty acid supplementation provides a protective benefit in heart disease, and in particular sudden cardiac death. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is another disease entity that has been proven to benefit from this nutrition intervention, with improvement in symptoms and diminished nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) usage. In addition, many psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD), have shown positive results when supplementation has been used as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy. The remainder of clinical applications for ω-3 fatty acids requires further investigation. Specifically, according to preliminary clinical evidence, parenteral administration of fatty acids warrants further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeath 3aenergy 3aheart diseases 3ahuman diseases 3amental depression 3ameta-analysis 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3anutrition 3anutritional intervention 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3arandomized clinical trials 3arheumatoid arthritis 3aschizophrenia1 aGura, Kathleen M.1 aKim, Sendia1 aArsenault, Danielle A.1 aBistrian, Bruce R.1 aPuder, Mark0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2006 Aug., v. 21, no. 4 p.323-341dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01154265060210043233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013100155300001600286500002000302520164600322592002801968650002501996650002402021650002002045650001202065650002602077650001502103650001302118700001602131700001402147700001902161700001602180773012202196856007302318852000902391655001202400IND60572151520221120141438.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057215152DNAL7 a10.1111/jhn.124012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegaran, E.10aDoes body mass index impact on muscle wasting and recovery following critical illness? A pilot feasibility observational study  ap. 227-235.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Critical illness is associated with muscle loss, weakness and poor recovery. The impact that illness and the ensuing metabolic response has on obese patients is not known. Objectives were to test if obese patients lose less muscle depth compared to non‐obese patients; if a reduction in muscle depth was associated with reduced strength and recovery; and to assess the feasibility of these methods with a range of body mass index's (BMI). METHODS: A prospective observational pilot study of muscle depth in critically ill patients categorised by BMI was performed. Muscle depth changes were assessed by ultrasound on study days 1, 3, 5, 7, 12 and 14. Strength was measured via handgrip dynamometry and Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score on waking and at discharge from the intensive care unit. Level of dependency was measured with the Barthel index. RESULTS: 44 critically ill patients; 17 had normal BMI, 10 were overweight and 17 were obese. The three groups did not differ in baseline characteristics, except obese patients had significantly greater initial muscle depth. Muscle depth loss was similar between the BMI groups at each of the time points. Handgrip and MRC sum score were only possible in a small number of patients because of reduced alertness and weakness. Majority were deemed fully dependent based on the Barthel index. CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients lost muscle depth in a comparable manner to non‐obese patients, suggesting that BMI may not prevent muscle depth loss. It was not possible to determine the effect on strength because the clinical condition of patients precluded reliable measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomedical research 3abody mass index 3amuscles 3aobservational studies 3aoverweight 3apatients1 aWandrag, L.1 aStotz, M.1 aTerblanche, M.1 aHickson, M.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2017 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.227-235dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0952-38717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jhn.124013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245013000162300001800292520042500310592002800735650001000763650001200773650001300785650001100798650004400809653002500853653001200878653002100890700002600911773015300937856007701090852000901167655001201176IND60522049120221122044759.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052204912DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1996-12052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJüschke, Ralf10aUntersuchungen zur Säurestärke von Alkanpolysulfonsäuren / Investigations on the Acid-Strength of Alkanepolysulfonic Acids  ap. 1691-1700.  aThe acid strength of alkanepolysulfonic acids was measured using the correlation between the ²⁹Si NMR shift of the corresponding trimethylsilylester of an acid and the pKS₁-value of the acid.

Several ways to express exogenous genes in neurons are available, but each method has pros and cons. The lentivirus vector is useful for high efficiency gene transfer to neurons and stabilizes gene expression via genome integration, but this integration may destroy the host genome. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-derived vector (EB vector) is an accessible and useful vector in human cell lines because the vector is not integrated into the host genome but stays in the nucleus as an episome. However, there has been no report on this process in rodent neurons.We examined the usefulness of the EB vector for testing gene function in neurons. We found that EB vector-derived exogenous proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP-tagged actin were easily detectable even after three weeks of transfection. Second, a tetracycline-induced gene expression system in the EB vector was active after three weeks of transfection, indicating that plasmids were retained in neurons for up to three weeks. Third, we determined that only Family of repeat element of the plasmid vector is essential for its long-term presence in neurons. These results show that the modified EB vector is a useful tool for examining gene function in neurons.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 4 3aactin 3agene expression 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahumans 3aplasmid vectors 3aplasmids 3arodents 3atransfection 0aCell biology 0aNeuroscience 0aNeurology 0aNervous system 0aNeuronal death 0aElectrophysiology 0aPlasmid vector 0aEpisome 0aPostmitotic cell 0aLong-term exogenous gene expression 0aEpstein-barr virus based vector1 aMiwa, Yoshihiro0 tHeliyon.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.e03504-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e035043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01587naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012100158300001800279520038400297592002800681650001200709650002300721650002300744650001700767650001900784650001400803650002800817650001800845700001200863700001700875700001600892700002100908700001300929700001100942700001900953773013400972856007401106852000901180655001201189IND60635362420221121104133.0190329e20190326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063536242DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc00764d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chenlin10aTraceable cancer cell photoablation with a new mitochondria-responsive and -activatable red-emissive photosensitizer  ap. 3801-3804.  aA mitochondria-responsive and -activatable photosensitizer (PS), MPS, composed of a pyridinium cation as a mitochondria targeting group and a dibenzylideneacetone derivative with environment-sensitive emission properties as the ROS generator and self-efficacy tracer, is reported.

In the first part, the aims and possibilities of Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) as odour-screening and aroma profiling technique are discussed. The critical difference between approaches is whether the ranking of odorants is carried out on an extract containing all the odorants present in the product, or on an extract representative of the odorants contained in the vapour phases that cause the odour and flavour. While the second alternative is more direct and can be more efficient, it requires a good understanding of the factors affecting orthonasal olfaction, handling volatiles (purging, trapping, eluting, and separating) and about the sensory assessment of GC effluents. The review also includes an updated list compiling all the odorants detected in wine by GC-O, including retention indexes and odour descriptions with a general guideline for the identification of odorants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeffluents 3aflavor 3agas chromatography 3aguidelines 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aolfactometry 3aresearchers 3ascreening 3asensory evaluation 3asmell 3atrapping 3avapors 3awines1 aFerreira, Vicente 0 tFoods.g2020 Dec. 18, v. 9, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91218923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245014700169300001600316520173600332592002802068650002402096650001202120650001102132650001702143650002402160650002202184650001202206650002102218650001902239650001302258650001902271650001402290650001702304650001702321650001502338650002002353651001102373653001602384653002602400653002102426653002402447653001802471700002302489700002702512700002302539700001902562700001702581773013402598856007802732852000902810655001202819IND60595800320221118161041.0190514e20180508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059580032DNAL7 a10.1139/cjss-2018-00212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorris, Charlotte E.10aAssessing structural and functional indicators of soil nitrogen availability in reclaimed forest ecosystems using ¹⁵N-labelled aspen litter  ap. 357-368.  aLandscape-level disturbance is a reality in many parts of the world including the Athabasca oil sands region, Canada, and soils play an essential part in the overall reclamation process. Soils are reconstructed during reclamation to provide a foundation and a nutrient source for the novel ecosystems. However, reclamation is often monitored through structural indicators of soil quality, which may not reflect dynamic ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling. Our objective was to determine if nutrient cycling was occurring on novel ecosystems and if standard structural measures of soil quality were appropriate indicators. We assessed soil quality and nitrogen cycling in reclaimed, harvested and undisturbed aspen forest sites following the addition of ¹⁵N-labelled aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) leaf litter to the soil surface. Structural soil quality indicators, including soil moisture and microbial carbon and nitrogen biomass, were higher on the undisturbed site, whereas soil microbial composition differed among sites. Yet, uptake of ¹⁵N by microbes and plants, which continued throughout the 52 mo field incubation, was comparable across all sites. These results indicate that differences in structural attributes between disturbed and undisturbed soils do not necessarily translate into differences in soil functioning related to nitrogen cycling. Instead, this case study supports exploring the use of stable isotope tracers to assess dynamic soil function indicators in reclaimed ecosystems. Being able to follow biogeochemical cycling as vegetation becomes established and new forests start to develop following reclamation is key to assessing the long-term sustainability of these novel ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus tremuloides 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aecological function 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3aisotope labeling 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aoil sands 3aplant litter 3asoil quality 3asoil water 3astable isotopes 3aCanada 0areclamation 0astable isotope tracer 0afield incubation 0asoil nitrogen cycle 0aboreal forest1 aQuideau, Sylvie A.1 aLandhäusser, Simon M.1 aDrozdowski, Bonnie1 aHogg, Karen E.1 aOh, Se-Woung0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2018 May 8, v. 98, no. 2 p.357-368dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1934x1918-18417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2018-00213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100002600192245011000218506007600328520132700404592002801731506003701759650001801796650001301814650001901827650002001846650001901866650002101885650002201906650001101928650001401939650001801953651001701971653001801988653002002006653001702026653001502043653002102058653002502079653002102104653002102125653001702146653002302163700001902186700002302205700002602228700002202254700002802276773009302304856008602397852000902483655001202492IND60690953620221207133523.0211030e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069095362DNAL7 aPMC70631532pmcid7 a321813892pmid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e035082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTagoe, Eunice Twumwaa12aA predictive model and socioeconomic and demographic determinants of under-five mortality in Sierra Leone  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSierra Leone is among the countries that recorded high under-five child mortality rate in the world. To design and implement policies that can address this public health challenge, the present study developed a predictive model of factors that explained under-five mortality in Sierra Leone using the 2008 and 2013 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey (SDHS) datasets. LASSO regression technique was used to select the predictors to build the under-five predictive single-level logit and multilevel logit models. Statistical analyses were performed in the R freeware version 3.6.1. About 588 (10.4%) and 1320 (11.1%) children under five were reported dead in 2008 and 2013, respectively. The significant predictors of under-five mortality in Sierra Leone were the total number of children ever born, number of children under five in the household, mother's birth in the last five years, mother's number of living children, and number of household members, household wealth, maternal contraceptive use and intention, number of eligible women in the household, type of toilet facility, sex of the child, and weight of the child at birth. The study identified certain predictors that deserve policy attention and interventions to strengthen the efforts of creating child welfare and survival atmosphere in Sierra Leone.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achild welfare 3achildren 3acontraceptives 3adata collection 3ahealth surveys 3ahousehold income 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3amortality 3apublic health 3aSierra Leone 0aPublic health 0aQuality of life 0aEpidemiology 0aPediatrics 0aHealth disparity 0aUnder-five mortality 0aLASSO Regression 0aPredictive model 0aSierra Leone 0aSub-saharan africa1 aAgbadi, Pascal1 aNakua, Emmanuel K.1 aDuodu, Precious Adade1 aNutor, Jerry John1 aAheto, Justice Moses K.0 tHeliyon.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.e03508-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e035083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245018600163300001800349520143600367592002801803650001601831650001201847650001301859650001301872650002201885650001301907650002101920650001201941650001301953650001701966650000901983653001901992653002202011653002302033653001902056653002902075700001702104773015302121856007702274852000902351655001202360IND60522049420221122044616.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052204942DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1996-12082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRominger, Frank10aHeterometallische Mehrkernkomplexe von Zink und Cadmium mit cis-[Cr(OH)2(en)2]+-Liganden / Heterom etallic Polynuclear Complexes of Zinc and Cadmium with cis-[Cr(OH)2(en)2]+ Ligands  ap. 1716-1724.  aA series of polynuclear heterometallic complexes containing chromium and zinc or cadmium were prepared by the reaction of cis-[CrCl₂(en)₂]Cl and a zinc or cadmium salt in water and the molecular and crystal structures of 1 to 5 determined by X-ray structure analyses. The products contain chelating or bridging cis-[Cr(OH)₂(en)₂]⁺ groups. For the zinc complexes a tetrahedral coordination is observed, and the [Cr(OH)₂(en)₂]⁺ units are found to act as bridges. [[ZnCl₂(μ-OH)Cr(en)₂(μ-OH)]ClO₄]ₙ (1) has a chain polymeric structure. [{ZnCl₂(μ-OH)Cr(en)₂(μ-OH)}₂]Cl₂ (2) has a cyclic structure. In the case of the cadmium complexes the [Cr(OH)₂(en)₂]⁺ units act as chelating ligands. For the three cadmium complexes [Cd₃(μ-Cl)₄Cl₄{Cr(μ3-OH)(μ-OH)(en)₂}₂]·4H20 (3), [[Cd(μ-Cl)(H₂O)₂{Cr(μ-OH)₂(en)₂}](ClO₄)(NO₃)·2H₂O]ₙ; (4), and [Cd₂(μ-Cl)2Cl₃(H₂O)₃{ Cr(μ-OH)₂(en)₂}]ₙ; (5) an octahedral coordination sphere is observed. The cadmium atoms in 3 to 5 are connected by at least one chloro bridge. In the centrosymmetrical pentanuclear complex 3 bridging occurs by face-sharing, and in the chain polymeric complexes 4 and 5 by edge-sharing of the coordination octahedra. In the crystal structures of all complexes a network of hydrogen bonds is observed, which contributes substantially to the stability of the conformation of the chain structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acadmium 3achlorine 3achromium 3acrystal structure 3ageometry 3ahydrogen bonding 3aligands 3anitrates 3aperchlorates 3azinc 0aZinc Complexes 0aCadmium Complexes 0aChromium Complexes 0aHydroxo Bridge 0aHeterometallic Compounds1 aThewalt, Ulf0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 51, no. 12 p.1716-1724dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1996-12083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011100163300001600274520144000290592002801730650002001758650001401778650001001792650001301802650002101815650002301836650001401859650001501873700001501888700001501903700002201918700001701940700001901957700002701976773008902003856004802092852000902140655001202149IND50069394220221118071607.0130926e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006939422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-013-1609-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerburg, P.10aNutrient ratios, differential retention, and the effect on nutrient limitation in a deep oligotrophic lake  ap. 119-130.  aNutrient ratios have been related to nutrient limitation of algal growth in lakes. Retention of nutrients in lakes, by sedimentation and by denitrification, reduces the nutrient concentrations in the water column, thereby enhancing nutrient limitation. Differential retention of nitrogen and phosphorus alters their ratios in lakes and thereby contributes to determine whether nitrogen or phosphorus limits algal growth. We examined the relationships between differential nutrient retention, nutrient ratios, and nutrient limitation in Lake Brunner, a deep oligotrophic lake. The observed retention of nitrogen (20%) and phosphorus (47%) agreed with predictions by empirical equations from literature. As a result of differential retention with a much larger proportion of phosphorus retained than that of nitrogen, the nitrogen:phosphorus ratio was higher in the lake (69) than in the inflows (46). While the mean ratio in the inflows suggested no or only moderate phosphorus limitation, the lake appeared to be severely phosphorus limited. Combining empirical equations from literature that predict nitrogen and phosphorus retention suggests that the nitrogen:phosphorus ratio is enhanced by greater retention of phosphorus compared to nitrogen only in deep lakes with relatively short residence times, such as Lake Brunner. In contrast, in most lakes differential retention is expected to result in lower nitrogen:phosphorus ratios.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenitrification 3aequations 3alakes 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrient retention 3anutrients 3aphosphorus1 aHorrox, J.1 aChaney, E.1 aRutherford, J.

Leonardite-based products have been used to improve soil properties and to help plants cope with abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, the effects of two commercial leonardites and an organic compost, in addition to a control treatment, were assessed for pot-grown olive plants over a period of fourteen months on soil properties, tissue elemental composition and dry matter yield (DMY). Three organic amendments were applied at single and double rates of that set by the manufacturer. The study was arranged in two experiments: one containing the seven treatments mentioned above and the other containing the same treatments supplemented with mineral nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilization. Overall, organic compost increased soil organic carbon by ~8% over the control. In the experiment without NPK supplementation, N concentrations in shoots and P in roots were the highest for the compost application (leaf N 12% and root P 32% higher than in the control), while in the experiment with NPK supplementation, no significant differences were observed between treatments. Total DMY was ~10% higher in the set of treatments with NPK in comparison to treatments without NPK. Leonardites did not affect significantly any measured variables in comparison to the control. In this study, a good management of the majority of environmental variables affecting plant growth may have reduced the possibility of obtaining a positive effect on plant nutritional status and growth from the use of commercial leonardites. The leonardites seemed to have caused a slight effect on biological N immobilization. This is not necessarily an advantage or a drawback; it is rather a feature that must be understood to help farmers make better use of these products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposts 3adry matter accumulation 3aelemental composition 3aleaves 3amanufacturing 3anitrogen 3anutritional status 3aolives 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3araw materials 3asoil organic carbon1 ade Almeida, Surian Fernanda1 aRaimundo, Soraia 1 ada Silva Domingues, Lucas 1 aRodrigues, Manuel Ângelo0 tSoil systems.g2022 Jan. 11, v. 6, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27147x2571-87897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems60100073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012000153300001800273500002000291520161800311592002801929650001501957650001701972650002001989650002502009650001302034650002102047650001502068650002402083650001402107650001002121650002002131650001502151650001802166650001202184650003002196650001802226650001102244650002202255650002002277650002702297650001802324650001902342650001102361650002202372650001302394700002202407700001802429700001902447700001702466700002002483773009902503856007302602852000902675655001202684IND60571458220221118040817.0170712e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057145822DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.144292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jie10aHelicoverpa zea gut‐associated bacteria indirectly induce defenses in tomato by triggering a salivary elicitor(s)  ap. 1294-1306.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInsect gut‐associated microbes modulating plant defenses have been observed in beetles and piercing‐sucking insects, but the role of caterpillar‐associated bacteria in regulating plant induced defenses has not been adequately examined. We identified bacteria from the regurgitant of field‐collected Helicoverpa zea larvae using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI‐TOF) mass spectrometry. A combination of biochemical, molecular, and confocal electron microscopy methods were used to determine the role of caterpillar‐associated bacteria in mediating defenses in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato). Laboratory‐reared H. zea inoculated with one of the bacteria identified in field‐collected H. zea, Enterobacter ludwigii, induced expression of the tomato defense‐related enzyme polyphenol oxidase and genes regulated by jasmonic acid (JA), whereas the salicylic acid (SA)‐responsive pathogenesis‐related gene was suppressed. Additionally, saliva and its main component glucose oxidase from inoculated caterpillars played an important role in elevating tomato anti‐herbivore defenses. However, there were only low detectable amounts of regurgitant or bacteria on H. zea‐damaged tomato leaves. Our results suggest that H. zea gut‐associated bacteria indirectly mediate plant–insect interactions by triggering salivary elicitors. These findings provide a proof of concept that introducing gut bacteria to a herbivore may provide a novel approach to pest management through indirect induction of plant resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aEnterobacter 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3abacteria 3acatechol oxidase 3adesorption 3aelectron microscopy 3aelicitors 3agenes 3aglucose oxidase 3aherbivores 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3apest management 3aplant-insect relations 3aribosomal RNA 3asalicylic acid 3asaliva 3asequence analysis 3atomatoes1 aPeiffer, Michelle1 aHoover, Kelli1 aRosa, Cristina1 aZeng, Rensen1 aFelton, Gary W.0 tnew phytologist.g2017 May, v. 214, no. 3 p.1294-1306dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.144293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245018700169300001600356520167300372592002802045650002002073650001502093650001002108650001102118650001402129650002402143650002102167650001402188650002602202650000902228650002102237650001902258650002902277650001302306650001202319653001502331653001202346653002102358653001102379700001402390700001402404700001702418700002102435700001702456773012502473856008202598852000902680655001202689IND60549714120221116143303.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054971412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jvc.2016.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaborda-Vidal, P.10aUse of ECG-gated computed tomography, echocardiography and selective angiography in five dogs with pulmonic stenosis and one dog with pulmonic stenosis and aberrant coronary arteries  ap. 418-426.  aPulmonic stenosis (PS) is the most common congenital cardiac disease in dogs. Boxers and English bulldogs are among the most commonly affected breeds and also commonly associated with an aberrant coronary artery (CA). If an aberrant CA is suspected and balloon valvuloplasty indicated, an intra-operative angiography is recommended prior to the procedure. ECG-gated computed tomography (CT) can be used to screen for CA anomalies in a quick and minimally-invasive way (preventing side effects associated with selective catheter angiography) and allowing early planning of the procedure. The aim of this case series was to report CT findings associated with PS diagnosed by echocardiography. Our database was retrospectively searched for cases of dogs with PS diagnosed by echocardiography, where an ECG-gated CT was performed. A total of six cases were retrieved: all were diagnosed with severe PS. Four dogs had concurrent congenital defects: two dogs had a patent ductus arteriosus, one dog had a ventricular septal defect and an overriding aorta, one dog had an aberrant CA. Detailed CT findings of all cases were reported, including one case of a patent ductus arteriosus and an overriding aorta not identified by transthoracic echocardiography. In addition, an abnormal single left coronary ostium, with a pre-pulmonic right CA was described. In conclusion, despite echocardiography remaining the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of PS, ECG-gated-CT angiography is a complementary diagnostic method that may provide additional relevant information, shorten surgery/anaesthesia time and reduce the amount of radiation to which the clinician is subjected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanesthesia 3aaorta 3abreeds 3acatheters 3acomputed tomography 3acoronary vessels 3adatabases 3adiagnostic techniques 3adogs 3aechocardiography 3aheart diseases 3apatent ductus arteriosus 3aplanning 3asurgery 0aCongenital 0aCardiac 0aAdvanced imaging 0aCanine1 aPedro, B.1 aBaker, M.1 aGelzer, A.R.1 aDukes-McEwan, J.1 aMaddox, T.W.0 tJournal of veterinary cardiology.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 4 p.418-426dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000118x1760-27347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvc.2016.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04496naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245007800210300001600288506007600304520277100380592002803151506003703179650002003216650000803236650002003244650002003264650001703284650002703301650001303328650001003341650002703351650002403378650001103402650003603413650001403449650001903463650001503482650001503497650000903512650001303521650001103534650003103545653001103576653002303587653002603610653001203636653001003648653000803658700002303666700002203689773009003711856008403801852000903885655001203894IND60545876820221207105903.0170606e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054587682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2013.11.0042doi7 aPMC42331402pmcid7 a243339912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Feng-Chiao10aModeling and analysis of personal exposures to VOC mixtures using copulas  ap. 236-245.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnvironmental exposures typically involve mixtures of pollutants, which must be understood to evaluate cumulative risks, that is, the likelihood of adverse health effects arising from two or more chemicals. This study uses several powerful techniques to characterize dependency structures of mixture components in personal exposure measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with aims of advancing the understanding of environmental mixtures, improving the ability to model mixture components in a statistically valid manner, and demonstrating broadly applicable techniques. We first describe characteristics of mixtures and introduce several terms, including the mixture fraction which represents a mixture component's share of the total concentration of the mixture. Next, using VOC exposure data collected in the Relationship of Indoor Outdoor and Personal Air (RIOPA) study, mixtures are identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF) and by toxicological mode of action. Dependency structures of mixture components are examined using mixture fractions and modeled using copulas, which address dependencies of multiple variables across the entire distribution. Five candidate copulas (Gaussian, t, Gumbel, Clayton, and Frank) are evaluated, and the performance of fitted models was evaluated using simulation and mixture fractions. Cumulative cancer risks are calculated for mixtures, and results from copulas and multivariate lognormal models are compared to risks calculated using the observed data. Results obtained using the RIOPA dataset showed four VOC mixtures, representing gasoline vapor, vehicle exhaust, chlorinated solvents and disinfection by-products, and cleaning products and odorants. Often, a single compound dominated the mixture, however, mixture fractions were generally heterogeneous in that the VOC composition of the mixture changed with concentration. Three mixtures were identified by mode of action, representing VOCs associated with hematopoietic, liver and renal tumors. Estimated lifetime cumulative cancer risks exceeded 10−3 for about 10% of RIOPA participants. Factors affecting the likelihood of high concentration mixtures included city, participant ethnicity, and house air exchange rates. The dependency structures of the VOC mixtures fitted Gumbel (two mixtures) and t (four mixtures) copulas, types that emphasize tail dependencies. Significantly, the copulas reproduced both risk predictions and exposure fractions with a high degree of accuracy, and performed better than multivariate lognormal distributions. Copulas may be the method of choice for VOC mixtures, particularly for the highest exposures or extreme events, cases that poorly fit lognormal distributions and that represent the greatest risks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aair 3acleaning agents 3adata collection 3adisinfection 3aenvironmental exposure 3agasoline 3aliver 3alognormal distribution 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aneoplasms 3aodor compounds 3apollutants 3aprediction 3arisk 3asolvents 3avapors 3avolatile organic compounds 0aCopula 0aCumulative effects 0aExposure determinants 0aMixture 0aRIOPA 0aVOC1 aMukherjee, Bhramar1 aBatterman, Stuart0 tEnvironment international.g2014 Feb., v. 63 p.236-245dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245006700203300001400270500001500284506007600299520081900375592002801194506003701222650002601259650000901285650003401294650001801328650002401346650002001370650001401390650001701404650002201421650001001443650002301453650001201476650003001488650003101518653001301549700002201562700002001584700002201604773007601626856008101702852000901783655001201792IND60173879020221207120658.0150603e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017387902DNAL7 a10.1007/s12284-010-9039-62doi7 aPMC31756322pmcid7 a219610492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Ying10aOsWRKY IIa Transcription Factors Modulate Rice Innate Immunity  ap. 36-42.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWRKY transcription factors regulate diverse plant processes including responses to biotic stresses.

A field study was conducted at Clayton, NC, on a Dothan sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Plinthic Kandiudult) to investigate responses of cotton reproductive development to reduced plant population. All flowers on plants grown at 2 and 12 plants m⁻² were tagged so that associations among boll and lint quantity and quality, flowering date, and fruiting position could be determined. On plants grown at 2 plants m⁻², 33 and 65% of their fiber came from flowers initiated before 88 days after planting (DAP) in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Plants grown at 12 plants m⁻² produced 63 and 88% of their fiber from flowers initiated before 88 DAP in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Plant population did not affect total lint yield, however. Because of favorable late-season weather, plants grown at 2 plants m⁻² produced more bolls on vegetative branches and at more distal sympodial positions than did plants grown at 12 plants m⁻². Boll weight and micronaire were generally higher for earlier bolls at all positions for the lower population density. Later bolls exhibited poorer boll and fiber properties, indicating negative effects of reduced heat unit accumulation by later bolls. Our findings indicate that replanting, which might delay stand establishment by 3 to 4 wk, would be of little help toward improving fiber yield because it would rely more heavily on later produced bolls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acrop yield 3alint cotton 3acrop quality 3aplant density 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aflowers 3aweight 3aheat sums 3alength 3agenotype 3aNorth Carolina1 aWells, Randall S.,0 tCrop science.g1998 Sept., v. 38, no. 5 p.1190-1195dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800050013x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02188naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245009900177520106200276592002801338650001501366650001401381650002101395650001501416650001201431653002301443653001901466653001801485653002601503653002801529653001901557700002101576700002601597773010601623856008801729852000901817655001201826IND60751245820221120091247.0220110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075124582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApostoloumi, Chrisa10aPrinciples and concepts about seagrasses: Towards a sustainable future for seagrass ecosystems  aSeagrasses grow in shallow marine and estuarine environments worldwide, providing multiple ecosystem services. However, a global trend of seagrass loss has been documented. Thus, increasing awareness of seagrass value is crucial for the sustainability of these vital ecosystems. This study aims to contribute to the creation of a seagrass-literate society, by defining key principles and concepts in relation to seagrasses that a seagrass-literate person should know. Six principles about seagrasses were defined. Each one is underpinned by a set of concepts. These principles and concepts concern key issues of seagrass biology (Principles 1-4), value (Principles 3-5), loss and protection (Principle 5), and research (Principle 6). Seagrass principles and concepts can be primarily used for educational purposes and as a practical resource to policy- and decision- makers. Our attempt could stimulate a collaborative effort of scientists and educators, aiming to improve the recommended principles and concepts, and to contribute to seagrass conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3amarine pollution 3aseagrasses 3asociety 0aMarine angiosperms 0aSeagrass value 0aSeagrass loss 0aSeagrass conservation 0aEnvironmental awareness 0aOcean literacy1 aMalea, Paraskevi1 aKevrekidis, Theodoros0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Dec., v. 173 p.112936-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04444naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002400165245006800189300001600257520284900273592002803122650001003150650001503160650001903175650000903194650002503203650001003228650001503238650001203253650002003265650001203285650001003297650002203307650001603329650001203345650005103357650002403408650000903432650001103441650004303452650000903495650002103504650004703525650003403572650004803606650002403654700002203678773011003700856008303810852000903893655001203902IND4461493220221120041918.0141106e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446149322DNAL7 a212778192pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2010.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Cibele F.10aNormal Doppler velocimetry of renal vasculature in Persian cats  ap. 399-404.  aRenal diseases are common in older cats. Decreased renal blood flow may be the first sign of dysfunction and can be evaluated by Doppler ultrasound. But previous studies suggest that the resistive index (RI) has a low sensitivity for detecting renal disease. Doppler waveforms of renal and intrarenal arteries demonstrate decreased blood flow before there are any changes in the RI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the normal Doppler flowmetrics parameters of renal arteries (RAs), interlobar arteries (IAs) and abdominal aorta (AO) in adult healthy, Persian cats. Twenty-five Persian cats (13 females and 12 males with mean age of 30 months and an age range 12–60 months) with normal clinical examinations and biochemical tests and normal systemic blood pressure were given B-mode ultrasonographies in order to exclude all nephropathies, including polycystic kidney disease. All measurements were performed on both kidneys. Both kidneys (n=50) were examined by color mapping of the renal vasculature. Pulsed Doppler was used to examine both RAs, the IAs at cranial, middle and caudal sites, and the AO. The RI was calculated for all of the vessels. Early systolic acceleration (ESA) of RA and IA was obtained with Doppler spectral analysis. Furthermore, the ratio indices between RA/AO, and IA/RA velocities were calculated. The mean values of peak systolic velocity (PSV) and the diameter for AO were 53.17±13.46cm/s and 0.38±0.08cm, respectively. The mean RA diameter for all 50 kidneys was 0.15±0.02cm. Considering the velocimetric values in both RAs, the mean PSV and RI that were obtained were 41.17±9.40cm/s and 0.54±0.07. The RA had a mean ESA of 1.12±1.14m/s² and the calculated upper limit of the reference value was 3.40m/s². The mean renal-aortic ratio was 0.828±0.296. The IA showed PSV and RI values of 32.16±9.33cm/s and 0.52±0.06, respectively. The mean ESA of all IAs was 0.73±0.61m/s². The calculated upper limit of the reference value was 2.0m/s². The mean renal-interlobar artery ratio was 1.45±0.57. The RI values obtained in this study were similar to values reported in the literature. Some conditions that lead to a decrease in compliance and to an increase in vascular resistance can affect the Doppler spectral waveforms without changes in RI. To our knowledge, there are no studies that were directed toward to the normal ESA values of the renal vasculature in Persian cats. This study introduced a new ratio between the PSV of the RA and the IA. This index was developed based on the well-known effects of Doppler on the detection of stenosis, regardless of the cause. Further studies are necessary to verify the hemodynamic behavior of this index under pathological conditions in cats as well as the effect of aging, nephropathies and systemic pressure on Doppler velocimetric parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaorta 3ablood flow 3ablood pressure 3acats 3aclinical examination 3acolor 3acompliance 3afemales 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3amales 3aspectral analysis 3aultrasonics 2aAnimals 2aAorta, Abdominalxphysiologyxultrasonography. 2aBlood Flow Velocity 2aCats 2aFemale 2aKidneyxblood supplyxultrasonography. 2aMale 2aReference Values 2aRenal Arteryxphysiologyxultrasonography. 2aRenal Circulationxphysiology 2aUltrasonography, Doppler, Colorxveterinary 2aVascular Resistance1 aChammas, Maria C.0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2011 June, v. 13, no. 6 p.399-404dElsevier Ltdx1098-612X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2010.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245010100190300001600291500002000307520141200327592002801739650001101767650001601778650001001794650001201804650001101816650001401827650002701841650002301868650001901891650002401910650001901934650001001953650001201963650001501975650001701990650001502007650001402022650002402036650003002060650002902090650002202119651001802141651001502159651001102174651001102185700002002196700002702216773011802243852000902361856008902370655001202459IND4403635820221120163328.0210417e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440363582DNAL7 a181941442pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02349.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarling, Emily10aIncreased seed dispersal potential towards geographic range limits in a Pacific coast dune plant  ap. 424-435.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Dispersal may be favoured at geographic range edges by unstable population and metapopulation dynamics. However, dispersal may also evolve in response to geographic variation in other life‐history traits, especially the mating system. Here, increased dispersal at range margins was tested for with a range‐wide analysis of seed dispersal and mating system traits in Abronia umbellata, a plant endemic to Pacific coastal dunes of North America. • Seeds disperse within winged anthocarps. Anthocarps from 34 populations varied widely in wing size (mass‐corrected wing index). Wing index correlated negatively with threshold wind velocity for dispersal in wind tunnel tests, suggesting that wings facilitate tumbling over open sandy substrate. As predicted, wing index increased and threshold velocity decreased towards both range limits. • Flower size, herkogamy and self‐incompatibility declined towards range limits, indicating a shift to self‐fertilization, and flower size and wing index correlated negatively. However, the increase in wing index towards range limits remained after statistically controlling flower size. • These results are consistent with selection favouring dispersal at range margins. The evolutionary lability of dispersal across the range may affect the interaction between selection and gene flow in the establishment and maintenance of geographic range limits.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acorrelation 3adunes 3aflowers 3afruits 3agene flow 3ageographical variation 3aindigenous species 3amating systems 3apopulation dynamics 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3aselfing 3awind speed 3awind tunnels 2aDemography 2aEcosystem 2aFlowersxphysiology 2aNyctaginaceaexphysiology 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSeedsxphysiology 3aNorth America 0aCalifornia 0aMexico 0aOregon1 aSamis, Karen E.1 aEckert, Christopher G.0 tnew phytologist.g2008 Apr., v. 178, no. 2 p.424-435dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02349.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02589naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245006000179300001700239520165000256592002801906650001201934650002101946650001401967650001301981653002401994653002102018653003202039653001302071773009802084856008402182852000902266655001202275IND60122084020221119064542.0150324e20141102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012208402DNAL7 a10.1080/03066150.2013.8769972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Ploeg, Jan Douwe10aPeasant-driven agricultural growth and food sovereignty  ap. 999-1030.  aThe concept of food sovereignty presents us with an important theoretical and practical challenge. The political economy of agriculture can only take up this gauntlet through improving its understanding of the processes of agricultural growth. It is very difficult to address the issue of food sovereignty without such an understanding. Developing such an understanding involves (re)combining the political economy of agriculture with the Chayanovian approach. This paper gives several explanations (all individually valid but stronger in combination) as to why peasant agriculture results in sturdy and sustainable growth and also identifies the factors that undermine this capacity. The paper also argues that peasant agriculture is far from being a remnant of the past. While different peasantries around the world are shaped and reproduced by today's capital (and more specifically by current food empires), they equally help to shape and contribute to the further unfolding of the forms of capital related to food and agriculture. It is important to understand this two-way interaction between capital and peasant agriculture as this helps to ground the concept of food sovereignty. The article argues that the capacity to produce enough food (at different levels, distinguishing different needs, and so on) needs to be an integral part of the food sovereignty discourse. It concludes by suggesting that peasant agriculture has the best potential for meeting food sovereignty largely because it has the capacity to produce (more than) sufficient good food for the growing world population and that it can do so in a way that is sustainable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3afood sovereignty 3apeasantry 3apolitics 0apeasant agriculture 0afood sovereignty 0aintensification of land use 0aSan Nong0 tJournal of peasant studies.g2014 Nov. 2, v. 41, no. 6 p.999-1030dRoutledgex1743-93617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2013.8769973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012400173520104900297592002801346650001701374650001301391650001901404650002101423650001301444650000901457650001801466651002201484653003201506653002601538653003201564653002001596653002601616700001501642700001601657700001301673700001901686700001401705700001801719773010601737856008801843852000901931655001201940IND60751245920221121052551.0220124e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075124592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGregorietti, M.10aCetacean presence and distribution in the central Mediterranean Sea and potential risks deriving from plastic pollution  aThe Sardinian and Sicilian Channels are considered hotspots of biodiversity and key ecological passages between Mediterranean sub-basins, but with significant knowledge gaps about marine mammal presence and potential threats they face.Using data collected between 2013 and 2019 along fixed transects, inter and intra-annual cetacean index of abundance was assessed. Habitat suitability, seasonal hot spots, and risk exposure for plastic were performed using the Kernel analysis and the Biomod2 R-package.661 sightings of 8 cetacean species were recorded, with bottlenose and striped dolphins as the most sighted species. The north-eastern pelagic sector, the coastal waters and areas near ridges resulted the most suitable habitats for these species. The risk analysis identified the Tunis, Palermo, and Castellammare gulfs and the Egadi Island as areas of particular risk of plastic exposure.The study represents a great improvement for cetacean knowledge in this region and contributes to the development of effective conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3ahabitats 3amarine mammals 3amarine pollution 3aplastics 3arisk 3arisk analysis 3aMediterranean Sea 0aSardinian-Sicilian Channels 0aCetacean distribution 0aSpecies Distribution Models 0aRisk assessment 0aPlastic marine litter1 aAtzori, F.1 aCarosso, L.1 aFrau, F.1 aPellegrino, G.1 aSarà, G.1 aArcangeli, A.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Dec., v. 173 p.112943-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245012900201506007600330520143900406592002801845506003701873650001901910650001201929650000901941650001101950650001201961650002201973650001401995650001002009700002302019700002302042700002102065700002202086700002502108700002702133700002302160700002802183700002202211700002202233700002202255700002402277773012202301856007402423852000902497655001202506IND60650764620221207133650.0190710e20190425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065076462DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110409382doi7 aPMC65209642pmcid7 a310272682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahir, Muna  J.10aAssociation of Full Breastfeeding Duration with Postpartum Weight Retention in a Cohort of Predominantly Breastfeeding Women  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFull breastfeeding (FBF) is promoted as effective for losing pregnancy weight during the postpartum period. This study evaluated whether longer FBF is associated with lower maternal postpartum weight retention (PPWR) as compared to a shorter FBF duration. The MILK (Mothers and Infants Linked for Healthy Growth) study is an ongoing prospective cohort of 370 mother&ndash;infant dyads, all of whom fully breastfed their infants for at least 1 month. Breastfeeding status was subsequently self-reported by mothers at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Maternal PPWR was calculated as maternal weight measured at 1, 3, and 6 months postpartum minus maternal prepregnancy weight. Using linear mixed effects models, by 6 months postpartum, adjusted means &plusmn; standard errors for weight retention among mothers who fully breastfed for 1&ndash;3 (3.40 &plusmn; 1.16 kg), 3&ndash;6 (1.41 &plusmn; 0.69 kg), and &ge;6 months (0.97 &plusmn; 0.32 kg) were estimated. Compared to mothers who reported FBF for 1&ndash;3 months, those who reported FBF for 3&ndash;6 months and &ge;6 months both had lower PPWR over the period from 1 to 6 months postpartum (p = 0.04 and p < 0.01, respectively). However, PPWR from 3 to 6 months was not significantly different among those who reported FBF for 3&ndash;6 versus &ge;6 months (p > 0.05). Interventions to promote FBF past 3 months may increase the likelihood of postpartum return to prepregnancy weight.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast feeding 3ainfants 3amilk 3amodels 3amothers 3apostpartum period 3apregnancy 3awomen1 aHaapala, Jacob  L.1 aFoster, Laurie  P.1 aDuncan, Katy  M.1 aTeague, April  M.1 aKharbanda, Elyse  O.1 aMcGovern, Patricia  M.1 aWhitaker, Kara M.,1 aRasmussen, Kathleen M.,1 aFields, David A.,1 aHarnack, Lisa  J.1 aJacobs, David R.,1 aDemerath, Ellen  W.0 tNutrients.g2019 Apr. 25, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110409383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01232naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013100161300001400292520020100306592002800507650000800535650001200543650001300555650001300568700001800581700002500599700002000624700002100644700003300665773012500698856007400823852000900897655001200906IND60669527720221123041751.0190920e20151029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066952772DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra90097b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Dibyendu10aCorrection: Deep eutectic solvents as a new class of draw agent to enrich low abundance DNA and proteins using forward osmosis  ap. 92618.  aCorrection for ‘Deep eutectic solvents as a new class of draw agent to enrich low abundance DNA and proteins using forward osmosis’ by Dibyendu Mondal et al., RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 89539–89544.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aosmosis 3aproteins 3asolvents1 aMahto, Ashesh1 aVeerababu, Polisetti1 aBhatt, Jitkumar1 aPrasad, Kamalesh1 aNataraj, Sanna Kotrappanavar0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 29, v. 5, no. 112 p.92618-92618dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra90097b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245010100168300002000269520181700289592002802106650002302134650002102157650001902178650001302197650001702210650002102227650001602248650003102264650002102295650001402316650001802330650001502348650002102363650002802384650001402412650001102426650002002437650001702457650002102474700002002495700001902515700002102534700001902555700002602574700002002600700002302620700002002643700002302663773012402686856007402810852000902884655001202893IND60669199520221121040627.0190920e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066919952DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra14100a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinković Vrček, Ivana10aDoes surface coating of metallic nanoparticles modulate their interference with in vitro assays?  ap. 70787-70807.  aScreening programs for the evaluation of nanomaterial value and safety rely on in vitro tests. The exceptional physicochemical properties of metallic nanoparticles (NPs), such as large surface area and chemically active surface, may provoke their interference with in vitro methods and analytical techniques used for evaluation of biocompatibility or toxicity of NPs. This study aimed to determine if such interference could be predicted on the basis of the surface characteristics of metallic NPs by investigating the effect of different surface coatings of silver (AgNPs) and maghemite NPs (γ-Fe₂O₃NPs) on common in vitro assays scoring two of the main cytotoxic endpoints: cell viability and oxidative stress response. We examined optical, adsorptive and chemically reactive types of NP interference with cell viability assays (MTT, MTS, and WST-8) and assays employing fluorescent dyes as markers for production of reactive oxygen species (DCFH-DA and DHE) or glutathione level (MBCl). Each type of tested NPs affected all of the six investigated assays leading to false interpretation of obtained results. The extent and type of interference were dependent on the type and surface coating of NPs as well as on their stability in biological media. The results have shown that interference was concentration-, particle type- and assay type-dependent. This study demonstrated that common in vitro assays, without appropriate cause-and-effect analysis and adaptation or modification, are ineffective in the evaluation of biological effects of metallic NPs due to their interaction with optical readouts and assay components. A comprehensive and feasible experimental setup has been proposed to gain a reproducible and reliable in vitro evaluation as the first step in the health assessment of metallic NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiocompatibility 3acell viability 3acoatings 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescent dyes 3aglutathione 3ahealth effects assessments 3ain vitro studies 3amaghemite 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3ascreening 3asilver 3astress response 3asurface area 3aviability assays1 aPavičić, Ivan1 aCrnković, Tea1 aJurašin, Darija1 aBabič, Michal1 aHorák, D.q(Daniel),1 aLovrić, Marija1 aFerhatović, Lejla1 aĆurlin, Marija1 aGajović, Srećko,0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 19, v. 5, no. 87 p.70787-70807dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra14100a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009900168520095100267592002801218650001201246650002401258650002501282650001901307650002101326650001801347650002001365650001601385651002001401651001501421653000901436653001401445653001001459653001001469700001801479700001501497700001301512773010601525856008801631852000901719655001201728IND60751246020221121052415.0220110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075124602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kang10aHarmful algal blooms caused by Phaeocystis globosa from 1997 to 2018 in Chinese coastal waters  aFrom 1997 to 2018, Phaeocystis globosa caused harmful algal blooms in Chinese coastal waters almost every year. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of P. globosa blooms and its influencing factors were discussed. The results showed that 80.6% of the P. globosa blooms happened in the South China Sea and 72.5% happened in the period from November to March of the following year. But in the Yellow Sea, P. globosa blooms might be limited by green tides. Among the influencing factors, temperature might be an important one that affected the spatial and temporal distribution of P. globosa blooms. Furthermore, eutrophication provided material basis and El Nino events might also stimulate the occurrence of P. globosa blooms. This study is helpful to reveal causes and mechanisms of P. globosa blooms and reduce the negative impacts of blooms on ecological environment, economic development and the safety of nuclear power plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aPhaeocystis globosa 3aeconomic development 3aeutrophication 3amarine pollution 3anuclear power 3apoisonous algae 3atemperature 3aSouth China Sea 3aYellow Sea 0aHABs 0aLong-term 0aCoast 0aChina1 aChen, Baohong1 aGao, Yahui1 aLin, Hui0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Dec., v. 173 p.112949-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006600146245015200212300001600364520098500380592002801365650001501393650002301408650001301431650001401444650001801458650001501476650002201491650002601513650004401539650002701583650001901610650001901629650001401648650003301662650002101695650001401716700002601730700002301756700002701779773016801806856008001974852000902054655001202063IND60627123920190215000000.0190128e20181204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062712392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b047572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalderón, Bárbara A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3677-748210aBlends of Renewable Poly(butylene succinate) and Poly(propylene carbonate) Compatibilized with Maleic Anhydride Using Quad Screw Reactive Extrusion  ap. 487-495.  aThe free radical functionalization of immiscible blends of polybutylene succinate (PBS) and polypropylene carbonate (PPC) was successfully achieved on a novel quad screw extruder. A premade compatibilizer, PPC-grafted-maleic anhydride (gPPC), was added in various amounts to trigger the chemical compatibilization and tailor the properties of the final blend. Titration of acid groups on the functionalized blends showed that the grafting efficiency increases with the addition of gPPC. Proton NMR corroborated the formation of new graft copolymers in the reactive blends. A change in the rheological behavior of the formulations evidenced the grafting reactions occurring at the interphase of the components. Also, gPPC suppressed droplet coalescence as seen in the SEM images. Finally, the addition of compatibilizer increased the tensile strain at break by more than 100%, improved up to 50% the impact resistance, and produced a small increase on flexural and elastic modulus.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3acomposite polymers 3adroplets 3aextrusion 3afree radicals 3ainterphase 3amaleic anhydrides 3amodulus of elasticity 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolybutylene succinate 3apolypropylenes 3aprocess design 3apropylene 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atensile strength 3atitration1 aMcCaughey, Matthew S.1 aThompson, Conor W.1 aSobkowicz, Margaret J.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Dec. 04, v. 58, no. 1 p.487-495dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b047573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165506010400278506007600382520142800458592002801886506003701914650001001951650001301961650002801974650001402002650002402016650000902040650001102049650001202060651001602072653002602088653003102114653002402145653002102169700005702190700005602247700001902303773009402322856008202416852000902498655001202507IND60767958220221207140918.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076795822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpäti, Karin10aData on the stated adoption decisions of Swiss farmers for variable rate nitrogen fertilization technologies  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present data on the stated preference for the adoption of variable rate technologies from 418 crop farmers in Switzerland. The online survey was conducted online in spring 2021. It consisted of two parts: 1) a choice experiment and 2) questions about farmers' characteristics, expectations and beliefs, as well as their risk preferences. In the choice experiment, farmers were presented with eight consecutive choice tasks. Each task consisted of three alternatives, two hypothetical scenarios for variable rate technologies adoption and the status quo option. We used a split-sample approach and varied the additional profit margin gained through higher yields, label premiums or subsidies for one subsample (focussing on the willigness to accept) and additional cost (acquisition, maintenance and other costs) for the other subsample (focussing on the willigness to pay). Non-monetary attributes include 1) ownership of the technology; 2) potential to increase nitrogen use efficiency and thus reduce nitrogen losses to the environment; 3) uncertainties about the actual impact of the technology on yields and profits (reliability); 4) support in case of technical difficulties. We also collected data on farmers' experiences, attitudes and goals, as well as their risk preferences. Additionally, the survey data were matched with data from the cantonal farm census, which contains information on farm characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afarms 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aownership 3aprofits and margins 3arisk 3aspring 3asurveys 3aSwitzerland 0aPrecision agriculture 0aVariable rate technologies 0aTechnology adoption 0aChoice modelling1 aHuber, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4545-456X1 aLogar, Ivana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3595-47741 aFinger, Robert0 tData in Brief.g2022 Apr., v. 41 p.107979-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245013400183500002200317520176000339592002802099650001902127650001202146650002002158650001302178650001002191650001602201650001402217650001202231650002902243653000902272653000802281653001002289653000902299653001002308653000902318653001002327653001102337653001102348653001002359653000802369653000902377653000802386653000902394653000802403653000702411653000802418653001902426653002102445653002002466653001602486653002602502700001902528700002302547700002102570700003102591773005002622856008202672852000902754655001202763IND60584820120221122152349.0171028s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058482012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahnamiri, Hossein Zakariapour10aRegulation of lipid metabolism in adipose depots of fat-tailed and thin-tailed lambs during negative and positive energy balances  aPre-press version  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effects of negative and positive energy balances on gene expression of regulators and enzymes controlling lipogenesis and lipolysis in muscle and adipose depots of fat-tailed and thin-tailed lambs. Lambs were slaughtered during neutral, negative and positive energy balances for sample collection. Real time q-PCR was conducted to measure the gene expression. Expression of PPARγ was increased in response to positive energy balance regardless of genotype and type of tissue (P<0.04). Expression of SREBF1 was reduced in response to negative and positive energy balances in fat-tailed lambs, whereas in thin-tailed lambs, downregulated SREBF1 was restored during positive energy balance (P<0.01). Enhancement in FABP4 expression in response to negative and positive energy balances was respectively higher in thin-tailed and fat-tailed lambs affected by interaction of genotype and energy balance (P<0.11). In thin-tailed lambs, the enhanced FABP4 expression in response to negative energy balance was considerably higher in mesenteric adipose depot, whereas in fat-tailed lambs, positive energy balance induced enhancement in FABP4 expression was considerably higher in fat-tail adipose depot. The results demonstrate that transcription regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis during negative and positive energy balances occurs differently in fat-tailed and thin-tailed lambs. Thin-tailed and fat-tailed lambs are respectively more responsive to negative and positive energy balances and mesenteric and fat-tail adipose depots respectively in thin-tailed and fat-tailed lambs are the main adipose depots responsible for higher responsiveness of thin-tailed and fat-tailed lambs to negative and positive energy balances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy balance 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenotype 3alambs 3alipogenesis 3alipolysis 3amuscles 3atranscription (genetics) 0aNEFA 0aTMR 0aCNCPS 0acDNA 0aGAPDH 0aPPIA 0aYWHAZ 0aPPARγ 0aSREBF1 0aFABP4 0aLPL 0aACAC 0aSCD 0aACLY 0aHSL 0aCt 0aNEL 0aAdipose depots 0aFat-tailed lambs 0aGene expression 0aLipogenesis 0aTranscription factors1 aZali, Abolfazl1 aGanjkhanlou, Mahdi1 aSadeghi, Mostafa1 aShahrbabak, Hossein Moradi0 tGene.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245009000200300002000290500001900310520090300329592002801232650001401260650002101274650001101295650001401306650001101320650001301331700005701344700005701401773014901458856007601607852000901683655001201692IND60713781620221118075158.0201023e20201002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071378162DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c087852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Paramita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3877-341810aElectrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrogen to Hydrazine Using a Trinuclear Nickel Complex  ap. 17312-17317.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aActivation and reduction of N₂ have been a major challenge to chemists and the focus since now has mostly been on the synthesis of NH₃. Alternatively, reduction of N₂ to hydrazine is desirable because hydrazine is an excellent energy vector that can release the stored energy very conveniently without the need for catalysts. To date, only one molecular catalyst has been reported to be able to reduce N₂ to hydrazine chemically. A trinuclear T-shaped nickel thiolate molecular complex has been designed to activate dinitrogen. The electrochemically generated all Ni(I) state of this molecule can reduce N₂ in the presence of PhOH as a proton donor. Hydrazine is detected as the only nitrogen-containing product of the reaction, along with gaseous H₂. The complex reported here is selective for the 4e–/4H⁺ reduction of nitrogen to hydrazine with a minor overpotential of ∼300 mV.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahydrazine 3anickel 3anitrogen1 aAmanullah, Sk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3288-59421 aDey, Abhishek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9166-33490 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Oct. 02, v. 142, no. 41 p.17312-17317dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c087853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245007400199300002000273500001900293520123500312592002801547650002401575650001301599650001601612650001001628700005801638700006101696700005101757700005701808700006401865700005501929700006901984773014902053856007602202852000902278655001202287IND60713781720210423000000.0201023e20201007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071378172DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c088342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Ya-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5083-137X10aVisible-Light-Induced Ni-Catalyzed Radical Borylation of Chloroarenes  ap. 18231-18242.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA highly selective and general photoinduced C–Cl borylation protocol that employs [Ni(IMes)₂] (IMes = 1,3-dimesitylimidazoline-2-ylidene) for the radical borylation of chloroarenes is reported. This photoinduced system operates with visible light (400 nm) and achieves borylation of a wide range of chloroarenes with B₂pin₂ at room temperature in excellent yields and with high selectivity, thereby demonstrating its broad utility and functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the borylation reactions proceed via a radical process. EPR studies demonstrate that [Ni(IMes)₂] undergoes very fast chlorine atom abstraction from aryl chlorides to give [Niᴵ(IMes)₂Cl] and aryl radicals. Control experiments indicate that light promotes the reaction of [Niᴵ(IMes)₂Cl] with aryl chlorides generating additional aryl radicals and [Niᴵᴵ(IMes)₂Cl₂]. The aryl radicals react with an anionic sp²–sp³ diborane [B₂pin₂(OMe)]⁻ formed from B₂pin₂ and KOMe to yield the corresponding borylation product and the [Bpin(OMe)]•– radical anion, which reduces [Niᴵᴵ(IMes)₂Cl₂] under irradiation to regenerate [Niᴵ(IMes)₂Cl] and [Ni(IMes)₂] for the next catalytic cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achlorine 3airradiation 3alight1 aGuo, Xiao-Ning1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7626-15391 aKrummenacher, Ivo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9537-15061 aWu, Zhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0500-73271 aNitsch, Jörn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4005-22571 aBraunschweig, Holger1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9264-17261 aRadius, Udo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0759-18061 aMarder, T.

With the rapid development of reverse genetic tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi in microalgae, it is increasingly important to assess whether genetic compensation affects the phenotype of engineered algal mutants. While exploring triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis pathways in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, it was discovered that knockout of certain genes catalyzing rate‐limiting steps of TAG biosynthesis, type‐2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase genes (DGTTs), triggered genetic compensation under abiotic stress conditions. Genetic compensation of a DGTT1 null mutation by a related PDAT gene was observed regardless of the strain background or mutagenesis approach, for example, CRISPR/Cas 9 or insertional mutagenesis. However, no compensation was found in the PDAT knockout mutant. The effect of PDAT knockout was evaluated in a Δvtc1 mutant, in which PDAT was upregulated under stress, resulting in a 90% increase in TAG content. Knockout of PDAT in the Δvtc1 background induced a 12.8‐fold upregulation of DGTT1 and a 272.3% increase in TAG content in Δvtc1/pdat1 cells, while remaining viable. These data suggest that genetic compensation contributes to the genetic robustness of microalgal TAG biosynthetic pathways, maintaining lipid and redox homeostasis in the knockout mutants under abiotic stress. This work demonstrates examples of genetic compensation in microalgae, implies the physiological relevance of genetic compensation in TAG biosynthesis under stress, and provides guidance for future genetic engineering and mutant characterization efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  a1332344cNational Science Foundation  aCBET‐1511939cNational Science Foundation  aFE‐0031914cU.S. Department of Energy  cCairo University  cCarnegie Institution  cUniversity of Maryland  cOffice of Fossil Energy  cUS National Science Foundation 3aAnimalia 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aabiotic stress 3abiosynthesis 3adiacylglycerol acyltransferase 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amicroalgae 3aphenotype 3areverse genetics 3atriacylglycerols1 aPark, Rudolph1 aMiller, Stephen M.1 aLi, Yantao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7545-18830 tplant journal.g2022 Aug., v. 111, no. 4 p.1069-1080dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.158743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002600181245015200207506007600359520126300435592002801698506003701726650001601763650001701779650001601796650002001812650001201832650000801844650002301852650001601875650001301891650003101904650001401935651001201949700002401961700002901985700002302014700002202037700001802059700003202077773012202109856007402231852000902305655001202314IND60650764920221207134156.0190710e20190329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065076492DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110407312doi7 aPMC65210672pmcid7 a309348812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLerchbaum, Elisabeth 10aEffects of Vitamin D Supplementation on Bone Turnover and Bone Mineral Density in Healthy Men: A Post-Hoc Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVitamin D is well known for its effects on calcium and mineral metabolism. However, vitamin D effects on bone turnover markers (BTMs), which are used together with bone mineral density (BMD) to evaluate bone health, are less clear. We therefore examined vitamin D effects on BTMs (beta-cross laps (CTX) and osteocalcin (OC)) and BMD in a post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). This is a post-hoc analysis of the Graz Vitamin D&amp;TT-RCT, a single-center, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted between December 2012 and November 2017 at the endocrine outpatient clinic at the Medical University of Graz, Austria. A total of 200 healthy men with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <75 nmol/L participated in the trial. Subjects were randomized to receive 20,000 IU of vitamin D3/week (n = 100) or placebo (n = 100) for 12 weeks. Outcome measures were BTMs, BMD, and trabecular bone score (TBS). A total of 192 men (mean age and 25(OH)D: 43 (&plusmn;13) years and 54.9 (&plusmn;18.3) nmol/L, respectively) completed the study. We found no significant treatment effect on BTMs, BMD, or TBS (p > 0.05 for all). In middle-aged healthy men, vitamin D treatment for 12 weeks had no significant effect on BTMs or BMD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone health 3abone metabolism 3acalcium 3amen 3amineral metabolism 3aosteocalcin 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3avitamin D 3aAustria1 aTrummer, Christian 1 aTheiler-Schwetz, Verena 1 aKollmann, Martina 1 aWölfler, Monika 1 aPilz, Stefan 1 aObermayer-Pietsch, Barbara 0 tNutrients.g2019 Mar. 29, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110407313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013400165300001800299500001900317520123200336592002801568650001301596650001401609650001001623650001701633650001501650650001501665650000901680650001401689650001401703650001401717650005301731650001301784650001101797650001701808650001301825650001901838653002901857653001101886653001101897700001901908700001501927700001301942700001601955700001801971773014901989856008302138852000902221655001202230IND60649413120221118032100.0190725e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064941312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Chŏng,10aTripartite motif containing protein 37 involves in thrombin stimulated BV-2 microglial cell apoptosis and interleukin 1β release  ap. 1252-1257.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most common of stroke with high mortality and severe morbidity. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) plays a neuronprotective role in ICH. In the current study, TRIM37 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was found to be increased in ICH patients compared to that in healthy controls (n = 15). TRIM37 bound to PPARγ and enhanced its ubiquitination in mouse microglial BV-2 cell line. According to previous studies, thrombin is produced in the brain instantaneously after ICH and triggers the activation of microglia. Here, thrombin induced TRIM37 expression, cell apoptosis and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release in BV-2 cells, while TRIM37 knockdown partially reversed the effects of thrombin on BV-2 cells. TRIM37 overexpression showed similar effects as thrombin on BV-2 cells, and PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone abolished the effects of TRIM37. In summary, TRIM37 involved in apoptosis and IL-1β release in BV-2 microglia by regulating PPARγ ubiquitination. The present data established a potential biological role of TRIM37 in ICH-induced brain damage and may provide insight into the development of therapy strategies for ICH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3abrain damage 3acell lines 3ahemorrhage 3amice 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aneuroglia 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3aresearch 3astroke 3atherapeutics 3athrombin 3aubiquitination 0aIntracerebral hemorrhage 0aTRIM37 0aPPARγ1 aXia, Xiangping1 aJiao, Song1 aLi, Gang1 aRan, Qishan1 aYao, Shengtao0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Sept. 03, v. 516, no. 4 p.1252-1257dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.1583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006900142245016100211300002000372500001900392520082100411592002801232650002201260650001401282650002401296650001501320650002501335700001601360700001701376700006001393700001901453700002501472700005501497700005901552700006901611700005301680700007001733700005901803773014901862856007602011852000902087655001202096IND60713781920221118075150.0201023e20201008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071378192DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c088672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuente Santiago, Alain R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8491-356510aTailoring the Interfacial Interactions of van der Waals 1T-MoS₂/C₆₀ Heterostructures for High-Performance Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysis  ap. 17923-17927.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFullerene-based low-dimensional (LD) heterostructures have emerged as excellent energy conversion materials.

However, smallholder agriculture landscapes host areas containing home gardens and other agroforestry systems (AFS) proved highly relevant for soil and biodiversity conservation. The positive interactions between aboveground and belowground biodiversity probably constitute a key element to promote the efficiency of these agro-ecosystems. To determine whether a relationship exists between tree and soil macrofauna diversity and composition, we compared cacao AFS with contrasted tree diversity along a topography and forest cover gradient in Talamanca, Costa Rica. To determine which components of the shade tree species, community structure (density, richness, Shannon, Pielou), and agroforest floor best explain the macrofauna community composition and structure, we constructed the “best models” based on the tree composition, tree structure, and agroforest floor as explanatory matrices in redundancy analyses. Macrofauna composition was best explained by a mix of tree species and litter attributes (R²=26.5 %), whereas macrofauna and vegetation co-vary significantly with topography (R²=12 %). Macrofauna structure is best explained by a selection of seven tree species (R²=41.2 %). The co-variation with topography remained low (R²=10.9 %). Tree evenness (Pielou index) explained only 7 % of macrofauna community structure while other diversity indices were not correlated with macrofauna composition or structure. The soil macrofauna was therefore more influenced by tree identity and litter composition than by the overall diversity of the tree community. This information is important for designing the optimal combinations of species for the intensification of production and provision of ecosystem services in cacao-based AFS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3aagroforestry 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3acommunity structure 3adeforestation 3aforests 3asmall-scale farming 3asoil 3asoil fauna 3atopography 3atrees 3aCosta Rica 0aAbove/below-ground diversity 0aSoil ecosystem services 0aFunctional traits 0aCanonical analysis1 aDeheuvels, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2819-84451 aCelentano, D.1 aArias, I.R.1 aHernández-García, L.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1478-49531 aSomarriba, E.0 tPedobiologia.g2021 Nov., v. 89 p.150770-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1957x0031-40567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2021.1507703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245004700168300001600215520106300231592002801294650002101322650001201343650001601355650001401371650001801385650001501403650001501418650001401433650003001447650001301477650002501490650002801515650000901543650003501552650002301587700001801610700002101628700001901649773008301668856008101751852000901832655001201841IND60173879720221120031550.0170721e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017387972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12284-010-9044-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuoka, Shuichi10aIntegration of Genomics into Rice Breeding  ap. 131-137.  aOne of the major challenges in genetics has been to identify the nucleotide polymorphisms responsible for phenotypic variation. Through intensive analysis, several major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for agronomic traits in rice have been identified and the underlying candidate genes have been delimited. Advanced mapping populations, including chromosome segment substitution lines, have enhanced the power of genetic analysis to detect QTL alleles, even those with minor effects. Recent examples of marker-assisted selection have proven the potential of this strategy for crop improvement. The genome-wide discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), even among closely related cultivars, has enhanced the power of allele mining in a wide range of rice breeding materials. An array-based SNP genotyping system can be used to visualize pedigree haplotypes in breeding materials, including landraces and modern cultivars. All of these technologies are accelerating the genetic dissection of complex agronomic traits and further improvement of rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomic traits 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3agenome mining 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3alandraces 3amarker-assisted selection 3apedigree 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asubstitution lines1 aEbana, Kaworu1 aYamamoto, Toshio1 aYano, Masahiro0 tRice.g2010 Sept., v. 3, no. 2-3 p.131-137dSpringer New Yorkx1939-84257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12284-010-9044-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009700172520091300269592002801182650001401210650002201224650001401246650001701260650002401277650001601301650001701317650002301334650001401357650001701371653002801388653001501416653002201431653001101453653001001464700001601474700002001490700001901510700001501529700001501544700001301559773009801572856008801670852000901758655001201767IND60751246520221121025714.0211114e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075124652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.1129552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qiaoqiao10aGuaianolides from Artemisia codonocephala suppress interleukine-1β secretion in macrophages  aSesquiterpene lactones supply a variety of scaffolds for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.

Within estuaries, one of the most threatened habitats is seagrass meadows. The impact of newly installed Reno mattresses on an adjacent Zostera capensis meadow and associated fauna was investigated in the Keurbooms Estuary, South Africa. The impact on Z. capensis was studied by determining percentage cover and the length of blades before and after placement of Reno mattresses. At the impact site, percentage cover and blade length decreased during the installation phase, however, recovered shortly after installation was completed. At the control site no changes in eelgrass percentage cover were noted. Invertebrate and fish species richness, diversity and abundance were compared in the eelgrass meadows before and after the installation. Whilst invertebrate species richness increased significantly after the installation at the Impacted site, there was no significant difference at the Control site. There was also no significant difference in invertebrate diversity and fish species richness and diversity at the Control and Impacted sites before and after installation. This suggests that the installation had no net negative impact at the Impacted site. Within a month of installation, the Reno mattresses were colonised by two invertebrate species (Amphibalanus amphitrite and Littoraria sp.). Although the introduction of Reno mattresses at the study site created a hybrid habitat that continued to provide a habitat for fish and invertebrates, we suggest that the use of these artificial structures should be in combination with natural vegetation (e.g. as a hybrid habitat) and not one that replaces natural habitat. There is limited information regarding the ecological impacts of using Reno mattresses in estuaries and this study provides new information on their ecological efficacy thus providing valuable insights in future coastal erosion control practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalanus amphitrite 3aZostera marina 3aerosion control 3aestuaries 3afauna 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahybrids 3ainvertebrates 3amarine science 3ameadows 3aspecies richness 3aSouth Africa 0aErosion control 0aBACI 0aZostera capensis 0aMacroinvertebrates 0aFish1 aHodgson, An,1 aHarasti, D.1 aClaassens, L.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 May, v. 52 p.102239-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013000167300001600297520102400313592002801337650001501365650001501380650003101395650002001426650001501446650001701461650000901478650001501487653003401502653002501536653002601561653002401587700001701611700001401628700001401642700001301656700001801669700005601687700002001743773011401763856008501877852000901962655001201971IND60606962820221116152112.0180730e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060696282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.07.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Cuijin10aSuperior adsorption performance for triphenylmethane dyes on 3D architectures assembled by ZnO nanosheets as thin as ∼1.5nm  ap. 732-741.  aThe 3-dimensional hierarchical ZnO flower-like architectures have been synthesized in a Zn(Ac)2·2H2O-Na2SeO3-KBH4-pyridine solvothermal system at 100°C for 24h. The flower-like architecture is assembled from ZnO nanosheets with a thickness of ∼1.5nm, and the flower-like architecture specific surface area is 132m²/g. When the ZnO flower-like architecture is used as the adsorbent for acid fuschin (AF), malachite green (MG), basic fuchsin (BF), congo red (CR) and acid red (AR) in water, the adsorption capacities for AF, MG, BF, CR and AR are 7154.9, 2587.0, 1377.9, 85.0 and 38.0mg/g, respectively. Evidently, the as-obtained ZnO flower-like architectures show excellent adsorption performances for triphenylmethane dyes, and the adsorption capacity of 7154.9mg/g for AF is the highest of all adsorbents for dyes. The adsorption mechanism can be attributed to the electrostatic attraction and the formation of ion-association complex between triphenylmethane dyes and ZnO hierarchical flower-like architectures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amalachite green 3ananosheets 3asurface area 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aZnO flower-like architectures 0aUltrathin nanosheets 0aTriphenylmethane dyes 0aAdsorption capacity1 aHan, Guoping1 aZhao, Yan1 aZhao, Hua1 aLiu, Bin1 aCheng, Lijuan1 aYang, Heqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4791-03111 aLiu, Shengzhong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 318 p.732-741dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.07.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245012200209300001600331520089300347592002801240650001701268650001701285650001801302650002101320650002301341650001201364650002101376650002301397650001901420650002001439650001901459650001501478700005601493700002101549700006601570773016801636856008001804852000901884655001201893IND60627124420221120132044.0190128e20181218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062712442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b048752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Furaiji, Mustafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7373-937010aUse of a Forward Osmosis–Membrane Distillation Integrated Process in the Treatment of High-Salinity Oily Wastewater  ap. 956-962.  aIn this work, the feasibility of using a hybrid forward osmosis (FO)–membrane distillation (MD) process for treating hypersaline produced water was studied. Four draw solutions [i.e., sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), lithium chloride (LiCl), and magnesium chloride (MgCl₂)] at concentrations near to their saturation limits were considered. LiCl manifested relatively high FO flux due to its high osmotic pressure (about 1600 atm at 10 M). However, the MD water flux for the 10 M LiCl was relatively low due to the low vapor pressure. NaCl and KCl showed a different behavior of a high MD flux and low or negative FO flux. MgCl₂ at a concentration of 4.8 M showed comparable fluxes for both FO and MD. This work has demonstrated that the FO–MD process has the ability to treat extremely saline solutions that contain hydrocarbons and to produce high-purity water.  aPublisher supplied data 3adistillation 3ahydrocarbons 3ahypersalinity 3alithium chloride 3amagnesium chloride 3aosmosis 3aosmotic pressure 3apotassium chloride 3aprocess design 3asodium chloride 3avapor pressure 3awastewater1 aBenes, Nieck1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9716-069X1 aNijmeijer, Arian1 aMcCutcheon, Jeffrey R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5638-49260 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Dec. 18, v. 58, no. 2 p.956-962dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b048753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245021100175520161400386592002802000650001102028650001702039650001102056650001402067650002702081650001902108650002302127650001302150650001102163650001102174653001402185653002202199653001402221653001802235653001802253653001202271700007402283700002102357700002302378700006402401700007002465700002202535773011402557856008302671852000902754655001202763IND60767958820221118131137.0220719e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076795882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardes, Veronica P.10aSpatio-temporal dynamics of the commercial seabob shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri (Heller, 1862) and physico-chemical parameters in a marine protected area: Changes in abundance and distribution after 20 years  aStudies comparing parameters before and after the establishment of protected areas in coastal environments allow improvements of management plans and recognition of alterations due to natural or anthropic effects. This study compared spatio-temporal variation in abundance of Xiphopenaeus kroyeri in two equivalent periods. The first period was 12 years before the establishment of the Marine Protected Area and the second was 8 years after. The influence of environmental factors in relation to abundance was also analyzed. Samples were conducted monthly at Ubatuba Bay, Southeast Brazilian coast in period 1 (1995–1996) and 2 (2016–2017). Five transects were sampled using the same methodology, encompassing depths from 5 to 15 meters and areas sheltered or exposed to tidal waves and currents. Abundance varied seasonally. Higher values were obtained in December, March, and June of period 1 and in April and July of period 2. These months correspond to autumn and the beginning of winter. Seasonal fluctuations in abundance seems to be a response to higher and more stable salinity and the efficacy of the closed season (March–May), favoring a higher abundance in the autumn. There was no significant difference of X. kroyeri abundance between periods. Results indicate stability of population density through time in the region, suggesting conservation measurements are aiding species’ protection is spite of a larger fishing fleet. Our study reinforces the importance of measurements to mitigate fishery resources along with other non-commercial species important to preserve local biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3afisheries 3amarine protected areas 3amarine science 3apopulation density 3asalinity 3ashrimp 3awinter 0aAbundance 0aFishery resources 0aPenaeidae 0aSedimentation 0aSeabob shrimp 0aUbatuba1 ade Oliveira Marques, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8982-26731 aFransozo, Vivian1 aCosta, Rogério C.1 aTeixeira, Gustavo M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9378-82871 aFreire, Fulvio Aurélio M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1580-02221 aFransozo, Adilson0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 May, v. 52 p.102241-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009700163300001800260520146100278592002801739596004501767596006201812596003701874596006301911596006301974596006102037650001202098650001402110650001202124650000902136650001502145650001902160650000902179650001802188700005702206700001802263773012502281856008202406852000902488655001202497IND60645241920221118051731.0190803e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064524192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-018-4541-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Lijuan10aWhy do we have El Niño: quantifying a diabatic and nonlinear perspective using observations  ap. 6705-6717.  aEl Niño, due to its global impact on weather patterns, ecosystems, agriculture and public health, has become as commonly known to the public as the recent global warming. But why we have El Niño is not yet as well answered as it may have been assumed. Linear theories have been successful in explaining the transition from the warm phase to the cold phase of the eastern tropical Pacific that results from the rise and fall of El Niño, but failed to explain the asymmetry between the two phases. A nonlinear theory for El Niño has suggested that there exist two equilibrium states for the tropical Pacific—one is zonally symmetric (or nearly so) with the warm-pool extending all the way to the eastern Pacific, and the other is strongly zonally asymmetric with the warm-pool confined to the western half of the tropical Pacific. Under this hypothesis, ENSO results from the fact that under the current radiative heating, both states are unstable, resulting in the apparent “wandering” behavior in between these two states as seen in the observations. To test this hypothesis, the authors have obtained the best approximations for the two equilibrium states empirically using updated ocean assimilation data, and quantified the stability of these two empirically obtained equilibrium states using two stability analysis methods. The results suggest that the two states are unstable, offering support for the nonlinear view of why we have El Niño.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGS 1444489cDirectorate for Geosciences  aAGS0852329cDivision of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences  aGC14-244cClimate Program Office  aNo. 41606011cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 41530426cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2017Y007cChinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences 3aEl Nino 3aasymmetry 3aclimate 3acold 3aecosystems 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3apublic health1 aSun, De-Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2238-04841 aYu, Yongqiang0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 June, v. 52, no. 11 p.6705-6717dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4541-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245006100179300001800240500000900258520176200267592002802029650002202057650001402079650001502093650001402108650002802122650001002150650001002160650001902170651001402189700001902203700001602222700001902238700002202257700001602279700001802295773012402313852000902437856009802446655001202544IND2197135020221120091416.0191122e199809  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219713502DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800050015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbate, P.

Yield was considered as the product of number of grain per square meter (NG) and weight per grain. The NG was analyzed in terms of (i) duration of the inflorescence growth period (excluding grains), (ii) crop growth rate during that period, (iii) partitioning of crop dry matter to spikes during the same period, and (iv) grain/spike weight ratio (i.e., number of grains per gram of spike). The data were obtained from two field experiments in the Province of Buenos Aires. Grain yield (range: 453–689 g m⁻²) was related more to NG (range: 13.3–21.3 ✕ 10³ grain m⁻²) than to weight per grain. Duration of spike growth period was the same (27 d) for all cultivars. During this period, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation, radiation-use efficiency (mean: 2.7 ± 0.28 g MJ⁻¹), and crop growth rate (mean: 26 ± 2.5 g m⁻² d⁻¹) were similar for all the cultivars examined. Differences among cultivars in partitioning to spikes (ranges: 28–34%) were significant. The NG, however, was not related to partitioning to the spike. There were clear differences among cultivars in the grain/spike weight ratio (range: 61–106 grain g⁻¹); NG was more closely related to this ratio (r = 0.96, P < 0.01) than to dry weight of spikes at the end of their growth period (r = −0.30). Increments in potential yield by means of high grain/spike weight ratio were not previously reported and may be a path to future potential yield improvements.

A novel tubular form of superwetting, porous, stainless steel/ceramic membranes were demonstrated for enabling continuous separations of oil–water emulsions, extracting either oil phase or aqueous phase from the flowing emulsions. The superhydrophobic membranes consist of macroporous (4 μm) stainless-steel SS434 tube with inner wall surface modified with superhydrophobicity (>150° contact angle) via perfluoro-silane grafting functionalization. The (super)hydrophilic membranes consist of 4-μm porous stainless-steel SS434 tube without/with inner wall coated with nanoporous alumina (6 nm average pore size), the surface of which was further modified with superhydrophilicity via Hydrophil-S solution deposition. With the cross-flow membrane filtration setup, the surface-engineered tubular membranes were studied for perm-selective extraction of aqueous or oil phase from oil–water emulsions (water-in-oil W/O and oil-in-water O/W) that are relevant to a real industrial biodiesel (FAME) production process. The superhydrophobic membrane (4 μm pore size) has demonstrated capability of extracting nearly 100% pure oil while rejecting water phase when either W/O or O/W emulsions were tested as feed. The superhydrophobic membrane showed distinct advantage of 2-orders-of-magnitude-higher flux extraction of oil at 100 times higher “break-through” pressures. On the other hand, the super/hydrophilic nanoporous membranes (6 nm) have shown selective water permeation (separation factor up to 35) when biodiesel-relevant W/O emulsions were tested. Finally, the membrane function is discussed from the perspective of improving industrial biodiesel processing yield by overcoming equilibrium limitations during the biodiesel formation reactions. Future work on in situ reaction–separation experiments are envisioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3abiodiesel 3aceramics 3acontact angle 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrofiltration 3ananopores 3aoils 3apermeability 3aporosity 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3astainless steel1 aBischoff, Brian L.1 aMorales-Rodriguez, Marissa E.1 aGray, Kevin A.1 aDavison, Brian H.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Jan. 03, v. 58, no. 2 p.1114-1122dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b048883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002300161245008700184300001800271500000900289520172900298592002802027650001802055650001902073650001902092650001902111650001602130650001402146650001402160650001702174650001102191650001102202650001302213773012402226852000902350856009802359655001202457IND2197135820221120091233.0191122e199809  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219713582DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800050017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcum, Kenneth B.10aCell Membrane Thermostability and Whole-Plant Heat Tolerance of Kentucky Bluegrass  ap. 1214-1218.  aepub  aHeat stress is often a major problem in C₃ (cool-season) turfgrasses during summer months, resulting in reduced turf quality and stand loss. Current germplasm screening for heat tolerance relies on field and whole-plant techniques, which are often inefficient and insensitive due to environmental interactions. A rapid, accurate procedure allowing simultaneous screening of large numbers of genotypes is needed. In vitro cell membrane thermostability (CMT) has been determined for a number of plants. The objectives of this study were to determine if differences in CMT exist among cultivars of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), and if CMT can predict whole-plant heat tolerance of these cultivars. CMT was determined by subjecting leaf segments to progressive heat shock exposure times, and deriving cellular electrolyte leakage curves. Whole-plant heat tolerance was determined by subjecting plants to 41°C day/34°C night at 95% relative humidity for 62 d (Study 1) and 47 d (Study 2) in controlled-environment chambers. Relative percentage leaf firing and percentage shoot dry weight were determined weekly. CMT was negatively correlated with relative percentage leaf firing (r = −0.80) and positively with relative percentage shoot dry weight (r = 0.75), averaged over two experiments. CMT and whole-plant heat tolerance used as indicators demonstrated that cultivars BM-3 and Midnight were more heat tolerant than Lavang, Nugget, and Ryss. This is the first report showing that CMT can predict whole-plant heat tolerance among turfgrass cultivars. Being rapid, accurate, and requiring little space, CMT may offer turfgrass breeders an ideal method for screening large numbers of genotypes for heat tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa pratensis 3acell membranes 3aheat stability 3aheat tolerance 3aheat stress 3agermplasm 3ascreening 3aelectrolytes 3ashoots 3aleaves 3agenotype0 tCrop science.g1998 Sept., v. 38, no. 5 p.1214-1218dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800050017x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03978naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245016400183300001600347520197300363592002802336650002102364650001102385650002002396650001502416650002502431650001102456650001702467650001902484650001102503650001202514650001102526650001902537650000902556650002102565650001202586650002802598650002402626650001202650650001102662650002602673650001102699650009902710650002702809650009602836650002802932650002202960650002902982650000903011700002203020700002203042700002003064700002903084700002203113700002003135700001903155773009703174856004803271852000903319655001203328IND4469619520221121230924.0121003e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446961952DNAL7 a223506732pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-012-2837-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConti, Barbara10aRepellent effect of Salvia dorisiana, S. longifolia, and S. sclarea (Lamiaceae) essential oils against the mosquito Aedes albopictus Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae)  ap. 291-299.  aAedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) has been one of the fastest spreading insects over the past 20 years. Its medical importance is due to the aggressive daytime human-biting behavior and the ability to vector many viruses, including dengue, LaCrosse, Eastern Equine encephalitis and West Nile viruses. In this research, the essential oils (EOs) extracted from fresh air dried leaves of Salvia dorisiana, S. longifolia, and S. sclarea (Lamiaceae) were evaluated for their repellent activity against A. albopictus by using the human-bait technique. The EOs chemical composition was also investigated, and EOs were divided in three different profiles on the basis of their chemical composition: EO with large amount of monoterpenes from S. sclarea, EO rich in oxygenated sesquiterpenes from S. dorisiana, and S. longifolia EO characterized by similar percentages of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The efficacy protection from S. dorisiana, S. longifolia, and S. sclarea EOs, at dosages ranging from 0.004 to 0.4 μL cm−2 of skin, was evaluated during 120 min of observation. Results indicated that S. dorisiana, S. longifolia, and S. sclarea EOs had a significant repellent activity (RD50 = 0.00035, 0.00049, and 0.00101 μL cm−2, respectively), with differences in repellency rates, as a function of oil, dosage, and observation time. S. dorisiana was the most effective oil: at the two higher dosages, it gave almost complete protection (with a protective efficacy of 90.99% and 95.62%, respectively) for 90 min. The best protection time was achieved with S. dorisiana essential oil. It ranged from 9.2 to 92.4 min. Protection times of S. longifolia and S. sclarea oils ranged from 3.2 to 60 min, and from 3.6 to 64.2 min, respectively. Our findings clearly reveal that these EOs have a good repellent activity against A. albopictus, therefore they can be proposed to improve the efficacy of repellent formulations against the Asian tiger mosquito.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes albopictus 3aSalvia 3aWest Nile virus 3aair drying 3achemical composition 3adengue 3aencephalitis 3aessential oils 3ahorses 3ainsects 3aleaves 3amonoterpenoids 3aoils 3asesquiterpenoids 3aviruses 2aAdministration, Topical 2aAedesxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHuman Experimentation 2aHumans 2aInsect Repellentsxadministration & dosagexchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aMonoterpenesxanalysis 2aOils, Volatilexadministration & dosagexchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aSalviaxchemistry 2aSesquiterpenesxanalysis 2aSkin1 aBenelli, Giovanni1 aLeonardi, Michele1 aAfifi, Fatma U.1 aCervelli, C.q(Claudio),1 aProfeti, Raffaele1 aPistelli, Luisa1 aCanale, Angelo0 tParasitology research.g2012 July, v. 111, no. 1 p.291-299dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-012-2837-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010100158520204100259592002802300650001902328650001902347650001902366650002102385650002302406650001402429650001602443650002102459650002402480650001402504650002602518650002202544650001702566650001602583650002202599650002502621650001702646651001002663700001502673700001602688773012702704856007402831852000902905655001202914IND60652235020221120114932.0190712e20180421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065223502DNAL7 a10.3390/su100412772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Dengpan10aImpact of Future Climate Change on Wheat Production: A Simulated Case for China’s Wheat System  aWith regard to global climate change due to increasing concentration in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>), it is important to examine its potential impact on crop development and production. We used statistically-downscaled climate data from 28 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)&ndash;Wheat model to simulate the impact of future climate change on wheat production. Two future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were used for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations during two different future periods (2031&ndash;2060 referred to as 40S and 2071&ndash;2100 referred to as 80S). Relative to the baseline period (1981&ndash;2010), the trends in mean daily temperature and radiation significantly increased across all stations under the future scenarios. Furthermore, the trends in precipitation increased under future climate scenarios. Due to climate change, the trend in wheat phenology significantly advanced. The early flowering and maturity dates shortened both the vegetative growth stage (VGP) and the whole growth period (WGP). As the advance in the days of maturity was more than that in flowering, the length of the reproductive growth stage (RGP) of spring wheat was shortened. However, as the advance in the date of maturity was less than that of flowering, the RGP of winter wheat was extended. When the increase in CO<inf>2</inf> concentration under future climate scenarios was not considered, the trend in change in wheat production for the baseline declined. In contrast, under increased CO<inf>2</inf> concentration, the trend in wheat yield increased for most of the stations (except for Nangong station) under future climatic conditions. Winter wheat and spring wheat evapotranspiration (ET) decreased across all stations under the two future climate scenarios. As wheat yield increased with decreasing water consumption (as ET) under the future climatic conditions, water use efficiency (WUE) significantly improved in the future period.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3aevapotranspiration 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gases 3ameteorological data 3aphenology 3aproduction technology 3asimulation models 3aspring wheat 3atemperature 3avegetative growth 3awater use efficiency 3awinter wheat 3aChina1 aBai, Huizi1 aLiu, De  Li0 tSustainability.g2018 Apr. 21, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100412773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245007800157300002000235500001900255520108200274592002801356650002401384650000801408650001301416650002301429650002001452700001701472700001101489700005601500700006401556773015001620856007601770852000901846655001201855IND60713782420221118074844.0201023e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071378242DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c089942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Jie10aMolecular Interaction and Orientation of HOCl on Aqueous and Ice Surfaces  ap. 17329-17333.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe interaction and orientation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) on the ice surface has been of great interest as it has important implications to ozone depletion. As HOCl interacts with the ice surface, previous classical molecular dynamics simulations suggest its OH moiety orients to the outside of the ice surface, whereas the quantum calculations performed at 0 K indicate its Cl atom is exposed. To resolve this contradiction, herein, Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations are adopted, and the results suggest that at ambient temperature, the interaction between HOCl with interfacial water is dominated by the robust H-bond of (HOCl)H–O(H₂O). As a result, the HOCl mainly acts as the proton donor to the water surface, which thus can participate in proton transfer reactions via the promotion of interfacial water. Moreover, the Cl atom of HOCl is found to be exposed to the outside of the water surface. Therefore, during the heterogeneous reactions of HOCl on the water surface, the Cl atom becomes the reactive site and is easily attacked by other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aice 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3aozone depletion1 aZhang, Weina1 aWu, Si1 aAn, Taicheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6918-80701 aFrancisco, Joseph S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5461-14860 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Sept. 30, v. 142, no. 41 p.17329-17333dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c089943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245008400160520179400244592002802038650002502066650002702091650001602118650001602134650001402150650001402164650002702178650001002205650002002215650001502235650002002250650001302270650002502283650002102308653000802329653002502337653001502362653001902377700001502396700001202411700001302423700001202436700001502448773010802463856008202571852000902653655001202662IND60751247020221121081214.0211127e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075124702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2021.1014782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Y.F.10aAge-related changes in liver metabolism and antioxidant capacity of laying hens  aThis study aimed to investigate the age-related changes of hepatic metabolism and antioxidant capacity of laying hens at 3 different ages. A total of 192 Hy-line Brown laying hens were assigned into 3 groups: 1) 195-day-old (D195 group); 2) 340-day-old (D340 group); 3) 525-day-old (D525 group). Each group replicated 8 times with 8 hens at the same age. Higher activity of aspartate aminotransferase and lower contents of total protein and globulin were observed in the serum of 525-day-old hens in comparison with their 195-day-old counterparts (P < 0.05). The 525-day-old hens accumulated higher contents of total cholesterol and triglyceride in the liver than 195-day-old birds. Additionally, compared with hens from D195 or D340 group, 525-day-old birds exhibited a lower circulating estradiol level (P < 0.05). For antioxidant capacity, birds in the D525 group showed a higher malondialdehyde concentration in both serum and liver as compared with D195 or D340 group (P < 0.05). The 525-day-old hens also exhibited lower glutathione peroxidase activities in both serum and liver when compared with 195-day-old birds (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, there was a decline of hepatic superoxide dismutase activity in the D525 group in comparison with D195 group (P < 0.05). Compared with 195-day-old counterparts, 340-day-old birds upregulated the mRNA abundance of nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 and glutathione peroxidase 1 in the liver (P < 0.05). In contrast, hens from D525 group showed the downregulation of hepatic nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2, NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1, and superoxide dismutase 1 when compared with D340 group (P < 0.05). These results indicated that increasing age can adversely affect liver metabolism and function of laying hens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3aestradiol 3aglobulins 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3aprotein content 3aquinones 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols 0aage 0aantioxidant capacity 0alaying hen 0aliver function1 aChen, Y.P.1 aJin, R.1 aWang, C.1 aWen, C.1 aZhou, Y.M.0 tPoultry science.g2021 Dec., v. 100, no. 12 p.101478-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2021.1014783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002900181245008800210506007600298520168600374592002802060506003702088650001102125650001402136650002402150650002802174650001602202650003402218650001602252650002702268650001102295650002502306650002402331650002402355700001802379700002102397700002502418700002602443700002102469773012202490856007402612852000902686655001202695IND60650765520221207134116.0190710e20190327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065076552DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110407112doi7 aPMC65208832pmcid7 a309347422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacDonald-Wicks, Lesley 10aDietary Long-Chain Fatty Acids and Cognitive Performance in Older Australian Adults  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConvincing evidence exists for the positive effect of an improvement in diet quality on age-related cognitive decline, in part due to dietary fatty acid intake. A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Hunter Community Study (HCS) (n = 2750) was conducted comparing dietary data from a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) with validated cognitive performance measures, Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen (ARCS) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Adjusted linear regression analysis found statistically significant associations between dietary intake of total n-6 fatty acids (FA), but no other FAs, and better cognitive performance as measured by the ARCS (RC = 0.0043; p = 0.0004; R2 = 0.0084). Multivariate regression analyses of n-6 FA intakes in quartiles showed that, compared with the lowest quartile (179.8&ndash;1150.3 mg), those in the highest quartile (2315.0&ndash;7449.4 mg) had a total ARCS score 2.1 units greater (RC = 10.60466; p = 0.006; R2 = 0.0081). Furthermore, when n-6 FA intake was tested against each of the ARCS domains, statistically significant associations were observed for the Fluency (RC = 0.0011432; p = 0.007; R2 = 0.0057), Visual (RC = 0.0009889; p = 0.034; R2 = 0.0050), Language (RC = 0.0010651; p = 0.047; R2 = 0.0068) and Attention (RC = 0.0011605; p = 0.017; R2 = 0.0099) domains, yet there was no association with Memory (RC = &minus;0.000064; p = 0.889; R2 = 0.0083). No statistically significant associations were observed between FA intakes and MMSE. A higher intake of total n-6 FA, but not other types of FA, was associated with better cognitive performance among a representative sample of older aged Australian adults.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3across-sectional studies 3adietary fat 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3along chain fatty acids 3amemory 3anutritional adequacy 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aregression analysis1 aMcevoy, Mark,1 aMagennis, Eliza 1 aSchofield, Peter  W.1 aPatterson, Amanda  J.1 aZacharia, Karly 0 tNutrients.g2019 Mar. 27, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110407113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007300146245010900219300001600328520160900344592002801953650001301981650001301994650001102007650001602018650002202034650001102056650003502067650001102102650001702113650002002130650001402150650001602164653000802180653001102188653001902199653001802218653002002236700002102256773010302277856008002380852000902460655001202469IND60621346820221120021519.0181116e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062134682DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X177452722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietras-Szewczyk, Małgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7031-719910aModelling of real solar radiation spatial distribution as a tool for solar energy cadastre in the cities  ap. 204-215.  aThe increasing needs of energy and decreasing traditional energy sources are becoming one of the biggest issues of our civilization. The provision of stable energy supply is a matter of state security. The energy consumption keeps growing especially in big cities. Therefore, it became reasonable to produce energy directly in cities. To optimize the use of the solar energy in the city areas, a fundamental issue is to find and estimate the amount of solar radiations at a specified location by using available tools and data. The main goal of this work is to demonstrate the potential of the r.sun model, a component of GRASS software, in calculating real solar radiation for the selected location. The work starts with demonstrating the effect of cloud cover for the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface and the usage of GIS software and Ogimet website in the spatial analysis of real solar radiation distribution. For this purpose, data concerning cloud cover for selected locations were analysed. The study is based on the synoptic data obtained from Ogimet. Average daily cloud cover totals and long-term values were calculated. Apart from the cloud cover data, a significant variable, the Linke turbidity factor, describing the weakening of solar radiation due to the presence of aerosols and water vapour in the atmosphere, was taken into consideration. The obtained results were used to develop a map of real solar radiation distribution for a part of Wrocław. The results obtained by that model with the acquired data by the local meteorological station show compatibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aaerosols 3acities 3acloud cover 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3ageographic information systems 3amodels 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aturbidity 3awater vapor 0aGIS 0aenergy 0asolar cadastre 0asynoptic data 0asolar radiation1 aSzewczyk, Leszek0 tEnergy & environment.g, v. 29, no. 2 p.204-215dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X177452723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007800165300001600243520096500259592002801224650000801252650001001260650001401270650001101284650001301295650001101308650002201319650001601341650001901357700002301376700003101399700002101430700001601451700001901467700001701486700001401503700002201517773007801539856008101617852000901698655001201707IND60173880520221119001548.0150603e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017388052DNAL7 a10.1007/s12284-010-9054-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGill, Navdeep10aDynamic Oryza Genomes: Repetitive DNA Sequences as Genome Modeling Agents  ap. 251-269.  aRepetitive sequences, primarily transposable elements form an indispensable part of eukaryotic genomes. However, little is known about how these sequences originate, evolve and function in context of a genome. In an attempt to address this question, we performed a comparative analysis of repetitive DNA sequences in the genus Oryza, representing ~15 million years of evolution. Both Class I and Class II transposable elements, through their expansion, loss and movement in the genome, were found to influence genome size variation in this genus. We identified 38 LTRretrotransposon families that are present in 1,500 or more copies throughout Oryza, and many are preferentially amplified in specific lineages. The data presented here, besides furthering our understanding of genome organization in the genus Oryza, will aid in the assembly, annotation and analysis of genomic data, as part of the future genome sequencing projects of O. sativa wild relatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOryza 3aevolution 3agenome 3agenomics 3amodels 3asequence analysis 3atransposons 3awild relatives1 aSanMiguel, Phillip1 aDhillon, Braham Deep Singh1 aAbernathy, Brian1 aKim, HyeRan1 aStein, Lincoln1 aWare, Doreen1 aWing, Rod1 aJackson, Scott A.0 tRice.g2010 Dec., v. 3, no. 4 p.251-269dSpringer-Verlagx1939-84257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12284-010-9054-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245010200173300001600275520112900291592002801420650001401448650002301462650001301485650001301498650001101511650001201522650001701534650001901551700006001570773016801630856008001798852000901878655001201887IND60627124920221120122702.0190128e20181206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062712492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b049222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonaubauer, Philipp J.10aEvaluation of Effectiveness Factors for Multicomponent Diffusion Models Inside 3D Catalyst Shapes  ap. 110-119.  aOn an industrial scale, the efficiency of heterogeneous catalysis is commonly subject to diffusive transport limitations. The binary friction model (BFM) combines Maxwell–Stefan-type diffusion, pore effects and viscous contributions for multicomponent reaction mixtures. A variety of catalyst shapes have been developed over the years to overcome transport problems. However, rigorous modeling of multicomponent diffusion–reaction problems in 3D geometries remains an ongoing challenge. We successfully applied the BFM to nine shapes, all varying in size and catalyst loading. The volume-to-surface ratio and the curvature of the bodies were found to be the characteristic features of the pellets, describing the reaction–diffusion interplay. With this, the 3D shape can be adequately approximated with straightforward 1D strategies. Finally, a comparison to Fickian diffusion models highlights the similarities and discrepancies to the Maxwell–Stefan concept of the BFM. These findings can contribute to an integral description of 3D reaction–diffusion problems in homogeneously distributed, mesoporous catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afriction 3ageometry 3amodels 3apellets 3aporous media 3aprocess design1 aHinrichsen, Olaf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3796-69200 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Dec. 06, v. 58, no. 1 p.110-119dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b049223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03949naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002200162245010800184300001600292520219300308592002802501650002602529650001902555650002202574650001702596650001302613650001202626650001502638650001502653650001402668650001302682650001702695650001302712650001702725650001202742650002002754650001302774650000802787650001402795650001002809650001202819650002802831650003202859650002702891650003902918650004002957650001202997650004603009650002203055650002403077650002303101700001703124700002303141700002003164773008603184856004403270852000903314655001203323IND50072830720221119203545.0140210e200008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007283072DNAL7 a110074892pmid7 a10.1007/s0041200000872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzanero, Silvia14aThe chromosomal distribution of phosphorylated histone H3 differs between plants and animals at meiosis  ap. 308-317.  aPlant (Secale cereale, Triticum aestivum) and animal (Eyprepocnemis plorans) meiocytes were analyzed by indirect immunostaining with an antibody recognizing histone H3 phosphorylated at serine 10, to study the relationship between H3 phosphorylation and chromosome condensation at meiosis. To investigate whether the dynamics of histone H3 phosphorylation differs between chromosomes with a different mode of segregation, we included in this study mitotic cells and also meiotic cells of individuals forming bivalents plus three different types of univalents (A chromosomes, B chromosomes and X chromosome). During the first meiotic division, the H3 phosphorylation of the entire chromosomes initiates at the transition from leptotene to zygotene in rye and wheat, whereas in E. plorans it does so at diplotene. In all species analyzed H3 phosphorylation terminates toward interkinesis. The immunosignals at first meiotic division are identical in bivalents and univalents of A and B chromosomes, irrespective of their equational or reductional segregation at anaphase I. The grasshopper X chromosome, which always segregates reductionally, also shows the same pattern. Remarkable differences were found at second meiotic division between plant and animal material. In E. plorans H3 phosphorylation occurred all along the chromosomes, whereas in plants only the pericentromeric regions showed strong immunosignals from prophase II until telophase II. In addition, no immunolabeling was detectable on single chromatids resulting from equational segregation of plant A or B chromosome univalents during the preceding anaphase I. Simultaneous immunostaining with anti-tubulin and anti-phosphorylated H3 antibodies demonstrated that the kinetochores of all chromosomes interact with microtubules, even in the absence of detectable phosphorylated H3 immunosignals. The different pattern of H3 phosphorylation in plant and animal meiocytes suggests that this evolutionarily conserved post-translational chromatin modification might be involved in different roles in both types of organisms. The possibility that in plants H3 phosphorylation is related to sister chromatid cohesion is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEyprepocnemis plorans 3aSecale cereale 3aTriticum aestivum 3aX chromosome 3aanaphase 3aanimals 3aantibodies 3achromatids 3achromatin 3acohesion 3agrasshoppers 3ahistones 3akinetochores 3ameiosis 3aphosphorylation 3aprophase 3arye 3atelophase 3awheat 2aAnimals 2aEdible Grainxgenetics. 2aChromosomesxultrastructure 2aGrasshoppersxgenetics 2aHistonesxisolation & purification 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aMeiosis 2aPhosphoproteinsxisolation & purification 2aSecalexgenetics. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTriticumxgenetics1 aArana, Pilar1 aPuertas, Maria J.,1 aHouben, Andreas0 tChromosoma.g2000 Aug., v. 109, no. 5 p.308-317dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004120000087  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002200161245007700183300001800260500000900278520148900287592002801776650001301804650002301817650001901840650002301859650002001882650001501902650001101917650002601928650001501954650001401969650002301983650001802006650001202024650001002036650001902046650001302065700002102078700002102099773012402120852000902244856009802253655001202351IND2197140420221120112151.0191122e199809  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219714042DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800050024x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLozovaya, Vera V.10aβ-l,3-Glucanase and Resistance to Aspergillus flavus Infection in Maize  ap. 1255-1260.  aepub  aStudies of the activity levels of the fungal cell wall degradative enzyme, β-l,3-glucanase, were carried out with Zea mays L. embryogenie callus cultures and kernels of genotypes with different abilities to resist aflatoxin formation on the ears. Dual-culture experiments of the aflatoxin forming fungus, Aspergillus flavus Link: Fr. with maize callus, demonstrated that the growth of A. flavus on plates was inhibited more by callus of a resistant genotype (Tex 6 ✕ Mol7 denoted T✕M) than by a sensitive genotype (Pa91). The inhibition correlated with the activity levels of β-1,3-glucanase in the callus and in the culture medium. The presence of the fungus caused an increase in enzyme activity in T✕M but not in Pa91 callus. Direct treatment of callus of both genotypes with A. flavus spores caused the amount of callose to increase within 30 min. An elevated β-l,3-glucanase activity in maize kernels was also correlated with lower A. flavus infection observed in the resistant genotype (Tex 6) compared with a susceptible one (B73). Fungal inoculation of the ears increased the enzyme activities both in kernels in contact with and not in contact with the fungus. These studies indicate that β-l,3-glucanase activity may have a role in the inhibition of growth of the A. flavus fungus, that maize embryogenic callus and kernels do respond to the presence of this nonpathogenic fungus, and that these systems might be useful in further plant-fungal interaction studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aAspergillus flavus 3abeta-glucanase 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3acell walls 3acallus 3asomatic embryogenesis 3aaflatoxins 3acorn ears 3agenetic resistance 3aculture media 3acallose 3aseeds 3atissue culture 3agenotype1 aWaranyuwat, Aree1 aWidholm, Jack M.0 tCrop science.g1998 Sept., v. 38, no. 5 p.1255-1260dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800050024x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03019naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245011100211300001600322520147600338592002801814650001801842650001701860650001701877650001401894650001101908650001901919650001201938650001201950650002501962650001301987650001302000650001102013650001502024650001402039650002202053650001002075651001602085653001702101653004002118653002202158653002502180700002602205700001802231700002302249700001902272773011602291856008502407852000902492655001202501IND60584821320221122152423.0200503e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058482132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilyushkina, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3586-202810aApplying the Delphi method to assess impacts of forest management on biodiversity and habitat preservation  ap. 179-189.  aThis study applied a structured expert elicitation technique, the Delphi method, to identify the impacts of five forest management alternatives and several forest characteristics on the preservation of biodiversity and habitats in the boreal zone of the Nordic countries. The panel of experts consisted of a number of scientists in the field. The data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire distributed via e-mail in two rounds. Our findings demonstrated that an increase in management intensity for timber production is likely to have a negative effect on the biodiversity and habitats with intense management alternatives such as a “clear-cutting system” resulting in the strongest adverse impact. The presence of deadwood, mixture of trees of different sizes and increase in stand age were expected to promote preservation of biodiversity and habitats. However, there was little agreement between experts regarding the functional form that relationships between preservation of biodiversity and forest characteristics take. The Delphi method was found useful in investigating the existing knowledge base and capable of contributing to a more comprehensive assessment for decision support as a valuable addition to on-going empirical and modeling efforts. The findings could assist forest managers in developing forest management strategies that generate benefits from timber production while taking into account the trade-offs with biodiversity goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphi method 3abiodiversity 3aclearcutting 3adead wood 3ae-mail 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3aforests 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3amanagers 3amodels 3ascientists 3astand age 3atimber production 3atrees 3aScandinavia 0aSilviculture 0aNon-provisioning ecosystem services 0aForest attributes 0aManagement intensity1 aStrange, N.q(Niels),1 aLöf, Magnus,1 aEzebilo, Eugene E.1 aBoman, Mattias0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 409 p.179-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007400164520106000238592002801298650001901326650002301345650001501368650001501383651001101398653002001409653001701429653001701446653001801463700001601481700001801497773011501515856008301630852000901713655001201722IND60687448920221118203133.0201025e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068744892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2020.1012562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Sheng10aLong-term variations of wind and wave conditions in the Taiwan Strait  aResearch on the long-term characteristics of ocean conditions is becoming increasingly necessary as the impact of climate change is becoming conspicuous.

The validation shows that the simulated results are in agreement with the observations. From analysis of the annual, seasonal, and monthly distributions of wind speeds and significant wave heights, the maximum wind speed and significant wave height appear in January, with the maximum wind speed reaching 12 m/s and maximum significant wave height reaching 2.8 m. Additionally, the long-term trends of the wind speeds and significant wave heights are studied, and, during the 30 years, the wind and wave variation trends are found to increase significantly. Furthermore, the linear trends of the wind speeds and significant wave heights at three points are analyzed, which present the temporal variations of wind and wave over the Taiwan Strait.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3atemporal variation 3awind power 3awind speed 3aTaiwan 0aLong-term trend 0aWind climate 0aWave climate 0aTaiwan strait1 aGong, Yijie1 aWang, Zhifeng0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2020 Apr., v. 36 p.101256-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2020.1012563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012100168506011700289506007600406520144500482592002801927506003701955650002801992650001602020650001202036650001102048650001102059650001502070650001002085650001002095650002302105650001202128651001302140653002502153653001302178653003002191653001402221653002102235700001902256700001802275773010002293856008402393852000902477655001202486IND60767959620221207141511.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076795962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1010442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdissa, Belay10aEmulating the natural spawning conditions of Labeobarbus brevicephalus (PISCES: Cyprinidae) from Lake Tana, Ethiopia  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLabeobarbus brevicephalus is one of the 17 endemic migratory large African barb species making up a species flock in Lake Tana (Ethiopia). The multiple constructions of dams and irrigation weirs on the tributary rivers of Lake Tana have become detrimental to the upstream spawning migration of these fishes. Considering worst-case scenarios of obstruction of all-natural migratory routes, artificial spawning emulation structures were designed and developed at the Bahir Dar Fisheries and Other Aquatic Life Research Center (BFALRC) to emulate the upstream spawning migration routes and habitats. A pond was constructed to emulate the lake and a canal was connected to the pond emulating tributary rivers. The setups were to enable the fishes to migrate out of the pond and spawn at the upper area (pool) of the canal. At the upstream of the canal, gravel beds were prepared on which the L. brevicephalus could spawn. Running (ready for spawning (stage 5)) male and female L. brevicephalus were placed in the pond. After a day long-acclimatization period lake water was pumped into the canal at a discharge rate of 250–1000 liters/min. Stimulated by the flow, 86 male and 24 female L. brevicephalus moved out of the pond migrated to the upper part of the canal made 16 spawning on the gravel beds, and returned to the pond. The fertilized oocytes (zygotes) were collected and it was possible to hatch them in aquariums in the laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLabeobarbus intermedius 3aaquaculture 3afemales 3aflocks 3agravel 3airrigation 3alakes 3amales 3amigratory behavior 3aoocytes 3aEthiopia 0aEmulating structures 0aEthiopia 0aLabeobarbus brevicephalus 0aLake Tana 0aNatural spawning1 aAbebe Getahun,1 aDejen, Eshete0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 Apr., v. 23 p.101044-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1010443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245014700176300001600323520185100339592002802190650002102218650001302239650002202252650002302274650001302297650002002310650002202330650002202352650001102374650001602385650001002401651001002411653002202421653002202443653002902465653002102494653002302515700002102538700002002559700001702579700002202596773011602618856008502734852000902819655001202828IND60584821420221122180617.0190403e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058482142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwaizumi, Masakazu G.10aHistorical seed use and transfer affects geographic specificity in genetic diversity and structure of old planted Pinus thunbergii populations  ap. 211-219.  aAlthough most molecular ecology studies examining genetic variation have focused on natural forests, for some major tree species, natural forests are nearly extinct, and the remaining genetic resources are mainly planted forests. In order to manage the genetic variability and develop a conservation strategy for such species, it is important to examine genetic variation resulting from historical processes during repeated artificial population development through plantations. The geographic pattern of genetic diversity and structure of 49 old planted Pinus thunbergii populations (2755 trees) distributed across Japan was examined using seven nuclear microsatellite markers. We found that allelic diversity was generally lower in both northern and eastern populations; however, locally, some populations in other regions also exhibited low allelic diversity. The overall value of the standardized measure of population differentiation (G′ST = 0.206) was higher than that of both other widespread Japanese conifers and continental Pinus species. STRUCTURE software revealed a general gradual cline in genetic structure from southwestern to northeastern populations; however, some populations on the Japan Sea side showed quite a different local proportion of cluster memberships from nearby populations. These observations indicated that most of the preserved, planted populations of P. thunbergii possess regional genetic variation, but some populations were developed from seed pools derived from other regions, possibly through distribution by ship along the Japan Sea. Information on this specific genetic variation as a result of historical seed use and transfer should assist the design of several conservation units and breeding zones, while also taking care of a deep-seated need for conservation of pine forests by local people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus thunbergii 3abreeding 3acomputer software 3aconiferous forests 3aconifers 3agenetic markers 3agenetic resources 3agenetic variation 3apeople 3aplantations 3atrees 3aJapan 0aGenetic diversity 0aGenetic structure 0aHistorical seed transfer 0aPinus thunbergii 0aPlanted population1 aMiyata, Shousuke1 aHirao, Tomonori1 aTamura, Miho1 aWatanabe, Atsushi0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 408 p.211-219dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006700140245019900207300001800406520138200424592002801806650001401834650002101848650001201869650002001881650000901901650001401910650002201924650002201946650000901968650001101977650001801988650002802006650001902034650001402053650001702067650001302084700001602097700001802113700001802131700001502149700001802164700001602182700001402198700001102212773014202223856007402365852000902439655001202448IND60635359620221122010305.0190329e20190327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063535962DNAL7 a10.1039/c8tb03320j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhangThese authors contributed equally to this work., Tiantian10aGlucose oxidase and polydopamine functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles: combination of the photothermal effect and reactive oxygen species generation for dual-modality selective cancer therapy  ap. 2190-2200.  aCancer cells possess some inherent characteristics, such as glucose-dependence and intolerance to heat and exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, a strategy has been developed to target these vulnerable weaknesses of cancer cells using glucose oxidase (GOx) and polydopamine (PDA) functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe₃O₄@PDA/GOx NPs). PDA is first deposited on the surfaces of iron oxide NPs through self-polymerization, and then GOx is covalently linked with PDA upon mixing the enzyme and Fe₃O₄@PDA under alkaline conditions. In this system, the PDA layer along with iron oxide NPs serves as a photothermal transfer material converting near infrared (NIR) radiation into heat. The covalently linked GOx can competitively consume glucose and spontaneously generate ROS H₂O₂ that can be further converted by the iron oxide NPs into more toxic ˙OH, inducing apoptosis of cancer cells. The selective toxicity of Fe₃O₄@PDA/GOx NPs on cancer cells is demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, a single injection rather than multiple doses results in significant suppression of tumors, and does not induce apparent histological lesions in the 4T1 tumor-bearing Balb/c mice. The versatility of the functionalization strategy reported in this study will contribute to developing efficient therapies for selective cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3achemical bonding 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aheat 3ahistology 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amice 3amixing 3ananoparticles 3anear infrared radiation 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aLi, Yinping1 aHong, Weiying1 aChen, Zhiyong1 aPeng, Peng1 aYuan, Shiling1 aQu, Jingyao1 aXiao, Min1 aXu, Li0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Mar. 27, v. 7, no. 13 p.2190-2200dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb03320j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100003000192245010800222506007600330520163700406592002802043506003702071650001802108650002002126650001902146650001102165650001902176650001102195650000902206653001502215653001702230653002002247653001502267653002602282653001802308653002002326653002002346653001202366653002202378653001002400653001802410653002302428653001602451700002302467700002202490700002002512700002102532700002002553700005902573773009302632856008602725852000902811655001202820IND60690950120221207133412.0211030e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069095012DNAL7 aPMC70572012pmcid7 a321544092pmid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRincón-Arévalo, Héctor10aLow frequency of IL-10+ B cells in patients with atherosclerosis is related with inflammatory condition  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aB cells involvement in animal models of atherosclerosis has been unequivocally established. However, the role of these cells in patients with atherosclerosis is almost unknown. Besides the production of antibodies, B cells can also exhibit regulatory functions mainly through IL-10. Here, we characterized human B cell subsets, their production of IL-10 in patients with atherosclerosis and their potential association with inflammation.Patients with confirmed atherosclerotic events and controls with low cardiovascular risk were included. B cells subsets were determined in mononuclear cells (PBMC) using flow cytometry. PBMC were cultured ex vivo (5 h) and in vitro (48 h) to determine IL-10⁺ B cells and in some cases TNF-α⁺ and IFN-γ⁺ CD4⁺ T cells. The inflammatory state of the participants was determined through high sensitivity C reactive protein levels.Increase in percentage and number of plasmablasts was observed in patients with atherosclerosis compared with controls. A decreased frequency of IL-10⁺ B cells was observed in patients, both in ex vivo and in vitro cultures. This decrease was detected in transitional, memory, and plasmablast subsets. Interestingly, the reduction of IL-10⁺ B cells negatively and significantly correlated with the inflammatory condition of the studied subjects and associated with an increased frequency of TNF-α⁺ and IFN-γ⁺ CD4⁺ T cells. The blockade of IL-10R did not show further effect in T cells activation.There is an association between the inflammatory state and a reduction of IL-10⁺ B cells that could contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aatherosclerosis 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-10 3amemory 3arisk 0aImmunology 0aInflammation 0aHealth sciences 0aCardiology 0aCardiovascular system 0aImmune system 0aImmune disorder 0aAtherosclerosis 0aB cells 0aRegulatory B cell 0aIL-10 0aB cell subset 0aC reactive protein 0aCholesterol1 aQuintero, Julio C.1 aFortich, Fernando1 aRojas, Mauricio1 aVasquez, Gloria,1 aCastaño, Diana1 aYassin, Lina M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9375-03740 tHeliyon.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.e03441-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245014400162500001400306520120700320592002801527650001901555650001601574650001201590650001301602650001901615650002801634650001301662650001201675650001301687650001901700700003001719700002901749700002601778773011901804856007601923852000901999655001202008IND60721614420221122211446.0201224e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072161442DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91218682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrego, Ricardo 10aMacroelements and Trace Elements Content in Brine-Canned Mackerel (Scomber colias) Subjected to High-Pressure Processing and Frozen Storage  aNAL-light  aThis study analysed the effect of prior high-pressure processing (HPP; 200–600 MPa, 2 min), freezing (-30 °C, 48 h), and frozen storage (-18 °C, 6 months) on the macroelement and trace element content in brine-canned mackerel (Scomber colias). Most elements (Na, Ca, Ba, Mn, Fe, Cu, Cd, Sn, As, S, and Se) showed an increased (p < 0.05) presence in mackerel muscle canned after freezing. A content increase (p < 0.05) was also observed for Na and Sn if prior frozen storage was also applied; on the contrary, Ca, Ba, Mn, Fe, Cd, S, and Se showed a content decrease (p < 0.05) as a result of such storage. Freezing, frozen storage, and canning led to lower values (p < 0.05) in canned fish for K, Mg, Pb, and P. Prior HPP led to relevant content decreases (p < 0.05) for K, Mg, Ca, Ba, Mn, Fe, Pb, and P contents in fish canned after the freezing step; HPP provoked additional decreases (p < 0.05) in Ca, Ba, and Mn levels in samples corresponding to 6-month frozen storage. On the contrary, prior HPP led to marked increases (p < 0.05) for Cd, S, and Se contents in all canned samples. Content changes are explained on the basis of modifications of other constituents and liquor losses from muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScomber colias 3acanned fish 3acanning 3afreezing 3afrozen storage 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amackerel 3amuscles 3asampling 3atrace elements1 aVázquez Murillo, Manuel,1 aCobelo-García, Antonio 1 aAubourg, Santiago  P.0 tFoods.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 9, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91218683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007300162300001800235520100700253592002801260650001201288650001401300650002301314650000901337650002401346650001601370650001901386650001901405650001801424650002601442650002301468650001901491700002001510700001801530700002201548700001801570773013401588856007501722852000901797655001201806IND60536826320221118083703.0160807e20120314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053682632DNAL7 a10.1021/ie200693v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaque, Md.

In the present work, coir fiber reinforced polypropylene composites were manufactured using injection molding method. Raw coir was chemically treated with benzene diazonium salt in alkali, acidic, and neutral media separately in order to increase the compatibility between the coir fiber and polypropylene composite. During chemical treatment, hydrophilic -OH groups in the raw coir cellulose were converted to hydrophobic -O–Na groups. Both raw and treated coir at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 wt % were utilized during composite manufacturing. Microstructural analysis and mechanical tests were conducted. Alkali treated specimens yielded the best set of mechanical properties. On the basis of fiber loading, 30% fiber reinforced composites had the optimum set of mechanical properties among all composites manufactured.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acellulose 3achemical treatment 3acoir 3adiazonium compounds 3aengineering 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3amechanical testing 3apolypropylenes1 aAli, Md.

Ensuring structural integrity of key nuclear plant components is essential for both safe and economic operation. Structural integrity assessments require knowledge of the mechanical and physical properties of materials, together with an understanding of mechanisms that can limit the overall operating life. With improved mechanistic understanding comes the ability to develop predictive models of the service life of components. Such models often require parameters which can be provided only by characterisation of processes occurring in situ over a range of scales, with the sub-micrometre-scale being particularly important, but also challenging. This appraisal reviews the techniques currently available to characterise microstructural features at the nanometre to micrometre length-scale that can be used to elucidate mechanisms that lead to the early stages of environmentally-assisted crack formation and subsequent growth. Following an appraisal of the techniques and their application, there is a short discussion and consideration for future opportunities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acracking 3adurability 3aengineering 3aengineers 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aplanting 0aMeasurement techniques 0aEnvironmentally assisted cracking 0aSteel 0aLength scale 0aNuclear reactor 0aMaterials characterization 0aNuclear engineering 0aMaterials science 0aMaterials property 0aCorrosion 0aMaterials structure1 aBurrows, Robert1 aPatel, Rajesh1 aMoore, Stacy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7928-97131 aHallam, Keith R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5789-17351 aFlewitt, Peter E.J.0 tHeliyon.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.e03448-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245008400160500001400244520125600258592002801514650002201542650001401564650002201578650002001600650003801620650001301658650001401671650002201685650001001707650003301717650001301750650001301763650000801776650001301784650001201797650001901809650001501828650001101843650001701854650001201871700001901883700002101902700002001923773011901943856007602062852000902138655001202147IND60721614820221122211418.0201224e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072161482DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91217372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Seon-Min 10aStarch Retrogradation in Rice Cake: Influences of Sucrose Stearate and Glycerol  aNAL-light  aRetrogradation properties and kinetics of rice cakes with the addition of glycerol (GLY) and sucrose fatty acid ester (SE) were investigated. In hardness, both rice cakes with glycerol (RGLY) and rice cakes with sucrose fatty acid ester (RSE) showed lower initial hardening compared with the control for up to 5 days. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of RSE showed a B+V-type pattern, and the relative crystallinity showed that GLY and SE lowered the initial and final crystallization of rice cake. Both GLY and SE affected the retrogradation enthalpy, glass transition temperature, and ice melting enthalpy in differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). However, ¹H NMR relaxation time (T₂) of rice cake decreased regardless of additives. From these results, the addition of glycerol and sucrose stearate inhibits the retrogradation process of rice cakes, which will solve industrial problems. Applying the Avrami equation for retrogradation kinetics of rice cake was suitable in XRD and DSC with high coefficient of determination (0.9 < R²). Meanwhile, the other retrogradation index improved the R² when the exponential rise to maximum equation was used. This suggests that there is an alternative of Avrami equation to predict the retrogradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadditives 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenthalpy 3aequations 3afatty acid esters 3afoods 3aglass transition temperature 3aglycerol 3ahardness 3aice 3akinetics 3amelting 3aretrogradation 3arice cakes 3astarch 3astearic acid 3asucrose1 aChoi, Hee-Don 1 aChoi, Hyun-Wook 1 aBaik, Moo-Yeol 0 tFoods.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 9, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91217373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100002500192245012300217506007600340520165200416592002802068506003702096650002602133650001502159650001802174650003002192650002602222650001102248653002302259653002602282653002902308653001902337653000902356653002202365653004802387653002102435700002902456700001802485773009302503856008602596852000902682655001202691IND60690950620221207131554.0211030e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069095062DNAL7 aPMC70566532pmcid7 a321544122pmid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmud, Aliyu Wappah10aQSAR and molecular docking studies of 1,3-dioxoisoindoline-4-aminoquinolines as potent antiplasmodium hybrid compounds  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aQuantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) provides a model that link biological activities of compounds to thier chemical stuctures and molecular docking study reveals the interaction between drug and its target enzyme. These studies were conducted on 1,3-dioxoisoindoline-4-aminoquinolines with the aim of producing a model that could be used to design highly potent antiplasmodium. The compounds were first optimized using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with basis set B3LYP/6-31G∗ then their descriptors calculated. Genetic Function Algorithm (GFA) was used to select descriptors and build the model. One of the four models generated was found to be the best having internal and external squared correlation coefficient (R²) of 0.9459 and 0.7015 respectively, adjusted squared correlation coefficient (Rₐdⱼ) of 0.9278, leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation coefficient (Q²cᵥ) of 0.8882. The model shows that antiplasmodial activities of 1,3-dioxoisoindoline-4-aminoquinolines depend on ATSC5i, GATS8p, minHBint3, minHBint5, MLFER_A and topoShape descriptors. The model was validated to be predictive, robust and reliable. Hence, it can predict the antiplasmodium activities of new 1,3-dioxoisoindoline-4-aminoquinolines.The docking result indicates strong binding between 1,3-dioxoisoindoline-4-aminoquinolines and Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (pfLDH), and revealed the important of the morpholinyl substituent and amide linker in inhibiting pfLDH. These results could serve as a model for designing novel 1,3-dioxoisoindoline-4-aminoquinolines as inhibitors of PfLDH with higher antiplasmodial activities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aalgorithms 3aantimalarials 3adensity functional theory 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amodels 0aPhysical chemistry 0aTheoretical chemistry 0aPharmaceutical chemistry 0aAntiplasmodium 0aQSAR 0aMolecular docking 0aPlasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase 0aHybrid compounds1 aShallangwa, Gideon Adamu1 aUzairu, Adamu0 tHeliyon.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.e03449-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245013700161500001400298520107600312592002801388650002301416650001301439650000901452650001001461650001601471650001301487650001501500650002401515650001501539650003301554650002701587650001801614650001301632650001401645650001601659650002501675650001601700700002201716700002101738700002201759773011901781856007601900852000901976655001201985IND60721614920221122211457.0201224e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072161492DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91218722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasiri, Laleh 10aRheological Behavior of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice) Extract as a Function of Concentration and Temperature: A Critical Reappraisal  aNAL-light  aIn the present study, rheological properties of twelve different licorice root extracts were evaluated using a rotational viscometer as a function of soluble solids content (15–45 °Bx) and temperature (30–70 °C). Response Surface Methodology was used to understand the relationships between the parameters. The experimental data were then fit into mathematical models. The results, for the first time, revealed that the licorice solutions had non-Newtonian shear-thinning behaviors with flow behavior indexes of 0.24 to 0.91, depending on the licorice extract samples, temperature, and °Bx. These observations were different from those reported in the literature and the present study elaborated on reasons for such observations. Further, the shear-thinning behavior generally increased by increasing the °Bx and decreasing the temperature. In addition, the power-law model was found to be suitable for predicting the experimental data. The newly revealed information can be particularly important in designing the unit operations for licorice extract processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycyrrhiza glabra 3abehavior 3aflow 3afoods 3ainformation 3alicorice 3aliterature 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3arheological properties 3aroot extracts 3asampling 3asolutions 3atemperature 3atotal soluble solids 3aviscometers1 aGavahian, Mohsen 1 aMajzoobi, Mahsa 1 aFarahnaky, Asgar 0 tFoods.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 9, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91218723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245011100158500001400269520132800283592002801611650002001639650001201659650001701671650001301688650001601701650001401717650002101731650001701752650001501769650001501784650001301799650001401812650001101826650001501837650001101852650000901863650002501872650001101897700002101908700002301929700002201952773011901974856007602093852000902169655001202178IND60721615020221120112842.0201224e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072161502DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91218732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing 10aLime Juice Enhances Calcium Bioaccessibility from Yogurt Snacks Formulated with Whey Minerals and Proteins  aNAL-light  aYogurt-based snacks originally with a calcium content between 0.10 and 0.17 mmol/g dry matter were enriched with a whey mineral concentrate and whey protein isolate or hydrolysate. Whey mineral concentrate was added to increase the total amount of calcium by 0.030 mmol/g dry matter. Calcium bioaccessibility was determined following an in vitro protocol including oral, gastric, and intestinal digestion, with special focus on the effect of lime juice quantifying calcium concentration and activity. Calcium bioaccessibility, defined as soluble calcium divided by total calcium after intestinal digestion amounted to between 17 and 25% for snacks without lime juice. For snacks with lime juice, the bioaccessibility increased to between 24 and 40%, an effect attributed to the presence of citric acid. Citric acid increased the calcium solubility both from whey mineral concentrate and yogurt, and the citrate anion kept supersaturated calcium soluble in the chyme. The binding of calcium in the chyme from snacks with or without lime juice was compared electrochemically, showing that citrate increased the amount of bound calcium but with lower affinity. The results indicated that whey minerals, a waste from cheese production, may be utilized in snacks enhancing calcium bioaccessibility when combined with lime juice.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3acheesemaking 3acitrates 3acitric acid 3adigestion 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrolysates 3aintestines 3alime juice 3aminerals 3aprotocols 3asnacks 3asolubility 3awastes 3awhey 3awhey protein isolate 3ayogurt1 aAalaei, Kataneh 1 aSkibsted, Leif  H.1 aAhrné, Lilia  M.0 tFoods.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 9, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91218733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013600157300001600293500002000309520130800329592002801637650003101665650001401696650001401710650001001724650002301734650003401757650001401791650001401805650002201819650002801841650003501869650001601904650001001920651001101930700002301941700002301964700001201987700002701999700001902026700002202045700002002067700002202087700002002109700002102129700002302150700001802173700002902191773009802220856007302318852000902391655001202400IND60571455620221118040815.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057145562DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.144342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Ziming12aA small secreted protein in Zymoseptoria tritici is responsible for avirulence on wheat cultivars carrying the Stb6 resistance gene  ap. 619-631.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aZymoseptoria tritici is the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch, a major pathogen of wheat globally and the most damaging pathogen of wheat in Europe. A gene‐for‐gene (GFG) interaction between Z. tritici and wheat cultivars carrying the Stb6 resistance gene has been postulated for many years, but the genes have not been identified. We identified AvrStb6 by combining quantitative trait locus mapping in a cross between two Swiss strains with a genome‐wide association study using a natural population of c. 100 strains from France. We functionally validated AvrStb6 using ectopic transformations. AvrStb6 encodes a small, cysteine‐rich, secreted protein that produces an avirulence phenotype on wheat cultivars carrying the Stb6 resistance gene. We found 16 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms among the tested strains, indicating that AvrStb6 is evolving very rapidly. AvrStb6 is located in a highly polymorphic subtelomeric region and is surrounded by transposable elements, which may facilitate its rapid evolution to overcome Stb6 resistance. AvrStb6 is the first avirulence gene to be functionally validated in Z. tritici, contributing to our understanding of avirulence in apoplastic pathogens and the mechanisms underlying GFG interactions between Z. tritici and wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3acultivars 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic resistance 3agenome-wide association study 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aprotein secretion 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atransposons 3awheat 3aFrance1 aMarcel, Thierry C.1 aHartmann, Fanny E.1 aMa, Xin1 aPlissonneau, Clémence1 aZala, Marcello1 aDucasse, Aurélie1 aConfais, Johann1 aCompain, Jérôme1 aLapalu, Nicolas1 aAmselem, Joëlle1 aMcDonald, Bruce A.1 aCroll, Daniel1 aPalma‐Guerrero, Javier0 tnew phytologist.g2017 Apr., v. 214, no. 2 p.619-631dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.144343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009000169520199000259592002802249650001202277650001102289650001402300650001802314650002102332650000902353650000902362650001702371651001102388651001702399653001702416653001202433653002002445653003302465653001702498653000802515653000802523653000902531653000802540653000702548653000802555653000802563653000802571653001002579653000902589653001302598653001102611653000702622653000802629653000802637700002202645700001602667700001902683700001502702773008702717856008502804852000902889655001202898IND60772226320221122003454.0220509e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077222632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2022.1062622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Rebekah10aWind erosion susceptibility modelling along the Eastern Cape Wild Coast, South Africa  aWind erosion is a major driver of land degradation, impacting more than a third of all land areas in recent centuries. It has been estimated that approximately 19% of lands in Europe are moderately to highly susceptible to wind erosion, whilst up to 25% of East and Southern Africa are at moderate to elevated risk of soil erosion. Along the eastern seaboard of South Africa, accelerated wind erosion has led to severe, localised land degradation in parts of the Wild Coast. In data sparse regions where conventional wind erosion modelling is difficult, mitigation of the devastating impacts associated with accelerated wind erosion could be facilitated by the identification of highly susceptible areas. Therefore, the study objectives were to map the regional wind erosion susceptibility conditions and identify vulnerable areas. In this study, general concepts of the Wind Erosion Equation were adopted. Two regional susceptibility methods were implemented and compared. Model 1 employed a geostatistical approach, based on erosion factor class frequency ratio data and Analytical Hierarchy Process importance weights. Model 2 utilised the data driven Weights of Evidence modelling technique. Model 1 has classified large areas of the study area as having low susceptibility (46%) whilst Model 2 classed more than 90% of the areas as very low susceptible zones. Both models show that less than 4% of the study region has a high to very high susceptibility to wind erosion. In general, areas associated with a higher wind erosion susceptibility are poorly vegetated, wind exposed coastal zones that are characterized by unconsolidated, erodible sandy soils. Model 1 and Model 2 are associated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.987 and 0.946 respectively, displaying satisfactory average performances. The employed modelling approaches provide an effective means to assess regional wind erosion susceptibility in coastal environments worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatenas 3acoasts 3aequations 3ageostatistics 3aland degradation 3arisk 3awind 3awind erosion 3aEurope 3aSouth Africa 0aWind erosion 0aCoastal 0aFrequency ratio 0aAnalytical Hierarchy Process 0aSouth Africa 0aWEQ 0aLAI 0aNDVI 0aGIS 0aFR 0aAHP 0aWoE 0aDEM 0aSUDEM 0aQGIS 0aSAGA GIS 0aSAGHOS 0aCR 0aROC 0aAUC1 aMusekiwa, Chiedza1 aBotha, Greg1 aNcume, Mawande1 aKemp, Jaco0 tCatena.g2022 July, v. 214 p.106262-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.1062623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245007300163500001400236520099800250592002801248650003501276650001201311650001001323650001801333650002101351650001401372650002401386650002301410650001001433651001101443700002201454700002401476700002001500773011901520856007601639852000901715655001201724IND60721615220221120113015.0201224e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072161522DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91218752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHonig, Vladimir 10aNutrient Effect on the Taste of Mineral Waters: Evidence from Europe  aNAL-light  aIn this study, 15 selected bottled mineral waters from chosen European countries were tested for their mineral nutrient contents. In particular, six important nutrients (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, HCO3-, Cl⁻) were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The content of mineral nutrients in all sampled mineral waters were compared to their expected content based on the label. Consequently, their taste was evaluated by 60 trained panelists who participated in the sensory analysis. The results from both the atomic absorption spectroscopy and sensory analysis were analyzed using the regression framework. On the basis of the results from the regression analysis, we determined to what extent the individual mineral nutrients determined the taste of the mineral water. According to the regression results, four out of six analyzed nutrients had a measurable impact on taste. These findings can help producers to provide ideal, health-improving nutrients for mineral water buyers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acalcium 3afoods 3amineral water 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aregression analysis 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3aEurope1 aProcházka, Petr,1 aObergruber, Michal 1 aRoubík, Hynek 0 tFoods.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 9, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91218753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009800170520202500268592002802293650002202321650001202343650002002355650001802375650001102393650001102404650002902415650001002444650001902454650002402473650002802497650001502525653002802540653002902568653003602597653003802633653001702671700001502688700001602703700001302719700001502732700001402747700001502761700001402776773008702790856008502877852000902962655001202971IND60772226420221122003443.0220509e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077222642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2022.1062632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Qingwei10aMonitoring the impacts of cultivated land quality on crop production capacity in arid regions  aCultivated land plays a vital role in human survival and the development of human civilization. The cultivated land quality (CLQ) is of considerable significance for ensuring food security and social stability. Although studies have been conducted to assess CLQ, efforts regarding the quantitative impacts of CLQ on crop production capacity are still scarce, especially in arid regions. Understanding such a question greatly benefits land resources management and sustainable development of oasis agriculture. The objective of this study is to explore the spatiotemporal variations of CLQ and to quantify the impacts of CLQ on crop production capacity via an ordinary linear regression (OLS) model and correction analysis in arid regions. The Delphi-AHP (analytic hierarchy process) method is applied to assess CLQ in this study with the highest accuracy (96.35%). The average score of cultivated land quality (S-CLQ) is 58.75 in the study area. The results further suggest that the quality of decreasing cultivated land (61.53) is much higher than that of increasing cultivated land (57.99). We use net primary productivity (NPP) calculated by the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) to simulate the crop production capacity and find that CLQ has a significant positive impact on crop production capacity (R² = 0.706). The distribution of average annual NPP is similar to that of CLQ. 62.41% of cultivated land shows an increasing trend in annual NPP, whereas 37.57% of cultivated land shows a decreasing trend. Pearson coefficient by intervals is calculated to identify areas where crop production capacity does not match the quality of cultivated land. The results reveal considerable differences in the Pearson coefficient in various intervals (negative correlation in 5 intervals and positive correlation in 10 intervals). This research quantifies the impacts of CLQ on crop production capacity and provides a way to accurately capture the location of cultivated land that needs to be improved in arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acatenas 3acrop production 3afood security 3ahumans 3amodels 3anet primary productivity 3aoases 3aphotosynthesis 3aregression analysis 3asustainable development 3avegetation 0aCultivated land quality 0aCrop production capacity 0aVegetation photosynthesis model 0aDelphi-analytic hierarchy process 0aArid regions1 aWu, Shixin1 aHuang, Xiao1 aKong, Lu1 aYan, Yuyan1 aXiao, Hao1 aLi, Yuzhen1 aCai, Peng0 tCatena.g2022 July, v. 214 p.106263-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.1062633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100002100192245009100213506007600304520134500380592002801725506003701753650001701790650001501807650000901822650001501831650001801846650000901864650001601873650002101889653001101910653002401921653001201945653001201957653002601969653003101995653002102026653001402047653002402061653002802085653003402113653001802147653001802165700001802183700001702201700001502218773009302233856008602326852000902412655001202421IND60690951020221207131505.0211030e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069095102DNAL7 aPMC70572232pmcid7 a321544152pmid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jiangping,10aExplosive property and combustion kinetics of grain dust with different particle sizes  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effect of particle size on the combustion and explosion properties of grain dust is investigated by Hartmann tube, cone calorimeter (CC), and thermogravimetry (TG), it aims to provide fundamental experimental data of grain dust for an in-depth study on its potential risk. The fine-grain dust facilitates the decrease in the minimum ignition temperature (MIT) of dust layer and dust cloud, as well as the obvious increases in the maximum explosion pressure Pₘₐₓ (climbs from 0.36 to 0.49 MPa) and pressure rising rate dP/dt (rises from 6.05 to 12.12 MPa s⁻¹), leading to the increases in maximum combustion rate (dw/dτ)ₘₐₓ and combustion characteristic index S, corresponding to the greater or severer potential risk. Because the E corresponding to combustion increases from 106.05 (sample with a particle size of 180–1250 μm) to 153.45 kJ mol⁻¹ for the sample of 80–96 μm, the combustion process gradually transforms from diffusion-controlled into a kinetically controlled mode with the decreasing particle size of grain dust, together with the retardation of initially transient charring. It determines that the competition between the charring and combustion dominates the decomposition, and the combustion prevails for the coarse particle, while the charring controls the combustion for the fine-grain dust.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalorimeters 3acombustion 3adust 3agrain dust 3aparticle size 3arisk 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aEnergy 0aMaterials chemistry 0aBiofuel 0aBiomass 0aEnergy sustainability 0aMaterials characterization 0aMaterials safety 0aExplosion 0aCombustion kinetics 0aHeat release properties 0aCoats-redfern integral method 0aParticle size 0aHartmann tube1 aTang, GongFan1 aWang, YaChao1 aHan, Yujiu0 tHeliyon.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.e03457-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245007000197300001600267500002000283506007600303520160300379592002801982506003702010650001302047650000902060650001802069650001402087650001902101650001002120650002202130650001502152650001702167650000902184650001602193650001602209650002802225650003502253700001702288700001702305700001502322700001202337700001602349700001702365700002002382700001802402700001502420700001902435700001502454773009802469856007302567852000902640655001202649IND60571455820221207144924.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057145582DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.144002doi7 aPMC53633432pmcid7 a280679532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Guanghui10aComplex genetic architecture underlies maize tassel domestication  ap. 852-864.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMaize (Zea mays) tassels underwent profound morphological changes during maize domestication and improvement. Although a number of genes affecting maize inflorescence development have been identified, the genetic basis of the morphological changes in maize tassels since domestication is not well understood. Here, using a large population of 866 maize‐teosinte BC₂S₃ recombinant inbred lines genotyped using 19 838 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we performed high‐resolution quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for five tassel morphological traits. We showed that the five tassel traits were associated with different genetic architecture features. Known genes for maize inflorescence development identified by mutagenesis were significantly enriched in the tassel trait QTLs, and many of these genes, including ramosa1 (ra1), barren inflorescence2 (bif2), unbranched2 (ub2), zea floricaula leafy2 (zfl2) and barren stalk fastigiate1 (baf1), showed evidence of selection. An in‐depth nucleotide diversity analysis at the bif2 locus identified strong selection signatures in the 5′‐regulatory region. We also found that several known flowering time genes co‐localized with tassel trait QTLs. A further association analysis indicated that the maize photoperiod gene ZmCCT was significantly associated with tassel size variation. Using near‐isogenic lines, we narrowed down a major‐effect QTL for tassel length, qTL9‐1, to a 513‐kb physical region. These results provide important insights into the genetic architecture that controls maize tassel evolution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adomestication 3aevolution 3aflowering date 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ainbred lines 3aloci 3amutagenesis 3aphotoperiod 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aWang, Xufeng1 aHuang, Cheng1 aXu, Dingyi1 aLi, Dan1 aTian, Jinge1 aChen, Qiuyue1 aWang, Chenglong1 aLiang, Yameng1 aWu, Yaoyao1 aYang, Xiaohong1 aTian, Feng0 tnew phytologist.g2017 Apr., v. 214, no. 2 p.852-864dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.144003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100002100192245012300213506007600336520128000412592002801692506003701720650002301757650001301780650001301793650001101806650001301817650001401830650001601844650001701860650001501877650001501892650001801907650002401925650001201949650000901961650001701970650001101987653001701998653001702015653002102032653001702053653002502070653002902095653001902124653003002143653001702173700002702190773009302217856008602310852000902396655001202405IND60690951120221207132552.0211030e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069095112DNAL7 aPMC70566492pmcid7 a321544162pmid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWongon, Matusorn10aInhibitory effect of Artocarpus lakoocha Roxb and oxyresveratrol on α-glucosidase and sugar digestion in Caco-2 cells  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLong-term diabetic complications are exacerbated by post-prandial hyperglycemia which could be ameliorated by α-glucosidase inhibitor including oxyresveratrol. Puag-Haad is an aqueous extract from Artocarpus lakoocha Roxb. containing ~65% oxyresveratrol. Oxyresveratrol is an inhibitor of isolated yeast α-glucosidase enzyme but has not been tested on intact gut enterocytes where the enzyme is membrane-bound. Accordingly, differentiated Caco-2 cells that contain the native enzyme were used to test maltose hydrolysis in the present study. The results demonstrated that purified yeast α-glucosidase was non-competitively inhibited by oxyresveratrol (Ki 54.4 ± 0.7 μg/mL) and Puag-Haad (2.7 ± 0.1 μg/mL) compared to 153.8 ± 4.3 μg/mL acarbose, an anti-diabetic drug. In differentiated Caco-2 cells, both oxyresveratrol and Puag-Haad inhibited maltose hydrolysis with lesser potency compared to acarbose. Thus, although weaker than acarbose, oxyresveratrol and Puag-Haad do not inhibit pancreatic amylase which might be a therapeutic asset in preventing fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate causes abdominal bloating, flatulence, or diarrhea. Oxyresveratrol and Puag-Haad may help control postprandial hyperglycemia with low risk of gastrointestinal side effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArtocarpus lacucha 3aacarbose 3aamylases 3aassets 3adiarrhea 3adigestion 3aenterocytes 3afermentation 3aflatulence 3ahydrolysis 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypoglycemic agents 3amaltose 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3ayeasts 0aBiochemistry 0aCell biology 0aDigestive system 0aPharmacology 0aAlternative medicine 0aArtocarpus lakoocha Roxb 0aOxyresveratrol 0aα-glucosidase inhibitors 0aCaco-2 cells1 aLimpeanchob, Nanteetip0 tHeliyon.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.e03458-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011800159300001800277520088700295592002801182650004401210650002201254650002001276650002301296650002701319650002601346650003701372650001601409650001301425650002301438650001801461650002701479650003301506650002101539650002201560650003701582650000901619650002901628650001501657700001901672773013401691856007501825852000901900655001201909IND60536827520221118083632.0160807e20120314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053682752DNAL7 a10.1021/ie20183832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, Rashmi

This limits our understanding of the ecological scales at which trait variation occurs in response to environmental drivers and change. We analyzed and compared multiple canopy foliar trait distributions using field sampling and airborne imaging spectroscopy along an Andes‐to‐Amazon elevation gradient. Field‐estimated traits were generated from three community‐weighting methods, and remotely sensed estimates of traits were made at three scales defined by sampling grain size and ecological extent. Field and remote sensing approaches revealed increases in average leaf mass per unit area (LMA), water, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) and polyphenols with increasing elevation. Foliar nutrients and photosynthetic pigments displayed little to no elevation trend. Sample weighting approaches had little impact on field‐estimated trait responses to elevation. Plot representativeness of trait distributions at landscape scales decreased with increasing elevation. Remote sensing indicated elevation‐dependent increases in trait variance and distributional skew. Multiscale invariance of LMA, leaf water and NSC mark these traits as candidates for tracking forest responses to changing climate. Trait‐based ecological studies can be greatly enhanced with multiscale studies made possible by imaging spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acanopy 3acarbohydrates 3aclimate change 3aimage analysis 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3anutrients 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3apolyphenols 3aremote sensing 3aspectroscopy 3atropical forests 3avariance1 aMartin, Roberta E.1 aAnderson, Christopher B.1 aKryston, Katherine1 aVaughn, Nicholas1 aKnapp, David E.1 aBentley, Lisa Patrick1 aShenkin, Alexander1 aSalinas, Norma1 aSinca, Felipe1 aTupayachi, Raul1 aQuispe Huaypar, Katherine1 aMontoya Pillco, Milenka1 aCcori Álvarez, Flor Delis1 aDíaz, Sandra1 aEnquist, Brian J.1 aMalhi, Y.q(Yadvinder),0 tnew phytologist.g2017 May, v. 214, no. 3 p.973-988dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.140683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012200171520168000293592002801973650001102001650001602012650001702028650002202045650002302067650001602090650001502106650001302121650001502134700002502149700002102174700002102195700002202216773012502238856008302363852000902446655001202455IND60771437820221120161752.0220325e20220125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077143782DNAL7 a10.3390/soilsystems60100142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLozbenev, Nikolai 10aComparative Assessment of Digital and Conventional Soil Mapping: A Case Study of the Southern Cis-Ural Region, Russia  aDigital mapping was applied for a key site located at the Southern Cis-Ural region near Ufa city (the Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia). The digital soil map (DSM) was created using the open-source GIS software packages and compared to a conventional (CSM) one. As input parameters, we used standard morphometric values of the topography and field descriptions of soils, including the authors’ data. The DSM was created at the same scale (1:25,000) as the CSM, and soils of different classes were grouped according to the principle of genetic homogeneity and regional agroecological value. Comparing DSM and CSM showed several significant differences in the position, areas, and boundaries of hydromorphic soils and chernozems. The DSM has advantages over CSM at estimating smaller soil areas (areals) and their boundaries, in particular, on elevated topography elements (hills and steep slopes) and upper links of the erosion network (small dry valleys, hollows, and gullies). On the other hand, fluvial soils are mapped rather poorly by the digital approach, and CSM is more appropriate for such soils’ areals. The highest discrepancy is confined to the areas of eroded soils and fluvisols (15% and 12% of total area, respectively) due to significant differences in DSM and CSM approaches for such soil groups. We suppose that the digital method is effective and suitable for the Cis-Ural region, despite 57% soil taxa (types) prediction accuracy and the complexity of the territory by its ruggedness, erosion, and suffusion processes. The implementation and further use of digital mapping methods increase the quality of work, reduce its cost and terms in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3aagroecology 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3agenetic similarity 3amorphometry 3aprediction 3asoil map 3atopography1 aKomissarov, Mikhail 1 aZhidkin, Andrey 1 aGusarov, Artyom 1 aFomicheva, Daria 0 tSoil systems.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 6, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27147x2571-87897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems60100143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005300138245011200191300001600303500002000319520212700339592002802466596005902494650001602553650001902569650002302588650001502611650001502626650003002641650002402671650001302695650001102708650001802719650002202737650001002759650001202769700001602781700001402797700002402811700001702835700001602852773012002868856007302988852000903061655001203070IND60769861920221121224357.0220311e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076986192DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.37702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7990-067110aIdentifying the seasonal characteristics of likely habitats for the Yangtze finless porpoise in Poyang Lake  ap. 523-536.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) has experienced significant decline and habitat degradation in recent decades. At present, nearly half of the total population inhabits Poyang Lake. The hydrological seasonality of the lake significantly influences porpoise habitat configuration, which brings problems for conservation in the delineation of reserve design and the management of human activities. A hydrodynamic model was used to distinguish the different hydrological conditions between the flood and dry seasons. The MaxEnt model was used to investigate the major environmental variables affecting porpoise distribution and delineate likely habitats of the porpoise under different hydrological conditions. The effectiveness of the present nature reserve was evaluated based on these results. Flow velocity and distance to fish spawning grounds were the primary variables influencing porpoise distribution during the dry season. Water depth, flow velocity and the distance to bank were the major variables during the flood season. The likely habitats were distributed discontinuously along the main channel during the dry season, with a total area of 112 km². During the flood season, the habitats extended into the central areas of the lake and tributaries with a total area of 628 km². At present, the nature reserve covers 4% and 18% of the likely core habitats during dry and flood seasons. An ideal nature reserve should be designed as an integrative network with reference to the seasonality of likely habitat distribution and major environmental variables. The habitats in conditions of extreme low water should be strictly protected in the dry season. Enhanced survey efforts, long‐term hydrodynamic modelling and species distribution modelling can greatly assist in understanding habitat configuration and changing processes for other freshwater cetaceans inhabiting river–lake systems. Future planning to improve protection should consider habitat characteristics under the shifting hydrological conditions caused by climate change or artificial flow alteration.  aPublisher supplied data  a42161014cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aNeophocaena 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3adry season 3afreshwater 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrologic models 3alakes 3asurveys1 aLai, Geying1 aLiu, Ying1 aDevlin, Adam Thomas1 aZhan, Shupin1 aWang, Sheng0 tAquatic conservation.g2022 Mar., v. 32, no. 3 p.523-536dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.37703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01558naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245014500159300001800304520048500322592002800807650001100835650001800846650002400864653002100888653002600909653001500935653001400950653002500964700001700989773014001006856007701146852000901223655001201232IND60522047620221120094734.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052204762DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1996-11132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrabbes, I.10aHerstellung von CuTa2O6 - von der Trirutil- zur Perowskit-Struktur / Preparation of CuTa2O6 - from the Trirutile to the Perovskite Structure  ap. 1605-1610.  aA new trirutile MTa₂O₆ was synthesized by thermal decomposition of a freeze dried Cu- Ta-oxalate precursor.

The changes in the physical and mechanical properties of the fiberglass (FG) and basalt plastic (BP) have been compared. The analysis shows that BF is a good alternative to fiberglass for elaboration of composite materials for various purposes. In the most aggressive alkaline environments, BP resistance is higher as compared with that of FG. If required, BF resistance to chemically active media could be increased by midifying its composition and applying protective layers and heat treatment of fibers. For extended use of BP as an effective structural material under various climatic conditions, including in the Arctic, long-term tests of 10 or more years are advisable and relevant, with control of changes in their mechanical parameters and an analysis of processes of climatic aging developing in BP.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasalt 3afiberglass 3aheat treatment 3aplastics 3aArctic region 0aMaterials science 0aBasalt fiber 0aBasalt plastic 0aChemical composition 0aAlkali resistance 0aStrength 0aYoung's modulus 0aMechanical indicators 0aClimatic tests1 aStartsev, O.V.1 aKychkin, A.K.0 tHeliyon.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.e03481-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e034813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014900171300001400320520101300334592002801347650001701375650001301392650001201405650002001417650002601437650002201463650001401485650002301499650001401522650002501536650001401561650000901575650001101584650001301595651001101608700002401619700002201643700002901665700002301694700002201717773007601739856008101815852000901896655001201905IND60173877520221121100426.0150603e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017387752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12284-009-9023-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomson, Michael J.10aGenetic Diversity of Isolated Populations of Indonesian Landraces of Rice (Oryza sativa L.)

To better understand the relationships between rice genetic diversity and associated geographic and cultural factors, we collected and characterized 183 rice landraces from 18 villages along the Bahau and Kayan rivers in the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. A genetic diversity analysis using 30 microsatellite markers detected a clear distinction between the indica and japonica varietal groups (Fₛₜ = 0.59), with 80% of the landraces identified as tropical japonica and 20% indica, which largely correlated with the field-level ecotypes: upland japonica and lowland indica. Indigenous knowledge from local farmers was gathered about the names, origins, and uses of the landraces, which provides a rich background to compare with the genetic relationships of these traditional varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aecotypes 3afarmers 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheirloom varieties 3ahighlands 3aindigenous knowledge 3alandraces 3arice 3arivers 3avillages 3aBorneo1 aPolato, Nicholas R.1 aPrasetiyono, Joko1 aTrijatmiko, Kurniawan R.1 aSilitonga, Tiur S.1 aMcCouch, Susan R.0 tRice.g2009 Mar., v. 2, no. 1 p.80-92dSpringer-Verlagx1939-84257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12284-009-9023-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012800164300001600292520160800308592002801916650002101944650003701965650002902002650002702031650002502058650001402083650002302097650001402120650001102134650001502145650001802160650001902178650000902197650002402206650001902230650001502249650002002264653001302284653002402297653001602321653001802337653005302355700001502408700001702423700001602440700001802456700001502474700001902489773011202508856008502620852000902705655001202714IND60584818520221120053655.0200913e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058481852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Kang10aCreation of active-passive integrated mechanisms on membrane surfaces for superior antifouling and antibacterial properties  ap. 621-631.  aAntifouling mechanisms are critical to membrane structure-property relationship. Currently, most researches focus on either passive fouling-resistant, fouling-release mechanisms or active antibacterial mechanism, the integration of active and passive antifouling mechanisms is much less explored. In this study, a novel modifier bearing three functional segments was designed and utilized for antifouling and antibacterial membrane surface construction. In detail, a block-like copolymer comprising low surface energy poly(hexafluorobutyl methacrylate) (PHFBM), hydrophilic poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PEGMA) and antibacterial poly[2-(methacryloyoxy)ethyl trimethylammonium chloride] (PMTAC) quaternary ammonium salt segments was prepared via free radical polymerization. The copolymer was employed for fabricating PVDF membranes by non-solvent induced phase separation method. The surface enrichment of copolymer was confirmed by XPS analysis. The PHFBM and PEGMA segments created passive fouling-release, fouling-resistant mechanisms whereas the PMTAC segments created active antibacterial mechanism on PVDF membrane surfaces. When utilized for oil/water emulsion filtration, the total flux decline ratio of PVDF/PHFBM-PEGMA-PMTAC membrane was as low as 6.3% and the flux recovery ratio reached nearly 100%. Besides, the antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus was higher than 99%. Hopefully, the strategy of active-passive integrated mechanisms in this study can be applicable to construct diverse antifouling surfaces for water treatment related applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifouling activities 3aartificial membranes 3achlorides 3acomposite polymers 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3afiltration 3afree radicals 3ahydrophilicity 3aoils 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3aseparation 3awater treatment 0aMembrane 0aSurface segregation 0aAntifouling 0aAntibacterial 0aActive-passive integrated antifouling mechanisms1 aSu, Yanlei1 aZhou, Linjie1 aHe, Mingrui1 aZhang, Runnan1 aLiu, Yanan1 aJiang, Zhongyi0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 548 p.621-631dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007200147245010900219506010400328506007600432520142600508592002801934506003701962650002301999650001302022650002002035650001102055650002202066650002302088650001202111651001202123653002002135653003002155653002002185653001302205653002302218700005702241700005502298773009402353856008202447852000902529655001202538IND60767956320221207142045.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076795632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÓ Súilleabháin, Gearóid,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9621-768X10aDataset on student experiences and perceptions of Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) in an Irish University  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper presents a dataset from a survey of student experiences and perceptions of Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Munster Technological University, a new higher education institute in the south-west of Ireland formed from the recent merger of two older institutes of technology. Data were collected throughout the month of May 2021 using the online survey tool Typeform with the survey itself being promoted with the student body primarily via email, social media and the university's Learning Management System. There were a total of 1703 responses (approx. 11% response rate which maps to less than a 2.5% margin of error at a 95% level of confidence). The survey was designed to elicit data with respect to student background, workspace and access; ERT tools and platforms used; challenges faced during the ERT period as well as benefits and preferred future teaching and learning modes. The dataset could be of interest to other researchers, policy makers and administrators interested in student experiences of and insight with respect to ERT and student views on the legacy of ERT. Data also provide opportunity to cross-tabulate key variables such as, e.g., internet connectivity and overall ERT experience. Survey questions are also included for replicability purposes. The data article also includes students’ responses received in CSV and formatted spreadsheet formats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aInternet 3adata collection 3ae-mail 3aissues and policy 3amanagement systems 3asurveys 3aIreland 0aOnline learning 0aEmergency Remote Teaching 0aRemote teaching 0aCOVID-19 0aStudent experience1 aFarrelly, Tom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1986-41541 aLacey, Sean1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3005-62940 tData in Brief.g2022 Apr., v. 41 p.107954-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005200140245013000192300001800322500002000340520109000360592002801450596008801478596005801566596007601624596005601700650002201756650001301778650001701791650001801808650001201826650003301838650001301871650001701884650001501901650001901916650001801935650001301953650001601966650002501982650001602007650000902023700001402032700001602046700005302062773015302115856007502268852000902343655001202352IND60789028220221120122453.0220818e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078902822DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.159122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5499-286410aAppropriate ultrasonic treatment improves the production of antioxidant peptides by modifying gelatin extracted from yak skin  ap. 5897-5908.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe antioxidant peptide was produced from hydrolysis with Bacillus subtilis proteases supplemented with different duration of ultrasound, and the hydrolysis and structural characteristics of yak skin gelatin (YSG) were characterised. Compared with the excessive ultrasonic treatment (10–40 min), the YSG produced by moderate ultrasonic treatment (5 min) had a higher degree of hydrolysis and the DPPH free radical scavenging ability, and ABTS free radical scavenging activity of the hydrolysate was increased. The results showed that ultrasound for 5 min significantly weakened hydrogen bonds and promoted the exposure of hydrophobic groups, resulting in the loosening of collagen structure. Appropriate ultrasonic treatment obviously changed the gelatin structure, as the changes in the decrease of glass transition temperature, the reduction of particle size and the destruction of the surface morphology. These findings showed that moderate ultrasound (5 min) could modify the structure of YSG and, therefore, has great potential in the production of antioxidant peptides.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020C‐18cthe ecological beef and mutton cascade processing and industrialization  a2021YFD1600200cthe National Key R&D Program of China  a2021CXZX‐381cthe project of outstanding postgraduate Innovation Star  a20YF3NA016cthe Provincial Key R&D Program of Gansu 3aBacillus subtilis 3acollagen 3afood science 3afree radicals 3agelatin 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aparticle size 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3ayaks1 aHan, Ling1 aWang, Yanru1 aYu, Qunli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2490-48000 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2022 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.5897-5908dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.159123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01250naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012000161300001400281520019000295592002800485650002300513650000900536650001300545650001100558650001100569700002000580700002100600700001800621700001900639700001700658700001800675773012400693856007400817852000900891655001200900IND60669525820221123042735.0190920e20150818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066952582DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra90076j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Chi-Ching10aCorrection: Surface-enhanced Raman scattering on a silver film-modified Au nanoparticle-decorated SiO₂ mask array  ap. 70501.  aCorrection for ‘Surface-enhanced Raman scattering on a silver film-modified Au nanoparticle-decorated SiO₂ mask array’ by Chi-Ching Chang et al., RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 66096–66103.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3agold 3ananogold 3asilica 3asilver1 aChen, Liang-Yih1 aYang, Guangxuan,1 aChen, Qing-Ye1 aLiang, Yu-Chih1 aLin, Shyr-Yi1 aLiu, Yu-Chuan0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 5, no. 86 p.70501-70501dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra90076j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01981naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010400163300001600267520073400283592002801017650001301045650001801058650002301076650001201099650001801111650001901129650002501148653001901173653001601192653001901208653002301227653001801250700001901268700002101287700002601308700002001334700001301354773010301367856008001470852000901550655001201559IND60621344320221117162606.0181116e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062134432DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X177214752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Apurv10aThermal properties of nano-graphite-embedded magnesium chloride hexahydrate phase change composites  ap. 651-660.  aPhase change materials can provide large heat storage density with low volume. But their low thermal conductivity limits their heat transfer capabilities. Since carbonaceous nanoparticles have a good thermal conductivity they can be applied as an additive to phase change materials to increase their heat transfer rate. In this study, nano-graphite is used as an additive and the influences of its various concentrations on the thermal conductivity and melting and freezing rate for the nanoparticle-enhanced phase change materials is experimentally investigated. Experimental results indicates a reduction of 22% in melting time and a reduction of 75% in solidification time of 0.5% nano-graphite-embedded phase change material.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreezing 3aheat transfer 3amagnesium chloride 3amelting 3ananoparticles 3asolidification 3athermal conductivity 0aNanocomposites 0aMgCl2·6H2O 0aenergy storage 0aheat transfer rate 0anano-graphite1 aBarman, Bidyut1 aKardam, Abhishek1 aNarayanan, S Shankara1 aVerma, Abhishek1 aJain, VK0 tEnergy & environment.g, v. 28, no. 7 p.651-660dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X177214753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245015300211506011700364506007600481520089000557592002801447506003701475650001001512650002001522650001701542650001301559650001401572650001001586653002501596653002401621653001601645653001601661653000801677653003501685653002901720653002301749700002501772700001901797700001701816700002101833700001601854700001601870700001901886700002401905700002401929700003001953700002601983700002602009773009402035856008202129852000902211655001202220IND60767956520221207142037.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076795652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZareba, Michal Rafal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8525-241210aNeuroimaging of chronotype, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness: Structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance brain imaging data from 136 young adults  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe dataset contains structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance brain imaging data from 136 young individuals (87 females; age range from 18 to 35 years old) along with questionnaire-assessed measurements of trait-like chronotype, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. The recruitment criteria excluded individuals with self-reported history of psychiatric or neurological conditions and current medication use. All the brain imaging sessions were performed between 5:20 PM and 8:55 PM in order to control the effect of time of day on acquired images. The data is mostly useful to scientists interested in circadian rhythmicity. It can be deployed in large-scale multicenter meta-analyzes investigating the structural brain correlates of chronotypes in humans.

This novel study employs a systems lens to examine both technical and non-technical barriers to renewables, with a focus on interactions that are empirically influential on PV uptake. Using local solar expert stakeholder input into a participatory systems approach, this study provides a structural analysis of factors influencing household solar adoption. The approach is applied and assessed for household solar PV systems in Santiago, Chile, to gain insight into the interconnected factors driving technology adoption. Barriers and motivations to adoption identified in a recent Delphi study for Santiago were used to create a list of factors thought by local experts to impact future adoption. These factors and their pairwise interactions were modeled using the impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) technique and analyzed within a four-hour workshop with eight solar experts in Santiago. Results from the analysis regarding factor influence, dependence and evolutionary trajectories were presented to experts and discussed at length. Salient discussion points focused on the need for attractive financial incentives, knowledge diffusion among potential consumers, and a maturing market that incites a cultural shift towards customers who desire energy independence. Intuitive and insightful programmatic areas were illuminated for policy and action in Santiago based on a systems-focused interpretation of factors in the form of short- and long-term strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumers (people) 3aeconomic factors 3aeconomic incentives 3aenergy 3aexperts 3ainnovation adoption 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amotivation 3apolitics 3asolar collectors 3astakeholders 3asystems analysis 3aChile1 aKaminsky, Jessica1 aGottschamer, Lawrence0 tSustainability.g2018 Apr. 19, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100412573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00984naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245007900166300001400245520015400259592002800413650002400441700003200465700002600497773012400523856007400647852000900721655001200730IND60669526020221123041957.0190920e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066952602DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra90078f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadmavathy, Nagarajan10aCorrection: Solution based rapid synthesis of AgCuO₂ at room temperature  ap. 72069.  aCorrection for ‘Solution based rapid synthesis of AgCuO₂ at room temperature’ by Nagarajan Padmavathy et al., RSC Adv., 2014, 4, 62746–62750.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature1 aVijayaraghavan, Rajagopalan1 aKulkarni, Giridhar U.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 25, v. 5, no. 88 p.72069-72069dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra90078f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010600162300001600268520049700284592002800781650001900809650001200828650001200840650001400852650002000866650001200886650002300898650002100921650001100942650001000953650000900963700001600972700002100988700001701009700002401026700002201050773011501072856008201187852000901269655001201278IND4472770220221119164606.0190314e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447277022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-011-1180-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaku, Tomomi10aImprovement of fermentable sugar yields of mangium through transgenic overexpression of xyloglucanase  ap. 545-548.  aRecalcitrance to saccharifi cation is a major limiting factor of the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol.

This high energy dependence could involve important effects on the level and stability of their electricity prices as a half the gross electricity generated in both countries came from power stations using imported combustible fuels (such as natural gas, coal and oil). In general, changes in the prices of these fossil fuels can directly affect household electricity prices, since generation costs are likely to be transmitted through to the wholesale electricity market. Moreover, in the framework of the European Union Emission Trading System, electricity production technologies tend to incorporate their costs of carbon dioxide emission allowances in sale offers with the consequent increase of the electricity prices. The objective of this paper is to analyze the influence of fossil fuel costs and prices of carbon dioxide emission allowances in the EU on the Spanish and Portuguese electricity prices. With this aim, a maximum entropy econometric approach is used. The obtained results indicate that not only the price of imported gas are very important in explaining Spanish and Portuguese electricity prices but also the price of carbon dioxide emission allowances in the EU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aeconometrics 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aelectricity generation 3aimports 3amarkets 3anatural gas 3aoils 3apower plants 3aprices 3aPortugal 3aSpain 0aElectricity market 0aEuropean Union Emission Trading System 0aSpain 0aPortugal 0aenergy dependence1 aGarcía-Álvarez, María T0 tEnergy & environment.g, v. 28, no. 7 p.687-705dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X177240473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013100169500002200300520111200322592002801434650003101462650001601493650001801509650001301527650002001540650001001560650000901570650001401579650002301593650001201616650001301628650001501641650002201656653000801678653000901686653000701695653001101702653000801713653000801721653000901729653001001738653000801748653000701756653000901763653000901772653000901781653000701790653000701797653000901804653002401813653001901837653002301856653003301879700001701912700001801929700002001947700002001967700005901987773005002046856008202096852000902178655001202187IND60584819020221120024126.0171028s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058481902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Aishwarya10aWild-type catalase peroxidase vs G279D mutant type: Molecular basis of Isoniazid drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis  aPre-press version  aMycobacterium tuberculosis katG gene is responsible for production of an enzyme catalase peroxidase that peroxidises and activates the prodrug Isoniazid (INH), a first-line antitubercular agent. INH interacts with catalase peroxidase enzyme within its heme pocket and gets converted to an active form. Mutations occurring in katG gene are often linked to reduced conversion rates for INH. This study is focussed on one such mutation occurring at residue 279, where glycine often mutates to aspartic acid (G279D). In the present study, several structural analyses were performed to study the effect of this mutation on functionality of KatG protein. On comparison, mutant protein exhibited a lower docking score, smaller binding cavity and reduced affinity towards INH. Molecular dynamics analysis revealed the mutant to be more rigid and less compact than the native protein. Essential dynamics analysis determined correlated motions of residues within the protein structure. G279D mutant was found to have many residues that showed related motions and an undesirable effect on the functionality of protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aantibiotics 3aaspartic acid 3acatalase 3adrug resistance 3agenes 3aheme 3aisoniazid 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3amutation 3aperoxidase 3aprotein structure 0aINH 0aKatG 0aTB 0aMDR-TB 0aNAD 0aACP 0aH2O2 0aSPC/E 0aPCA 0aXP 0aRMSD 0aRMSF 0aSASA 0aRg 0aMD 0akatG 0aCatalase peroxidase 0aINH resistance 0aMolecular dynamics 0aPrincipal component analysis1 aSingh, Aditi1 aGrover, Sonam1 aPandey, Bharati1 aKumari, Anchala1 aGrover, Abhinav1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3296-78600 tGene.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01434naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007100162300002000233520051800253592002800771650001300799650002200812650001300834650001100847700002300858700002200881700002200903773012400925856007401049852000901123655001201132IND60669198120221120104853.0190920e20150814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066919812DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra14072b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkowronek, Paweł10aChirality transfer through sulfur or selenium to chiral propellers  ap. 69441-69444.  aThe mechanism of chirality transfer from a chiral alkyl substituent to a trityl moiety through sulfur or selenium atoms is analysed and discussed on the basis of ECD measurements, DFT structure and ECD spectra calculations.

However, land use change, particularly from coastal reclamation, has caused severe population declines of waterirds. Although 19 sites, covering 1.51 million hectares, were recognized as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) prior to 2009, bird surveys since 2009 have indicated additional sites may be important, and should be included in the protection area network. In this study, we compile waterbird distribution data (post-2009) from multiple sources, including citizen science databases, published and gray literatures. Using these data while also adopting internationally recognized criteria, we delineate new sites of significance to waterbird conservation. For these newly identified sites, using remote-sensed data, we develop a habitat suitability index (HSI) to identify any change in the same site between 2000 and 2015. The study results show that of 26 sites meeting criteria for significance to waterbird conservation in Chinese coastal wetlands of the Yellow and Bohai Seas, 9 sites are included within boundaries of existing IBAs, and 17 are new identified sites; Eight threatened waterbird species are recorded in 13 of the newly identified sites; and seven threatened species or species that occurred in internationally significant numbers have not been previously documented in existing IBAs; Decreases in habitat suitability are apparent at 16 of 17 newly identified sites between 2000 and 2015, as are declines in the extent of natural habitat. To curtail future population declines of waterbirds in coastal wetlands of the Yellow and Bohai Seas, prioritized conservation of these newly identified sites is urgently required.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitizen science 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3amigratory behavior 3aremote sensing 3athreatened species 3awater birds 3aChina 0aWaterbirds 0aHabitat suitability index (HSI) 0aCoastal wetland conservation 0aYellow and Bohai Seas1 aXia, Shaoxia1 aJackson, Micha Victoria1 aZhao, Ning1 aLiu, Yu1 aTeng, Jiakun1 aMeng, Zhen1 aYu, Xiubo1 aShi, Jianbin0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2020 June, v. 22 p.e01031-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e010313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006800167300001600235500001900251520091900270592002801189650002001217650002401237650001301261650001401274650001401288650002001302650001301322653003401335653001001369700001601379700002001395700001901415700001701434700001801451700001901469700001801488773014601506856008301652852000901735655001201744IND60649411820221118032245.0190725e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064941182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Yong Won10aAbrogation of B-RafV600E induced senescence by FoxM1 expression  ap. 866-871.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aB-RafV600E oncogene mutation occurs in various cancers and is associated with tumor initiation. However, genetic modification of B-RafV600E in cells induces MAPK activation and results in oncogene-induced senescence. Overcoming the oncogene-induced senescence by B-RafV600E requires activation of another oncogene pathway, such as AKT signaling. In the present study, we explored the factors involved in overcoming the senescence program in cells activated by B-RafV600E and AKT signaling. B-RafV600E activation caused a feedback inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and resulted in downregulation of FoxM1, one of the AKT downstream components. AKT activation by PTEN downregulation induced FoxM1 expression, and co-expression of B-RafV600E and FoxM1 overcame the cellular senescence. These observations suggested that FoxM1 is critical downstream gene of AKT and functions to overcome B-RafV600E-induced senescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell senescence 3agenetic engineering 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3aphosphorylation 3aresearch 0aB-RafV600E induced senescence 0aFoxM11 aNam, Ga Eun1 aKim, Young-Hwa,1 aYoon, Jung Eun1 aPark, Ji Hee1 aKim, Jang Hee1 aKang, Seok Yun1 aPark, Tae Jun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 516, no. 3 p.866-871dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012200167300001600289520103800305592002801343650001701371650003001388650001101418650001301429650002401442650001001466650000901476650001801485650002201503650000901525650001001534650001001544650001101554650002201565650000901587700001801596700002401614700002301638700001801661700002301679700001901702700002201721700001801743700002401761773007801785856008101863852000901944655001201953IND60173878320221120065434.0150603e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017387832DNAL7 a10.1007/s12284-009-9031-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasuda, Hiroshi10aOverexpression of the Barley Nicotianamine Synthase Gene HvNAS1 Increases Iron and Zinc Concentrations in Rice Grains  ap. 155-166.  aIn humans, iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) deficiencies result in major worldwide health problems. Transgenic technologies to produce Fe- and Zn-biofortified rice varieties offer a promising potential solution. Nicotianamine, the precursor of phytosiderophores, chelates Fe²⁺and Zn²⁺and plays an important role in transporting these metals to both vegetative and reproductive organs within the plant. Our objective was to increase Fe and Zn contents in rice grains by overexpressing the barley nicotianamine synthase gene HvNAS1. HvNAS1-overexpressing transgenic rice showed increased HvNAS1 expression and subsequent increases in endogenous nicotianamine and phytosiderophore content in shoots, roots, and seeds. Fe and Zn concentrations in polished T₁seeds from transgenic plants increased more than three and twofold, respectively; Fe and Zn concentrations also increased in both polished and brown T₂seeds. These results suggest that the overproduction of nicotianamine enhances the translocation of Fe and Zn into rice grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aalkyl (aryl) transferases 3abarley 3achelates 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3airon 3anicotianamine 3aphytosiderophores 3arice 3aroots 3aseeds 3ashoots 3atransgenic plants 3azinc1 aUsuda, Kanako1 aKobayashi, Takanori1 aIshimaru, Yasuhiro1 aKakei, Yusuke1 aTakahashi, Michiko1 aHiguchi, Kyoko1 aNakanishi, Hiromi1 aMori, Satoshi1 aNishizawa, Naoko K.0 tRice.g2009 Dec., v. 2, no. 4 p.155-166dSpringer-Verlagx1939-84257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12284-009-9031-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245010000178300001800278500000900296500001500305520167100320592002801991650001302019650001902032650001702051650000902068650002002077650001402097650002802111650002002139650002102159650002502180651001202205653001402217653001002231700001702241700001902258773012302277852000902400856009802409655001202507IND2196537020221120132043.0191122e199807  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219653702DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800040029x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOikeh, S.

Consequently, some farmers have not adopted improved high yielding varieties because they lacked desired quality characteristics for processing and other end uses. We conducted this study to determine the effects of N application on some maize (Zea mays L.) grain quality parameters. In 1993 and 1994, five maize cultivars under four N levels (0, 30, 60, and 120 kg ha⁻¹) were evaluated at Zaria (11° 11′ N), northern Nigeria, on a Plinthustalf (fine-loamy isohyperthermic). Increasing N levels increased grain yield, kernel weight, and grain protein quadratically for all the cultivars. The hybrid 8644-27 had the highest grain yield and kernel weight of 5.3 Mg ha⁻¹ and 26.62 mg kernel⁻¹, respectively. Average grain protein yield per unit area was not significantly different among cultivars in both years. At 30 to 60 kg N ha⁻¹, the cultivars 8644-27 and TZPB-SR had a greater percentage of floaters, than the other cultivars in both years, reflecting a greater proportion of floury endosperm, indicating that they would be best for traditional dry milling, where the whole grain is ground to produce flour. Also, at 30 to 60 kg N ha⁻¹, SPL and TZB-SR had a relatively low percentage of floaters and high test weights of over 811 kg m⁻³ in 1993 and 778 kg m⁻³ in 1994, and should give high yields of grits when processed. Thus, both cultivars have high value for industrial dry milling. Results showed that the choice of cultivar and N level may affect grain quality and they should be considered in producing maize for dry milling purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aplant breeding 3acrop quality 3acorn 3amilling quality 3aendosperm 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3aprotein content 3aapplication rate 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aNigeria 0acultivars 0aseeds1 aKling, J.

The treatment of wool fiber with potassium permanganate in salt solution was assessed using 3D-SEM and the progressive reduction in the scale height and cuticle smoothing demonstrated. While this effect was relatively obvious and uniform, the effect of a proteolytic enzymatic treatment on the fiber surface was less uniform.

We took advantage of a density cline at the periphery of distribution range of white-tailed deer to study trophic interactions between this herbivore and understory vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that the availability of summer forage in woodlands for this selective browser determines adult body size through density-dependent forage consumption during growth. We predicted 1) a change of forest composition resulting from persistent selective browsing; and 2) a negative relationship between the size of fully grown deer and the intensity of forage competition in summer. We estimated deer population density, carcass mass at maturity, and standing biomass of vegetation in 13 zones throughout the range of the deer in Québec, which covers 128,000 km². Asymptotic carcass mass was related to body length, and to a lesser extent to percent body fat, and reflected size of fully grown deer. Plant biomass varied with respect to deer density, but the direction and intensity of the relationship depended on deer preference for various plant groups. Occurrence of preferred taxa decreased with increasing deer density. Forage competition in summer was related negatively to deer size, which declined sharply when there was < 10,000 kg of forage per deer. In the trade-off between growth and body reserves, the size of mature deer is likely adjusted to forage intake in order to balance absolute nutrient needs, a response allowing increased foraging efficiency of depleted resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aadults 3abody fat 3abody length 3adeer 3afeed intake 3aforage 3aforests 3aherbivores 3aphytomass 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3asummer 3aunderstory 3aQuebec 0acondition 0agrowth 0aoverabundance 0aQuébec 0awhite-tailed deer. 0aBanfield 0a1977 0aMarie-Victorin 0a1995.1 aCrête, Michel,1 aOuellet, Jean-Pierre1 aDaigle, Claude1 aLesage, Louis0 tÉcoscience.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 11, no. 3 p.286-295dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2004.116828353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011300171300001600284520139700300592002801697650001301725650001501738650001101753650002001764650003901784650001101823650001601834650001601850650001401866650002501880650001601905653003601921653002201957653003201979653002502011700002202036700002202058700002102080700002002101773011502121856008502236852000902321655001202330IND60524327920221116221723.0170202e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052432792DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2015.11114502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolmonen, Pekka14aThe ADV/ASV AATSR aerosol retrieval algorithm: current status and presentation of a full-mission AOD dataset  ap. 545-561.  aAn advanced along-track scanning radiometer (AATSR) global multi-year aerosol retrieval algorithm is described. Over land, the AATSR dual-view (ADV) algorithm utilizes the measured top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in both the nadir and forward views to decouple the contributions of the atmosphere and the surface to retrieve aerosol properties. Over ocean, the AATSR single-view (ASV) algorithm minimizes the discrepancy between the measured and modelled TOA reflectances in one of the views to retrieve the aerosol information using an ocean reflectance model. Necessary steps to process global, multi-year aerosol information are presented. These include cloud screening, the averaging of measured reflectance, and post-processing. Limitations of the algorithms are also discussed. The main product of the aerosol retrieval is the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at visible/near-infrared wavelengths. The retrieved AOD is validated using data from the surface-based AERONET and maritime aerosol network (MAN) sun photometer networks as references. The validation shows good agreement with the reference (r = 0.85, RMSE = 0.09 over land; r = 0.83, RMSE = 0.09 at coasts and r = 0.96, RMSE = 0.06 over open ocean). The results of the aerosol retrievals are presented for the full AATSR mission years 2002–2012 with seasonally averaged time series for selected regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3acoasts 3adata collection 3agovernmental programs and projects 3amodels 3aphotometers 3areflectance 3ascreening 3atime series analysis 3awavelengths 0aVisible/infrared remote sensing 0aearth observation 0aglobal environmental change 0aatmospheric aerosols1 aSogacheva, Larisa1 aVirtanen, Timo H.1 ade Leeuw, Gerrit1 aKulmala, Markku0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2016 June 2, v. 9, no. 6 p.545-561dTaylor & Francisx1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2015.11114503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012900163520136400292592002801656650002801684650001001712650002001722650001201742650001501754650001301769650001301782650001701795650001401812650001501826653002701841653001701868700001601885700001701901700001701918700001701935773011001952856008502062852000902147655001202156IND60744528420221119212710.0210926e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074452842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1177492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chao10aMolecular mechanisms underlying the calcium-mediated uptake of hematite nanoparticles by the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila  aIn aquatic ecosystems, the calcium (Ca) concentration varies greatly. It is well known that Ca affects the aggregation of nanoparticles (NPs) and thus their bioaccumulation. Nevertheless, Ca also plays critical roles in various biological processes, whose effects on NP accumulation in aquatic organisms remain unclear. In this study, the effects of Ca on the uptake of polyacrylate-coated hematite NPs (HemNPs) by the aquatic ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila were investigated. At all of the tested Ca concentrations, HemNPs were well dispersed in the experimental medium, excluding the possibility of Ca to influence HemNP bioaccumulation by aggregating the NPs. Instead, Ca was shown to induce the clathrin-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis of HemNPs. Manipulation of the Ca speciation in the experimental medium as well as the influx and intracellular availability of Ca in T. thermophila indicated that HemNP uptake was regulated by the intracellular Ca level. The results of the proteomics analyses further showed that the binding of intracellular Ca to calmodulin altered the activity of proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (calcineurin and dynamin) and phagocytosis (actin). Overall, the biologically inductive effects of Ca on NP accumulation in aquatic organisms should be considered when evaluating the environmental risks of NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetrahymena thermophila 3aactin 3abioaccumulation 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3adynamins 3ahematite 3aphagocytosis 3apollution 3aproteomics 0aAquatic microorganisms 0aNanoparticle1 aGuo, Wen-Bo1 aLiu, Yue-Yue1 aYang, Liuyan1 aMiao, Ai-Jun0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 288 p.117749-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1177493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001300144245008800157300001600245520103300261592002801294650000901322650001801331650001901349653000901368653002401377653002701401653001401428653001401442700001401456700001201470700001301482773012001495852000901615856008101624655001201705IND4401122820221121233106.0181020e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440112282DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175070835552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, H.10aMeasurement Precision and Evaluation of the Diameter Profiles of Single Wool Fibers  ap. 981-991.  aA recent model of the Single Fiber Analyzer 3001 (SIFAN3001) was firstly employed to obtain the single wool fiber diameter profiles (SfFDPs) at multiple orientations. The results showed that using SIFAN3001 to measure fiber diameter at four orientations for 50 single fibers randomly sub-sampled from each mid-side sample can produce average fiber diameter profiles (AS fFDPs) of fibers within staples. Within the testing regime used, the precision estimates for the total samples were ±1.3 µm for the mean fiber diameter of staples and 1.4 µm for the average fiber diameter of the AS fFDPs at each scanned step in the diameter profile. The mean diameter ratio (ellipticity) obtained from the four orientations was 1.08±0.01, confirming that the Merino wool fibers under review were elliptical rather than circular. The elliptical morphology of wool fibers and the precision of the fiber diameter measurement at each point along a fiber will be considered in the development of a mechanical model of Staple Strength testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3awool 3awoolen fabric 3atextile fibers 0awool 0aellipticity of wool 0afiber diameter profile 0aprecision 0aSIFAN30011 aMahar, T.1 aLiu, X.1 aWang, X.0 tTextile research journal.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.981-991dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175070835553Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02509naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245007100208300002200279506007600301520092300377592002801300506003701328650002201365650002201387650002201409650001801431650001201449650001401461650002001475653001301495653001901508653001401527653002501541653002401566653002201590653002001612653001801632653002501650653002101675700002401696700002401720700002201744700002401766700001801790773008001808856008201888852000901970655001201979IND60561778320221207051209.0170124e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056177832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.0562doi7 aPMC51475002pmcid7 a278892392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucas, María,10aStructural Mechanism for Cargo Recognition by the Retromer Complex  ap. 1623-1635.e14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRetromer is a multi-protein complex that recycles transmembrane cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane. Defects in retromer impair various cellular processes and underlie some forms of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Although retromer was discovered over 15 years ago, the mechanisms for cargo recognition and recruitment to endosomes have remained elusive. Here, we present an X-ray crystallographic analysis of a four-component complex comprising the VPS26 and VPS35 subunits of retromer, the sorting nexin SNX3, and a recycling signal from the divalent cation transporter DMT1-II. This analysis identifies a binding site for canonical recycling signals at the interface between VPS26 and SNX3. In addition, the structure highlights a network of cooperative interactions among the VPS subunits, SNX3, and cargo that couple signal-recognition to membrane recruitment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aParkinson disease 3aX-ray diffraction 3abinding sites 3acations 3aendosomes 3aplasma membrane 0aretromer 0asorting nexins 0aendosomes 0aretrograde transport 0aendocytic recycling 0acargo recognition 0asorting signals 0aprotein coats 0amembrane recruitment 0amembrane tubules1 aGershlick, David C.1 aVidaurrazaga, Ander1 aRojas, Adriana L.1 aBonifacino, Juan S.1 aHierro, Aitor0 tCell.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 167 p.1623-1635.e14dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012700176300001600303500001900319520145700338592002801795650002201823650002101845650002501866650001001891650002301901650001301924650001501937650001201952650001301964650002101977650001501998650001102013650002202024650001002046650001702056651002102073653001602094653001802110653001402128653001402142653001802156653001202174653000902186653002002195653001502215700002102230773010402251856008602355852000902441655001202450IND60726517620210618000000.0210205e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072651762DNAL7 a10.1080/11956860.2004.116828412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeldman, Richard E.10aBird composition of oak ecosystem fragments in an urbanized setting: The influence of adjacent coniferous forest fragments  ap. 338-346.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBird composition of habitat fragments in urban areas is expected to be associated with adjacent landscape and with smaller-scale factors within fragments. This study investigated the bird assemblage of coastal oak (Quercus garryana) fragments in British Columbia, Canada adjacent to either coniferous forest or urban development. Effect of habitat type (oak, conifer, urban) and local habitat differences (tree volume, shrub cover, grass cover) on the composition of the bird assemblage was also determined. During the 2000 breeding season, birds were surveyed in a 50-m fixed-radius point count at stations along two transects within each habitat type. Bird assemblages were most different between forest and urban habitat. The bird composition of oak fragments fell in between. Within oak, most birds fell into one of three groupings: 1) associated with conifer trees within oak fragments adjacent to coniferous forest, 2) associated with oak, an invasive alien shrub (Cytisus scoparius), and grass, within oak fragments adjacent to coniferous forest, and 3) associated with snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) in oak fragments adjacent to urbanization. The results indicate that the type of adjacent habitat and tree composition in oak fragments are significant factors associated with oak bird assemblages. Future shifts in species composition are possible as the region becomes more urbanized and coniferous trees encroach into remaining oak habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCytisus scoparius 3aQuercus garryana 3aSymphoricarpos albus 3abirds 3aconiferous forests 3aconifers 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aurbanization 3aBritish Columbia 0aDouglas-fir 0afragmentation 0aGarry oak 0alandscape 0aurbanization. 0aGodfrey 0a1986 0aDouglas et al., 0a1998-2001.1 aKrannitz, Pam G.0 tÉcoscience.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 11, no. 3 p.338-346dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2004.116828413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001600144245008600160300001600246520173300262592002801995650001902023650001802042650002102060653000902081653001402090653002002104653002902124653001202153700001802165700001702183700001202200773012002212852000902332856008102341655001202422IND4401122420221121233046.0181020e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440112242DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175070835182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiya Zhou, 10aCharacterization of Liquid Moisture Transport Performance of Wool Knitted Fabrics  ap. 951-956.  aWool fabric is one of the fabrics normally suitable for autumn—winter garments. With the popularization of air conditioning, however, it is much hotter outdoors than indoors with a large temperature gradient in summer, under which circumstances the wearer finds it easier to sweat out of doors, and feels cold and clammy when entering a room kept at a lower temperature by air conditioning. With the advances in knitting and finishing technology, fine wool knitted fabrics are finding more applications as summer garments. Thus, the design and study of comfortable summer wool knitted fabric is increasing. Wool fiber has a higher vapor moisture absorbency than other natural fibers, such as cotton, linen, and silk, and general synthetic fibers. It also has higher heat releasing and heat absorption properties accompanying moisture absorption and desorption respectively, which strengthens the buffering effect of the clothing between the human body and the surrounding environment. In the present study, different kinds of fabric knitted by wool yarn in a plain structure (W1, W2), and wool yarn matched with polyester yarns (WP1, WP2) or cotton yarns (WC1, WC2) as plating yarn are developed so as to have different liquid water transport properties. Their liquid moisture transport properties are characterized by using the Moisture Management Tester. By fabric design and post-finishing, our aim to create different liquid water transfer and distribution properties in the fabrics was achieved. W2 is poor at spreading liquid in the top and bottom surfaces of the fabric, showing poor liquid transfer properties, and WC1 is the best at spreading liquid in the bottom surface, showing good moisture management properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3atextile fibers 3awoolen fabric 3anonwoven fabrics 0awool 0apolyester 0aknitted fabrics 0aliquid moisture transfer 0acomfort1 aXunwei Feng, 1 aYanfeng Du, 1 aYi, Li,0 tTextile research journal.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.951-956dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175070835183Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04176naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245016000208520264300368592002803011650001903039650001503058650001703073650002403090650002003114650002203134650001803156650002503174650001403199650001003213650001503223650001003238650002403248650001903272651000903291653000903300653000803309653001303317653003003330653002403360700002003384700002503404700006303429773011103492856008203603852000903685655001203694IND60682216520221122010455.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068221652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoorazimy, Maryam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6341-388710aIntegrating airborne laser scanning data, space-borne radar data and digital aerial imagery to estimate aboveground carbon stock in Hyrcanian forests, Iran  aA framework for estimating aboveground forest carbon stock (AFCS) is required for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in Developing Countries. Recently, methods for estimating the spatial distribution of AFCS using remotely sensed datasets and multiple prediction techniques have been found to be useful, particularly given the prohibitive costs of acquiring the necessary sample sizes for sufficiently precise pure field-based estimation of this variable. The objective of the study was to assess and compare the capabilities of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, L-band radar data and UltraCam images in combination with four commonly used prediction techniques for estimating mean AFCS per unit area: multiple linear regression (MLR) and the nonparametric k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF) algorithms. Our study area was a part of Hyrcanian deciduous forests in two managed and unmanaged stands at Shast Kalateh forest. We used a systematic sample consisting of 308 circular field plots of 0.1 ha located at the intersections of a 150 × 200 m grid with a random starting point and remote sensing-derived metrics as auxiliary data. We used 67% of the sample plots for training purposes and the remaining 33% for validation. Also, we used the model-assisted estimators to statistically rigorously estimate mean AFCS per unit area and its standard error (SE).Among the remotely sensed datasets, considered singly, the ALS data with R²⁎ = 0.34, rRMSE = 47.42% and relative efficiency (RE) = 1.51 produced the greatest accuracy and precision for AFCS estimation. RE can be interpreted as the factor by which the sample size for the pure field-based estimator would have to be increased to obtain the same precision as for the model-assisted estimator using auxiliary data. Among the remotely sensed datasets considered in combination, the ALS and PALSAR dataset with R²⁎ = 0.41, rRMSE = 44.80% and RE = 1.70 produced the greatest prediction accuracy and precision and increased the proportion of variability explained relative to ALS and PALSAR separately by 7% and 36%, respectively. Contrary to our expectation, the combination of PALSAR and UltraCam data decreased the precision of AFCS estimates. All the remotely sensed datasets, singly and in combination, with the most accurate prediction techniques for each combination produced estimates of AFCS that were within the 95% confidence interval for the field-based estimate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3aalgorithms 3acarbon sinks 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3adeciduous forests 3adeforestation 3adeveloping countries 3aemissions 3alidar 3aprediction 3aradar 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aIran 0aREDD 0aALS 0aUltraCam 0aModel-assisted estimators 0aRelative efficiency1 aShataee, Shaban1 aMcRoberts, Ronald E.1 aMohammadi, Jahangir1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4836-30730 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Apr., v. 240 p.111669-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245006600168300001800234520086800252592002801120650002101148650002701169650002201196650003001218650001001248650000901258650001801267650002201285650002301307650001801330700001701348700002601365700002501391700002501416700002101441773013401462856007401596852000901670655001201679IND60704284820221116161258.0200722e20200721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070428482DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc03334k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatus, María Francisca12aA topological isomer of the Au₂₅(SR)₁₈⁻ nanocluster  ap. 8087-8090.  aEnergetically low-lying structural isomers of the much-studied thiolate-protected gold cluster Au₂₅(SR)₁₈⁻ are discovered from extensive (80 ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive molecular force field ReaxFF and confirmed by density functional theory (DFT). A particularly interesting isomer is found, which is topologically connected to the known crystal structure by a low-barrier collective rotation of the icosahedral Au₁₃ core. The isomerization takes place without breaking of any Au–S bonds. The predicted isomer is essentially iso-energetic with the known Au₂₅(SR)₁₈⁻ structure, but has a distinctly different optical spectrum. It has a significantly larger collision cross-section as compared to that of the known structure, which suggests it could be detectable in gas phase ion-mobility mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3aconstitutional isomers 3acrystal structure 3adensity functional theory 3agases 3agold 3aisomerization 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoparticles1 aMalola, Sami1 aKinder Bonilla, Emily1 aBarngrover, Brian M.1 aAikens, Christine M.1 aHäkkinen, Hannu0 tChemical communications.g2020 July 21, v. 56, no. 58 p.8087-8090dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cc03334k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245007000165300002000235520175200255592002802007650001502035650001502050650001902065650002402084650002502108650001502133650001902148650001502167650002102182650001102203650001302214650001902227650000702246650001102253700001802264700005702282700005402339700005702393700005502450700005402505773012202559856008702681852000902768655001202777IND60746846720221120123241.0210806e20210709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074684672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c009602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Li10aRegeneration of Na₂Q in an Electrochemical CO₂ Capture System  ap. 12260-12269.  aThe CO₂ capture system based on the electrochemical desorption at room temperature and atmospheric pressure may solve the high regeneration energy consumption problem of the amine-based postcombustion CO₂ capture technology. In our former work, 0.7 M Na₂Q was used to absorb CO₂, and the pH mediator, tiron (QH₂), was used to adjust the pH of the solution during the redox process to desorb CO₂ and regenerate the absorbent. However, the absorbent does not completely regenerate due to the poor reduction of Q. In this work, the regeneration of 0.05–0.7 M Na₂Q and the modification of graphite felt (GF) electrodes were further investigated. The results show that the reproducibility and the cyclicality of the Na₂Q solution with a lower concentration (0.1 M) are better than those of 0.7 M Na₂Q under the same conditions. The GF electrodes after acid treatment, heat treatment, phosphorus-doped, or MnO₂-modified improve their electrochemical activities under acidic and weakly alkaline conditions. Phosphorus-doped or MnO₂-modified GF electrodes also significantly improve the redox reaction under strongly alkaline conditions. The process of CO₂ capture combining the Na₂Q regeneration with the CO₂ absorption is proposed to improve the reducibility of Q. In addition, a possible electrochemical reaction process of the Na₂Q system is proposed. QH₂ is oxidized to produce Q, in which a 1,4-Michael reaction to produce sodium 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonate occurs. The byproduct tiron-o-quinone is also produced, which could further polymerize to form oligomers. During the reduction of high-concentration Na₂Q, the oligomers precipitate out of the solution, resulting in inhibition of the reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3aacid treatment 3aambient temperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3abyproducts 3acarbon dioxide 3adesorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aheat treatment 3apH 3asodium1 aHou, Liangkun1 aLiu, Yingying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2106-64181 aWu, Kejing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0894-399X1 aZhu, Yingming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4926-88471 aLu, Houfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3537-24801 aLiang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2942-46860 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 July 09, v. 35, no. 15 p.12260-12269dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c009603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03814naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245017300168300001600341520197400357592002802331650001302359650000802372650001302380650002602393650001302419650001502432650001102447650001102458650003102469650002502500650001302525650001102538650001802549650002602567650001902593650001602612651001002628651002402638653001502662653001202677653001002689653001702699700001602716700001502732700005402747700002102801700001902822700001402841700001102855700001402866700001602880700005402896700002102950700001802971773010402989856008603093852000903179655001203188IND60649592320221118235144.0190705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064959232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.04.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, SK,10aExperimental investigation of variations in morphology, composition and mixing-state of boundary layer aerosol: A balloon based study over urban environment (New Delhi)  ap. 243-252.  aThe morphology, composition, and complex mixing states of aerosol are extremely important physico-chemical properties which are the major inputs to the optical/radiative models. Though, ground based observations of the said properties are abundant but the vertical profiles of the same are very much limited throughout the globe. The information on the vertical heterogeneity of the aforementioned properties over a polluted environment like Delhi will be very helpful to develop a better understanding of the thermodynamics of the lower atmosphere.In present study, we carried out a tethered balloon based field campaign in National Physical Laboratory (28° 38′ 10″ N, 77° 10′ 17″ E) from 21 to 27 February 2014 to explore the vertical distribution of the said properties. Based on the microscopic observations, the bubbly shaped sulfate particles number percentage is less (5%) on the ground, abundant (49%) on altitude <350 m and nearly absent on altitude >350 m. At 500 m altitude, particles were majorly of spiked shape with elongated dimension ∼ 3–4 μm. The number percentage of the aged fractals has been found to increase by 4% in the 100–350 m range against the ground observations. Based on the bulk composition of non-carbonaceous species, at 200 m altitude, we observed significant amount (74%) of the oxides of sulfur compared to that of ground observations (30%) that could be due to temperature inversion and air parcel movement from IGP (Indo Gangetic Plain). Various core-shell type particle configurations have been observed at different altitudes. At 200 m altitude, particles were majorly aged with anionic species (like S, Cl and HSO4) and cationic species (like C2H5). The bulk and individual particle level data generated over Delhi environment in this experiment may improve our understanding of boundary layer aerosol and could provide the scientific insights of their probable effects on low level cloud formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric chemistry 3achlorine 3amicroscopy 3amixing 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3aspatial distribution 3asulfates 3asulfur 3asulfur oxides 3atemperature inversion 3athermodynamics 3aurban areas 3aIndia 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain 0aMorphology 0aFractal 0aAging 0aMixing-state1 aAhlawat, A.1 aKhosla, D.1 aSharma, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8951-63261 aPrasad, M.V.S.N.1 aSingh, Sukhvir1 aGupta, B.1 aTulsi,1 aSethi, D.1 aSinha, P.R.1 aOjha, D.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9312-38161 aWiedensohler, A.1 aKotnala, R.K.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 July, v. 185 p.243-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245010800163300001600271520133400287592002801621650001501649650001001664650001101674650001601685650001501701653001701716653001401733653002001747653000801767653001001775653001601785700001701801700002001818700001501838700001101853700001701864700001701881773011501898856008502013852000902098655001202107IND60524328220221116225634.0170202e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052432822DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2015.11119502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hui12aA novel image-fusion method based on the un-mixing of mixed MS sub-pixels regarding high-resolution DSM  ap. 606-628.  aA major reason for the spectral distortions of fused images generated by current image-fusion methods is that the fused versions of mixed multispectral (MS) sub-pixels (MSPs) corresponding to panchromatic (PAN) pure pixels remain mixed. The MSPs can be un-mixed spectrally to pure pixels having the same land cover classes in a fine classification map during the fusion process. Since it is difficult to produce such a land cover classification map using only MS and PAN images, a Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from airborne Light Detection And Ranging data were employed in this study to facilitate the classification. In a novel fusion method proposed in this paper, MSPs near and across boundaries between vegetation and non-vegetation are identified using MS, PAN, and normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM). The identified MSPs then are fused to pure pixels with respect to the corresponding land cover class in the classification map. In a test on WorldView-2 images over an urban area and the corresponding nDSM, the fused image generated by the proposed method was visually and quantitatively compared with fused images obtained using common image-fusion methods. The fused images generated by the proposed method yielded minimal spectral distortions and sharpened boundaries between vegetation and non-vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland cover 3alidar 3amodels 3aurban areas 3avegetation 0aImage fusion 0aun-mixing 0amixed sub-pixel 0aDSM 0aLiDAR 0aWorldView-21 aJing, Linhai1 aSun, Zhongchang1 aLi, Junjie1 aXu, Ru1 aTang, Yunwei1 aChen, Fulong0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2016 June 2, v. 9, no. 6 p.606-628dTaylor & Francisx1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2015.11119503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167300001400255520098000269592002801249650002701277650001301304650001301317650002101330650001601351650001401367650002001381650001801401650001201419650001201431650004401443650001401487650002001501653002001521653001201541653002801553653002001581653001201601653001301613700002301626700001701649700002201666700001701688700005801705773008801763856008401851852000901935655001201944IND60528719620221119102811.0160716e20160624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052871962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2016.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBini, Davide10aMultivalent ligand mimetics of LecA from P. aeruginosa: synthesis and NMR studies  ap. 23-28.  aMolecular recognition of glycans plays an important role in glycomic and glycobiology studies. For example, pathogens have a number of different types of lectin for targeting host sugars. In bacteria, lectins exist sometimes as domains of bacterial toxins and exploit adhesion to glycoconjugates as a means of entering host cells. Herein, we describe the synthesis of three glycodendrons with the aim to dissect the fine structural details involved in the multivalent carbohydrate–protein interactions. LecA, from the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been used to characterize galactose dendrons interaction using one of the most widespread NMR technique for the elucidation of receptor-ligand binding in solution, the saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR. Furthermore, the effective hydrodynamic radius of each dendrimer recognized by LecA was estimated from the diffusion coefficients determined by pulsed-field-gradient stimulated echo (PFG-STE) NMR experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3abacterial toxins 3adiffusivity 3agalactose 3aglycoconjugates 3ahydrodynamics 3alectins 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apathogens 3apolysaccharides 0aLigand mimetics 0aSTD NMR 0aPFG-STE NMR experiments 0aP. aeruginosa 0aLectins 0aDendrons1 aMarchetti, Roberta1 aRusso, Laura1 aMolinaro, Antonio1 aSilipo, Alba1 aCipolla, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2678-83290 tCarbohydrate research.g2016 June 24, v. 429 p.23-28dElsevier Ltdx0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2016.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010000168300001400268500001900282520138300301536027301684592002801957596001001985596001101995596000802006650001302014650003002027650001502057650000902072650002002081650002402101650001602125650001102141650001302152650000902165650001602174650002102190650002002211650001902231651001002250653002102260653002102281653001502302653001402317653002002331700001702351700001902368700001902387700001802406700001402424700001102438773012702449856008502576852000902661655001202670IND60726517820221116144947.0210205e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072651782DNAL7 a10.1080/15324982.2020.17652212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZenghui, Sun10aUse and economic benefit of soft rock as an amendment for sandy soil in Mu Us Sandy Land, China  ap. 15-31.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDesertification seriously threatens sustainable economic and social development. Soft rock has been used as a soil amendment for sandy soil in Mu Us Sandy Land. In this study, the effects of soft rock amendment treatments were examined in the cultivation of corn (Zea mays L.), with a focus on soil properties and economic benefits in a field site with sandy soil in 2012–2014, in Mu Us Sandy Land, China. Four crushed soft rock amendment treatments (four ratios of soft rock to sand, 0:1, 1:5, 1:2 and 1:1 by volume) were applied in 2012. The results showed sandy soil properties were well improved by adding soft rock. All soft rock treatments significantly (p < 0.05) increased grain yield and net revenue in all three years. Grain yield increases ranged from 67.8% to 160.1%, and 3-year net revenue increases ranged from 450% to 559%. The treatment with ratios of soft rock to sand of 1:2 showed the strongest effect among all treatments for soil aggregation and corn production averaged over three years. The 1:2 soft rock to sandy soil treatment (by volume) respectively produced 3,257, 633 and 382 USD ha⁻¹ higher net revenues than did the ratios of soft rock to sand of 0:1, 1:5, and 1:1 treatments over the three years. In general, the 1:2 soft rock to sandy soil treatment had a satisfactory effect on improving soil properties and enhancing economic benefit.  aThis research was supported by the Fund Project of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Land Consolidation [2018-TD02], the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2019JQ-945], the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0504705].  aPublisher supplied data  a-TD02  aJQ-945  a705 3aZea mays 3aadministrative management 3aarid lands 3acorn 3adesertification 3afinancial economics 3agrain yield 3aincome 3aresearch 3asand 3asandy soils 3asoil aggregation 3asoil amendments 3asoil treatment 3aChina 0aEconomic benefit 0aMu Us Sandy Land 0asandy soil 0asoft rock 0asoil properties1 aJichang, Han1 aHuanyuan, Wang1 aRuiqing, Zhang1 aYingying, Sun1 aJing, Wei1 aYa, Hu0 tArid land research and management.g2021 Jan. 2, v. 35, no. 1 p.15-31dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl68456x1532-49907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324982.2020.17652213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245010200205300001400307506007600321520136800397592002801765506003701793650002801830650001801858650001401876650002801890650001601918650001001934650001701944650001301961650001601974650001601990650002102006650002302027650001402050650001302064650001702077700002302094700002102117700002302138773016802161856008302329852000902412655001202421IND4487019220221207080211.0120502e20120103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448701922DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11153811092doi7 aPMC32529352pmcid7 a221987702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerber, Lukas C.10aIncorporating microorganisms into polymer layers provides bioinspired functional living materials  ap. 90-94.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArtificial two-dimensional biological habitats were prepared from porous polymer layers and inoculated with the fungus Penicillium roqueforti to provide a living material. Such composites of classical industrial ingredients and living microorganisms can provide a novel form of functional or smart materials with capability for evolutionary adaptation. This allows realization of most complex responses to environmental stimuli. As a conceptual design, we prepared a material surface with self-cleaning capability when subjected to standardized food spill. Fungal growth and reproduction were observed in between two specifically adapted polymer layers. Gas exchange for breathing and transport of nutrient through a nano-porous top layer allowed selective intake of food whilst limiting the microorganism to dwell exclusively in between a confined, well-enclosed area of the material. We demonstrated a design of such living materials and showed both active (eating) and waiting (dormant, hibernation) states with additional recovery for reinitiation of a new active state by observing the metabolic activity over two full nutrition cycles of the living material (active, hibernation, reactivation). This novel class of living materials can be expected to provide nonclassical solutions in consumer goods such as packaging, indoor surfaces, and in biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPenicillium roquefortii 3abiotechnology 3abreathing 3aevolutionary adaptation 3afood intake 3afungi 3agas exchange 3ahabitats 3ahibernation 3aingredients 3amicrobial growth 3anutrient transport 3apackaging 3apolymers 3areproduction1 aKoehler, Fabian M.1 aGrass, Robert N.1 aStark, Wendelin J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Jan. 3, v. 109, no. 1 p.90-94dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11153811093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012100158300002000279520142400299592002801723650001501751650002601766650001801792650001701810650001501827650001101842650001301853650000701866650001601873650001301889650001101902650001101913650001401924700001501938700001801953700002201971700001701993773014302010856007402153852000902227655001202236IND60645729020221119162507.0190529e20190528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064572902DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta03126j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Bingbing12aA rare (3,12)-connected zirconium metal–organic framework with efficient iodine adsorption capacity and pH sensing  ap. 13173-13179.  aWe report here a stable rare zirconium metal–organic framework (MOF) exhibiting a sky topology, Zr₆(μ₃-O)₄(μ₃-OH)₄(ITTC)₄ (UPC-158) (where H₃ITTC = 4,4′,4′′-(1H-imidazole-2,4,5-triyl)tribenzoic acid), established by Zr₆(μ₃-O)₄(μ₃-OH)₄(−COO)₁₂ clusters and 4,4′,4′′-(1H-imidazole-2,4,5-triyl)tribenzoic acid with abundant π-electrons as an ideal material for removing iodine vapor – a major radioactive fission waste. The iodine adsorption efficiency of the acid-treated UPC-158-HX series shows a substantial improvement compared with that of the parental UPC-158 (1.77 g g⁻¹), and the iodine vapor uptake of 2.92 g g⁻¹ at 343.15 K for UPC-158-HCl has reached the maximum value among the reported MOF materials. In addition, the protonation and deprotonation of imidazole nitrogen alter the symmetry of internal structures, resulting in a strong fluorescence enhancement of the material in the pH range of 10–11, making it a potentially precise pH meter. This work not only provides insights into the discovery of unprecedented structures and topologies through the rational choice of organic linkers via experimental and simulation methods but also paves the way to understand the structure related functional applications. It also opens up a window for the design and construction of highly complex porous and stable structures for sophisticated applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3adeprotonation 3afluorescence 3aimidazoles 3aiodine 3anitrogen 3apH 3aprotonation 3atopology 3avapors 3awastes 3azirconium1 aLi, Fugang1 aWang, Chiming1 aZhang, Liangliang1 aSun, Daofeng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 May 28, v. 7, no. 21 p.13173-13179dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta03126j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245012600157300001600283520179300299592002802092650002302120650002402143650001302167650002002180650001302200650001502213650001102228650002002239700001902259700002302278700002202301700002302323700002202346700002402368700002202392700002202414773014102436856007202577852000902649655001202658IND60661909820221123035201.0190904e20070701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066190982DNAL7 a10.1039/b700163k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Gary S.10aEvaluation of vacuum filter sock surface sample collection method for Bacillus spores from porous and non-porous surfaces  ap. 666-671.  aVacuum filter socks were evaluated for recovery efficiency of powdered Bacillus atrophaeus spores from two non-porous surfaces, stainless steel and painted wallboard and two porous surfaces, carpet and bare concrete. Two surface coupons were positioned side-by-side and seeded with aerosolized Bacillus atrophaeus spores. One of the surfaces, a stainless steel reference coupon, was sized to fit into a sample vial for direct spore removal, while the other surface, a sample surface coupon, was sized for a vacuum collection application. Deposited spore material was directly removed from the reference coupon surface and cultured for enumeration of colony forming units (CFU), while deposited spore material was collected from the sample coupon using the vacuum filter sock method, extracted by sonication and cultured for enumeration. Recovery efficiency, which is a measure of overall transfer effectiveness from the surface to culture, was calculated as the number of CFU enumerated from the filter sock sample per unit area relative to the number of CFU enumerated from the co-located reference coupon per unit area. The observed mean filter sock recovery efficiency from stainless steel was 0.29 (SD = 0.14, n = 36), from painted wallboard was 0.25 (SD = 0.15, n = 36), from carpet was 0.28 (SD = 0.13, n = 40) and from bare concrete was 0.19 (SD = 0.14, n = 44). Vacuum filter sock recovery quantitative limits of detection were estimated at 105 CFU m⁻² from stainless steel and carpet, 120 CFU m⁻² from painted wallboard and 160 CFU m⁻² from bare concrete. The method recovery efficiency and limits of detection established in this work provide useful guidance for the planning of incident response environmental sampling for biological agents such as Bacillus anthracis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus anthracis 3aBacillus atrophaeus 3aconcrete 3adetection limit 3aplanning 3asonication 3aspores 3astainless steel1 aBetty, Rita G.1 aBrockmann, John E.1 aLucero, Daniel A.1 aSouza, Caroline A.1 aWalsh, Kathryn S.1 aBoucher, Raymond M.1 aTezak, Matthew S.1 aWilson, Mollye C.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2007 July 1, v. 9, no. 7 p.666-671dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b700163k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010400165520175200269592002802021650001102049650001902060650002602079650001602105650002302121650001802144650001502162650001602177650001102193650001502204650001902219650000902238650002402247650001802271650002102289653006102310653001502371653002802386653004502414700005702459700002302516700003502539700001502574700005702589700001402646700001502660700005502675700001502730773012902745856008202874852000902956655001202965IND60682216820221122041815.0200221e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068221682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Lisheng10aEstimation of surface heat fluxes using multi-angular observations of radiative surface temperature  aThe retrieval of canopy and soil component temperatures for estimating evapotranspiration in the two source energy balance (TSEB) model depends on a relatively accurate partitioning of soil/substrate evaporation and canopy transpiration along with the soil and vegetation temperature components. To avoid the need for a Priestley-Taylor based transpiration formulation, this study applies the TSEB model using radiometric land surface temperature observations at multiple view angles from an airborne sensor for estimating soil and canopy temperatures directly. This direct partitioning between soil and canopy temperatures applied with the TSEB formulation improved the agreement between observed and modeled surface heat fluxes, reducing mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in latent heat fluxes (LE) with flux tower observations from nearly 20% using the original Priestley-Taylor based TSEB model (TSEB-PT) to 15% using TSEB with thermal infrared observations from two substantially different view angles (TSEB-2AG) to nearly 5% using multiple (~6) view angles (TSEB-6AG). Moreover, TSEB-6AG is shown to compute physically realistic spatially-distributed LE for a range of vegetation cover and environmental conditions over the imaged domain. Values of MAPE for sensible heat (H) tended to be larger for all three models due to the fact that tower measurements tended to be located in well irrigated and densely vegetated sites having relatively low H values. This increased accuracy of soil and vegetation component temperature separation using multiangle radiometric temperature observations is useful for evaluating the utility of single and dual view angle thermal radiometer measurements currently available for applying the TSEB model.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aenergy balance 3aenvironmental factors 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3aheat transfer 3airrigation 3alatent heat 3amodels 3aradiometry 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3asurface temperature 3atranspiration 3avegetation cover 0aAirborne multiangle radiometric temperature observations 0aTSEB model 0aSurface flux estimation 0aSoil and canopy temperature partitioning1 aBian, Zunjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2433-99011 aKustas, William P.1 aLau, R.

Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms regulating responses to these conditions. In this study, we sequenced a zucchini transcriptome after merging data from untreated control and from plants exposed to low temperature (4 °C) or low light intensity (80 μmol photons m―² s―¹. A total of 234,583 transcripts N50 = 2609 bp were generated, and 83,650 unigenes N50 = 1257 bp were predicted. Under low-temperature conditions, 982 and 340 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively. Fewer genes were up- 834 and down-regulated 216 under low light intensity stress, indicating that the zucchini seedlings were more sensitive to the applied low temperature than the low light intensity stress. Functional enrichment analyses identified many common or specific biological processes and gene sets responsive to low temperature and low light intensity. In addition, 18 full-length cDNA genes from six gene families (LHCB, POD, SOD, ABAR, ICE1, and COR) and five transcription factor families (AP2/ERF, NAC, ZFP, WRKY, and MYB) identified as potentially associated with both stresses were observed to be differentially expressed in zucchini leaves. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis uncovered many important pathways, including those related to plant hormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. We also confirmed the expressions of these unigenes by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Our findings and the identified functional genes can provide useful clues for improving the abiotic stress tolerance of zucchini by exploitation of the underlying mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAbiotic stresses 0aCucurbita pepo 0aDifferentially expressed genes 0aExpression analysis 0aRNA sequencing 0aZucchini1 aWang, Bin1 aLi, Yongping1 aHuang, Lifang1 aZhang, Qianrong1 aZhu, Haisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9090-42781 aWen, Qingfang0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Apr. 30, v. 265 p.109263-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1092633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245007700167300002000244520108100264592002801345650001601373650001101389650002001400650002101420650001801441650001301459650002001472700001501492700001801507700005501525700005501580773012201635856008701757852000901844655001201853IND60746847120221120204901.0210806e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074684712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c010612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Quan10aSynthesis of Furanic Ethers from Furfuryl Alcohol for Biofuel Production  ap. 12725-12733.  aFuranic ethers including furfuryl ether (FE) and tetrahydrofurfuryl ether (TFE) are considered as boosters for raising the octane number and cetane number, respectively. In this work, heterogeneous catalysts are used to synthesize FE from furfuryl alcohol and are found to be effective, and then they hydrogenate FE into TFE. Among the solid acids including HZSM-5, SiO₂–Al₂O₃, SiO₂, and Al₂O₃, it was discovered that the SiO₂–Al₂O₃ complex with about 2.0% Al₂O₃ content exhibited excellent activity with 69% ethyl furfuryl ether (EFE) yield achieved. SiO₂–Al₂O₃ demonstrated a decrease in its activity after being recycled six times. However, after calcination, SiO₂–Al₂O₃ regained its activity. SiO₂–Al₂O₃ maintained its activity and stability due to the Lewis acid site and the large pore size. In situ hydrogenation of EFE into ethyl tetrahydrofuran ether was performed using Ru/C, Pd/C, Pd/Al₂O₃, Raney Ni, Ni/Al₂O₃, Ni/CeO₂, and Ni/SiO₂ catalysts. Only Raney Ni demonstrated both high activity and stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aenergy 3afuel production 3afurfuryl alcohol 3ahydrogenation 3aporosity 3atetrahydrofuran1 aZhang, Wei1 aLuo, Shengjun1 aGuo, Rongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1880-29601 aXu, Dongyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1457-94820 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 July 12, v. 35, no. 15 p.12725-12733dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c010613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245012200158300001600280520150100296592002801797650001601825650001301841650002601854650002201880650001201902650002201914650001401936650003001950651001001980700002101990700002202011700002002033700001802053773014102071856007202212852000902284655001202293IND60661910020221122023623.0190904e20070601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066191002DNAL7 a10.1039/b700247e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrizo, Daniel10aIn utero and post-natal accumulation of organochlorine compounds in children under different environmental conditions  ap. 523-529.  aA study of intake of organochlorine compounds (OCs) in children both in utero and at the age of four years has been performed in two cohorts. One encompasses children born in Menorca Island between 1997 and 1998, and the other those born between 1997–1999 in Ribera d’Ebre, an in-land industrial–agricultural area of Catalonia. Comparison of the OC concentrations in serum samples from both populations, including those obtained from cord blood and blood collected at four years, provides information on the influence of local pollution sources in the accumulation of these compounds. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) have been found for hexachlorobenzene, indicating that chronic airborne contamination to this compound in Ribera d’Ebre involved higher in utero exposure, which increased in the first four years of growth. Similarly, in the cohort of Menorca, higher in utero exposure to PCBs was observed and this increased subsequently in the first four years of growth. Other compounds encompassing temporal contamination episodes such as γ-HCH involved higher in utero exposure but strongly diminished in the first four years of growth. Overall, it can be concluded that local chronic pollution by OCs has a direct effect in children living in the surrounding areas. This influence is reflected in higher exposure, both in utero and in the first years of growth, that significantly stands out over the background contamination due to the ubiquity of these compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3achildren 3aenvironmental factors 3ahexachlorobenzene 3alindane 3amaternal exposure 3apollution 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aSpain1 aGrimalt, Joan O.1 aRibas-Fito, Nuria1 aTorrent, Maties1 aSunyer, Jordi0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2007 June 1, v. 9, no. 6 p.523-529dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b700247e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011200159300002000271520228500291592002802576650001102604650002202615650001402637650001202651650001102663650001302674650001402687650003402701650001902735650001702754650001902771650001202790650001802802650000702820650001102827650002302838650002302861650000902884700001602893700001602909700001802925700002102943700001902964700001702983773014303000856007403143852000903217655001203226IND60645729320221119162458.0190529e20190528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064572932DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta03212f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huaiqing12aA novel aqueous Li⁺ (or Na⁺)/Br⁻ hybrid-ion battery with super high areal capacity and energy density  ap. 13050-13059.  aWith the explosive growth in intermittent renewable sources and the global drive toward decarbonizing the energy economy, reliable large-scale electrical energy storage technologies with high safety and low cost are urgently needed. Aqueous batteries hold the intrinsic advantages of nonflammability and low cost; the zinc//bromine flow battery and LiMn₂O₄//NaTi₂(PO₄)₃ aqueous rechargeable ion battery are two representative systems with relatively high voltages (1.6 V to 1.8 V in common aqueous solutions). However, the long-term cycling stability of intercalation/de-intercalation type cathode materials is easily impaired by pH fluctuance, while the deposition/dissolution-type zinc anode suffers from zinc dendrites and uneven deposition issues. To avoid these two issues, we propose a novel bromine//NaTi₂(PO₄)₃ hybrid ion battery, involving an aqueous redox pair (Br₃⁻/Br⁻, with high reactivity in a pH range from 0 to 9) and a high-loading ion intercalation anode (NaTi₂(PO₄)₃, with low working voltage and little volume change). First, the high-performance NTP@C nanoparticles are synthesized by a modified sol–gel method. Then, the three-dimensional NTP@C anode with super high mass loading is designed by employing a porous and conductive carbon substrate. The crossover of bromine in aqueous catholyte is suppressed by an effective bromine complexing agent and the insufficient ion transport in a thick solid anode is conquered by a negative flowing electrolyte. As a result, the hybrid ion battery shows high areal energy density, high power density and promising cycling stability. The full cell can deliver a high energy density and power density of 12.8 mW h cm⁻² (109 W h kg⁻¹ based on NTP@C and reacted LiBr) and 29.4 mW cm⁻² (250 W kg⁻¹ based on NTP@C and reacted LiBr), respectively. Moreover, the power density can reach 106 mW cm⁻² with energy density remaining at 7.95 mW h cm⁻² (68 W h kg⁻¹ based on NTP@C and reacted LiBr) at a super high current density of 100 mA cm⁻². An average capacity loss of 0.075% per cycle is obtained during a 200-cycle test, demonstrating the great feasibility of the new system. Therefore, this hybrid battery has great potential in large scale electrical energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aaqueous solutions 3abatteries 3abromine 3acarbon 3acathodes 3adendrites 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectric power 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3alithium 3ananoparticles 3apH 3asodium 3asol-gel processing 3astorage technology 3azinc1 aWang, Renhe1 aSong, Zihan1 aZhang, Huamin1 aZhang, Hongzhang1 aWang, Yonggang1 aLi, Xianfeng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 May 28, v. 7, no. 21 p.13050-13059dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta03212f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245017700164300001200341500001900353520132700372592002801699650002401727650002101751650002201772650002201794650002201816650001901838650002101857653002301878653002301901653002501924653003301949700001601982700001501998700001602013700001602029700001402045700001702059773013102076856008702207852000902294655001202303IND60720547020221120133823.0210121e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072054702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Die10aNearly perfect kinetic resolution of racemic o-nitrostyrene oxide by AuEH2, a microsomal epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus usamii, with high enantio- and regio-selectivity  ap. 1-7.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOnly a few known epoxide hydrolases (EHs) displayed activity towards o-nitrostyrene oxide (4a), presumably owing to the large steric hindrance caused by o-nitro substituent. Therefore, excavating EHs with high activity and enantio- and/or regio-selectivity towards racemic (rac-) 4a is essential but challenging. Here, AuEH2 from Aspergillus usamii was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). E. coli/Aueh2, an E. coli transformant expressing AuEH2, possessed EH activities of 16.2–184 U/g wet cell towards rac-styrene oxide (1a) and its derivatives (2a–13a), and the largest enantiomeric ratio of 96 towards rac-4a. The regioselectivity coefficients, βR and βS, of AuEH2 were determined to be 99.2% and 98.9%, suggesting that it regiopreferentially attacks the Cᵦ in the oxirane rings of (R)- and (S)-4a. Then, the nearly perfect kinetic resolution of 20 mM rac-4a in pure water was carried out using 20 mg/mL wet cells of E. coli/Aueh2 at 25 °C for 50 min, retaining (S)-4a with over 99% eeₛ and 48.9% yieldₛ, while producing (R)-o-nitrophenyl-1,2-ethanediol (4b) with 95.3% eeₚ and 49.8% yieldₚ. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of AuEH2 with high enantiopreference for (R)-4a, its crystal structure was solved by X-ray diffraction and the molecular docking of AuEH2 with (R)- or (S)-4a was simulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus awamori 3aEscherichia coli 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3aepoxide hydrolase 3aethylene oxide 3aregioselectivity 0aAspergillus usamii 0aKinetic resolution 0ao-Nitrostyrene oxide 0aMolecular docking simulation1 aHu, Bo-Chun1 aWen, Zheng1 aZhang, Dong1 aLiu, You-Yi1 aZang, Jia1 aWu, Min-Chen0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 169 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002200144245013000166300001800296520163700314650004401951650001401995650002502009650001402034650001602048650001202064650002102076650001602097650001602113650001402129650001302143650000902156650002302165650002202188650000902210650001402219650000702233650001402240650002402254650001802278650003202296650002002328650002002348650003302368650001902401700001502420700002102435700002002456700002202476773016102498856004702659852000902706655001202715IND4534983320221118191631.0150929s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453498332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b007962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, David R.10aDevelopment of Iron-Chelating Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Packaging for Inhibiting Lipid Oxidation in Oil-in-Water Emulsions  ap. 5055-5060.  aFoods such as bulk oils, salad dressings, and nutritionally fortified beverages that are susceptible to oxidative degradation are often packaged in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottles with metal chelators added to the food to maintain product quality. In the present work, a metal-chelating active packaging material is designed and characterized, in which poly(hydroxamic acid) (PHA) metal-chelating moieties were grafted from the surface of PET. Biomimetic PHA groups were grafted in a two-step UV-initiated process without the use of a photoinitiator. Surface characterization of the films by attenuated total reflective Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) suggested successful grafting and conversion of poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA) to PHA chelating moieties from the surface of PET. Colorimetric (ferrozine) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) assays demonstrated the ability of PET-g-PHA to chelate iron in a low-pH (3.0) environment containing a competitive metal chelator (citric acid). Lipid oxidation studies demonstrated the antioxidant activity of PET-g-PHA films in inhibiting iron-promoted oxidation in an acidified oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion model system (pH 3.0). Particle size and Î¶-potential analysis indicated that the addition of PET-g-PHA films did not affect the physical stability of the emulsion system. This work suggests that biomimetic chelating moieties can be grafted from PET and effectively inhibit iron-promoted degradation reactions, enabling removal of metal-chelating additives from product formulations. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadditives 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3abiomimetics 3abottles 3achelating agents 3acitric acid 3acolorimetry 3aemulsions 3aethylene 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3amass spectrometry 3aoils 3aoxidation 3apH 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3aparticle size 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3aproduct quality 3asalad dressings 3ascanning electron microscopy 3azeta potential1 aTian, Fang1 aRoman, Maxine J.1 aDecker, Eric A.1 aGoddard, Julie M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 May 27, v. 63, no. 20 p.5055-5060dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00796  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008000170500001900250520153700269592002801806650001201834650001201846650001601858650001201874650001701886650001301903650001101916650002201927650001601949651001901965653001901984653002102003653002002024653000802044653003302052653001502085700001902100700002002119700002202139700002202161700001702183700002102200773011302221856008202334852000902416655001202425IND60683599120221117230952.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068359912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2020.1050822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRybníček, Michal10aWorld's oldest dendrochronologically dated archaeological wood construction  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn 2018, during the construction of a motorway in the East Bohemian Region near the town of Ostrov (Czech Republic), archaeologists excavated a structure of a wooden water well lining with a square base area of 80 × 80 cm and 140 cm in height. Due to the excellent conservation of the oak timbers, studies of technological details and precise tree-ring dating were possible. The used trees were felled in the years 5256/55 BC, which makes this well the oldest dendrochronologically dated archaeological wooden construction worldwide. It is the third well from the Early Neolithic period that has been discovered in the Czech Republic within the last four years. The design consists of grooved corner posts with inserted planks. This type of construction reveals advanced technical know-how and, till now, is the only known type from this region and time period. Thanks to the combination of annually resolved and absolutely dated tree-ring widths (TRWs), the Czech oak TRW chronology has been significantly extended back to 5481 BC. Wood anatomical identification of fragments from the well filling show mainly oak (Quercus spp.) and hazel (Corylus spp.), indicating a local forest composition dominated by these taxa. The shape of the individual structural elements and tool marks preserved on their surface confirm sophisticated carpentry skills. Based on these observations, we established a model for the “chaîne opératoire” from forest utilization to the final artefact at the beginning of the Early Neolithic period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorylus 3aQuercus 3aarchaeology 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3ahighways 3amodels 3awood construction 3awoodworking 3aCzech Republic 0aCentral Europe 0aDendrochronology 0aEarly Neolithic 0aOak 0aLinear pottery culture (LBK) 0aWater well1 aKočár, Petr,1 aMuigg, Bernhard1 aPeška, Jaroslav,1 aSedláček, Radko1 aTegel, Willy1 aKolář, Tomáš0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2020 Mar., v. 115 p.105082-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.1050823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014800172300001600320500001900336520102100355592002801376650001801404650001301422650001301435650000901448650001201457650002501469653001101494653001501505653001901520700001601539773013501555856008701690852000901777655001201786IND60720547120221120133838.0210212e20210131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072054712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazawa, Kenjiro10aForcibly spun dragline silk fibers from web-building spider Trichonephila clavata ensure robustness irrespective of spinning speed and humidity  ap. 550-557.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWeb-building spiders secrete dragline silk fibers to sustain their body and use them as frameworks during web construction.

We found that the crystal and morphological structures did not rely on the spinning speed and humidity. Furthermore, the mechanical strength and extensibility of the dragline silk fibers were maintained, demonstrating that dragline silk fibers ensure robustness irrespective of the spinning speed and humidity.

Here, an attempt is made to grow high-surface-area three-dimensional (3D) Zn nanoflakes on molecularly modified Zn surface. The approach is simple, cost effective, and straightforward for a large-scale production of anode. Additionally, Co₃O₄ as a catalyst for oxygen evolution is effectively immobilized on nickel foam by a simple spray pyrolysis technique. It provides a stable current density of 10 mA cm–² at 1.51 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). A Zn–air battery is assembled in a homemade setup and studied in detail for its electrochemical properties. It shows outstanding cycling stability of more than 500 charge–discharge cycles at 5 mA cm–² (83 h). A comparative study is carried out for unmodified and modified Zn anodes. It is observed that molecular modification has a strong influence on battery performance. Hence, the present approach can be innovative in the development of next-generation Zn–air batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acatalysts 3acomparative study 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afoams 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3aoxygen production 3apyrolysis1 aRabinal, M.

We predict that these earliest dogs (referred to herein as protodogs), while potentially difficult to distinguish morphologically from wolves, experienced behavioral shifts, including changes in diet. Specifically, protodogs may have consumed more bone and other less desirable scraps within human settlement areas. Here we apply Dental Microwear Texture Analysis (DMTA) to canids from the Gravettian site of Předmostí (approx. 28,500 BP), which were previously assigned to the Paleolithic dog or Pleistocene wolf morphotypes. We test whether these groups separate out significantly by diet-related variation in microwear patterning. Results are consistent with differences in dietary breadth, with the Paleolithic dog morphotype showing evidence of greater durophagy than those assigned to the wolf morphotype. This supports the presence of two morphologically and behaviorally distinct canid types at this middle Upper Paleolithic site. Our primary goal here was to test whether these two morphotypes expressed notable differences in dietary behavior. However, in the context of a major Gravettian settlement, this may also support evidence of early stage dog domestication. Dental microwear is a behavioral signal that may appear generations before morphological changes are established in a population. It shows promise for distinguishing protodogs from wolves in the Pleistocene and domesticated dogs from wolves elsewhere in the archaeological record.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanidae 3aPleistocene epoch 3aarchaeology 3adiet 3adogs 3adomestication 3ahuman settlements 3amorphs 3anutritional behavior 3atexture 3awolves 3aCzech Republic 0aCanis familiaris 0aCanis lupus 0aDog domestication 0aDietary behavior 0aDental microwear texture analysis 0aUpper paleolithic/palaeolithic1 aDuBois, Josephine1 aLázničková-Galetová, Martina,1 aGermonpre, Mietje,1 aUngar, Peter S.0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2020 Mar., v. 115 p.105092-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.1050923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013400169300001600303520201000319592002802329650005302357650001102410650002002421650001202441650001602453650001602469650001302485650001102498650001802509650002402527650000802551650001602559650003402575650003402609650002702643650002402670650001002694651001802704653003002722653002302752653001302775653001602788653002202804700001702826700001102843700001502854700001402869773011902883856008803002852000903090655001203099IND60589515920221122044811.0190206e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058951592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiaowei10aPFOA is associated with diabetes and metabolic alteration in US men: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2012  ap. 566-574.  aExposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is associated with a range of adverse health effects. However, it remains unclear whether PFAS at environmentally relevant exposure levels are related to diabetes and metabolite concentrations in adults. Using cross-sectional data from 7904 adults (age≥20years) in the 2003–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we examined the association of PFAS with the prevalence of diabetes and metabolite concentrations. A multivariate logistic regression was applied to investigate the associations of diabetes prevalence with serum perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) levels. A multivariate generalised linear regression was further performed to investigate the associations between PFAS exposure and some metabolites. We identified a strong positive association between serum PFOA and diabetes prevalence in men with an adjusted model (OR: 2.66, 95% CI: 1.63–4.35; P for trend=0.001). No significant association between serum PFOA and diabetes prevalence was observed in women (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.88–2.46; P for trend=0.737). Furthermore, diabetes was not related to PFOS, PFHxS and PFNA, regardless of gender. In the gender-stratified generalised linear models, men and women with the highest PFOA levels demonstrated a 1.43% (95% CI: 0.62%–2.34%) and a 1.07% (95% CI: 0.27%–1.97%) greater increase in serum total cholesterol (P for trend=0.006 and 0.001) compared to those with the lowest PFOA levels. There were no significant associations between serum PFOA and other metabolites. These results provide epidemiological evidence that environment-related levels of serum PFOA may be positively associated with the prevalence of diabetes in men and with total cholesterol in adults. Further clinical and animal studies are urgently needed to elucidate putative causal relationships and shed light on the potential mode of action involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aanimals 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adiabetes 3agender 3alinear models 3amechanism of action 3amen 3ametabolites 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aregression analysis 3awomen 3aUnited States 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0aPerfluorooctanoate 0aDiabetes 0aMetabolites 0aTotal cholesterol1 aLiu, Yuanxin1 aXu, Bo1 aGu, Liubao1 aTang, Wei0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 June 01, v. 625 p.566-574dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.1863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04027naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009200166300001600258520189700274592002802171650001602199650002602215650001102241650001402252650001402266650001502280650001702295650002102312650001002333650001902343650001502362650001402377650002902391650002502420650001102445650001602456650001402472650001202486650001202498651001002510653002102520653002802541653002002569653001902589700005402608700005302662700001702715700005502732700001802787700001502805700002402820700001602844700005802860700001402918700001302932700001802945700001702963700001402980700001502994700002603009700001703035700005403052773010403106856008603210852000903296655001203305IND60649592820221118235006.0190705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064959282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReche, C.10aSpatio-temporal patterns of high summer ozone events in the Madrid Basin, Central Spain  ap. 207-220.  aComplex spatial and temporal patterns of ground-level O3 and NO2 concentrations have been revealed across an important southern European O3 exceedance area (Madrid Basin, central Spain). Data were obtained from 102 diffusion tube sites and 49 monitoring stations (25 urban/suburban, 12 urban/suburban-traffic, 7 remote, 3 rural, 2 urban-industrial) located through a wide area inside and beyond the city. This new, high-density database confirms that current locations of monitoring stations in the Madrid networks are well positioned to record representative levels of O3 across the area. Two air quality monitoring stations were identified as reference measurement points, based on their lower O3 and NO2 concentrations, and used as a proxy for regional and hemispheric background levels. Although a main regional contribution was evidenced, emissions of local precursors within the Madrid urban plume play a key role in the generation of O3 exceedances, which are higher and occur earlier near the city than at rural sites, where the effect of NO titration is lower. Despite the fact that weekend emissions of O3 precursors in Madrid are typically lower than on weekdays, mainly due to fewer road traffic emissions, there is little difference in average values of weekday and weekend O3. However, more subtle “weekend effect” differences are revealed by probability density analysis, with high O3 and low NO2 at the highest temperature range (30-35° C) at weekends reflecting lower NO titration. This analysis highlights the importance of NO timing with respect to the photochemical activity timing. The complexity of these O3 pollution patterns in and around the city is dependent on an ever-changing interplay between weather conditions, emission sources, and the timescale required for pollutant transport, chemical processing and recirculation in an evolving contaminated airmass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abasins 3adatabases 3aemissions 3amonitoring 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aphotochemistry 3apollutants 3apollution 3aprobability distribution 3aprocessing chemistry 3asummer 3atemperature 3atitration 3atraffic 3aweather 3aSpain 0aOzone precursors 0aPhotochemical pollution 0aSouthern Europe 0aWeekend effect1 aMoreno, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3235-10271 aAmato, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1546-91541 aPandolfi, M.1 aPérez, J.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3896-621X1 ade la Paz, D.1 aDíaz, E.,1 aGómez-Moreno, F.J.1 aPujadas, M.1 aArtíñano, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9682-79071 aReina, F.1 aOrio, A.1 aPallarés, M.1 aEscudero, M.1 aTapia, O.1 aCrespo, E.1 aVargas Rojas, Ronald,1 aAlastuey, A.1 aQuerol, X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6549-98990 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 July, v. 185 p.207-220dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002200144245015300166300001800319520098000337650004201317650003501359650002201394650002301416650001201439650001801451650001101469650001501480650003101495650004401526650002001570650001001590650001101600650001601611700001801627700002401645700002301669700002201692700002401714773016101738856004701899852000901946655001201955IND4534983520221118190849.0150929s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453498352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b019932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasini, Gabriella10aStructural and nutritional properties of pasta from Triticum monococcum and Triticum durum species.

Saragolla) and Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum (cv. Monlis), under different processing conditions. MRI analysis and NMR spectroscopy (i.e., T1 and T2 NMR relaxation times and diffusion parameters) were conducted on pasta, and 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of the chemical compounds released by pasta samples during the cooking process was performed. In addition, starch digestibility (enzymatically determined) was also investigated. The NMR results indicated that Saragolla pasta has a more compact structure, ascribed to pasta network and in particular to different technological gluten properties, that mainly determine the lower ability of Monlis pasta in binding water. These results correlate well with the lower rate of starch hydrolysis measured for Monlis pasta compared to Saragolla when both are dried at high temperature. 3aTriticum monococcum subsp. monococcum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3achemical analysis 3achemical compounds 3acooking 3adigestibility 3agluten 3ahydrolysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutritive value 3apasta 3astarch 3atemperature1 aGreco, Fulvia1 aCremonini, Mauro A.1 aBrandolini, Andrea1 aConsonni, Roberto1 aGussoni, Maristella0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 May 27, v. 63, no. 20 p.5072-5082dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b01993  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011000170300001400280520126600294592002801560650001701588650001601605650001501621650001801636650001101654650001901665653002001684653003501704653003901739653003701778653002801815653002801843700002601871700002001897700002401917700002801941700002201969773008801991856008402079852000902163655001202172IND60528720220221119102620.0160716e20160722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052872022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2016.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyzhov, Ivan M.10aBlock synthesis of A (type 2) and B (type 2) tetrasaccharides related to the human ABO blood group system  ap. 59-71.  aHerein we report the synthesis of 3-aminopropyl glycosides of A (type 2) and B (type 2) tetrasaccharides via [3 + 1] block scheme. Peracetylated trichloroacetimidates of A and B trisaccharides were used as glycosyl donors. The well-known low reactivity of 4-OH group of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine forced us to test four glucosamine derivatives (3-Bz-1,6-anhydro-GlcNAc and 3-trifluoroacetamidopropyl β-glycosides of 3-Ac-6-Bn-GlcNAc, 3-Ac-6-Bn-GlcN3, and 3-Ac-6-Bn-GlcNAc2) to select the best glycosyl acceptor for the synthesis of type 2 tetrasaccharides.

Glycosylation of 3-Bz-1,6-anhydro-GlcNAc derivative resulted in α-glycoside as a major product. High stereospecificity was achieved only in the synthesis of B (type 2) tetrasaccharide, when 3-trifluoroacetamidopropyl 3-Ac-6-Bn-GlcNAc2β was applied as the glycosyl acceptor (β/α 5:1), whereas glycosylation with trichloroacetimidate of A trisaccharide was not stereospecific (β/α 1.3:1). Glycosylation of 3-trifluoroacetamidopropyl glycoside of 3-Ac-6-Bn-GlcN3β with trichloroacetimidates of A and B trisaccharides provided the same stereochemical yield (β/α 1.5:1).  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood groups 3aglucosamine 3aglycosides 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3atrisaccharides 0aBlock-synthesis 0aABO histo-blood group antigens 0aTrichloroacetimidate glycosylation 0aN-Acetyl-1,6-anhydro-glucosamine 0aN,N-Diacetylglucosamine 0a2-Azido-2-deoxy-glucose1 aKorchagina, Elena Yu.1 aPopova, Inna S.1 aTyrtysh, Tatiana V.1 aParamonov, Alexander S.1 aBovin, Nicolai V.0 tCarbohydrate research.g2016 July 22, v. 430 p.59-71dElsevier Ltdx0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2016.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100001700186245014300203300001100346506007600357520148200433592002801915506003701943650002301980650001202003650000902015650002702024650003402051650001302085650001502098650002102113650001202134650001402146650003002160650004502190650003502235650001702270650001202287650000902299650003602308650005502344650005102399650003602450650007402486700002102560773009102581856007902672852000902751655001202760IND50090070420221207105645.0161031e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009007042DNAL7 aPMC40418942pmcid7 a248861032pmid7 a10.1186/1297-9716-45-572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsieh, Li-En10aIdentification and genotyping of feline infectious peritonitis-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in the feline interferon-γ gene  ap. 57.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated, highly lethal disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. Currently, no protective vaccine or effective treatment for the disease is available. Studies have found that some cats survive the challenge of virulent FCoV isolates. Since cellular immunity is thought to be critical in preventing FIP and because diseased cats often show a significant decrease in interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the feline IFN-γ gene (fIFNG) are associated with the outcome of infection. A total of 82 asymptomatic and 63 FIP cats were analyzed, and 16 SNP were identified in intron 1 of fIFNG. Among these SNP, the fFING + 428 T allele was shown to be a FIP-resistant allele (p = 0.03), and the heterozygous genotypes 01C/T and +408C/T were found to be FIP-susceptible factors (p = 0.004). Furthermore, an fIFNG + 428 resistant allele also showed a clear correlation with the plasma level of IFN-γ in FIP cats. For the identification of these three FIP-related SNP, genotyping methods were established using amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), and the different genotypes could easily be identified without sequencing. The identification of additional FIP-related SNP will allow the selection of resistant cats and decrease the morbidity of the cat population to FIP.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFeline coronavirus 3aalleles 3acats 3acell-mediated immunity 3afeline infectious peritonitis 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ainterferon-gamma 3aintrons 3amorbidity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aCats 2aCoronavirus, Felinexphysiology 2aFeline Infectious Peritonitisxgeneticsxvirology. 2aInterferon-gammaxbloodxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary.1 aChueh, Ling-Ling0 tVeterinary research.g2014 Dec., v. 45, no. 1 p.57-57dBioMed Centralx1297-97167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-45-573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011000175300001400285520173800299592002802037650001002065650001902075650001502094650000902109650001202118650001302130650001502143650001102158650001002169650002602179650002002205653003002225653002102255653001102276653000802287653000802295653001802303653000902321653000702330653000702337653000802344653000702352653000702359653000802366653000802374653000802382653002402390653000702414653000702421653001002428653000802438653000802446653000702454700001502461700002202476773011202498856008302610852000902693655001202702IND60682217420221122221736.0200410e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068221742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Jose Mauricio10aReference intervals for rotational thromboelastometry measurements using the ROTEM® delta device in dogs  ap. 26-32.  aAims of the present study were to define reference intervals for viscoelastic analyses of canine haemostasis using the ROTEM® delta analyser, and as a secondary aspect to determine the precision (repeatability) of this method. Blood samples from 125 clinically healthy dogs were included. Measurements were performed with commercially available activating reagents (ex-tem, in-tem and kaolin solution) as well as without activation. Additional fourfold measurements were done in 3 of the normal blood samples and in 3 samples with haemostatic alterations to evaluate the precision of the method.Coefficients of variation (CVs) for most of the ROTEM variables were < 10%. Clot formation time and maximum clot elasticity showed a wide inter-individual variation in comparison with alpha angle and maximum clot firmness. A multivariate analysis on various ROTEM parameters revealed particularly a significant influence of neuter status and a significant interrelationship between the factors sex and neuter status for measurements with different activating reagents. These results reflected the fact that significant differences occurred only between intact and neutered females, but not in males. No or only occasionally significant differences were found between groups of sex, age, and size.In conclusion, CVs demonstrated that the method delivers repeatable results in canine citrated whole blood. Established reference intervals should deliver valuable orientation for the evaluation of viscoelastic properties of clotting whole blood in dogs using the ROTEM delta analyser. Neuter status in females appeared to be the most relevant influencing factor and should be considered for the interpretation of ROTEM delta test results.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acastration 3adogs 3afemales 3afirmness 3ahemostasis 3akaolin 3amales 3amultivariate analysis 3aviscoelasticity 0aViscoelastic measurements 0aReference values 0aCanine 0aAge 0aSex 0aNeuter status 0aAPTT 0aCI 0aCT 0aCFT 0aCV 0aα 0aA30 0aMCF 0aMCE 0aLI 30, LI 45, LI 60 0aML 0aPT 0aROTEM 0aTEG 0aTEM 0aTT1 aRohn, Karl1 aMischke, Reinhard0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2020 June, v. 130 p.26-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010900153300001800262500001900280520153400299592002801833650002301861650003101884650001101915650001301926650001701939700001301956700002801969700001301997700002102010700001602031773013502047856007402182852000902256655001202265IND60704285520221116161250.0200722e20200721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070428552DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cs00021c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chen10aSelf-assembly of block copolymers towards mesoporous materials for energy storage and conversion systems  ap. 4681-4736.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelf-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) provides a versatile strategy for controllable preparation of a broad range of functional materials with different ordered structures. In recent decades, this soft-templating strategy has been widely utilized for preparing a wide range of mesoporous materials. These porous materials have attracted tremendous interest in energy storage and conversion (ESC) applications in view of their ability to absorb, store, and interact with guest species on their exterior/interior surfaces and in the pore space. Compared with other synthetic approaches, such as template-free and hard-templating methods, BCP soft-templating protocols show great advantages in the construction of large mesopores with diameters between 10–60 nm, which are suitable for applications requiring the storage or hosting of large-sized species/molecules. In addition, this strategy shows incomparable merits in the flexible control of pore size/architecture/wall thickness, which determines the final performance of mesoporous materials in ESC devices. In the last decade, rapid development has been witnessed in the area of BCP-templated mesoporous materials. In this review paper, we overview the progress of this field over the past 10 years, with an emphasis on the discussions of synthetic methodologies, the control of materials structures (including morphology and pore size/shape), and potential applications particularly in rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, electro-/photocatalysis, solar cells, etc.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenergy 3aporosity 3aporous media1 aLi, Qian1 aKaneti, Yusuf Valentino1 aHou, Dan1 aYamauchi, Yusuke1 aMai, Yiyong0 tChemical Society reviews.g2020 July 21, v. 49, no. 14 p.4681-4736dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs00021c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011300167500001900280520138200299592002801681650001901709650001601728650001901744650001101763650002401774650001501798650001201813651001701825651001501842653002401857653001901881653002401900653000801924653002901932653002801961700002601989700002902015700003102044700002302075700002402098700002402122700001902146700002602165700002002191700002102211700002702232700002302259700002302282700002402305700002302329700002902352700002302381773011302404856008202517852000902599655001202608IND60683599720221117230945.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068359972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2020.1050972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Dylan S.10aSatellite-based remote sensing rapidly reveals extensive record of Holocene coastal settlement on Madagascar  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite decades of archaeological research, roughly 75% of Madagascar's land area remains archaeologically unexplored and the oldest sites on the island are difficult to locate, as they contain the ephemeral remains of mobile hunter/forager campsites. The known archaeological record is therefore biased toward later sites, especially sites dating to the second millennium AD, following the expansion of Indian Ocean trading networks. Systematic archaeological investigations are required to address these biases in the known archaeological record and clarify the island's early human history, but funding limitations, logistical and time constraints in surveying large areas and a relatively small number of active field archaeologists present substantial barriers to expansive areal survey coverage. Using theoretical models derived from human behavioral ecology (i.e., ideal free distribution, optimal foraging theory) in conjunction with freely available remote sensing data, we illustrate how archaeological survey of Madagascar's landscapes can be rapidly expanded, more effectively target early archaeological deposits, and address questions about the island's settlement. This study illustrates the potential for theoretically-driven satellite-based remote sensing analysis to improve our understanding of the archaeological record of the world's fourth largest island.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aarchaeology 3ahuman behavior 3ahumans 3apopulation dynamics 3asatellites 3asurveys 3aIndian Ocean 3aMadagascar 0aSettlement patterns 0aRemote sensing 0aPredictive modeling 0aGIS 0aHuman behavioral ecology 0aIdeal free distribution1 aAndriankaja, Vanillah1 aCarnat, Tahirisoa Lorine1 aChrisostome, Zafy Maharesy1 aColomb, Christoph,1 aFenomanana, Felicia1 aHubertine, Laurence1 aJustome, Ricky1 aLahiniriko, François1 aLéonce, Harson1 aManahira, George1 aPierre, Briand Venance1 aRoi, Razafimagnefa1 aSoafiavy, Patricia1 aVictorian, Faralahy1 aVoahirana, Vavisoa1 aManjakahery, Barthelemy,1 aDouglass, Kristina0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2020 Mar., v. 115 p.105097-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.1050973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013400169300001400303500001900317520101300336592002801349650002901377650001201406650001201418650004301430650002001473650002501493650001301518650001001531650001001541700001501551700002501566773011401591856008601705852000901791655001201800IND60726518720221116145034.0210315e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072651872DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2020.18379852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aS., De Petris12aA New Index for Assessing Tree Vigour Decline Based on Sentinel-2 Multitemporal Data.

In this work a new index, from Sentinel-2 retrieved NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series, is proposed, hereafter called ‘normalized Vegetation Vigour Index (nVVI)’, which is specifically designed to quantify and map tree vigour decline. Results proved that nVVI is negatively correlated to tree age (r = −0.815, p < 0.001): older or unhealthy trees showed low nVVI values; younger trees showed high nVVI possibly related to vigour increase. nVVI was, finally used within a Decision Support System (DSS) specifically designed to support tree failure risk management in wide areas, like the natural parks. It was found that such approach can result in an economic saving of about 52% compared to more traditional tree stability surveys. If present, a nVVI map can highlight incipient vegetative anomalies permitting tree stability surveys to be better prioritized.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision support systems 3adecline 3aforests 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3arisk management 3atime series analysis 3atree age 3atrees 3avigor1 aF., Sarvia1 aE., Borgogno-Mondino0 tRemote sensing letters.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 12, no. 1 p.58-67dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2020.18379853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169300001400276500002900290520105200319536038301371592002801754596001301782596001601795596001601811596001901827596001701846650001101863650001901874650002701893650001201920650001901932650001401951650002901965700001601994700001502010700001802025700001302043773011402056856008602170852000902256655001202265IND60726518820221116144945.0210315e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072651882DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2020.18413202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jianhui12aA novel phase bias estimation method for multichannel HRWS SAR system in azimuth based on RDS analysis  ap. 11-19.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aMultichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems in azimuth can realize high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) imaging, which has attracted intensive research interests. The azimuth ambiguities caused by non-uniform sampling can be suppressed by digital beamforming technique. However, the presence of inevitable channel errors in the multichannel SAR system deteriorates the performance of ambiguity suppression. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the multichannel SAR echoes, it was found that phase bias among channels can cause jumping in the reconstructed Doppler spectrum (RDS). This letter presents a novel data-based phase bias estimation method for HRWS SAR system. With the assumption that the splice of echo energy inside the Doppler bandwidth is continuous, there is no jumping in the RDS. The estimation of phase biases in the multichannel HRWS SAR system can be translated into the optimization solution issue. Simulation experiments and real data processing results validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.  aThis work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0502700]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61871175]; Foundation of Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, Ministry of Education [RIMP2020003]; Youth Talent Lifting Project of Henan Province [2019HYTP006]; and College Key Research Project of Henan Province [192102210082].  aPublisher supplied data  a61871175  aRIMP2020003  a2019HYTP006  a2017YFB0502700  a192102210082 3aenergy 3aimage analysis 3ainformation processing 3ajumping 3aremote sensing 3asolutions 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aWang, Guan,1 aWang, Ling1 aGuo, Zhengwei1 aLi, Ning0 tRemote sensing letters.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 12, no. 1 p.11-19dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2020.18413203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245010500171300001600276500001500292520232000307592002802627650002202655650001802677650001202695650002102707650001302728650002502741650001702766650001002783650001602793650001102809650001702820650001102837653001102848773013302859856005702992852000903049655001203058IND4507642920221120154845.0150710e193309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450764292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1096-3642.1933.tb01611.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, T.

The first histological changes are observed in the late larval stage (preâpupa), when phenomena of disputed significance occurâthe formation of globules and their apparent liberation into the gutâlumen This is followed by rapid multiplication of the replacementâcells. The bases of the histolyzing epithelial cells contain large vacuoles, and it is probable that these exert a mechanical force, pushing the epithelium away from the basementâmembrane. This process of casting is probably aided also by chemical disintegration of the cellâbases and basementâmembrane, by the force exerted by the rapidly growing replacementâcells, and by severe muscular peristalsis of the intestinal muscleâlayers. The rapid proliferation of the replacementâcells leads to the formation of the new epithelium. This is at first irregularly disposed and thrown into folds which disappear as the diameter of the gut increases. The cast epithelium lies in the gutâlumen, and is removed by an undetermined method, probably a combination of âautoâdigestionâ and by enzymes liberated from the new cellâlayer. Phagocytosis plays no part in the process. The early epithelium shows certain characteristic features, particularly a refringent edge, which splits away by delamination and gives rise in this manner to the peritrophic membrane which thus arises during the pupal period. There is only one pupal epithelium. The adult morphology is attained before the imago emerges, but the cells of the epithelium are small and âcuboid.â The final histological characters (such as greater size, perinuclear space, etc.), are not at first present, and probably do not appear until after the first meal. A discussion of the timeârelations of these various processes and consideration of the results of other investigations leads to the theory that metamorphosis is started by a single original stimulus, and though some amount of progress may follow from this, its completion appears to depend upon the serial development of other succeeding stimuli each responsible for some particular phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasement membrane 3ametamorphosis 3aenzymes 3aepithelial cells 3avacuoles 3aperitrophic membrane 3adelamination 3aVespa 3aperistalsis 3alarvae 3aphagocytosis 3aimagos 0aadults0 tProceedings of the Zoological Society of London.g1933 Sept., v. 103, no. 3 p.629-644dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0370-27747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.1933.tb01611.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010900156300001400265500002000279520107600299592002801375650001701403650001201420650001401432650001001446650001001456650001201466650002001478650001201498650002301510650001201533650001401545650001801559650002101577700002201598773012101620856007301741852000901814655001201823IND60590864620221121061952.0180314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059086462DNAL7 a10.1111/ens.122752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagai, Taiki10aIndividual variation in body color in the field cricket Teleogryllus occipitalis (Orthoptera: Gryllidae)  ap. 22-27.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBody color of animals may affect individual fitness through direct effects on various processes, such as predatory avoidance, thermoregulation, UV resistance, and mating behavior. Body color variation of the field cricket Teleogryllus occipitalis (Audinet‐Serville) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) is often observed. We quantified the individual variation in body color of this species by measuring the luminance of hind leg femur. Thereafter, we examined whether the body color was a heritable trait or not using parent–offspring analysis. In addition, the effect of body color of both parents on body size, sex ratio, and survival rate of progeny was investigated. The results showed that maternal body color was not heritable, whereas paternal body color was correlated with the body color of the progeny. Body size and sex ratio were not correlated with body color of parents. Although paternal body color did not affect the survival rate of the progeny beyond the stage of final instar nymph, progeny survival rate significantly increased with darkness of maternal body.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTeleogryllus 3aanimals 3abody size 3acolor 3afemur 3ainstars 3amating behavior 3aparents 3apredator avoidance 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3asurvival rate 3athermoregulation1 aKuriwada, Takashi0 tEntomological science.g2018 Mar., v. 21, no. 1 p.22-27dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774063x1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.122753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01975naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245007800170300001400248520105700262592002801319650001401347650000901361650001201370650001201382650001601394700001301410700001401423700001201437773008001449856008801529990002301617852000901640655001201649IND60096315220221123024508.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009631522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryogenics.2010.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, L.M.12aA novel effective suppression of natural convection in pulse tube coolers  ap. 85-89.  aDue to natural convection, the cooling performance of the pulse tube cooler (PTC) greatly degrades if the pulse tube cold-head is placed upward. In our previous study, it was found that the natural convection in the pulse tube can be well suppressed by inserting a certain number of circular screens. In this paper, a further detailed investigation into this suppression method are made, including the effect of number and material of screens, input acoustic power, and some other factors on suppressing natural convection at different inclination angles θ in the range of 0–180°. In our experiment of a single stage inline type PTC driven by a linear compressor, the orientation-dependence is considerably weakened with 6-layer copper screens in the pulse tube, in the cold temperature range of 40–80K. Moreover, the cooling performance deterioration at θ=0° induced by the inserted screens can be kept in an acceptable range. This novel suppression of natural convection greatly improves adaptability of pulse tube cryocoolers’ application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3acold 3acoolers 3acooling 3atemperature1 aHu, J.Y.1 aLuo, E.C.1 aDai, W.0 tCryogenics.g2011 Feb., v. 51, no. 2 p.85-89dElsevier Ltdx0011-22757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryogenics.2010.11.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245009100205300001800296500001900314520135700333592002801690650002201718650001701740650001401757650001601771650001201787650001201799650001201811650001401823650001901837650001301856650001501869650001301884653002201897653001501919653002201934700001401956700001401970700001801984700001902002773013302021856008502154852000902239655001202248IND60736661520221118002101.0210510e20210422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073666152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c007362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Leihao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6734-102710aProteomic Study Reveals Major Pathways Regulating the Development of Black Soldier Fly  ap. 2216-2223.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNowadays, biodegrading organic waste, as a solution to confront environmental challenges, has attracted wide attention. A dipteran insect, black soldier fly (BSF), exhibits outstanding capability to convert organic waste into proteins and lipid resources, and thus, much interest has been shown in it. However, information of fundamental biology of BSF is still limited besides its recycling efficiency. In this work, we present a complete proteomic database of BSF at all instars (before prepupa). We further formulated the pathways corresponding to BSF development and built a relationship with the current genetic database. To achieve this, we investigated the proteomics of BSF during different periods. We identified 5036 proteins, and among them, 3905 proteins were annotated in the protein function database. illustrated three pathways related to major physiological processes including the insulin signaling pathway for feeding and growth, fatty acid biosynthesis pathway for fatty acid using, and toll/immune deficiency pathway for immune behavior. The proteins in these three pathways were matched with a published genetic database, and this reference library could be used for future BSF genetic engineering. In conclusion, this work provided a comprehensive protein library of BSF and expands the basic knowledge of BSF for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3abiosynthesis 3adatabases 3afatty acids 3ainsects 3ainstars 3ainsulin 3alibraries 3aorganic wastes 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aresearch 0ablack soldier fly 0alife cycle 0asignaling pathway1 aWan, Quan1 aXu, Yalan1 aShen, Honglan1 aYang, Mingying0 tJournal of proteome research.g2021 Apr. 22, v. 20, no. 5 p.2216-2223dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c007363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009700172300001600269520106500285592002801350650001301378650002101391650002201412650002701434650001901461650001101480650001701491650001401508650001201522650003001534650001901564650001301583700002301596773009801619856008601717852000901803655001201812IND60125249720221120163800.0151103e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012524972DNAL7 a10.1893/0005-3155-84.3.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Christopher10aOverexpression of the kinetochore-associated proteins SKAP and astrin in human breast cancer  ap. 136-141.  aThe faithful alignment and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is essential for the prevention of aberrant chromosome numbers that can lead to cancer. This process is mediated by the mitotic spindle, which forms stable attachments to the chromosomal centromere through the kinetochore structural intermediate. Small kinetochore-associated protein (SKAP) is a recently described component to the kinetochore that complexes with other kinetochore-associated proteins including astrin, CENP-E, and CEP55. SKAP is required for proper chromosome segregation and the metaphase to anaphase transition as its depletion results in activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and mitotic delay. Here, we show that overexpression of SKAP in cultured cells speeds cell division in a colony formation assay. We also show that SKAP along with the interacting proteins CEP55 and astrin are overexpressed in human breast carcinoma. These data suggest that aberrant overexpression of SKAP and the astrin-SKAP complex may help facilitate the rapid growth of tumor cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaphase 3abreast neoplasms 3achromosome number 3achromosome segregation 3acultured cells 3ahumans 3akinetochores 3ametaphase 3amitosis 3amitotic spindle apparatus 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteins1 aBrooks, William S.0 tBios.g2013 Sept., v. 84, no. 3 p.136-141dBeta Beta Beta Biological Societyx0005-31557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1893/0005-3155-84.3.1363Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03948naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245006300196500002000259520222300279592002802502596005902530596008102589596008802670650002202758650001402780650001102794650001902805650001502824650001202839650000902851650001302860650001402873650001102887650001202898650001502910650001302925650001402938650001002952650001602962650001602978700005602994700005503050700005603105700005803161773013703219856007703356852000903433655001203442IND60795070320221119230017.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079507032DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JB0245172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1265-702910aThird‐Order Padé Thermoelastic Constants of Solid Rocks  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClassical third‐order thermoelastic constants are generally derived from the theory of small‐amplitude acoustic waves in isotropic materials during heat treatments. Investigating higher‐order thermoelastic constants for higher temperatures is challenging owing to the involvement of the number of unknown parameters. These Taylor‐type thermoelastic constants from the classical thermoelasticity theory are formulated based on the Taylor series of the Helmholtz free energy density for preheated crystals. However, these Taylor‐type thermoelastic models are limited even at low temperatures in characterizing the temperature‐dependent velocities of elastic waves in solid rocks as a polycrystal compound of different mineral lithologies. Thus, we propose using the Padé rational function to the total thermal strain energy function. The resulting Padé thermoelastic model gives a reasonable theoretical prediction for acoustic velocities of solid rocks at a higher temperature. We formulate the relationship between the third‐order Padé thermoelastic constants and the corresponding higher‐order Taylor thermoelastic constants with the same accuracy. Two additional Padé coefficients α1 ${\mathit{\alpha }}_{1}$ and α2 ${\mathit{\alpha }}_{2}$ can be calculated using the second‐, third‐, and fourth‐order Taylor thermoelastic constants associated with the Brugger's constants, which are consistent with those obtained by fitting the experimental data of polycrystalline material. The third‐order Padé thermoelastic model (with four constants) is validated by the fourth‐order Taylor thermoelastic prediction (with six constants) with ultrasonic measurements for polycrystals (olivine samples) and solid rocks (sandstone, granite, and shale). The results demonstrate that the third‐order Padé thermoelastic model can characterize thermally induced velocity changes more accurately than the conventional third‐order Taylor thermoelastic prediction (with four constants), especially for solid rocks at high temperatures. The Padé approximation could be considered a more accurate and universal model in describing thermally induced velocity changes for polycrystals and solid rocks.  aPublisher supplied data  a41821002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aB18055c111 Project “Deep‐Superdeep Oil & Gas Geophysical Exploration”  aXDA14010303cStrategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aGibbs free energy 3aacoustics 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ageophysics 3agranite 3aheat 3aisotropy 3alithology 3amodels 3aolivine 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asandstone 3ashale 3atemperature 3aultrasonics1 aFu, Li‐Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8692-84051 aFu, Bo‐Ye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1964-78541 aDeng, Wubing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7672-79491 aHan, Tongcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1009-36290 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Sept., v. 127, no. 9 p.e2022JB024517-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JB0245173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010300164300001200267520149600279592002801775650001001803650001301813650002901826650001601855650001001871650001301881650000701894650001501901650001301916650001301929650001801942650002701960650002101987650001402008650001302022651002102035651001002056700002702066700002602093773015102119856008202270852000902352655001202361IND60627808220221117223230.0190314e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062780822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-019-7247-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Pawan10aEvaluation of trophic status and its limiting factors in the Renuka Lake of Lesser Himalaya, India  ap. 105.  aThe present study is to evaluate trophic status and its limiting factors in the Renuka Lake, using surface water samples. The water of the lake is found to be slightly alkaline with pH 8.33–8.70 (avg. 8.61 ± 0.1). The turbidity 4.63–6.62 NTU (avg. 5.48 ± 0.63 NTU) indicated low level of clarity in the lake. The Carlson’s index based on the Secchi disc transparency (SD), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and total phosphorus (TP) has indicated that the Renuka Lake is turned hyper-eutrophic in status. The correlation coefficient has indicated that most parameters in the lake are contributed by different sources. Factor-1 marked 26.40% variance, which may be due to higher impact of rock weathering than the anthropogenic activities, whereas 18.56% variance shown by factor-2 may be due to natural and anthropogenic activities. However, factor-3 (14.38% variance) inferred that the higher contribution of Chl-a, pH, TDS, NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻, salinity, and SO₄²⁻ is due to major impacts of the anthropogenic activities. The inverse distance weighting method has indicated spatial interpolation and area of influence of different parameters in the lake. The “nutrient (TP) limited large sized algae” as well as phosphorus is considered as a major limiting factor for increasing productivity and trophic state index. The present study has inferred that the nutrient enrichment should be controlled to restore the Renuka Lake, owing to its social and ecological significances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aammonium 3aanthropogenic activities 3achlorophyll 3alakes 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphorus 3asalinity 3asulfates 3asurface water 3atotal dissolved solids 3atotal phosphorus 3aturbidity 3avariance 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aMahajan, Ambrish Kumar1 aMeena, Narendra Kumar0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 Feb., v. 191, no. 2 p.105-105dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7247-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01600naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003500141245019800176300001500374500001900389520032700408592002800735650001500763650002200778650001600800650001900816650001300835651000900848653001400857653001400871653001600885653001200901653002000913700001500933700002300948700002900971773011801000856007501118852000901193655001201202IND60697351320221118230749.0200605e20150907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069735132DNAL7 a10.3897/JHR.45.53132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeris-Felipo, Francisco Javier10aReview of the genus Aristelix Nixon, 1943 (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Alysiinae), with description of a new species from Iran and clarification of the status of Antrusachrysogastra (Tobias, 1986)  ap. 97-111.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe species of the Western Palaearctic genus Aristelix Nixon, 1943 are reviewed.

Although the etiology is not well understood, vitamin D deficiency may be involved. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on bone mass accrual in HIV-infected youth. DESIGN: Perinatally HIV-infected children were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D (100,000 IU cholecalciferol given every 2 mo) and calcium (1 g/d) (supplemented group) or double placebo (placebo group) for 2 y. The total-body bone mineral content (TBBMC), total-body bone mineral density (TBBMD), spine bone mineral content (SBMC), and spine bone mineral density (SBMD) were assessed by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and at 2 annual follow-up visits. RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants, aged 6–16 y, were randomly assigned to either the supplemented (n = 30) or the placebo (n = 29) group. At enrollment, supplemented and placebo groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, dietary intakes of vitamin D and calcium, mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, TBBMC, TBBMD, SBMC, or SBMD. Significant increases in serum 25(OH)D were observed in the supplemented group but not in the placebo group. TBBMC, TBBMD, SBMC, and SBMD increased significantly at 1 and 2 y in both groups. No between-group differences were observed at any time before or after adjustment for stage of sexual maturation by mixed linear model analysis. CONCLUSION: One gram of calcium per day and oral cholecalciferol at a dosage of 100,000 IU every 2 mo administered to HIV-infected children and adolescents did not affect bone mass accrual despite significant increases in serum 25(OH)D concentrations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00724178.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3abone density 3acalcium 3achildren 3acholecalciferol 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3alinear models 3amineral content 3aoral administration 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3aspine (bones) 3avitamin deficiencies 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdolescent 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aBone and Bonesxdrug effects 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aChild 2aCholecalciferolxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHIV Infectionsxcomplicationsxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxdrug therapyxetiology.1 aMcMahon, Donald J1 aAbrams, Elaine J.,1 aBamji, Mahrukh1 aPurswani, Murli1 aEngelson, Ellen S1 aHorlick, Mary1 aShane, Elizabeth0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2012 Mar., v. 95, no. 3 p.678-685dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.0247863Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245010800198500002000306520180800326592002802134596012302162650002002285650002502305650001302330650001002343650002002353650001602373650002902389650002402418700005502442700001902497700002102516700001902537700001802556700002002574700001602594773013002610856007502740852000902815655001202824IND60780742420221122060051.0220622e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078074242DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.222332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Dyke, Fred1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7903-818010aComparative detection, density, and reproductive performance of Kirtland's warbler in jack and red pine  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe formerly endangered Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) is among a growing number of conservation‐reliant species that depend on active management to avoid reverting to endangered status. Because the Kirtland's warbler is a habitat specialist of young, even‐aged jack pine (Pinus banksiana), managers of the recovery effort stressed creating new jack pine stands and monitoring numbers of singing males through an annual census using single visits to individual stands. Kirtland's warbler will occupy and breed in red pine (P. resinosa), but red pine has not been surveyed for Kirtland's warblers in the annual population census. Furthermore, the current monitoring approach cannot determine their species detection probability or individual detection probability, which is essential to evaluate both red pine use and the accuracy of the census. From 2016–2018 we estimated density and detection probabilities in jack pine and red pine stands through repeated visits to a limited number of stands rather than single visits to many stands. Estimates of species detection probability indicated that ≥1 male Kirtland's warbler would be detected on most sites when any were present, but individual detection probabilities were less and varied by stand type, indicating that single visits to sites would underestimate numbers and that accurate estimation of detection probability was important for estimation of density in different stand types. We offer quantitative estimates of detection probabilities for determination of Kirtland's warbler population size in jack pine versus red pine stands in the same areas and breeding seasons. Managers of Kirtland's warblers should incorporate detection probabilities into population surveys to achieve more accurate estimates of population size.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant Agreement Award F15AP00985cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act Program 3aPinus banksiana 3aSetophaga kirtlandii 3ahabitats 3amales 3apopulation size 3aprobability 3areproductive performance 3awildlife management1 aHarju, Seth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0444-78811 aHindy, Michael1 aCannata, Natalie1 aSchmidt, Emily1 aHillman, Erin1 aSargent, Alyssa1 aKeas, Brian0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2022 July, v. 86, no. 5 p.e22233-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.222333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245012500174300001800299520193700317592002802254650002202282650001202304650001902316650002202335650002202357650002102379650002002400650001002420650002102430650001102451650002502462650001802487650001302505650005202518650001002570650002902580650002602609650003102635700002402666773011902690856005502809852000902864655001202873IND4510095220221116144215.0150730e20010415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451009522DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02124.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLimesand, Sean W.10aNovel activator proteinâ2Î± spliceâvariants function as transactivators of the ovine placental lactogen gene  ap. 2390-2401.  aActivator proteinâ2 (APâ2) has been implicated as a transactivator of the human and ovine placental lactogen (oPL) genes. Transcriptional enhancement through an APâ2âcisâacting element has been described for other genes expressed in the placenta, but the APâ2 isoform enhancing expression is species dependent. Transactivation of the oPL minimal promoter (â124âbp to +16âbp) by APâ2 was confirmed by mutational analysis in transiently transfected human choriocarcinoma cells (BeWo). APâ2Î± was localized in ovine chorionic epithelial cells by immunohistochemistry and a 3âkb transcript was identified by Northern hybridization. Four nearly fullâlength APâ2 cDNAs were isolated from an ovine placenta cDNA library. Nucleotide sequencing these cDNAs revealed that the APâ2 mRNA expressed in the ovine placenta shares identity with human APâ2Î±, but variations in the predicted Nâterminus were observed, and three unique APâ2Î± spliceâvariants were identified. Expression of APâ2Î± variants in HepG2 cells, devoid of endogenous APâ2, indicates that enhancement through the APâ2 element in the oPL gene minimal promoter was variant dependent. RNA transcripts for all of the ovine APâ2Î± spliceâvariants were confirmed in ovine placenta by RTâPCR, and homologs for two variants were found in human placenta. However, only one APâ2Î± transcript, which shares identity to Xenopus APâ2Î±, was expressed in BeWo cells. Immunoblot analysis confirmed APâ2Î± variants in ovine chorionic binucleate cell nuclear extracts, one of which migrates similar to the APâ2Î± variant identified in BeWo cell nuclear extracts. These data indicate the presence of new mammalian APâ2Î± spliceâvariants that augment transactivation of the oPL gene in ovine chorionic binucleate cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorthern blotting 3aXenopus 3acDNA libraries 3achoriomammotropin 3acomplementary DNA 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3aplacenta 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asheep 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation1 aAnthony, Russell V.0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 Apr. 15, v. 268, no. 8 p.2390-2401dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02124.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010300208300001800311520177400329592002802103650002202131650001702153650002302170650001102193650001902204650001202223650001202235650001402247650001102261650001802272650001302290650001502303650002102318650001102339651001902350651001702369700006102386773012002447856008202567852000902649655001202658IND60744384020221121025911.0210713e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074438402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-021-00595-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoleman, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1413-822210aNitrogen credit trading as an incentive for riparian buffer establishment on Pennsylvania farmland  ap. 1033-1045.  aAgricultural nitrogen loading is a leading cause of eutrophication within the Chesapeake Bay. Agriculture in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is responsible for a large portion of the nitrogen load entering the bay. Vegetated riparian buffers are a common agroforestry practice used to intercept surface runoff and subsurface leaching of nutrients such as nitrogen from upland agricultural fields. Watershed-wide nutrient credit trading has been suggested as a mechanism for reducing nutrient pollution entering the Chesapeake Bay. The cost of producing nitrogen credits through the establishment of riparian buffers on Pennsylvania farmland was analyzed to determine if nitrogen credit trading could provide an incentive for buffer establishment. Forest buffers were shown to have marginally lower nitrogen credit production costs and payback periods than grass filter strips. Larger riparian buffers were shown to have higher credit production costs than smaller buffers due to increases in establishment costs outpacing increases in nitrogen credit trading revenue. Nitrogen credit trading was determined to be an inadequate incentive for agricultural riparian buffer establishment due to the high cost of producing nitrogen credits. Furthermore, nitrogen credit trading was shown to be less lucrative compared to the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a common riparian buffer cost share program. However, increases in the market price of nitrogen credits or bundling nitrogen with other nutrient credits such as phosphorus could ultimately result in credit trading providing an adequate incentive for agricultural riparian buffer establishment. These results could be used to guide the framework for nutrient credit trading programs within other watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagroforestry 3aconservation areas 3acredit 3aeutrophication 3aforests 3agrasses 3ahighlands 3aincome 3amarket prices 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3ariparian buffers 3arunoff 3aChesapeake Bay 3aPennsylvania1 aJacobson, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0336-45340 tAgroforestry systems.g2021 Aug., v. 95, no. 6 p.1033-1045dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34245x0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-021-00595-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012000165300001800285500001900303520182900322592002802151650002202179650001102201650001502212650001702227650001902244650001302263650001802276650003102294650002402325650001202349650001602361650001102377650001302388650001602401650001302417650001502430650001702445650001302462650002402475650001102499650002002510650002902530650001102559653002602570653001902596653001302615653001202628653000802640700001902648700001402667700001702681700002802698700001802726700001402744700005502758773013302813856008502946852000903031655001203040IND60736661820221118002047.0210510e20210329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073666182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c007762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hao10aHormonal Regulation of Reproductive Diapause That Occurs in the Year-Round Mass Rearing of Bombus terrestris Queens  ap. 2240-2250.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAdult reproductive diapause is an adaptive strategy under adverse environments for insects and other arthropod species, including bumblebees, which enables queens to survive through a harsh winter and then build new colonies in the following spring. Little research has been done on the molecular regulatory mechanism of reproductive diapause in Bombus terrestris, which is an important pollinator of wild plants and crops. Our previous research identified the conditions that induced reproductive diapause during the year-round mass rearing of B. terrestris. Here, we performed combined transcriptomics and proteomics analyses of reproductive diapause in B. terrestris during and after diapause at three different ecophysiological phases, diapause, postdiapause, and founder postdiapause. The analyses showed that differentially expressed proteins/genes acted in the citrate cycle, insect hormone biosynthesis, insulin and mTOR signaling pathway. To further understand the mechanisms that regulated the reproductive diapause, genes involved in the regulation of JH synthesis, insulin/TOR signal pathway were determined. The BtRheb, BtTOR, BtVg, and BtJHAMT had lower expression levels in diapause queens. The JH III titer levels and the activities of the metabolic enzymes were significantly up-regulated in postdiapause queens. Also, after the microinjection of insulin-like peptides (ILPs) and JH analogue (JHA), hormones, cold-tolerance metabolites, metabolic enzymes, and reproduction showed significant changes. Together with results from other related research, a model of the regulation of reproductive diapause during the year-round mass rearing of B. terrestris was proposed. This study contributes to a comprehensive insight into the molecular regulatory mechanism of reproductive diapause in eusocial insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus terrestris 3aadults 3aarthropods 3abiosynthesis 3acold tolerance 3adiapause 3aecophysiology 3agene expression regulation 3ahormonal regulation 3ainsulin 3ametabolites 3amodels 3apeptides 3apollinators 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3areproduction 3aresearch 3asignal transduction 3aspring 3atranscriptomics 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3awinter 0areproductive diapause 0asocial insects 0ahormones 0aRNA-seq 0aTMT1 aWu, Guang’an1 aZhou, Hao1 aDai, Xiaoyan1 aSteeghs, Nicolaas W.

However, different T. grandis landraces vary significantly in their fatty acid and oil contents, and their molecular regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate the molecular basis of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and oil body formation in T. grandis kernels, transcriptome sequencing were performed based on the Illumina platform in ten different T. grandis landraces. In total, 112,699 unigenes were identified, among them, 175 unigenes related to lipid biosynthesis were found, including 126 unigenes for fatty acid biosynthesis, 37 unigenes for triacylglycerol assembly and 12 unigenes for oil body proteins. The correlation analysis between the oil content and the expression levels of unigenes suggested that biotin carboxylase, acyl-ACP thioesterase A and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase may play key roles in oil accumulation. Three candidate genes (TgOLEO1, TgCLO1 and TgSLO1) encoding oil body-associated proteins were further identified through phylogenetic analysis and amino acid sequence alignment. Further subcellular localization assay indicated that all of the proteins were localized in both of endoplasmic reticulum and oil body. Compared with wild type, oil body proteins transiently over-expressed tobacco leaves had a higher abundance of oil bodies. Furthermore, the candidate regulatory genes (including TgWRI1, TgFUS3, etc.) that may be involved in the regulation of lipid biosynthesis were also identified. This study will be critical for the molecular assisted screening and breeding of high content of oil and unsaturated fatty acids cultivars for T. grandis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTorreya grandis 3aamino acid sequences 3abiosynthesis 3abiotin 3acultivars 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3alandraces 3aleaves 3alipid bodies 3alipid content 3alipid metabolism 3aoils 3aphylogeny 3aplant breeding 3aproteins 3aregulator genes 3ascreening 3aseeds 3asequence alignment 3atobacco 3atranscriptomics 3atransferases 3atrees 3atriacylglycerols 3aunigenes 3aunsaturated fatty acids 0aDAG 0aTAGs 0aACCase 0aACP 0aKAS 0aKAR 0aHAD 0aENR 0aFAT 0aLACS 0aG3P 0aGPAT 0aLPAT 0aPAP 0aDGAT 0aPDAT 0aFAME 0aFPKM 0aDAF 0aLEC1 0aWRI1 0aFUS3 0aLipid 0aOil biosynthesis 0aOil body-associated proteins 0aTranscriptome1 aLou, Heqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2454-098X1 aChen, Wenchao1 aZhou, Ying1 aZhang, Zihao1 aXiao, Minghui1 aWang, Zhanqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7953-61281 aYang, Yi1 aYang, Lei1 aZhang, Feicui1 aWu, Jiasheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2515-46771 aSong, Lili0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Mar., v. 145 p.112051-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.1120513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245007800178300001600256520100600272592002801278650002101306650001501327650001401342650002201356650002101378650001401399650001301413650001301426650001601439650001201455700002101467700002001488773010901508856008201617852000901699655001201708IND60588882920221119222251.0191003e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058888292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-017-1465-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillberg-Keyriläinen, Pia10aProduction of cellulose carbamate using urea-based deep eutectic solvents  ap. 195-204.  aCellulose carbamate is a bio-based, biodegradable, and environmentally friendly material and thus an interesting alternative to petroleum-based polymers or fibers from cellulose produced using the viscose process for producing fibers from cellulose. In this study we described an efficient and green method to prepare cellulose carbamates by using deep eutectic solvents. Three different urea-based deep eutectic solvents were used with different molar ratios and cellulose consistency. Nitrogen content of cellulose carbamates increases when cellulose consistency increases from 5 to 20%. Also, the reaction temperature affects the nitrogen content. In addition, the cellulose crystallinity decreases during the carbamation reaction with 20% cellulose consistency using any of the three deep eutectic solvents studied, when the sample is processed in a high-consistency reactor. By selecting suitable parameters, the nitrogen content of cellulose carbamates can be easily adjusted to a desired level.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acarbamates 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3anitrogen content 3apetroleum 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aviscose1 aHiltunen, Jaakko1 aRopponen, Jarmo0 tCellulose.g2018 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.195-204dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-017-1465-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245009400169300001400263520121800277592002801495650001101523650001901534650001901553650001601572650002501588650001601613700001601629700001901645700002601664700002801690700001801718700001701736700001901753773011101772856004801883852000901931655001201940IND4472420720221120103447.0120416e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447242072DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-011-0515-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzdemir, Hüseyin,10aQuantification of the urban heat island under a changing climate over Anatolian Peninsula  ap. 31-38.  aThe Anatolian Peninsula is located at the confluence of Europe, Asia, and Africa and houses 81 cities of which 79 of them have population over 100,000. We employed some criteria to select the cities from the 81 cities. After accomplishing all the criteria, eight cities were remaining for the study. Nonparametric Mann–Kendall test procedure was employed for the urban and rural stations of these cities to detect the long-term change in temperature trends. Statistical analysis of daily minimum temperatures for the period between 1965 and 2006 suggest that there is no statistically significant increase in rural areas. In contrast to the findings of the previous studies, however, all the urban sites and difference between urban and rural pairs show significant increase in temperatures, a strong indication for the existence of urban heat island (UHI) affect over the region. Regional Climate Model was also utilized to assess the changes in temperature by the end of century for the region. The findings suggest that an increase of up to 5°C is possible. Climate change effects enforced with UHI have the potential to cause serious problems for the entire region and hence needs to be studied thoroughly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3arural areas 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature1 aUnal, Alper1 aKindap, Tayfun1 aTuruncoglu, Ufuk Utku1 aDurmusoglu, Zeynep Okay1 aKhan, Maudood1 aTayanc, Mete1 aKaraca, Mehmet0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2012 Apr., v. 108, no. 1-2 p.31-38dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-011-0515-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245012200170300001400292500002000306520138500326592002801711650001501739650001901754650002501773650001901798650001901817650002601836650001401862650002101876650001501897650001601912650002001928650002101948650001001969650001201979650001301991700002602004700001902030773012102049856007302170852000902243655001202252IND60590865120221121031207.0180314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059086512DNAL7 a10.1111/ens.122742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi‐Namaghi, Hussein10aAphid suitability for the predatory hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus altered with elevating atmospheric CO2 and sinigrin  ap. 12-21.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe fitness of natural enemies should be altered in response to changes in herbivore quality induced by the impact of increased atmospheric CO₂ levels on plants. We studied the effect of different CO₂ levels on the aphid predator Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer fed either specialist or generalist aphids reared on either of two host plants under laboratory conditions. In the host plant that contains sinigrin (black mustard), elevated CO₂ increased the sinigrin content of both host plant and the specialist aphid, but reduced the already very low levels in the generalist aphid. Predator development time increased with elevated CO₂, while fecundity decreased. Consequently, individual fitness decreased slightly with increasing atmospheric CO₂. Sinigrin significantly decreased fecundity and increased development time of the predator. As a result, fitness was significantly lower too. The consumption rate was influenced significantly by plant and prey solely and the interactions of host plant × prey type and CO₂ level × prey type. Further research on the effects of climate change parameters (e.g. greenhouse gases such as CO₂, ozone (O₃) and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), etc.) separately and jointly under controlled environmental conditions will help to understand the nature and direction of their effects on natural enemies as part of the tritrophic system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aBrassica nigra 3aEpisyrphus balteatus 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3afecundity 3agreenhouse gases 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3anatural enemies 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3arearing 3asinigrin1 aAmiri‐Jami, Alireza1 aShoor, Mahmoud0 tEntomological science.g2018 Mar., v. 21, no. 1 p.12-21dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774063x1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.122743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009700163300001600260520147400276592002801750650001801778650001301796650001201809650001101821650001301832650000901845650001501854650001401869650001301883650001801896650002301914650001401937651001101951700002201962773012601984856004802110852000902158655001202167IND4487515320221116144231.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448751532DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590110800482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlenev, G. V.10aDynamics of sex ratio in populations of cyclomorphic mammals (rodentia, cricetidae, muridae)  ap. 797-808.  aUsing the result of long-term monitoring (over 30 years) of the main population parameters of cyclomorphic mammals (genera Clethrionomys, Microtus, and Sylvaemus) in the Ilâmen Reserve (Chelyabinsk oblast, the Southern Urals), the phenomenology of the sex ratio and its dynamics in their natural populations are analyzed. The main factors potentially influencing the sex structure of rodents are considered, including isolation of settlements, relative abundance, population density, species-specific features, alternative types of ontogeny, exposure to extreme factors, sex-dependent asynchronous mortality, and age cross. It is shown that the analysis of sex structure in rodents should be performed taking into account the type of their ontogeny, with the CMR method (capture-marking-recapture) giving the most objective estimate of the sex ratio. An alternative approach is to analyze samples taken in autumn to winter, after the end of breeding and elimination of reproductive individuals from the population. It is concluded that the dynamics of the sex structure in murine rodents are conditioned ecologically and that no selective elimination of individuals depending on sex takes place upon overwintering. The sex ratio in cyclomorphic mammals is a variable parameter that fluctuates about the average value depending on both regular and random factors. Methodological recommendations are given for the assessment of sex structure in cyclomorphic mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClethrionomys 3aMicrotus 3aMuridae 3aautumn 3abreeding 3amice 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aontogeny 3aoverwintering 3apopulation density 3asex ratio 3aRussia1 aGrigorkina, E.

Additionally, castor bean petioles and inflorescences have extra floral nectary (EFN) glands that secrete sugars that also attract ants, which in return, defend against herbivores. We propose that in order to attract ants, castor bean would have to balance allocation of energy toward plant defense and seed dispersal per the Principle of Allocation. Specifically, we hypothesized that in castor bean, an increase in elaiosome size would correspond to result in a decrease in EFN gland size. We examined proportion of elaiosome:seed (by weight) investment relative to the EFN gland size on a given castor bean plant. We found that elaiosome weight was not correlated with EFN gland area (p = 0.1542), and report a one to five fold range in elaiosome investment across 34 plants. We present a range of environmental factors contributing to the observed variation in elaiosome investment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aRicinus communis 3aappendages 3acastor beans 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aherbivores 3ainsect larvae 3alipids 3anectaries 3apetioles 3aseed dispersal 3asugars 3aCalifornia1 aLiceaga, Lisa1 aCarmona-Galindo, Víctor D.0 tBios.g2013 Sept., v. 84, no. 3 p.180-183dBeta Beta Beta Biological Societyx0005-31557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1893/0005-3155-84.3.1803Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245009500207300001800302500001900320520146900339592002801808650001501836650001501851650002401866650001601890650001901906650001401925650001801939650002001957650001401977650002601991650001202017650002202029650001602051650001302067650001402080650001802094653001402112653001002126653000902136653002302145653002302168700006102191700002102252700006802273700006102341773013302402856008502535852000902620655001202629IND60736662120210615000000.0210510e20210326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073666212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c008162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDayon, Loïc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8499-270X10aProteomics of Human Milk: Definition of a Discovery Workflow for Clinical Research Studies  ap. 2283-2290.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMilk is a complex biological fluid composed mainly of water, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and diverse bioactive factors. Human milk represents a unique tailored source of nutrients that adapts during lactation to the specific needs of the developing infant. Proteins in milk have been studied for decades, and proteomics, peptidomics, and glycoproteomics are the main approaches previously deployed to decipher the proteome of human milk. In the present work, we aimed at implementing a highly automated pipeline for the proteomic analysis of human milk with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS). Commercial human milk samples were used to evaluate and optimize workflows. Centrifugation for defatting milk samples was assessed before and after reduction, alkylation, and enzymatic digestion of proteins, without and with presence of surfactants. Skimmed milk samples were analyzed using isobaric labeling-based quantitative MS on an Orbitrap Tribrid mass spectrometer. Sample fractionation using isoelectric focusing was also evaluated to more deeply profile the human milk proteome. Finally, the most appropriate workflow was transferred to a liquid handling workstation for automated sample preparation. In conclusion, we have defined and describe herein an efficient highly automated proteomic workflow for human milk sample analysis. It is compatible with clinical research, possibly allowing the analysis of sufficiently large cohorts of samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3aautomation 3abiomedical research 3abreast milk 3acentrifugation 3adefatting 3afractionation 3aglycoproteomics 3alactation 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3apeptidomics 3aproteome 3askim milk 3aspectrometers 0abiomarker 0ahuman 0amilk 0aproteome profiling 0asample preparation1 aMacron, Charlotte1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0248-43821 aLahrichi, Sabine1 aNúñez Galindo, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2619-44751 aAffolter, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1568-45160 tJournal of proteome research.g2021 Mar. 26, v. 20, no. 5 p.2283-2290dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c008163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01854naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245013300165520086600298592002801164650001701192650003101209650001601240650002001256650001201276650002101288650001301309700002301322773012001345856007801465852000901543655001201552IND60745574120221121061311.0210723e20210623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074557412DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100712752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamoi, Masahiro 10aCP12 Is Involved in Protection against High Light Intensity by Suppressing the ROS Generation in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942  aWe previously reported that CP12 formed a complex with GAPDH and PRK and regulated the activities of these enzymes and the Calvin–Benson cycle under dark conditions as the principal regulatory system in cyanobacteria. More interestingly, we found that the cyanobacterial CP12 gene-disrupted strain was more sensitive to photo-oxidative stresses such as under high light conditions and paraquat treatment. When a mutant strain that grew normally under low light was subjected to high light conditions, decreases in chlorophyll and photosynthetic activity were observed. Furthermore, a large amount of ROS was accumulated in the cells of the CP12 gene-disrupted strain. These data suggest that CP12 also functions under light conditions and may be involved in protection against oxidative stress by controlling the flow of electrons from Photosystem I to NADPH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalvin cycle 3aSynechococcus sp.

Lesions were similar in both species and were characterized by spongiform transformation of gray matter, intracytoplasmic vacuolation of neurons, neuronal degeneration and loss, astrocytic hypertrophy and hyperplasia, occurrence of amyloid plaques, and absence of significant inflammatory response. Distribution and severity of lesions were evaluated at 57 locations; there were only minor differences between deer and elk. Consistent, severe lesions occurred in olfactory tubercle and cortex, hypothalamus, and the parasympathetic vagal nucleus of deer, and sections examined from these regions would be sufficient to establish a diagnosis of chronic wasting disease. Lesions were milder in these locations in elk but were sufficiently apparent to be of diagnostic value. Other differences included increased severity of lesions in some thalamic nuclei in elk in contrast to deer, the occurrence of amyloid plaques demonstrable by hematoxylin and eosin and histochemical stains in deer in contrast to elk, and the presence of mild white matter lesions in elk but not in deer. Lesions of chronic wasting disease were qualitatively comparable to those of scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, transmissible mink encephalopathy, and the human spongiform encephalopathies. Topographic distribution and lesion severity of chronic wasting disease were most similar to those of scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Duration of clinical disease did not significantly influence lesion distribution or severity in either species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus hemionus 3aCervus elaphus 2aAnimals 2aBrainxpathology 2aDeer 2aDiencephalonxpathology 2aMesencephalonxpathology 2aPrion Diseasesxpathologyxveterinary. 2aTelencephalonxpathology 0aCentral nervous system 0aCervus elaphus nelsoni 0aelk 0amule deer 0aOdocoileus hemionus 0aspongiform encephalopathy1 aYoung, S.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 30, no. 1 p.36-45dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985893030001053Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02817naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245012900208300001600337520139000353592002801743596006501771650002301836650001201859650001601871650002901887650001601916650001501932650002101947650001501968650003101983650001102014650001202025650001002037650001202047650001002059650001002069651001502079651002502094700001602119700002402135773010702159856008402266852000902350655001202359IND60630034020221123024947.0190215e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063003402DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-07-18-0252-FI2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunney, Leonard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4315-369413aAn Experimental Test of the Host-Plant Range of Nonrecombinant Strains of North American Xylella fastidiosa subsp. multiplex  ap. 294-300.  aNonrecombinant strains of Xylella fastidiosa subsp. multiplex (those lacking evidence of significant intersubspecific homologous recombination) infect the xylem of a wide range of native and nonnative trees in North America. However, the degree to which different strains have a specialized host range remains poorly understood. We tested eight strains isolated from five different tree species (almond, olive, sweetgum, and plum in California and oak in Washington, DC). Experiments were conducted in greenhouses in Riverside, CA, and each strain was tested on 11 to 15 of the 17 plant species tested. Hosts infected by the most strains were plum (5 of 8 strains) and almond (4 of 8), while their congener peach was only infected by 1 of 8. No strains infected oleander or mulberry. All strains successfully infected their original host, with peach, olive (1 of 7), and sweetgum (2 of 6) only infected by such strains. Of the 90 total strain–novel-host combinations tested, 11 resulted in unambiguous infection, 2 gave ambiguous results, and the remaining 77 failed to result in symptoms or bacterial spread. All eight strains had a unique host range, including two pairs of strains with the same multilocus sequence typing sequence type, providing strong evidence of extensive plant-host specialization. There was little evidence that host relatedness was driving host specificity.  aPublisher supplied data  a2007-55605-17834cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aalmonds 3agreenhouses 3ahomologous recombination 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3amulberries 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aolives 3apeaches 3aplums 3astrains 3atrees 3axylem 3aCalifornia 3aDistrict of Columbia1 aAzad, Hamid1 aStouthamer, Richard0 tPhytopathology.g2019 Feb., v. 109, no. 2 p.294-300dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-07-18-0252-FI3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245014500163300001400308520178600322592002802108650001102136650002202147650002502169653001102194653002202205653002502227700001802252700001602270700001402286700001702300700001702317773010402334852000902438856008202447655001202529IND9302194920221119080322.0181009e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930219492DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985893030001062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaniyama, H.10aSpontaneous Diabetes Mellitus in Young Cattle: Histologic, Immunohistochemical, and Electron Microscopic Studies of the Islets of Langerhans  ap. 46-54.  aPathomorphologic studies were carried out on three cases of bovine diabetes mellitus with clinical signs of polydipsia, polyuria, severe emaciation, glycosuria, persistent hyperglycemia, and decreased glucose tolerance. At necropsy, two animals had atrophy of the pancreas, whereas other visceral organs, including the endocrine organs, showed no significant changes. Microscopically, there was atrophy and reduced numbers of pancreatic islets accompanied by interlobular and interacinar fibrosis and compensatory enlargement of some remaining islets. Lymphocytes were observed commonly around and within atrophic islets and occasionally around and within enlarged islets. Vacuolar degeneration with occasional accumulation of glycogen granules was observed in the β-cells of these enlarged islets. Immunohistochemical studies of atrophic islets demonstrated complete loss of β-cells or only a few small β-cells. There also was a corresponding decrease in the number of cells that stained with anti-glucagon (α-cells) or anti-somatostatin (δ-cells) antibodies. The vacuolated cells in the enlarged islets stained strongly with anti-insulin antibody (β-cells). Ultrastructurally, the majority of cells in the atrophic islets had reduced cytoplasmic volume and few secretory granules, features consistent with α-cells. In contrast, enlarged islets that had prominent immunohistochemical staining for insulin (β-cells) consisted of β-cells with cytosolic edema, mitochondrial swelling, dilated smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and reduced numbers of or degranulated secretory granules. These pathomorphologic features found in cattle are similar to those found in juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in human beings and suggest autoimmune involvement in diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3adiabetes mellitus 3aislets of Langerhans 0aCattle 0adiabetes mellitus 0aimmunohistochemistry1 aShirakawa, T.1 aFuruoka, H.1 aOsame, S.1 aKitamura, N.1 aMiyazawa, K.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 30, no. 1 p.46-54dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985893030001063Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02751naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245011900183300001600302520114200318592002801460650001401488650000901502650002001511650001401531650000901545650003301554650001201587650005501599650003701654650003001691650001101721650001401732650001901746650003901765650003501804650004701839650001401886650003801900650000901938650002501947700001801972700001901990700002002009700001802029773012902047856004802176852000902224655001202233IND4474474520221119015352.0120712e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447447452DNAL7 a226179482pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-012-0683-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hong-Sen10aDetrimental Effects of Maternal Lead Exposure during Pregnancy and Lactation on Molar Development in the Young Rat  ap. 240-244.  aThe purpose of this animal study was to investigate the influence of maternal lead exposure during pregnancy and lactation on molar development in the offspring. Scanning electron microscopy revealed no significant differences in the molar morphology among the groups.

Further, the experimental groups had smaller molar diameters than the control group, lead exposure during lactation had a greater influence on the molar size in the offspring, and the groups with the higher dose of lead exposure during pregnancy and lactation had significantly smaller molar sizes than the groups that received the lower dose. The mesiodistal and buccolingual diameters of molars were measured as 3.10 ± 0.07 and 1.95 ± 0.04 mm for control group, 2.97 ± 0.08 and 1.94 ± 0.01 mm for lactation group of low dose, 2.96 ± 0.05 and 1.84 ± 0.02 mm for lactation group of high dose, 3.09 ± 0.06 and 1.94 ± 0.04 mm for pregnancy group of low dose, and 3.02 ± 0.06 and 1.85 ± 0.06 mm for pregnancy group of high dose, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3alactation 3alead 3amaternal effect 3apregnancy 3arats 3ascanning electron microscopy 2aAnimals 2aDental Enamelxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrinking Waterxchemistry 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLeadxtoxicity 2aMaternal Exposurexadverse effects 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMolarxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPregnancy 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aTsai, Yu-Chen1 aChen, Ker-Kong1 aTseng, Yu-Chuan1 aHsu, Kun-Jung0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2012 Aug., v. 89, no. 2 p.240-244dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-012-0683-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006500144245012000209500002000329520132500349592002801674650000901702650001501711650001401726650001801740650001001758650001601768650001501784650000901799650001901808650000901827700004101836700001801877700002501895700002201920700001901942700002201961773014001983856007902123852000902202655001202211IND60780743120221122060115.0220622e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078074312DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2021008722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhodorova, Nadezda V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5099-251X10aConsumption of Boiled, but Not Grilled, Roasted, or Barbecued Beef Modifies the Urinary Metabolite Profiles in Rats  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSCOPE: The consumption of processed meat is associated with increased risk of chronic diseases, but determining how the exposure to specific cooking processes alters the metabolome is an analytical challenge. This study aims to evaluate the impact of four typical cooking methods for beef (boiling, barbecuing, grilling, and roasting) on the urinary metabolite profiles in rats, using a non‐targeted approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male Wistar rats (n = 48) are fed for 3 weeks with experimental diets containing either raw or cooked (boiled, barbecued, grilled, and roasted) beef. A control group is fed with milk proteins. The 24 h‐urines are analyzed using LC‐MS. The consumption of boiled meat leads to the specific excretion of di‐ and tri‐peptides (aspartyl‐leucine, glycyl‐aspartate, and aspartyl‐prolyl‐threonine) and a cyclo‐prolyl‐proline (p < 0.001). No singular metabolite specifically associated with the groups “grilled,” “roasted,” and “barbecued” meat is observed. CONCLUSION: Urinary metabolite profiles of rats fed boiled beef are clearly distinct from those of rats fed with raw, grilled, roasted, or barbecued beef. The specific metabolites include the products of non‐digested proteins and may be useful as potential intake biomarkers of this meat cooking method.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abiomarkers 3aexcretion 3afood research 3amales 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3amilk 3aprocessed meat 3arisk1 aJouan‐Rimbaud Bouveresse, Delphine1 aPilard, Serge1 aCordella, Christophe1 aLocquet, Nathalie1 aOberli, Marion1 aGaudichon, Claire0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2022 June, v. 66, no. 12 p.e2100872-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2021008723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012600164300001600290520080100306592002801107596005901135596005901194596005901253596007801312596008201390596008801472596008801560596007001648596007001718650001401788650002701802650001301829650001801842650001401860650001601874650000901890650001701899700001601916700001801932700001601950700001801966700001601984700001702000773010902017856008202126852000902208655001202217IND60588883520221119222533.0191003e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058888352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-017-1545-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Kezheng10aCellulose nanofibers/silk fibroin nanohybrid sponges with highly ordered and multi-scale hierarchical honeycomb structure  ap. 429-437.  aHighly ordered cellulose nanofibers/silk fibroin nanohybrid (CSN) honeycomb materials with multi-scale hierarchical architectures are successfully prepared from CSN hydrogel precursors using unidirectional freeze-drying technique. Cellulose nanofibers have an outstanding highly ordered honeycomb structure-directing function in composite hydrogel. However, silk fibroin does not have such function. Therefore, the properties of the CSN sponges can be effectively adjusted by simple changing the ratio of cellulose nanofibers to silk fibroin. When the content of silk fibroin reaches 50%, the CSN-50 sponge exhibits a nearly perfect highly ordered honeycomb structure with multi-scale hierarchical architectures. And the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area is about 120 m² g⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data  a21501154cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21601162cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21471135cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a16A430031cImportant Research Project at the University of Henan Province  a152102210352cthe Project of Henan Province Science and Technology Department  a2014BSJJ059cDoctoral Research Foundation of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry  a2014BSJJ060cDoctoral Research Foundation of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry  a2015XJJZ030cFoundation of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry  a2015XJJY004cFoundation of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3afibroins 3afreeze drying 3ahydrogels 3ananohybrids 3asilk 3asurface area1 aGuo, Yaqing1 aNiu, Qingyuan1 aHan, Lifeng1 aZhang, Linsen1 aZhang, Yong1 aWang, Lizhen0 tCellulose.g2018 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.429-437dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-017-1545-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002100164245005600185300001400241520114300255592002801398650000901426650002401435650002101459650001201480650004301492650000901535650005001544650006001594650001101654650002801665650007701693650000901770650004701779653000901826653001901835653002601854653002901880653002301909700001501932773010401947852000902051856008202060655001202142IND9302195020221119080203.0181009e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930219502DNAL7 a84423292pmid7 a10.1177/0300985893030001082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCracken, M.

The cats ranged in age from 1 to 10 years, and 6/11 cats were male. One to three heartworms were present in the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries of each of the 11 cats. Patchy areas of rugose thickening of the intima of the pulmonary trunk and marked villous endarteritis of lobar and medium-sized pulmonary arteries were observed. Affected larger vessels were partially occluded by large villous intimal proliferations that were lined by hyperplastic endothelial cells supported by connective tissue stroma. Moderate to marked infiltration of eosinophils and mononuclear inflammatory cells was consistently observed in the intima of affected larger pulmonary arteries. Thrombosis of pulmonary arteries was seen in five cats. Medial hypertrophy, mild intimal proliferative changes, and focal infiltrations of leukocytes were seen in small pulmonary arteries. Lesions indicative of right-sided heart failure consisting of right ventricular dilation and chronic passive congestion of the liver were observed in four cats.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3aDirofilaria immitis 3apulmonary artery 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxparasitologyxpathology. 2aCats 2aDirofilaria immitisxisolation & purification 2aDirofilariasisxcomplicationsxparasitologyxpathology. 2aFemale 2aHyperplasiaxveterinary 2aLung Diseases, Parasiticxetiologyxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPulmonary Arteryxparasitologyxpathology. 0aCats 0adirofilariasis 0afeline dirofilariasis 0afeline heartworm disease 0apulmonary arteries1 aPatton, S.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 30, no. 1 p.64-69dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985893030001083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01765naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245011600162300001600278520067100294592002800965650001600993650001401009650001101023650001201034650001701046650002001063650001601083650002301099650001101122650002101133650001001154650001901164650001301183650001001196700001601206773009001222856004601312852000901358655001201367IND4477817420221119015156.0120727e200010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447781742DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10267165290022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalatayud, Á.10aFoliar Spraying with Zineb Increases Fruit Productivity and Alleviates Oxidative Stress in Two Tomato Cultivars  ap. 149-154.  aThe effects of foliar spraying of the dithiocarbamate zineb on two cultivars of tomato grown in the field in a site with high ozone concentrations were studied by means of biomass assessment, antioxidant enzyme assays, lipid peroxidation, and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Zineb prevented the peroxidation of membrane lipids and decreased the activity of scavenging enzymes, which suggests that plants sprayed with zineb are subjected to lower oxidative stress than controls. The beneficial effects of zineb protection is the utilization of a larger fraction of absorbed radiant energy in photosynthesis and a larger fruit yield in plants of both cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3afoliar spraying 3afruit yield 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3aoxidative stress 3aozone 3aphotosynthesis 3atomatoes 3azineb1 aBarreno, E.0 tPhotosynthetica.g2000 Oct., v. 38, no. 1 p.149-154dSpringer-Verlagx0300-36047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026716529002  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245014800165500002000313520126700333592002801600596008401628596009501712650002701807650002801834650002501862650001501887650001801902650001801920650001201938650002001950650001101970650001801981650001201999650002202011650001502033650001702048650001502065650002002080700002402100700002602124700002102150700002602171700003502197700001802232700001902250700002102269700002102290700002302311700002702334700002002361700001802381700006002399700002002459773014002479856007902619852000902698655001202707IND60780743220221122060101.0220622e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078074322DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2021011332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOllinger, Nicole10aAnti‐Hyperglycemic Effects of Oils and Extracts Derived from Sea Buckthorn – A Comprehensive Analysis Utilizing In Vitro and In Vivo Models  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSCOPE: Sea buckthorn (Hippophaes rhamnoides) is capable of ameliorating disturbed glucose metabolism in animal models and human subjects. Here, the effect of sea buckthorn oil as well as of extracts of fruits, leaves, and press cake on postprandial glucose metabolism is systematically investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sea buckthorn did neither exert decisive effects in an in vitro model of intestinal glucose absorption nor did it alter insulin secretion. However, sea buckthorn stimulates GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane comparable to insulin, indicative of increased glucose clearance from the circulation. Isorhamnetin is identified in all sea buckthorn samples investigated and is biologically active in triggering GLUT4 cell surface localization. Consistently, sea buckthorn products lower circulating glucose by ≈10% in a chick embryo model. Moreover, sea buckthorn products fully revert hyperglycemia in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans while they are ineffective in Drosophila melanogaster under euglycemic conditions. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that edible sea buckthorn products as well as by‐products are promising resources for hypoglycemic nutrient supplements that increase cellular glucose clearance into target tissues.  aPublisher supplied data  aK1 Competence Centre FFoQSIcÖsterreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft  aJosef Ressel Center for Phytogenic Drug ResearchcChristian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aabsorption 3achick embryos 3afood research 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahumans 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3aintestines 3aisorhamnetin 3ametabolism 3aplasma membrane1 aNeuhauser, Cathrina1 aSchwarzinger, Bettina1 aWallner, Melanie1 aSchwarzinger, Clemens1 aBlank‐Landeshammer, Bernhard1 aHager, Roland1 aSadova, Nadiia1 aDrotarova, Ivana1 aMathmann, Katrin1 aKaramouzi, Eugenia1 aPanopoulos, Panagiotis1 aRimbach, Gerald1 aLüersen, Kai1 aWeghuber, Julian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6312-46661 aRöhrl, Clemens0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2022 June, v. 66, no. 12 p.e2101133-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2021011333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245012200174300001600296520092300312592002801235650002101263650001701284650001501301650002101316650001301337650001001350650001801360650001301378651001501391700001901406700002201425700003201447773009701479856008401576852000901660655001201669IND60125250920221120060628.0151103e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012525092DNAL7 a10.1893/0005-3155-84.4.2372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinton-Hardin, Daryle12aA preliminary study of Ricinus communis survivorship at Ballona Wetlands and Temescal Canyon, Los Angeles, California  ap. 237-240.  aInvasive plants such as Castor bean (Ricinus communis) are known to threaten ecosystems due to their competition for resources. The Ballona Wetlands and Temescal Canyon managers employ different techniques to manage the spread of R. communis, potentially resulting in differences in plant survivorship. To investigate this possibility, height of the stems of individual R. communis plants at each site were recorded in order to assign them to cohort groups. Based on the hypothesis predicted that R. communis would have a similar cohort structure at both sites but would exhibit higher survivorship at Temescal Canyon, where R. communis are removed less frequently than at the Ballona Wetlands. However, results indicate that management does not affect cohort structure or stability at either site, but rather, it may have contributed to the significantly higher overall survivorship of R. communis at Temescal Canyon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRicinus communis 3acastor beans 3aecosystems 3ainvasive species 3amanagers 3astems 3asurvival rate 3awetlands 3aCalifornia1 aKagihara, Jodi1 aPascua, Mary Rose1 aCarmona-Galindo, Víctor D.0 tBios.g2013 Dec., v. 84, no. 4 p.237-240dBeta Beta Beta Biological Societyx0005-31557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1893%2F0005-3155-84.4.2373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001700164245007800181300001400259520144600273592002801719650000901747650001501756650003201771650003201803650002301835650001201858650006101870650004501931650003601976650000902012650001102021650006002032650000902092650002402101653000902125653001302134653002902147653002602176700001602202700001702218700001702235773010402252852000902356856008202365655001202447IND9302195120221119080305.0181009e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930219512DNAL7 a84423312pmid7 a10.1177/0300985893030001102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, T. L.10aSuperficial Necrolytic Dermatitis (Necrolytic Migratory Erythema) in Dogs  ap. 75-81.  aTwenty-two dogs with superficial necrolytic dermatitis were evaluated prospectively, twenty-one of which had characteristic crusting lesions of the paw pads. Histologically, epidermal lesions included parakeratosis and laminar intracellular edema. The plasma amino acid concentrations of eight dogs were markedly depressed. Nine dogs had terminal diabetes mellitus. These clinical and morphologic findings were strikingly similar to those of necrolytic migratory erythema in human beings, the most common cause of which is hyperglucagonemia due to islet cell tumor of the pancreas. No pancreatic tumors were found in these dogs; plasma glucagon concentrations in the five dogs tested were normal. The serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations were elevated in all dogs. Severe vacuolar hepatopathy, suggesting metabolically or hormonally induced hepatic dysfunction, was found in 21 dogs at necropsy or by biopsy; one dog had ultrasonographic abnormalities of the liver. Histopathologically, severe vacuolar alteration resulted in parenchymal collapse and nodular regeneration, which grossly mimicked cirrhosis. Although the definitive metabolic stimulus was not discovered for the cutaneous and hepatic lesions, the similarity of the cutaneous and biochemical features of canine superficial necrolytic dermatitis to human necrolytic migratory erythema warrants further investigation into possible underlying pancreatic hormonal dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3adermatitis 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexblood 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aAnimals 2aDermatitisxbloodxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aDiabetes Mellitusxetiologyxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxbloodxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aLiver Diseasesxbloodxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aProspective Studies 0aDogs 0aglucagon 0ahepatocutaneous syndrome 0anecrolytic dermatitis1 aSong, M.

The expression of “flowering genes” is regulated by these factors in order to mediate this timing. The FT gene is thought to be expressed in response to all of these factors while the NPR1 gene is induced by salicylic acid (SA), a signaling molecule in the stress-induced flowering pathway. It is unknown whether stress-induced expression of NPR1 may alter expression of specific “flowering genes” such as FT or whether SA may directly influence the expression of FT. Thus, we examined the expression of FT and NPR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana in response to exogenous application of SA. Gene expression was measured using RT-qPCR. Student t-tests were used to assess differences in expression of both FT and NPR1 in response to SA application. FT expression did not significantly differ in response to SA; however, this is likely a result of mispriming due to homology of FT-related genes. Surprisingly, NPR1 expression was not induced by SA in our study. Although our results provide some insights, creative primer design to measure FT expression and modifications to the experimental design are needed to fully elucidate the relationship between FT and NPR1 expression and SA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aannuals 3aexperimental design 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agenes 3aphotoperiod 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalicylic acid 3at-test 3atemperature1 aGanger, Mike T.1 aEwing, Sarah J.0 tBios.g2013 Dec., v. 84, no. 4 p.241-249dBeta Beta Beta Biological Societyx0005-31557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1893%2F0005-3155-84.4.2413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002600147245021300173300001600386520136800402592002801770650001101798650002701809650002101836650001001857650002201867650001101889650001201900650002601912650001501938651001801953700002201971700001701993700002302010700001902033773008002052856008302132852000902215655001202224IND4470758320221119015255.0150812e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447075832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2012.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErinosho, Temitope O.10aAwareness of the Fruits and Veggies—More Matters campaign, knowledge of the fruit and vegetable recommendation, and fruit and vegetable intake of adults in the 2007 Food Attitudes and Behaviors (FAB) Survey  ap. 155-160.  aIncreased consumption of fruits and vegetables is recommended to reduce chronic disease risk. Few studies have examined awareness of the current fruit and vegetable campaign in the United States, Fruits and Veggies—More Matters. This study assessed awareness of the Fruits and Veggies—More Matters campaign and knowledge of the 7–13 serving recommendation for fruit and vegetable consumption among adults, and determined whether these were associated with fruit and vegetable intake. Cross-sectional data from 3021 adults in the United States’ National Cancer Institute’s 2007 Food Attitudes and Behaviors Survey were analyzed. Few participants were aware of the Fruits and Veggies—More Matters campaign (2%) and the 7–13 recommendation (6%) for adults. More participants were aware of the former 5 A Day campaign (29%) and recommendation (30%). Thirty-nine percent reported consuming ⩾5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Participants were more likely to consume ⩾5 servings of fruits and vegetables/day if they were aware of the 5 A Day/Fruits and Veggies—More Matters campaign, and reported that the recommendation for adults was ⩾5 servings/day. Findings suggest the need to increase awareness of the Fruits and Veggies—More Matters campaign, and the 7–13 recommendation among adults to support high fruit and vegetable intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aattitudes and opinions 3achronic diseases 3afoods 3afruit consumption 3afruits 3asurveys 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 3aUnited States1 aMoser, Richard P.1 aOh, April Y.1 aNebeling, Linda C.1 aYaroch, Amy L.0 tAppetite.g2012 Aug., v. 59, no. 1 p.155-160dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245007400172300001600246520160000262592002801862650001401890650001701904650001001921650003001931650001601961650001601977650001401993650001802007650001902025651001102044651001402055651001002069651001502079651001502094651001402109651002002123653001902143653002902162653002802191653002002219653001902239700001702258700001902275700002002294773013502314856008902449852000902538655001202547IND60795071620221119225352.0220929e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079507162DNAL7 a10.1600/036364422X165730193482742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjan, Vinay10aBiogeography of Zehneria (Cucurbitaceae) and a New Species from India  ap. 738-747.  aZehneria is one of the most diverse genera in Cucurbitaceae with 75 accepted species mainly in Southeast Asia and tropical Africa. Here, we describe Zehneria neorensis, a new species from Neora Valley in the mountains of West Bengal, India, which has 7–10 cm long twisted fruiting pedicels, the longest pedicels reported in the genus so far. Based on morphological data, we also suggest the transfer of Melothria morobensis to the genus Zehneria. With a molecular phylogenetic and global biogeographic analysis based on 3856 nucleotides of plastid and nuclear ribosomal DNA, we demonstrate that the genus Zehneria most likely originated on the African continent 24 (30–19) million years ago and spread from there at least five times to Madagascar and three times to Asia. Zehneria neorensis represents an independent colonization event from Africa to India about 11 (15–7) million years ago. Three lineages reached New Guinea/Australia and finally moved into Polynesia. We infer a rate of at least 20 long-distance dispersal (LDD) events per 10 million years in the genus. This high LDD frequency is most likely a result of the small berry fruits and small flattened seeds of Zehneria, which seem perfectly adapted to long-distance bird dispersal. Field observations are needed to investigate a potential effect of the newly discovered extended and coiling pedicels in Zehneria neorensis on seed dispersal efficiency. The new species adds to a growing list of rather old Cucurbitaceae lineages in the Himalayan foothills, supporting the hypothesis of long climatic stability in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelothria 3abiogeography 3abirds 3ageographical distribution 3anew species 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aseed dispersal 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 3aIndia 3aMadagascar 3aNew Guinea 3aPolynesia 3aSouth East Asia 0aBird dispersal 0acoiling fruiting pedicel 0along-distance dispersal 0anew combination 0apedicel length1 aKumar, Anant1 aKrishna, Gopal1 aSchaefer, Hanno0 tSystematic botany.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 47, no. 3 p.738-747dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364422X165730193482743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245012300209300001600332520076400348592002801112650001901140650001901159650004101178650001001219650001001229650002401239650003001263650001501293650001701308650001401325651001001339700002201349700002201371700001901393700001601412700001801428700001701446700001901463773010701482856008201589852000901671655001201680IND60630034320221123025013.0190206e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063003432DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-08-18-0298-A2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomila, Margarita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8725-190X10aDraft Genome Resources of Two Strains of Xylella fastidiosa XYL1732/17 and XYL2055/17 Isolated from Mallorca Vineyards  ap. 222-224.  aXylella fastidiosa is a plant-pathogenic bacterium that causes serious diseases in many crops of economic importance and is a quarantine organism in the European Union.

Two alternative configurations of a fuel cell system are considered (with and without an expander), and two alternative design concepts for each configuration: BoL (Begin of Life) and EoL (End of Life). The system including an expander generates additional power from the exhaust gases leaving the fuel cell stack, which might increase the system efficiency. However the total investment costs for this case are higher than for the other system configuration without an expander, due to the investment costs associated with the expander and its accessories. The fuel cell stack area in the EoL-sized systems is larger than in the BoL-sized systems. A larger stack area on one hand raises the investment costs, but on the other hand decreases the fuel consumption due to a higher cell efficiency. In this paper, exergoeconomic analyses have been implemented to consider a trade-off between positive and negative effects of using an expander in the system and to select the proper design concept. The results from the exergoeconomic analysis show that (a) an EoL-sized system with an expander is the most cost effective system, (b) the compression and humidification of air are very expensive processes, (c) the stack is by far the most important component from the economic viewpoint, and (d) the thermodynamic efficiency of almost all components must be improved to increase the cost effectiveness of the overall system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuel cells 3ahumidification 3athermodynamics 0aExergoeconomics 0aPEM (proton exchange membrane) fuel cell 0aStack 0aExpander 0aBegin of life 0aEnd of life1 aTsatsaronis, G.q(George),1 aDuelk, Christian0 tEnergy.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 77 p.608-622dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.09.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01336naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007000169300001600239520043800255592002800693653002300721653001600744653001400760653001700774700002500791700002300816773011400839856008400953852000901037655001201046IND60130167020221121020148.0151127e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013016702DNAL7 a10.1600/0363644067796960222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBove, Claudia P.12aA New Species of Cipoia (Podostemaceae) from Minas Gerais, Brazil  ap. 822-825.  aA new species of Cipoia ((Podostemaceae)) from the state of Minas Gerais ((Brazil)) is described and illustrated: Cipoia ramosa.

However, it is not entirely clear whether this trend of expansion could be linked to a greater reproductive effort in the species. Anthropogenic stressors can induce the reproductive effort of seagrass meadows as a response to stress, but other variables, such as seagrass biometrics or environmental factors, can also influence their sexual reproduction. To increase the knowledge regarding this issue, we monitored the flowering effort, seagrass biometrics and abiotic parameters of three Z. noltei meadows in an area that has been highly modified by anthropogenic activities during the past decades. Results showed that silt and clay content in the sediment (strongly correlated with organic matter) and seagrass vertical shoot density explained 54% of the variability in the flowering effort of the meadows. This study suggests that stress-induced flowering of Z. noltei may occur under determinate environmental conditions, such as silty environments with organic enrichment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZostera noltei 3aanthropogenic stressors 3aclay fraction 3aorganic matter 3aseagrasses 3asexual reproduction 3asilt 3astress response1 aVeiga, Puri 1 aSampaio, Leandro 1 aRubal, Marcos 0 tPlants.g2021 July 06, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100713873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245014100165300001500306520051000321592002800831650002100859650002800880650002200908650001100930650002000941650002300961650001200984650002400996700001801020700002201038700002301060700001901083700002501102700001801127700002901145700001701174700002201191700001801213700003001231773010601261856008201367852000901449655001201458IND4472494720221120032621.0141111e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447249472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2011.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjörck, Inger10aCereal grains for nutrition and health benefits: Overview of results from in vitro, animal and human studies in the HEALTHGRAIN project  ap. 87-100.  aEpidemiological studies have linked whole grain intake to the prevention of the metabolic syndrome, obesity and associated chronic diseases such as CVD and T2D.

Two field experiments, i.e., experiment 1 (EXP.1) and experiment 2 (EXP.2), were conducted, and four GABA levels, i.e., 0, 50, 500, 1000 mg l⁻¹, classified as CK, T1, T2, and T3, respectively, were sprayed at the initial heading stage of a fragrant rice cultivar, Yuxiangyouzhan. The results showed that exogenous GABA application increased the 2AP content in grains 8.58%–19.44% in EXP.1 and 0.01%–6.22% in EXP.2. Exogenous GABA treatments also increased the GABA concentration in the grains and proline content in fragrant rice. Significant correlations between the grain 2AP content and proline content in leaves at 5 days after spraying were also detected in EXP.1, whereas GABA application did not significantly affect leaf dry weight, total dry weight, or grain yield. Moreover, gas exchange parameters, soil-plant analyses development values, and antioxidant activities were improved under GABA treatments. Additionally, the GABA applications substantially improved the grain quality characteristics, including milled rice percentage, head rice percentage, and protein content. Overall, exogenous GABA application was effective in the improvement of quality characteristics in fragrant rice, especially that of grain 2AP contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosynthesis 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agas exchange 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3aheading 3aleaf dry mass 3aleaves 3aproline 3aprotein content 3arice 3aspraying 0aγ-aminobutyric acid 0a2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline 0aFragrant rice 0aQuality1 aKong, Leilei1 aMa, Lin1 aAshraf, Umair1 aPan, Shenggang1 aDuan, Meiyang1 aTian, Hua1 aWu, Longmei1 aTang, Xiangru1 aMo, Zhaowen0 tJournal of cereal science.g2020 Jan., v. 91 p.102900-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2019.1029003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245012300200500002000323520144900343592002801792596003001820650001601850650001501866650001501881650001701896650001301913650001401926700007001940700005602010700005702066773013702123856007702260852000902337655001202346IND60795068020221119223512.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079506802DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JB0247392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoymans, M.

A weighted least squares approach is used to recover microgravity results from a network of benchmarks around Kı̄lauea's summit, eliminate instrumental drift, and restore suspected data tares. A total mass of 1.9 × 10¹¹ kg was determined from these microgravity campaigns to have accumulated below Kı̄lauea Caldera during 2009–2015 at an estimated depth of 1.3 km below sea level. Only a fraction of this mass is reflected in surface deformation, and this is consistent with previously reported discrepancies between subsurface mass accumulation and observed surface deformation. The discrepancy, amongst other independent evidence from gas emissions, seismicity, and continuous gravimetry, indicate densification of magma in the reservoirs below the volcano summit. This densification may have been driven by degassing through the summit vent. It is hypothesized that during the final years of the summit eruption, magma densification resulted in a buildup of pressure in the reservoirs that may have contributed to the lower East Rift Zone outbreak of 2018. The observed mass accumulation beneath Kı̄lauea could not have been detected through other techniques and illustrates the importance of microgravity measurements in volcano monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  a801221cEC's Horizon 2020 3adeformation 3ageophysics 3agravimetry 3amicrogravity 3aresearch 3asea level1 ade Zeeuw‐van Dalfsen, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2527-49321 aEvers, L.

Herein, the FePS₃ nanosheets exfoliated from the bulk counterpart by the sonication assisted liquid-phase exfoliation were applied in the photoelectrochemical-type (PEC) photodetector. The FePS₃-based photoelectrode displays a short response time (rising time of 256 ms and decay time of 279 ms), large photocurrent density (3.2 μA cm–²), responsivity (31.94 μA cm–² W–¹), excellent long-term stability (more than 1000 s), and wide band detection (365–730 nm). Benefiting from the unique 2D structure of the FePS₃ nanosheets and the flexibility of the PET substrate, the fabricated photoelectrode can maintain an outstanding photodetection performance after 500 cycles of bending and twisting. Furthermore, the PEC photodetector with a flexible sandwich structure was fabricated to make it more portable. This work promotes the application of 2D FePS₃ nanosheets in optoelectronics and is of great significance to the practical application of the PEC device.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric current 3aferrimagnetic materials 3ananosheets 3aphosphorus 3aphotoelectrodes 3aphysical chemistry 3asonication1 aHuang, Zongyu1 aQiao, Hui1 aMa, Qian1 aZhou, Yang1 aTeng, Jianjin1 aQi, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0155-25580 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 125, no. 17 p.9526-9533dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c019383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245011200203500002000315520117000335592002801505596006501533596006501598596006501663596006501728596005901793650001601852650001601868650001501884650001301899650001501912650001301927700005801940700005701998700006702055700001702122700005802139773013702197856007702334852000902411655001202420IND60795068120221119223547.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079506812DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JB0242132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandanbata, Osamu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2361-848210aSub‐Decadal Volcanic Tsunamis Due To Submarine Trapdoor Faulting at Sumisu Caldera in the Izu–Bonin Arc  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe main cause of tsunamis is large subduction zone earthquakes with seismic magnitudes Mw > 7, but submarine volcanic processes can also generate tsunamis. At the submarine Sumisu caldera in the Izu–Bonin arc, moderate‐sized earthquakes with Mw < 6 occur almost once a decade and cause meter‐scale tsunamis. The source mechanism of the volcanic earthquakes is poorly understood. Here we use tsunami and seismic data from the recent 2015 event to show that abrupt uplift of the submarine caldera, with a large brittle rupture of the ring fault system due to overpressure in its magma reservoir, caused the earthquake and tsunami. This submarine trapdoor faulting mechanism can efficiently generate tsunamis due to large vertical seafloor displacements, but it inefficiently radiates long‐period seismic waves. Similar seismic radiation patterns and tsunami waveforms due to repeated earthquakes indicate that continuous magma supply into the caldera induces quasi‐regular trapdoor faulting. This mechanism of tsunami generation by submarine trapdoor faulting underscores the need to monitor submarine calderas for robust assessment of tsunami hazards.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP17J02919cMEXT, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP20J01689cMEXT, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP19K04034cMEXT, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJPMJJR1805cMEXT, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science  cEarthquake Research Institute, The University of Tokyo 3abrittleness 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asubduction 3atsunamis1 aWatada, Shingo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9924-968X1 aSatake, Kenji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3368-30851 aKanamori, Hiroo,d1936-1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8219-94281 aRivera, Luis1 aZhan, Zhongwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5586-26070 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Sept., v. 127, no. 9 p.e2022JB024213-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JB0242133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013500171300001600306520093800322592002801260650001901288650001501307650001201322650001401334650002401348650001501372650001601387653001501403653002301418653002501441653002301466700005801489700002001547773008901567856008401656852000901740655001201749IND60600495920221118213922.0180703e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060049592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBianco, Vincenzo10aPerformance analysis of turbulent convection heat transfer of Al2O3 water-nanofluid in circular tubes at constant wall temperature  ap. 403-413.  aThe present paper analyzes the turbulent convection of Al2O3-water nanofluid inside a circular section tube subjected to constant wall temperature. The analysis is developed numerically by using the mixture model, which has been proved to be a convenient method to simulate nanofluids behavior. The numerical model is successfully validated by means of analytical equations and experimental correlations. The study is focused on the analysis of the performance of Al2O3-water nanofluid within the considered device. Performance indicators based on the first and second law of thermodynamics are taken into account and analyzed. At the increase of nanofluid concentration, the Nusselt number increases, but entropy generation and pumping power also increase, therefore the penalties overcome the benefits.The results reported in the present paper are believed to be useful for the thermal optimization of nanofluids flow inside tubes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aconvection 3aentropy 3aequations 3amathematical models 3ananofluids 3atemperature 0aNanofluids 0aEntropy generation 0aTurbulent convection 0aNumerical analysis1 aManca, Oronzio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7226-35371 aNardini, Sergio0 tEnergy.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 77 p.403-413dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.09.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245010400203300001800307500002000325520228800345592002802633650002502661650001102686650001802697650000902715650002402724650001302748650003102761650001702792650001102809650001602820650001002836650002302846650000902869650002602878650001102904650001302915650002102928651001402949700002302963700002002986700002303006700002303029700001803052700002003070700001803090773012503108856008003233852000903313655001203322IND60780740720221120084517.0220622e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078074072DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.161612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanton, Lucila1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9887-019110aQuantitative exposure assessment and risk characterization for fipronil residues in laying hen eggs  ap. 2775-2788.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPoultry production is linked to veterinary drug use to treat diseases. Few ectoparasitic compounds are approved for poultry. Fipronil is a pesticide widely used in agriculture. It is also a drug authorized to control ectoparasites in small animals and, in some countries, in cattle. There has been evidence of fipronil extra‐label use in laying hens, mainly to control the red mite Dermanyssus gallinae. Fipronil's popularity is due to its high toxicity to invertebrates. It could be metabolized to more toxic metabolites that potentially damage human health. In the present study, we carry out a quantitative exposure assessment and risk characterization for fipronil residues in laying hen eggs for local consumption in five cities of Buenos Aires province in Argentina, namely, Azul, Balcarce, Juarez, Chaves, and Tandil. Consumption surveys and egg sampling were conducted for three summer periods. Eggs were analyzed by UFLC‐MS‐MS. Fipronil prevalence, residue concentrations, residue stability to cooking methods, egg consumption, among the most important variables were modeled. The results indicated that 20.7% of samples contained fipronil residues. The highest residue was fipronil sulfone metabolite. Fipronil concentrations quantified ranged between 10 and 2510 ppb (median value = 150 ppb). When eggs were cooked, fipronil residues were stable. The exposure assessment and risk characterization revealed that the highest probability of consuming eggs with fipronil residues above the admissible limits was for young adults (20.8%), followed by babies (16.9%), young children (16.4%), children (13.4%), teenagers (10.3%), older adults (9.41%), and adults (8.65%). These results suggest an unacceptable risk associated with egg consumption with fipronil residues for all age groups. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Fipronil is widely used as an extra‐label way on laying hens since its use is prohibited in poultry production both in Argentina and in most countries. This molecule has been classified as Class II, a moderately hazardous pesticide because it could damage various human organs. Fipronil residues in eggs could be one of the exposure pathways for consumers. Monitoring residual levels and carrying out the health risk assessment in eggs are thus in an urge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermanyssus gallinae 3acattle 3aectoparasites 3aeggs 3aexposure assessment 3afipronil 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amites 3apoultry production 3arisk 3arisk characterization 3asummer 3atoxicity 3aveterinary drugs 3aArgentina1 aSignorini, Marcelo1 aCanton, Candela1 aDomínguez, Paula,1 aFarías, Cristina,1 aAlvarez, Luis1 aLanusse, Carlos1 aMoreno, Laura0 tJournal of food science.g2022 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.2775-2788dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.161613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245012500207300001600332520164400348592002801992650001302020650002902033650002002062650001902082650002002101650002402121650001002145650001802155650001302173650001802186650001302204650002302217650001902240650001402259650002302273651001002296700001902306700002002325700002002345700002602365700002302391773012902414856008202543852000902625655001202634IND60588881020221119224227.0190812e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058888102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-017-0407-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNizzoli, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4731-980410aDenitrification in a meromictic lake and its relevance to nitrogen flows within a moderately impacted forested catchment  ap. 143-161.  aWe analysed the spatial and temporal variability of benthic nitrogen fluxes and denitrification rates in a sub-alpine meromictic lake (Lake Idro, Italy), and compared in-lake nitrogen retention and loss with the net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to the watershed. We hypothesized a low nitrogen retention and denitrification capacity due to meromixis. This results from nitrate supply from the epilimnion slowing down during stratification and oxygen deficiency inhibiting nitrification and promoting ammonium recycling and its accumulation. We also hypothesized a steep vertical gradient of sedimentary denitrification capacity, decreasing with depth and oxygen deficiency. These are important and understudied issues in inland waters, as climate change and direct anthropic pressures may increase the extent of meromixis. Nearshore sediments had high denitrification rates (87 mg m⁻² day⁻¹) and efficiency (~ 100%), while in the monimolimnion denitrification was negligible. The littoral zone, covering 10% of the lake surface, contributed ~50% of total denitrification, while the monimolimnion, which covered 70% of the sediment surface, contributed to < 13% of total denitrification. The persistent and expanding meromixis of Lake Idro is expected to further decrease its nitrogen removal capacity (31% of the incoming nitrogen load) compared to what has been measured in other temperate lakes. Values up to 60% are generally reported for other such lakes. Results of this study are relevant as the combination of anthropogenic pressures, climate change and meromixis may threaten the nitrogen processing capacity of lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiogeochemistry 3aclimate change 3adenitrification 3aforested watersheds 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen retention 3apollution load 3asediments 3atemporal variation 3aItaly1 aBartoli, Marco1 aAzzoni, Roberta1 aLonghi, Daniele1 aCastaldelli, Giuseppe1 aViaroli, Pierluigi0 tBiogeochemistry.g2018 Jan., v. 137, no. 1-2 p.143-161dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-017-0407-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245006000206300001800266500001100284520152600295592002801821650001801849650001101867650001301878650001401891650001701905650001501922650002001937650001001957650001601967650002401983650002102007650002502028650001602053650001502069650001902084650001402103650001502117650001602132650002302148700005702171700005902228700005702287700006402344773013702408856008202545852000902627655001202636IND60744382220221118030214.0210713e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074438222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-021-02489-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikut, Justyna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7762-765910aDiet supporting therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases  ap. 2275-2291.  aReview  aPURPOSE: Non-specific inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. More and more often attention is paid to the possibility of dietary support for inflammatory bowel diseases. METHODS: The following review article considers the role of dietary components in the treatment of IBD as: pteridines, probiotics, bovine immunoglobulin, vitamin D, omega-3, flavonoids, polyphenols, curcumin and phosphatidylcholine. The article also discusses plant raw materials of arjuna, soy protein and nettles, trying to summarize their effect on quenching the inflammatory process within the intestines. This review focuses on the possibilities of dietary components and supplementation use to improve the pharmacotherapy response as well as the general clinical patients’ condition. RESULTS: The mechanism of action of supportive therapy is based on reduction in oxidative stress, maintaining the adequate balance between Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes by affecting cytokines, increasing riboflavin supply for macrophages, increasing expression of vitamin D receptor, regulation by decreasing the expression of NF-κB in liver cells and ability to inhibit the COX2 entrance and inactivate prostaglandins that are involved in the inflammatory process and 12-lipoxygenase pathway inhibition. CONCLUSION: Considering clinical researches, it seems that the use of the above-mentioned ingredients in the diet of patients suffering IBD may positively influence the treatment process and maintenance of remission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3acattle 3acurcumin 3acytokines 3adrug therapy 3aflavonoids 3aimmunoglobulins 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amechanism of action 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolyphenols 3aprobiotics 3aprostaglandins 3aremission 3ariboflavin 3asoy protein 3aulcerative colitis1 aKonecka, Nina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1540-65861 aZiętek, Maciej1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7729-06701 aKulpa, Danuta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2352-75881 aSzczuko, Małgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9808-06240 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2021 Aug., v. 60, no. 5 p.2275-2291dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-021-02489-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014000166300001400306500001500320520165100335592002801986650001402014650002702028650001102055650001402066650001602080650000902096650001602105650001602121650001402137650002002151650003102171653001302202653002102215700001802236700001902254700001702273700001602290700002102306700002102327700001902348700001902367700002002386773009602406856008302502852000902585655001202594IND60125247720221120205002.0151103e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012524772DNAL7 a10.1893/0005-3155-83.3.812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLean, Nellie10aHow can hantaviruses kill humans but leave deer mice unaffected?bAn evaluation of the immune response of deer mice to Sin Nombre virus  ap. 81-89.  a2019-12-04  aSin Nombre virus (SNV) causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans, a disease with high (∼36%) mortality. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are the primary host of SNV and, unlike humans, deer mice infected with SNV have few overt signs of disease. The reasons for such mild infections in deer mice have not been well studied; however, this information may be useful in uncovering therapies that could reduce human HPS mortality. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the immune response of deer mice to SNV by examining their patterns of white blood cell production. We quantified the number of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, and monocytes produced by wild deer mice in both the early and late stages of SNV infection. Deer mice captured in the early season had greater basophil, lymphocyte, and eosinophil levels compared to deer mice captured in the late season. Conversely, monocyte levels were greater in deer mice captured in the late season. SNV infection status appeared to influence production of both neutrophils and monocytes, with SNV-infected mice having greater neutrophil levels but lower monocyte levels than uninfected mice. Collectively, the results seem to support the notion that immune stressors faced by wild deer mice shift from early to late season, and these differences are reflected by differential leukocyte production that occurs across seasons. Furthermore, our results indicate some potential differences between wild deer mice and lab-bred deer mice, as well as some possible similarities between wild deer mice and humans in their immune responses to SNV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasophils 3aPeromyscus maniculatus 3ahumans 3amonocytes 3alymphocytes 3amice 3aneutrophils 3aeosinophils 3amortality 3aimmune response 3aSin Nombre orthohantavirus 0aimmunity 0aSin Nombre virus1 aKelly, Ashley1 aMolinar, Edlin1 aGhachu, Joni1 aHart, Lacey1 aO'Brien, Colleen1 aWright, Kimberly1 aSchountz, Tony1 aHartney, Cathy1 aLehmer, Erin M.0 tBios.g2012 Sept., v. 83, no. 3 p.81-89dBeta Beta Beta Biological Societyx0005-31557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1893%2F0005-3155-83.3.813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009200164520150500256592002801761650001101789650002001800650001701820650001101837650002301848650001401871650001701885650001201902650001101914650001601925650002901941651001301970700002101983700002302004700002102027700002102048700001802069700002402087700002802111773012002139856007802259852000902337655001202346IND60745571920221122123457.0210723e20210622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074557192DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100712732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, Helena 10aSpatiotemporal Variation in Pollination Deficits in an Insect-Pollinated Dioecious Crop  aInadequate quantity and quality of pollen reaching the stigmas decreases the sexual reproductive output of plants, compromising yield. Still, the current extent of pollen limitation affecting yield (i.e., pollination deficits) is poorly quantified. This study is aimed at quantifying pollination deficits in kiwifruit orchards, a dioecious plant with a fruit caliber and market value largely dependent on pollination services. For that, we set up a pollination experiment and quantified services and yield provided by current pollination vectors, and under optimal pollination, over two years in a total of twenty-three orchards covering the kiwifruit production range in Portugal. We characterized nine fruit traits and used: (1) fruit weight to calculate pollination deficits and relate them with pollinator diversity and abundance, and environmental variables; and (2) production values, fruit caliber, and market values to calculate economic impact of pollination deficits. Results showed that pollination deficits were variable in time and space and were significantly and negatively correlated with pollinator abundance, while the opposite pattern was obtained for production, supporting the notion that a higher pollinator’s abundance is related to lower pollination deficits and higher yields. Understanding the factors affecting pollination deficits is crucial to depict the need for nature-based solutions promoting pollinators and to resort to management practices assisting pollination.  aPublisher supplied data 3adioecy 3aeconomic impact 3afruit weight 3afruits 3ainsect pollination 3akiwifruit 3amarket value 3amarkets 3apollen 3apollinators 3areproductive performance 3aPortugal1 aSiopa, Catarina 1 aCasais, Vinícius 1 aCastro, Mariana 1 aLoureiro, João,1 aGaspar, Hugo 1 aDias, Maria Celeste1 aCastro Méndez, Silvia,0 tPlants.g2021 June 22, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100712733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002300193245010900216300001600325506007600341520143900417592002801856506003701884650002001921650001901941650002101960650002001981650002302001650001702024650001302041650002102054650001102075650001502086650001302101650001502114650001702129650001302146650001902159650001402178653002102192653001402213653001502227653001102242653001002253700001902263700002302282700002702305700001902332700002302351773010202374856008702476852000902563655001202572IND60096313420221207055228.0190214e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009631342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.09.0022doi7 aPMC38425032pmcid7 a240450662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharp, Duncan M.C.10aAmphipathic polymer-mediated uptake of trehalose for dimethyl sulfoxide-free human cell cryopreservation  ap. 305-311.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFor stem cell therapy to become a routine reality, one of the major challenges to overcome is their storage and transportation. Currently this is achieved by cryopreserving cells utilising the cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Me2SO is toxic to cells, leads to loss of cell functionality, and can produce severe side effects in patients. Potentially, cells could be frozen using the cryoprotectant trehalose if it could be delivered into the cells at a sufficient concentration. The novel amphipathic membrane permeabilising agent PP-50 has previously been shown to enhance trehalose uptake by erythrocytes, resulting in increased cryosurvival. Here, this work was extended to the nucleated human cell line SAOS-2. Using the optimum PP-50 concentration and media osmolarity, cell viability post-thaw was 60±2%. In addition, the number of metabolically active cells 24h post-thaw, normalised to that before freezing, was found to be between 103±4% and 91±5%. This was found to be comparable to cells frozen using Me2SO. Although reduced (by 22±2%, p=0.09), the doubling time was found not to be statistically different to the non-frozen control. This was in contrast to cells frozen using Me2SO, where the doubling time was significantly reduced (by 41±4%, p=0.004). PP-50 mediated trehalose delivery into cells could represent an alternative cryopreservation protocol, suitable for research and therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3acell viability 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aerythrocytes 3afreezing 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aosmolarity 3apatients 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3atransportation 3atrehalose 0aCryopreservation 0aTrehalose 0aBiopolymer 0aSAOS-2 0aPP-501 aPicken, Andrew1 aMorris, Timothy J.1 aHewitt, Christopher J.1 aCoopman, Karen1 aSlater, Nigel K.H.0 tCryobiology.g2013 Dec., v. 67, no. 3 p.305-311dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012200181300001600303520164900319592002801968650002001996650002202016650001302038650002502051650001302076650003802089650002802127650001002155650001402165650003302179650001502212650001202227650001702239650001302256650001702269650001502286650001002301650000902311650002202320650003102342650001002373650002102383650006202404650005902466650005302525650004702578650002402625650001102649650001102660650001102671650000902682650001602691650003002707650003102737650001602768651002602784700002502810773009702835856004802932852000902980655001202989IND4447730820221120030349.0121003e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444773082DNAL7 a209386872pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-010-2079-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElgun, Gullu10aInvestigation of Cryptosporidium spp. antigen by ELISA method in stool specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea  ap. 395-397.  aCryptosporidium spp. is an important parasitic protozoan causing diarrhea in developing and developed countries. The agent causes severe life-threatening diarrhea especially in immunocompromised hosts. Diagnosis of the Cryptosporidium oocyst in stool samples by conventional microscopy is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the usefulness of a copro-antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test in detecting Cryptosporidium spp. from fecal specimens. For this aim, microscopy and specific antigen detection methods were compared to determine Cryptosporidium spp. In addition, specific antigen by ELISA method in stool was investigated in order to find out whether or not it contributes to the diagnosis of Cryptosporidium spp. One hundred and fifty-four stool specimens taken from patients whose ages ranged from 0 to 86 with diarrhea applied to Department of Parasitology, Balcali Hospital of Cukurova University in Adana, Turkey were used. All samples were examined for Cryptosporidium spp. antigen by ELISA and oocysts via gold standard modified acid-fast staining, between October 2008 and July 2009. Eight (5.19%) specimens were found to be positive by modified acid-fast staining method and 37 (24.03%) specimens by copro-antigen ELISA method were found to be positive. The sensitivity and specificity for copro-antigen ELISA were 100% and 80.1%, respectively. The results of copro-antigen ELISA indicate that the simple, rapid, reliable, and standardized immunoassay test is sensitive and specific for routine diagnosis and may be useful for large-scale epidemiological studies of cryptosporidiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aantigen detection 3aantigens 3adeveloping countries 3adiarrhea 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepidemiological studies 3afeces 3ahospitals 3aimmunocompromised population 3amicroscopy 3aoocysts 3aparasitology 3apatients 3auniversities 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAntigens, Protozoanxblood 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCryptosporidiosisxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aCryptosporidiumximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aDiarrheaxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aReproducibility of Results 2aYoung Adult 0aTurkeyxepidemiology.1 aKoltas, Ismail Soner0 tParasitology research.g2011 Feb., v. 108, no. 2 p.395-397dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-010-2079-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245006600197500002000263520184600283592002802129596005902157596005902216596005902275650001302334650001202347650002002359650001402379650001502393650002102408650001102429650001302440650001602453650001902469650001602488700005502504773013702559856007702696852000902773655001202782IND60795068420221119223451.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079506842DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JB0241372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7802-647910aMachine Learning Thermobarometry for Biotite‐Bearing Magmas  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiotite (sensu lato) is a widespread rock‐forming mineral in magmatic rocks that can be stable in a broad range of pressure and temperature, but appropriate biotite thermometers or barometers are lacking. Based on a collected experimental dataset (n = 839, T = 625–1,325°C, P = 1–48 kbar) containing biotites that span a wide compositional range [e.g., Mg/(Mg + Fe) = 0–1, TiO₂ = 0–9 wt%], we have trained several machine learning algorithms for calibrating a biotite thermobarometer. Our evaluation on model performance reveals that the thermobarometry derived from extremely randomized trees is the best option, which returns coefficients of determination (R²) ≥0.97 for estimating both temperature and pressure using either biotite‐only or biotite + melt model. The model reliability were evaluated using three different approaches for the biotite‐only and biotite + melt thermobarometers respectively, including Monte Carlo cross‐validation (RMSEs are 65°C and 4.7 kbar, 38°C and 3.2 kbar, respectively), testing with independent test set (RMSEs are 54°C and 4.4 kbar, 35°C and 2.4 kbar, respectively), and error propagation from assumed analytical uncertainty (2*MAD are 54°C and 1.27 kbar, 10°C and 1.26 kbar, respectively). Quantified relative importance of involved components in the thermobarometers supports an intrinsic control of thermodynamics in the stability of biotite as a function of pressure and temperature. We applied the new biotite thermobarometer for biotite‐bearing andesitic, phonolitic and rhyolitic volcanic systems provide reliable constraints of temperature and pressure for magma storage, ascent, and evolution. We also offer a user‐friendly webpage for online performance of the thermobarometers (https://lixiaoyan.shinyapps.io/Biotite_thermobarometer/).  aPublisher supplied data  a42130310cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41972055cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41902052cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aInternet 3abiotite 3adata collection 3aevolution 3ageophysics 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aresearch 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3auncertainty1 aZhang, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7019-50750 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Sept., v. 127, no. 9 p.e2022JB024137-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JB0241373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245010100158300001800259500002000277520204200297592002802339596005002367596006902417650001702486650001302503650002002516650002202536650002702558650001702585650002102602650001802623650001002641650001502651650002102666650001002687650001002697650001002707700005102717700001502768700002002783700005702803773012502860856008002985852000903065655001203074IND60780741020221120084625.0220622e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078074102DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.161802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Chao10aEnrichment of taste and aroma perceptions in chicken meat stewed in braised soup used repeatedly  ap. 2563-2577.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFlavor enrichment of sauce‐braised chicken creates a popular umami taste and aroma. In order to preliminarily reveal the enrichment of taste and aroma compounds of sauce‐braised meat products processed with braised soup used repeatedly, the system containing only chicken and chicken soup was designed to simulate the process of repeated stewing. Free amino acids, 5‐nucleotides, fatty acids, and volatile compounds in stewed chicken were determined, and taste and aroma profiles were evaluated using an electronic tongue (E‐tongue) and an electronic nose (E‐nose), respectively. As repeated stewing times increased, the total free amino acid content increased from 514.37 mg/100 g to 721.33 mg/100 g, and the contents of 5′‐inosine monophosphate, 5′‐guanosine monophosphate, and 5′‐adenosine monophosphate increased by approximately 20%. Meanwhile, the relative content of saturated fatty acids increased, and the relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased significantly. Oleic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitoleic acid accounted for more than 80% of the total fatty acid content. A total of 15 aroma‐active compounds were identified during repeated stewing, and their concentrations increased by more than 40%, especially for monounsaturated alkenals. Within 10 times of repeated stewing, the taste and aroma compounds were enriched because of a decrease in the concentration difference of taste substances and an increase in the flavor‐adsorption capacity of fat, which was also consistent with the results from the E‐nose and E‐tongue. The taste and aroma of stewed chicken tended to remain constant after 10 times of repeated stewing of braised soup. The obtained information can provide guidelines for regulating the aroma and taste of sauce‐braised chicken. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The fat level of stewed chicken and the difference in concentration between stewed meat and braised soup were important potential factors that could be employed to enhance the flavor of stewed meat.  aPublisher supplied data  a32001724cNational Natural Science Foundation  a2019‐MS‐006cNatural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province 3achicken meat 3achickens 3aelectronic nose 3aelectronic tongue 3afatty acid composition 3afood science 3afree amino acids 3alinoleic acid 3aodors 3aoleic acid 3apalmitoleic acid 3asoups 3ataste 3aumami1 aQi, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6539-10521 aYang, Cong1 aZhang, Qingyong1 aLiu, Dengyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6896-91980 tJournal of food science.g2022 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.2563-2577dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.161803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005000147245012200197300001100319520174100330592002802071596005902099650002002158650001302178650002902191650001202220650001202232650002102244650001602265650001102281650001902292650002202311650000902333650000902342650001402351650001302365650001102378650001302389650001302402650001402415650001502429650001502444650001002459650000902469700003302478700003202511700002502543700003102568700007102599773014902670856008202819852000902901655001202910IND60627807020221117223145.0190314e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062780702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-7170-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca-Montes de Oca, Reyna María Guadalupe10aChemical activity relation of phosphorus and nitrogen presence in trace elements incorporation into underground water  ap. 93.  aAnthropogenic activities can deteriorate the quality of groundwater destined for human use and consumption due to the fact that human activities cause changes in groundwater chemistry. The changes are induced by chemical species coming from industrial waste, which interacts with rocks and minerals. These trigger agents (phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients) which can incorporate trace elements (As, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn). The main objective of the present work was to study the phosphate ions’ and nitrogenous species’ effects on the incorporation of trace elements into groundwater used for human consumption and to determine the physicochemical processes that participate in the incorporation of trace elements. The physicochemical analysis and elemental analysis by ICP of the groundwater that supplies the study area showed that the phosphorus (P) activity contributes in the incorporation of trace elements into the water. Significant correlations between the activities of P and Fe (0.516), Mn (0.553), Pb (0.756), and As (− 0.747) as well as the correlation of NH₄⁺ with As indicate that the presence of chemical species such as PO₄³⁻ (2.50–32.20 mg L⁻¹), NO₃⁻ (0.89–30.80 mg L⁻¹), and NH₄⁺ (0.2–12.70 mg L⁻¹) are triggering agents that favor the dissolution and mobility of As (0.014–0.020 mg L⁻¹), Fe (0.020–1.14 mg L⁻¹), Mn (0.007–0.254 mg L⁻¹), Ni (0.002–0.0141 mg L⁻¹), Zn (0.009–0.459 mg L⁻¹), and Pb (0.009–0.0170 mg L⁻¹), species with adverse health effects because they are considered carcinogenic. Adequate control of the nitrogenous and phosphated material prevents the dissolution and mobility of trace elements into the water.  aPublisher supplied data  a4303/17CIcUniversidad Autónoma del Estado de México 3aadverse effects 3aammonium 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achemical species 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3ahydrochemistry 3aindustrial wastes 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3aminerals 3anickel 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3arocks 3azinc1 aMartínez-Miranda, Verónica1 aSolache-Ríos, Marcos José1 aRamos Leal, Alfredo,1 aÁlvarez-Bastida, Carolina1 aFuentes Rivas, Rosa María,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0091-40190 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 Feb., v. 191, no. 2 p.93-93dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-7170-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03889naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245013100179300001800310520163700328592002801965596006301993596005902056650002302115650001602138650001602154650001202170650001902182650002102201650002002222650002202242650002302264650001102287650001202298650002002310650002102330650002202351650001502373650002402388650001602412700003002428700003402458700002502492700002802517700002702545700002702572700002402599700003302623700003202656700003102688700003002719700003302749700002402782700002902806700002702835700002102862700001802883700002202901700006402923773013702987856008203124852000903206655001203215IND60744382520221118030101.0210713e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074438252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-020-02428-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Salazar, Luis E.10aEffect of the intake of dietary protein on insulin resistance in subjects with obesity: a randomized controlled clinical trial  ap. 2435-2447.  aPURPOSE: We compared the effect of diets with different amounts and sources of dietary protein on insulin sensitivity (IS) in subjects with obesity and insulin resistance (IR). METHODS: Eighty subjects with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) and IR (Matsuda index < 4.3 and HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5) over 18 years old were randomized to four groups for a one-month period: a normal protein diet (< 20%) with a predominance of animal protein (Animal NP) or vegetable protein (Vegetable NP) and a high-protein diet (25–30%) with a predominance of animal protein (Animal HP) or vegetable protein (Vegetable HP). Baseline and final measurements of body weight, body composition, biochemical parameters, blood pressure (BP), resting energy expenditure and plasma amino acid profiles were performed. RESULTS: Body weight, BMI and waist circumference decreased in all groups. Interestingly, the IS improved more in the Animal HP (Matsuda index; 1.39 vs 2.58, P = 0.003) and in the Vegetable HP groups (Matsuda index; 1.44 vs 3.14, P < 0.0001) after one month. The fat mass, triglyceride levels, C-reactive protein levels and the leptin/adiponectin index decreased; while, the skeletal muscle mass increased in the Animal and Vegetable HP groups. The BP decreased in all groups except the Animal NP group. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that a high-protein hypocaloric diets improves IS by 60–90% after one month in subjects with obesity and IR, regardless of weight loss and the source of protein, either animal or vegetable.

In Brazil, 72 species and 24 genera are recorded. Little is known about this family in the Central region of Brazil, and no research has previously been conducted in the ecologically important Cerrado biome. In this study, we evaluated the diversity and temporal variation of the Cetoniidae in an area of the Cerrado in the Federal District (Brazil) and verified whether the abundance and species richness were influenced by climatic variables. The study was carried out in an area of Cerrado sensu stricto at Água Limpa Farm in Brasília/DF. Beetles were collected weekly from October 2013 to September 2014 using 40 traps baited with banana and pineapple fermented with sugarcane juice. A total of 398 specimens comprising 8 genera and 15 species were collected. We observed temporal variation in abundance and richness of the Cetoniidae in direct relation to the climatic characteristics of the Cerrado, with a greater number of individuals and species appearing in the rainy season. Climatic variables such as temperature and humidity appear to have a significant effect on the diversity of Cetoniidae. This is the first study conducted on this family in Central Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3abait traps 3abananas 3acerrado 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3afarms 3aflowers 3afruits 3ahumidity 3apineapples 3aspecies diversity 3asugarcane juice 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awet season 3aBrazil1 aOliveira, Charles M.1 aVaz‐de‐Mello, Fernando Z.1 aFrizzas, Marina R.0 tEntomological science.g2018 Mar., v. 21, no. 1 p.84-92dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3774063x1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.122843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04084naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245008500202500002000287520240200307592002802709596002702737596004902764596005602813596003002869596001602899596003502915650002002950650001902970650001102989650002003000650001103020650001203031650001503043650001403058650001003072650002203082650001503104650002503119650001403144650001103158651001003169700006103179700002103240700002103261700007003282773013003352856007503482852000903557655001203566IND60780741220221122050924.0220622e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078074122DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.222262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, Matthew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9864-803X10aSpace use and site fidelity of wintering whooping cranes on the Texas Gulf Coast  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Aransas‐Wood Buffalo population (the only non‐reintroduced, migratory population) of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) overwinters along the Texas Gulf Coast, USA. Understanding whooping crane space use on the wintering grounds reveals essential aspects of this species' ecology, which subsequently assists with conservation. Using global positioning system telemetry data from marked whooping cranes during 2009–2017, we fit continuous‐time stochastic process models to describe movement and home range using autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE) and explored variation in home range size in relation to age, sex, reproductive status, and drought conditions. We used the Bhattacharyya coefficient of overlap and distance between home range centroids to quantify site fidelity. We examined the effects of time between winter home ranges and the sex of the crane on site fidelity using Bayesian mixed‐effects beta regression. Winter whooping crane 95% AKDE home range size averaged 30.1 ± 45.2 (SD) km² (median = 14.3, range = 1.1–308.6). Home ranges of sub‐adult females were approximately 2 times larger than those of sub‐adult males or families. As drought worsened, home ranges typically expanded. Between consecutive years, the home ranges of an adult crane exhibited 68 ± 31% overlap (site fidelity), but fidelity to winter sites declined in subsequent winters. The overlap of adult home ranges with the nearest unrelated family averaged 33 ± 28%. As a whooping crane aged, overlap with its winter home range as a juvenile declined, regardless of sex. By 4 years of age, a whooping crane had approximately 14 ± 28% overlap with its juvenile winter home range. Limited evidence suggested male whooping cranes return to within 2 km of their juvenile home range by their fifth winter. Previous data obtained from aerial surveys led ecologists to assume that whooping crane families normally used small areas (~2 km²) and expressed persistent site fidelity. Our analyses showed <8% of families had home ranges ≤2 km², with the average area 15 times greater, and waning site fidelity over time. Our work represents an analysis of whooping crane home ranges for this population, identifying past misconceptions of winter space use and resulting in better estimates of space requirements for future conservation efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Geological Survey  cPlatte River Recovery Implementation Program  cJoint Canada‐Alberta Oil Sands Monitoring program  cCanadian Wildlife Service  cCrane Trust  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 3aBayesian theory 3aGrus americana 3aadults 3aautocorrelation 3acoasts 3adrought 3ahome range 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amigratory species 3aphilopatry 3astochastic processes 3atelemetry 3awinter 3aTexas1 aStewart, David R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3103-53721 aHarris, Grant M.1 aBidwell, Mark T.1 aPearse, Aaron Todd,d1976-1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6137-15560 tjournal of wildlife management.g2022 July, v. 86, no. 5 p.e22226-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.222263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245010600161300001600267520131800283592002801601650001901629650001101648650002501659650002901684650002101713650001301734650002201747650001901769650002901788650001601817651001001833700001601843700001501859773007801874856008301952852000902035655001202044IND60096858020221118014624.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009685802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.04.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Wei10aCO₂ emission inventories for Chinese cities in highly urbanized areas compared with European cities  ap. 298-308.  aThe international literature has paid significant attention to presenting China as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the world, despite having much lower per-capita emissions than the global average. In fact, the imbalance of economic development leads to diversity in GHG emissions profiles in different areas of China. This paper employs a common methodology, consistent with the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) approved by the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), to estimate CO₂ emissions of four Chinese cities in highly urbanized areas from 2004 to 2010. The results show that the CO₂ emissions of all four cities are still rising and that secondary industries emit the most CO₂ in these cities. By comparing these data with the inventory results of two European cities, this paper further reveals that Chinese cities in highly urbanized areas contribute much higher per-capita emissions than their European competitors. Furthermore, the per-capita CO₂ emissions of the residential sector and private transport in these Chinese cities are growing rapidly, some of them approaching the levels of European cities. According to these findings, several policy suggestions considering regional disparities are provided that aim to reduce the CO₂ emissions of highly urbanized areas in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acities 3aeconomic development 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3aprivate sector 3arenewable energy sources 3aurban areas 3aChina1 aPagani, R.,1 aHuang, Lei0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Aug., v. 47 p.298-308dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.04.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
