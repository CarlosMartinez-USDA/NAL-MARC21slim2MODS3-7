A combination of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence spectroscopy, and transmittance spectrophotometry was used. Small amounts of F-DPPC increase the pretransition temperature (Tₚ) between the interdigitated gel phase (LᵦI) and the ripple gel phase (Pᵦ′). There are some signs of immiscibility where the non-interdigitated lipid is present in the phase diagram. However, at around 20mol.% F-DPPC, the pretransition merges with the main transition and is no longer detectable as a separate entity. Additionally, the Tₘ hysteresis increases steadily with higher mole fractions of F-DPPC. These results support that incorporating F-DPPC progressively stabilizes the LᵦI phase of DHPC until the membrane is fully interdigitated below the main transition temperature (Tₘ). The mixtures of F-DPPC and DHPC are miscible once the membrane is entirely interdigitated in the gel phase. Therefore, the ability of both lipids to interdigitate is an important factor controlling gel phase miscibility. Our results also demonstrate that the gel phase behavior of DHPC is highly sensitive to changes in its environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agels 3ahysteresis 3aphospholipids 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3atransmittance1 aDea, Phoebe K.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2012 Dec., v. 165, no. 8 p.818-825dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-30847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03981naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245010900177300001400286500001500300520286400315592002803179650001203207650002103219650001503240650001303255650001803268650001003286650001403296650001503310650002103325653001403346700002603360700002103386773010303407856008803510852000903598655001203607IND60465725320221122063741.0151123e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046572532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3113.2008.00436.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuh, Randall T.,10aPhylogenetic relationships within the Cimicomorpha (Hemiptera: Heteroptera): a total‐evidence analysis  ap. 15-48.  a2019-12-06  aA phylogenetic analysis for the Cimicomorpha was conducted using 92 taxa, including eight outgroups and six species of Thaumastocoridae. Density of taxon sampling allows for tests of relationships at the family level for most taxa, whereas in the Miridae denser sampling allows for doing so on the tribal level. This level of sampling also corresponds with the availability of testable published hypotheses of relationships. Morphological data for 73 characters are coded for all taxa. Approximately 3500 base pairs of DNA were sequenced for the following gene regions for 83 taxa: 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and COI. Results are presented for analysis of morphological data, individual molecular partitions, combined molecular data, combined morphological and molecular data for 83 taxa and combined morphological and molecular data for 92 taxa. Analyses of morphological data were performed using the parsimony programs nona and piwe: molecular and combined data were analysed using direct optimization with the program poy. Major conclusions of the present study include recognition of the following monophyletic groups: The Geocorisae is a monophyletic group. The monophyly of the Cimicomorpha – including Thaumastocoridae – is not supported in most analyses. The Reduviidae is monophyletic, with the Phymatinae Complex being the sister‐group of the remaining subfamilies. The circumscription of the Cimiciformes is altered from the prior conception of Schuh and Štys to also include the Joppeicidae, Microphysidae and Velocipedidae, as well as the recently described family Curaliidae; the monophyly of the Cimiciformes is supported in most analyses; the Cimiciformes is treated as the sister‐group of the Miroidea in most analyses. The monophyly of the Cimicoidea, including Curaliidae, is supported in all analyses including molecular data, whereas Curaliidae is treated as a more basal cimiciform in all other analyses. The monophyly and placement of the Thaumastocoridae is ambiguous across the range of analyses, and the monophyly of the Miroidea sensu Schuh and Štys receives limited support in the combined analyses of morphology + molecular data. The Tingidae and Miridae are each monophyletic and together almost invariably form a monophyletic group. Within the Miridae, several inclusive monophyletic groups at the subfamily/tribal level are more or less consistently recognized when molecular data are included; however, the interrelationships of the subfamilies vary substantially across the range of analyses. Of the individual molecular partitions, only 18S rDNA shows significant congruence with combined analyses of morphological, combined molecular or combined morphological and molecular data. Scenarios are discussed for the evolution of the metathoracic scent‐efferent system and the origin of the fossula spongiosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiridae 3aThaumastocoridae 3aconception 3aTingidae 3aribosomal DNA 3agenes 3amonophyly 3aReduviidae 3afamily relations 0aHemiptera1 aWeirauch, Christiane,1 aWHEELER, WARD C.0 tSystematic entomology.g2009 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.15-48dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2008.00436.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01989naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006500145245007900210300001800289520093500307592002801242650002001270650001001290650001401300650002201314700002001336700002201356700002101378700005401399773013301453856008001586852000901666655001201675IND60767691320221121195603.0220220e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076769132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c014272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDombrowski, Amanda W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9596-263X14aThe Chosen Few: Parallel Library Reaction Methodologies for Drug Discovery  ap. 1880-1897.  aParallel library synthesis is an important tool for drug discovery because it enables the synthesis of closely related analogues in parallel via robust and general synthetic transformations. In this perspective, we analyzed the synthetic methodologies used in >5000 parallel libraries representing 15 prevalent synthetic transformations. The library data set contains complex substrates and diverse arrays of building blocks used over the last 14 years at AbbVie. The library synthetic methodologies that have demonstrated robustness and generality with proven success are described along with their substrate scopes. The evolution of the synthetic methodologies for library synthesis over the past decade is discussed. We also highlight that the combination of parallel library synthesis with high-throughput experimentation will continue to facilitate the discovery of library-amenable synthetic methodologies in drug discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adrugs 3aevolution 3aorganic chemistry1 aAguirre, Ana L.1 aShrestha, Anurupa1 aSarris, Kathy A.1 aWang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9516-34830 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 87, no. 4 p.1880-1897dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c014273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015800172300001600330520098500346592002801331650000801359650001901367650003801386650001101424650003101435650002001466650001601486650001701502650001601519700002001535700001801555700001701573700001501590700001601605700001601621700001701637773011201654856008901766852000901855655001201864IND60093706020221118004918.0141103e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009370602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAleandri, S.12aA DSC investigation on the influence of gemini surfactant stereochemistry on the organization of lipoplexes and on their interaction with model membranes  ap. 838-844.  aPrevious investigations showed that the extent of DNA condensation and the efficiency in the transfection of liposomes formulated with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine and cationic stereomeric gemini surfactants depend heavily on the stereochemistry of the gemini. The influence of the stereochemistry on the interaction of lipoplexes with zwitterionic and anionic cell membrane models was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry to rationalize their different biological behavior. Further, the thermotropic behavior of the corresponding liposomes and of the spontaneous self-assemblies of gemini surfactants in the presence and in the absence of DNA was evaluated to correlate the physicochemical properties of lipoplexes and the stereochemistry of the cationic component. The obtained results show that the stereochemistry of the gemini surfactant controls lipoplexes organization and their mode and kinetic of interaction with different cell membrane models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acell membranes 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3astereochemistry 3asurfactants 3atransfection 3azwitterions1 aBonicelli, M.G.1 aGiansanti, L.1 aGiuliani, C.1 aIerino, M.1 aMancini, G.1 aMartino, A.1 aScipioni, A.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2012 Dec., v. 165, no. 8 p.838-844dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-30847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012900163300001800292520162100310536027601931592002802207596001402235650001502249650001702264650001402281650002002295650002402315650002102339650001102360650002302371650002202394650002402416650001202440650001702452653001202469653002602481653002302507653001102530700001602541700002902557700001902586773010802605856008502713852000902798655001202807IND60719216120221120052343.0201130e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071921612DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2020.17834872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo, IJu10aLinking the association between circRNAs and Alzheimer’s disease progression by multi-tissue circular RNA characterization  ap. 1789-1797.  aAlzheimer’s disease (AD) has devastating consequences for patients during its slow, progressive course. It is important to understand the pathology of AD onset. Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been found to participate in many human diseases including cancers and neurodegenerative conditions. In this study, we mined the published dataset on the AMP-AD Knowledge Portal from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) to describe the circRNA profiles at different AD stages in brain samples from four brain regions: anterior prefrontal cortex, superior temporal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus. In total, we found 147 circRNAs to be differentially expressed (DE) for different AD severity levels in the four regions. We also characterized the mRNA-circRNA co-expression network and annotated the potential function of circRNAs based on the co-expressed modules. Based on our results, we found that the most circRNA-regulated region in AD patients with severe symptoms was the parahippocampal gyrus. The strongest negatively AD severity-correlated module in the parahippocampal gyrus was enriched in cognitive disability and pathological-associated pathways such as synapse organization and regulation of membrane potential. Finally, a regression model based on the expression pattern of DE circRNAs in the module could help to distinguish the disease severity of patients, further supporting a role for circRNAs in AD pathology. In conclusion, our findings indicate that circRNAs in parahippocampal gyrus are possible biomarkers and regulators of AD as well as potential therapeutic targets.  aThis project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 721890.

Understanding consumers’ tastes and attitudes can contribute to proper planning for the production, marketing, and use of medicinal plants. This study aimed at determining factors affecting the consumption of medicinal plants in urban communities in the north of Iran. The instruments used in the study were a questionnaire and a face-to-face interview. The study population included 384 households selected from three districts of Gorgan City, Iran, using the simple sampling method (equal chance to select samples from the community). The collected data were analyzed using an ordinal logit model in SPSS software. The dependent variable was the monthly consumption of medicinal plant products, and the independent variables were household costs, household income, education, advertisement, plant prices, and availability. The results showed that financial power, medicinal plant quality, awareness and knowledge of medicinal plants, and preference of medicinal plants over chemical drugs with a significance level of 95% (p value < 0.05) affected the consumption of medicinal plants in the study area. The study’s results can be used for successful planning in this area based on producers, processors, and marketers of medicinal plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aeducation 3aenvironment 3ahousehold income 3alogit analysis 3amedicinal plants 3aquestionnaires 3aIran1 aFarsi, Raziye1 aFrozeh, Mahammad Rahim1 aPournemati, Ardeshir1 aMirdeilami, Seyedeh Zohreh0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2022 May, v. 24, no. 5 p.7455-7469dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01698-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245008600175300001600261520120000277592002801477650002901505650002701534650001901561650001101580650001701591650001801608650001601626650002701642650001501669650001301684650001601697651001001713653001901723653001001742700002101752700001801773773015801791856008701949852000902036655001202045IND60770602920221119210341.0220319e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077060292DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-0279.2021.00019.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, S. K.,10aEconomic access to groundwater irrigation under alternate energy regimes in Bihar  ap. 111-119.  aWith abundant groundwater resources, Bihar has the potential to harness the positive groundwater and agricultural development linkages by improving the economic access to groundwater irrigation. Using the representative data from Central Groundwater Board and the 5ᵗʰ Minor Irrigation Census, this study has examined the spatio-temporal changes in groundwater level, and compared the groundwater extraction cost under different energy policy regimes. The analysis shows a stable groundwater level in large parts of the state. The majority of the groundwater pumps are dependent on diesel energy, which is more than four times costlier than electric energy. Electric pumps are economical than diesel pumps even without the power subsidy. As the power supply in the state has been improving, farmers can significantly reduce irrigation costs by shifting to electric pumps. Among the electric pump owners, farmers with metered pricing (pro-rata) incur less energy cost as compared to flat-rate pricing. Bihar presently has both flat and pro-rata based pricing policies for electric pumps, leading to a trade-off between economic and equity aspects of groundwater use which needs to be optimized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural economics 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenergy policy 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3airrigation 3aresearch 3awater table 3aIndia 0aPricing policy 0aBihar1 aKishore, Avinash1 aSingh, Jaspal0 tAgricultural economics research review.g2021 June, v. 34, no. conf p.111-119dAgricultural Economics Research AssociationwJournal:2081x0974-02797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-0279.2021.00019.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007300168520123000241592002801471650001201499650001201511650001101523650001001534650002201544650001201566650001601578651001001594653002201604653002301626653002901649653003301678653001501711700001601726700001501742773009801757856008501855852000901940655001201949IND60680680420221119194141.0200217e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068068042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.1021502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Shengjun10aExport structures, income inequality and urban-rural divide in China  aRecent literature has linked export upgrading to income inequality, and found that regions exporting more sophisticated products tend to have lower levels of income inequality. Here, we extend the literature by stressing that regional income inequality is shaped not only by export product structure but also by export destination structure. We further scale down our analysis to the intra-regional level, and examine urban-rural inequality within a region. Few have related urban-rural inequality to export upgrading and a region's export product/destination structures. Hence, we contribute to the current literature by examining how regional export product/destination structures have shaped income inequality in general and urban-rural inequality in particular. Based on China's export data and income survey data, we show that export upgrading only contributes to the reduction of income inequality in China's urban areas. Urban-rural inequality tends to be more severe in regions that have more complex export product/destination structures, due to the concentration of export activities in urban areas and to some barriers that inhibits the flow of input factors (e.g. capital and labor) between rural and urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aexports 3aincome 3alabor 3asocial inequality 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aChina 0aIncome inequality 0aUrban-rural divide 0aExport product structure 0aExport destination structure 0aComplexity1 aYu, Changda1 aHe, Canfei0 tApplied geography.g2020 Feb., v. 115 p.102150-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.1021503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011100164300001800275520094100293592002801234650001501262650001101277650002501288650002301313650002101336650001601357700002201373773014401395856008301539852000901622655001201631IND60775199720221118223359.0220422e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077519972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-021-01701-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe, Canh Q.10aOptimal economic restructuring to reduce carbon emissions intensity using the projected gradient algorithm  ap. 6271-6287.  aThis paper proposes the projected gradient algorithm to find a solution that allows economic restructuring to minimize carbon emission intensity and not hinder targeted economic growth. It develops a general formula to calculate how much each sector should change its share in gross domestic products and its emission intensity such that the economy can have a lower aggregate emission intensity without hindering economic growth. Used data for 30 nations during 1997–2009, the study indicates that if a country follows this proposed optimal restructuring solution, it experiences a lower carbon emission intensity than its initial scenario. This solution is helpful to (1) find the optimal direction and quantitative solutions of a low emission economic structure; (2) continuously check and quantify the differences between the optimal and actual directions of economic structuring for adjusting economic and environmental policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic structure 3aemissions factor 3aenvironment1 aBui, Hoang-Mai T.0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2022 May, v. 24, no. 5 p.6271-6287dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01701-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006100169300001800230520087700248592002801125650001501153650001301168650001001181650001401191650002701205650001401232650001001246650001001256650000901266650001601275650000901291650001801300653001901318653001701337653002001354653001801374700001701392700001601409700001801425700001901443773012501462856008601587852000901673655001201682IND60773962520221119082520.0220420e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077396252DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2020.17644582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGogoi, Munmee10aMultifunctional Finishing of Woolens with Lemongrass Oil  ap. 1353-1365.  aIn the reported work, lemongrass oil was coated on the wool fabrics to impart multifunctional finish.

The coated fabrics were characterized using SEM, EDX, FTIR and computer color matching in addition to mechanical and handle associated properties. The effect of coating was analyzed on the three functional properties viz., moth repellence, UV protection and aroma of the fabric. During the moth repellence test, the lemongrass treated wool fabrics showed higher moth mortality (80%) and less weight loss (14%). The UV protection factor (UPF) was also found higher (127) than the untreated wool fabric (44). The coated fabrics retained aroma even after 90 days of storage. This environment-friendly fabric coating can be applied to different types of woolen products and other textiles for value addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbopogon 3achitosan 3acolor 3acomputers 3across-linking reagents 3amortality 3amoths 3aodors 3aoils 3aweight loss 3awool 3awoolen fabric 0aLemongrass oil 0aaroma finish 0amoth repellence 0aUV protection1 aKadam, Vinod1 aJose, Seiko1 aShakyawar, DB1 aKalita, Binita0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 19, no. 4 p.1353-1365dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2020.17644583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009400173500001400267520087000281592002801151650002701179650001401206650002101220650001901241650001401260650001301274653001101287653001901298653003101317653003501348700005601383773011301439856008601552852000901638655001201647IND60714067020221118095735.0210108e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071406702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolppanen, Sakari14aThe effect of values on carbon footprint and attitudes towards pro-environmental behavior  aNAL-light  aValues are a key determinant of pro-environmental behavior, but we argue that environmental lifestyle is not determined only by primary values, but rather, a combination of a primary and secondary value, which we call value-pairs. In this study we find three different types of value-pairs, each with different kinds of carbon footprints and willingness to take pro-environmental action. The value-pairs show that bioshperic values, when a primary or secondary value, are a strong determinant of a low-carbon lifestyle and even as a secondary value can override primary hedonic values. We also find that altruistic values only result in low-carbon lifestyles when paired with biospheric values, but not when paired with hedonic values. The significance of the findings is discussed in relation to previous research, the goal-framing theory and the spillover effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiosphere 3acarbon footprint 3ahedonic scales 3alifestyle 3aresearch 0aValues 0aClimate change 0aPro-environmental behavior 0aAttitudes & willingness to act1 aKang, Jingoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7391-31130 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 282 p.124524-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011700177300001400294520104300308592002801351650001301379650002401392650001101416650001201427650001701439650001801456650001701474650001501491650002601506650001101532650001201543650002301555650002801578650003101606650001101637650002401648653002401672653001101696653001801707653001101725653003301736700002101769700006101790773010401851856008701955852000902042655001202051IND60526703220221118123509.0190409e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052670322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.01.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrmann, Christiane10aBiogas crops grown in energy crop rotations: Linking chemical composition and methane production characteristics  ap. 23-35.  aMethane production characteristics and chemical composition of 405 silages from 43 different crop species were examined using uniform laboratory methods, with the aim to characterise a wide range of crop feedstocks from energy crop rotations and to identify main parameters that influence biomass quality for biogas production. Methane formation was analysed from chopped and over 90days ensiled crop biomass in batch anaerobic digestion tests without further pre-treatment. Lignin content of crop biomass was found to be the most significant explanatory variable for specific methane yields while the methane content and methane production rates were mainly affected by the content of nitrogen-free extracts and neutral detergent fibre, respectively. The accumulation of butyric acid and alcohols during the ensiling process had significant impact on specific methane yields and methane contents of crop silages. It is proposed that products of silage fermentation should be considered when evaluating crop silages for biogas production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abiomass 3abutyric acid 3acrop rotation 3aenergy crops 3afeedstocks 3alaboratory techniques 3alignin 3amethane 3amethane production 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aphysicochemical properties 3asilage 3asilage fermentation 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aSilage 0aMethane yield 0aLignin 0aMultiple regression analyses1 aIdler, Christine1 aHeiermann, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9854-27340 tBioresource technology.g2016 Apr., v. 206 p.23-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.01.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245007300171300001600244520127300260592002801533650003101561650001401592650001201606650001101618650001901629650002801648650001701676650001201693650001001705650002001715650000901735650001901744650001301763650001701776650001201793650002001805650002301825653001801848653002601866653001901892653001701911653001901928700005701947773013102004856008302135852000902218655001202227IND60553929220221118201344.0161023e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055392922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2015.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliver, John W.K.12aA carbon sink pathway increases carbon productivity in cyanobacteria  ap. 106-112.  aThe burning of fossil reserves, and subsequent release of carbon into the atmosphere is depleting the supply of carbon-based molecules used for synthetic materials including plastics, oils, medicines, and glues. To provide for future society, innovations are needed for the conversion of waste carbon (CO2) into organic carbon useful for materials. Chemical production directly from photosynthesis is a nascent technology, with great promise for capture of CO2 using sunlight. To improve low yields, it has been proposed that photosynthetic capacity can be increased by a relaxation of bottlenecks inherent to growth. The limits of carbon partitioning away from growth within the cell and the effect of partitioning on carbon fixation are not well known. Here we show that expressing genes in a pathway between carbon fixation and pyruvate increases partitioning to 2,3-butanediol (23BD) and leads to a 1.8-fold increase in total carbon yield in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Specific 2,3-butanediol production increases 2.4-fold. As partitioning increases beyond 30%, it leads to a steep decline in total carbon yield. The data suggests a local maximum for carbon partitioning from the Calvin Benson cycle that is scalable with light intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechococcus sp.

Backward selection based on polycross testing assumes equal male reproductive success and true half-sib progeny. The main objectives of this study were, firstly, to investigate the departure from these assumptions in a maritime pine polycross trial and, secondly, to evaluate the consequences for heritability and breeding values estimations. A total of 984 offspring from 98 half-sib families was genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphism markers to recover the full pedigree. Paternity was assigned successfully for 89 % of the offspring at a 99 % confidence level. We thus concluded there was an 11 % pollen contamination rate, assuming contamination when no genotype from the polymix composition could be identified as a father. The paternal contribution to the offspring varied among the males, but the departure from half-sib assumption was moderate since the average genetic correlation within the family was 0.26. Heritability and breeding values for girth at breast height and stem sweep were estimated using individual-tree mixed models with either partial or full pedigree information. The results highlighted a minor bias in heritability estimation due to unknown paternity, as well as a high correlation for estimated breeding values between the partial and full pedigree models, suggesting that the genetic merit of the parental generation for backward selection was adequately predicted using the partial pedigree model. Finally, pedigree recovery was also discussed in a perspective of forward selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinaster 3abreeding value 3aforest trees 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic merit 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aheritability 3amales 3amating systems 3amodels 3apaternity 3apedigree 3apollen 3aprogeny 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atree breeding1 aPlomion, Christophe1 aHarvengt, Luc1 aRaffin, Annie1 aBoury, Christophe1 aBouffier, Laurent0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2015 Oct., v. 11, no. 5 p.105-105dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1614-29427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-015-0932-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011800177520156300295592002801858650001301886650001301899650002301912650001401935650002501949650002701974650001702001650001802018650001002036650001202046650002002058650001302078650001302091650001702104653002802121653001202149653002602161653001702187653002302204653001802227653002202245700006502267773010802332856008602440852000902526655001202535IND60680680620221119194210.0200320e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068068062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1158252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllebracht, Nathan C.10aFunctionalized cellulose nanofibril aerogels as cooperative acid–base organocatalysts for liquid flow reactions  aCellulose nanomaterial aerogels are macroscopic porous solids with relatively high surface areas and are thus an interesting basis for renewable catalyst materials. Cross-linked acid–base bifunctional catalyst aerogels are produced here from TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCNF) and demonstrated in both batch and flow catalysis. Recently established acid–base modification for catalysis is expanded upon for chemical or physical cross-linking with small molecules and polymers. Low density and relatively high surface area (up to 74 m² g⁻¹) aerogel catalysts are produced with a variety of processing approaches and then freeze-dried from water or tert-butyl alcohol/water mixtures. Finer pore structure and increased surface area are achieved with tert-butyl alcohol as co-solvent. Chemical cross-linking improved aerogel stability to solvents. Homogeneous and aerogel TOCNF catalysts are shown to be effective acid–base cooperative catalysts for aldol condensation reactions in batch reactions. Continuous flow reactions are performed with glass column reactors packed with aerogel catalysts that showed improved rates relative to batch experiments, while also demonstrating physical stability. Catalyst deactivation in flow reactions is observed and observations of deactivation support previously reported mechanisms of site poisoning by competitive chemisorption of reactants in analogous acid–base catalysts. This report is a key demonstration of cellulose nanofibril aerogels for catalysis in continuous liquid flow reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3aalcohols 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acondensation reactions 3acrosslinking 3afreeze drying 3aglass 3aliquids 3aorganocatalysts 3apolymers 3asolvents 3asurface area 0aCellulose nanomaterials 0aAerogel 0aAcid–base catalysis 0aFlow reactor 0aAldol condensation 0aCross-linking 0aFunctionalization1 aJones, Christopher W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3255-57910 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 233 p.115825-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1158253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003800153245009600191300001600287520132800303592002801631650002101659650001801680650001601698650001701714650001801731650001101749650001001760650001201770650002201782650002001804650001001824650001101834650001101845650001501856650001301871650001901884650002101903650002601924650002001950650002201970650002001992650002902012650002602041650002202067653000702089653000802096653000702104653000702111653001802118653002102136653001202157653002102169653002602190653002702216700002202243700004102265700003302306700002702339700002502366700002702391700002802418773012102446856008802567852000902655655001202664IND60589558620221118230042.0190318e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058955862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuedes, Fernanda Alves de Freitas10aTranscriptional memory contributes to drought tolerance in coffee (Coffea canephora) plants  ap. 220-233.  aWater deprivation is an important limiting factor in the productivity of crops like coffee. In addition to transcription factors (TFs) and small non-coding RNAs, transcriptional memory seems to act in gene expression modulation during plant drought response. Here, a RNA-Seq approach was used to investigate the drought responses of Coffea canephora clones 109 and 120, which are respectively sensitive and tolerant to drought. Illumina sequencing allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the tolerant (826) and sensitive (135) clones and their enriched categories. Our results indicate that the sensitive clone may trigger an oxidative stress response, possibly leading to programmed cell death, when exposed to multiple drought episodes. The acclimation of tolerant plants, on the other hand, seems to involve antioxidant secondary metabolism and the ABA response. Most importantly, 49 memory genes were identified in the tolerant clone. They were mainly linked to the ABA pathway, protein folding and biotic stress. Small RNA profiling also identified regulatory microRNAs in coffee leaves, including hundreds of putative novel ones. Our findings strongly suggest that transcriptional memory modulates the expression of drought-responsive genes and contributes to drought tolerance in C. canephora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea canephora 3aabscisic acid 3aacclimation 3aantioxidants 3abiotic stress 3aclones 3acrops 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3amemory 3ametabolism 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aoxidative stress 3aprogrammed cell death 3aprotein folding 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3awater deprivation 0aCq 0aDEG 0aFC 0aTF 0aAbscisic acid 0aCoffea canephora 0aDrought 0aOxidative stress 0aReceptor-like kinases 0aTranscriptional memory1 aNobres, Priscilla1 aRodrigues Ferreira, Daniela Cristina1 aMenezes-Silva, Paulo Eduardo1 aRibeiro-Alves, Marcelo1 aCorrea, Régis Lopes1 aDaMatta, Fábio Murilo1 aAlves-Ferreira, Márcio0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2018 Mar., v. 147 p.220-233dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04404naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245009900199300001600298500002000314506002800334520243200362592002802794596002702822596004902849506003702898650000902935650002202944650002002966650001502986650001303001650002403014650002003038650002003058650002003078650002603098650002203124650002303146650001003169650002603179650001803205650002603223650002103249650001903270650001503289650001603304650001203320650002203332650001603354650003703370651001403407651001103421651001803432700003003450700002803480700001803508700002503526773011903551856007503670852000903745655001203754IND60750472120221207114527.0220826e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075047212DNAL7 a10.1002/ppp3.101932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1774-161714aThe function of root mat fungal communities: Changes in response to pH and phosphorus addition  ap. 653-666.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aAcid deposition affects forests in eastern North America, Europe, and eastern Asia, and reduces nutrient availability for forest trees. Reduced nutrient availability can reduce tree growth and forest productivity. Our research suggests that trees may rely on fungi, including mycorrhizal fungi, that colonize root mats near the soil surface for nutrient acquisition in forests subjected to acid‐induced nutrient limitation. These fungi may increase acquisition of nutrients from organic matter. Forest management practices that limit surface soil disturbance and damage to root mats, especially during timber harvesting activities, may be important for conserving forest productivity in regions subjected to acid deposition. SUMMARY: Many temperate forest soils are affected by a legacy of acid deposition, which can mobilize soil aluminum and reduce phosphorus (P) availability. These chemical changes are mostly manifest in mineral soil. However, many temperate trees have extensive shallow roots, or root mats, which are found on the surface of mineral soil. These root mats are in contact with the O horizon where substantial organic nutrients exist. But the role of root mats in accessing nutrients in nutrient limited, acidic soil is not well understood. We examined root mat fungal communities and their function using an existing 6‐year ecosystem‐level pH and P manipulation experiment, which artificially increased pH by more than 1.5 units and increased available P threefold. Dominant fungal taxa on roots were identified using Sanger sequencing and broad community changes were assessed using DNA fragment analysis. Nutrient acquisition within root mats was assessed by measuring the extracellular enzyme activity in rhizosphere soil. Fungal community structure changed with soil pH, while P availability altered extracellular enzyme production of phosphomonoesterase, β‐1,4‐glucosidase, and leucine aminopeptidase. Quercus–Fagus root mats contained ectomycorrhizal fungi and Acer roots contained both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Interestingly, both Acer and Quercus–Fagus root mats contained ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, which were less abundant at higher pH. Our results suggest an important role of root mats in nutrient acquisition from organic sources in temperate forests. These root mats could assist plants in overcoming the legacy of acid deposition in temperate forests.  aPublisher supplied data  cHolden Arboretum Trust  cCorning Institute for Education and Research0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcer 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacid deposition 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3acommunity structure 3adisturbed soils 3aectomycorrhizae 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3aforest management 3afungal communities 3afungi 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3amineral soils 3anutrient availability 3aorganic horizons 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3arhizosphere 3asoil pH 3atemperate forests 3atree growth 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aEast Asia 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aCarrino‐Kyker, Sarah R.1 aChervenak, Catherine F.1 aHoke, Adam J.1 aHewins, Charlotte R.0 tPlants, people, planet.g2021 Sept., v. 3, no. 5 p.653-666dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27661x2572-26117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.101933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009000171500001400261520134100275592002801616650001301644650001901657650001401676650001701690650001101707650001901718650002501737650001601762650002201778650001601800650001201816650001101828653001901839653001901858653002601877653001401903700002501917700006101942773011302003856008602116852000902202655001202211IND60714067420221118100218.0210108e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071406742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, Sergio,10aComparative life cycle assessment of high performance lithium-sulfur battery cathodes  aNAL-light  aLithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries present a great potential to displace current energy storage chemistries thanks to their energy density that goes far beyond conventional batteries. To promote the development of greener Li–S batteries, closing the existing gap between the quantification of the potential environmental impacts associated with Li–S cathodes and their performance is required. Herein we show a comparative analysis of the life cycle environmental impacts of five Li–S battery cathodes with high sulfur loadings (1.5–15 mg·cm⁻²) through life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and cradle-to-gate boundary. Depending on the selected battery, the environmental impact can be reduced by a factor up to 5. LCA results from Li–S batteries are compared with the conventional lithium ion battery from Ecoinvent 3.6 database, showing a decreased environmental impact per kWh of storage capacity. A predominant role of the electrolyte on the environmental burdens associated with the use of Li–S batteries was also found. Sensitivity analysis shows that the specific impacts can be reduced by up to 70% by limiting the amount of used electrolyte. Overall, this manuscript emphasizes the potential of Li–S technology to develop environmentally benign batteries aimed at replacing existing energy storage systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acradle-to-gate 3adatabases 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aenvironmental impact 3aexhibitions 3alithium batteries 3amethodology 3astorage 3asulfur 0aEnergy storage 0aLi–S battery 0aLife cycle assessment 0aEcodesign1 aAkizu-Gardoki, Ortzi1 aLizundia, Erlantz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4013-27210 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 282 p.124528-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03946naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245004300160300001600203500002000219520249900239592002802738650002302766650002602789650002402815650001902839650001202858650002202870650002902892650001702921650001702938650002002955650001102975650001402986650001203000650000803012650001203020650001003032650001303042650001003055650001103065651001103076651001803087651001103105651001203116651001403128651001403142651001103156651001103167773013203178856007303310852000903383655001203392IND60587558020221117213154.0180102e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058755802DNAL7 a10.1890/06-0624.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarington, C. R.14aThe evolution of arctic marine mammals  ap. S23-S40.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis review deals only with the evolutionary history of core Arctic marine mammals: polar bear (Ursus maritimus), walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandica), ringed seal (Phoca hispida), bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), white whale (Delphinapterus leucas), and narwhal (Monodon monoceras). Sections on the evolutionary background of pinnipeds and whales help to provide a better perspective on these core species. Polar bears stemmed from brown bears about the Early to Middle Pleistocene. Fossils are rare; the earliest records are from approximately Early Weichselian deposits of Kew Bridge, London, and Svalbard. Existing Pacific and Atlantic walruses probably arose from splitting of a former Holarctic range during a Pleistocene glacial phase of extensive sea ice in the Canadian Arctic. The earliest known bearded seal remains are from Early to Middle Pleistocene deposits of Norfolk, England, and Cape Deceit, Alaska. Other Pleistocene fossils of this species are recorded from the North Sea, southwestern Sweden, and the Champlain Sea that existed in eastern North America approximately 12000–10000 BP. The harp seal is the commonest pinniped in the Weichselian deposits of the southern North Sea. The earliest recorded fossil is from about 2 million years ago (2 Ma), from Ocean Point, Alaska. The earliest known Pleistocene ringed seal fossils are from last interglacial deposits near Teshekpuk Lake, Alaska, and Thule, Greenland, although an earlier (3 Ma?) specimen from Malaspina, Alaska, has been reported. This species seems to have been relatively abundant along the coasts of Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, during the Last Glacial Maximum. The bowhead whale probably originated in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The earliest (mid‐Wisconsinan) Canadian remains are from Ellesmere and Devon islands. More than 400 radiocarbon‐dated bowhead remains have been used to reconstruct Holocene sea ice history in the Canadian Arctic. White whales are common in the late warming stage (approximately 10500 BP) of the Champlain Sea and are one of the commonest marine mammal fossils in Late Pleistocene North Sea deposits. Fourteen narwhal specimens of Late Glacial or Early Holocene age are known from Atlantic Canada, as well as Ellesmere, Baffin, and Prince of Wales islands in Arctic Canada. Arctic marine mammals have tended to shift to more southerly ranges during glacial phases of the Pleistocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalaena mysticetus 3aDelphinapterus leucas 3aErignathus barbatus 3aHolocene epoch 3aMonodon 3aOdobenus rosmarus 3aPagophilus groenlandicus 3aPusa hispida 3aUrsus arctos 3aUrsus maritimus 3acoasts 3aevolution 3afossils 3aice 3aislands 3alakes 3alatitude 3aseals 3awhales 3aAlaska 3aArctic region 3aCanada 3aEngland 3aGreenland 3aNorth Sea 3aNorway 3aSweden0 tEcological applications.g2008 Mar., v. 18, no. sp2 p.S23-S40dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-0624.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245006300168300001800231500001900249500002000268520123700288592002801525596006001553596004901613596002901662650001001691650001501701650002001716650001701736650002401753650002501777650001101802650001401813650001901827650001401846700001801860700006101878773011501939856007302054852000902127655001202136IND60739516820221120023720.0210530e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073951682DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.152222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalinas‐Giegé, Thalia10aCyanophora paradoxa mitochondrial tRNAs play a double game  ap. 1105-1115.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPresent‐day mitochondria derive from a single endosymbiosis of an α‐proteobacterium into a proto‐eukaryotic cell. Since this monophyletic event, mitochondria have evolved considerably, and unique traits have been independently acquired in the different eukaryotic kingdoms. Mitochondrial genome expression and RNA metabolism have diverged greatly. Here, Cyanophora paradoxa, a freshwater alga considered as a living fossil among photosynthetic organisms, represents an exciting model for studying the evolution of mitochondrial gene expression. As expected, fully mature tRNAs are released from primary transcripts to function in mitochondrial translation. We also show that these tRNAs take part in an mRNA processing punctuation mechanism in a non‐conventional manner, leading to mRNA–tRNA hybrids with a CCA triplet at their 3′‐extremities. In this case, tRNAs are probably used as stabilizing structures impeding the degradation of mRNA by exonucleases. From our data we propose that the present‐day tRNA‐like elements (t‐elements) found at the 3′‐terminals of mitochondrial mRNAs in land plants originate from true tRNAs like those observed in the mitochondria of this basal photosynthetic glaucophyte.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐11‐LABX‐0057cFrench National Research Agency  cCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique  cUniversity of Strasbourg 3aalgae 3afreshwater 3agene expression 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genes 3amitochondrial genome 3amodels 3amonophyly 3aphotosynthesis 3asymbiosis1 aUbrig, Elodie1 aDrouard, Laurence1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6537-524X0 tplant journal.g2021 May, v. 106, no. 4 p.1105-1115dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.152223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01739naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007600169300001600245520063600261592002800897650002700925650002100952650001700973650001200990650002201002650001301024651001001037653001701047653001001064653001401074653001701088700001801105773015801123856008701281852000901368655001201377IND60770603520221120034242.0220319e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077060352DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-0279.2021.00025.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiraj Kumar,10aOptions of promoting seeds of biofortified crops: A case study of Bihar  ap. 175-182.  aExtracting from the policy documents related to the seed production and distribution, seed marketing and distribution networks, and the focussed group discussions and workshops this paper identifies options of promoting seeds of biofortified crops in the Indian state of Bihar.

However, the effective design of reserves must account for the spatial scales of larval dispersal that affect the demography of communities over ecological time frames. Ecologically relevant distances of dispersal were inferred from DNA microsatellite data in a broadcast‐spawning (Acropora tenuis) and a brooding (Seriatopora hystrix) coral at isolated reef systems off northwest Australia. Congruent with expectations based on life histories, levels of genetic subdivision among populations were markedly higher in the brooder than in the broadcast spawner. Additionally, significant subdivision for both species between systems (>100 km), and between (>10 km) or within reefs (<10 km) within systems, indicated that many reefs or reef patches are demographically independent. There was also a clear distinction in the scale of genetic structure between the different systems; at the more geographically complex of the systems, a much finer scale structure was detected in both species. This suggested that the hydrodynamics associated with these complex reefs restrict distances regularly traveled by larvae. The primary implication is that short‐term recovery of these coral communities after severe disturbance requires the input of larvae from viable communities kilometers to a few tens of kilometers away. Therefore, to be self‐sustaining, we suggest that coral reef protected areas need to be large enough to encompass these routine dispersal distances. Further, to facilitate recovery from severe disturbances, protected areas need to be replicated over these spatial scales. However, specific designs also need to account for size, complexity, and isolation of reefs, which will either restrict or enhance dispersal within this range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcropora tenuis 3aDNA 3abrooders 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3ademography 3ahydrodynamics 3alarvae 3alife history 3amicrosatellite repeats 3areserve networks 3aAustralia1 aSmith, Luke D.1 aVan Oppen, Madeleine J.

In combined-stress environments, plants exhibit novel genetic architecture for growth traits and physiological responses can display synergistic effects. Synergistic responses have been used to optimize agronomic production and recommendations for adaptation to weather and field conditions can be used to improve selective breeding for higher yielding crops. We hypothesized that alterations in hormone balance would alter phenotypic responses to abiotic and crowding stress in a genotype-specific manner. We investigated the role of plant growth regulators in modulating combined-stress growth responses in Zea mays. Maize inbreds were exposed to all single, double and triple combinations of the following stressors in a field environment: drought, nitrogen deprivation, and increased plant density. Growth regulator chemical treatments were applied in a factorial design using a range of inbred genotypes. We found significant differences between the seed weights of plants given different chemical treatments and when single-stress environments were compared to combined stress environments. Different inbred genotypes exhibited contrasting patterns of response to combined stress and plant growth regulator treatment. Plant growth regulators altered combined-stress response pathways in maize inbreds; predictions of growth regulator effects would be improved by better characterization of stress environments and genotype-environment interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aZea mays 3achemical treatment 3acorn 3adrought 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrowth traits 3anitrogen 3aphenotype 3aphysiological response 3aplant density 3aplant growth substances 3aplant response 3aprediction 3aseeds 3aselection methods 3asynergism 0aZero-inflated non-parametric trend test 0aHormones 0aAbiotic stress combinations 0aPaclobutrazol 0aUniconazole 0aGibberellic acid 0aPropiconazole1 aWang, Y.1 aStapleton, A.E.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2018 Mar., v. 147 p.179-188dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013400166300001200300520159700312592002801909650002001937650000901957650002101966650001201987650002001999650001002019650001102029650001002040650001402050650001902064650001302083650002302096650002002119650001602139700001802155700001702173700001802190700001802208773010902226856008102335852000902416655001202425IND60440138020221118092143.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044013802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-015-0938-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Sayed10aGenome-wide identification, characterization, and expression analysis of the dehydrin gene family in Asian pear (Pyrus pyrifolia)  ap. 110.  aDehydrins (DHNs) are a complex family of plant proteins that play an important role in protection of higher plant cells from dehydration and desiccation damage during environmental stresses, such as drought, high salinity, and low temperature. However, information on DHN genes of Asian pear (Pyrus pyrifolia), an economically important fruit crop grown in temperate regions in East Asia, e.g., China and Japan, is limited. To gain insights into this gene family in pear and to elucidate their roles in floral buds under low-temperature conditions, we performed a genome-wide identification, characterization, and expression analysis of DHN genes. Seven PpDHN genes were identified. Sequence alignment analysis of all putative proteins from these genes showed that all of the proteins contained a typical K-domain. These genes were categorized into SKₙ, YₙSKₙ, YKₙ, and Kₙ groups based on gene characterization and phylogenetic relationships. Hierarchical cluster analyses showed that in non-stressed pear, PpDHN genes were expressed in all vegetative tissues except young leaves and shoot tips, in which PpDHN1, PpDHN2, and PpDHN4 were not expressed. Transcript levels of four PpDHN genes increased significantly in floral buds in response to low-temperature treatment, which indicated that they play important roles during stress adaptation. This study provides evidence that the family of pear DHN genes may function in tissue development and stress responses.

However, there is no unanimous opinion on the relationship between bank credit to agriculture and industry, and economic growth. An attempt has been made to investigate the role of bank credit to agriculture and industry, and capital outlay on the per capita net state domestic product of India. To investigate such a relationship this study uses panel data regression techniques on different regions of India using the data from statistical handbook on Indian Economy published by RBI. The study finds that the fixed effect model is better than the random effect model and expansion of commercial banks credit to agriculture significantly and positively influences the per capita net state domestic product. Banks credit to the industry and capital outlay are not playing any significant role in stimulating per capita net state domestic product in various regions of India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3acapital 3acredit 3aeconomic development 3aindustry 3aresearch 3astatistical models 3aIndia0 tAgricultural economics research review.g2021 June, v. 34, no. conf p.196-196dAgricultural Economics Research AssociationwJournal:2081x0974-02797nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245008900170300001800259520176600277592002802043650002102071650002802092650002502120650001602145650002502161650002002186650002202206650001702228650001102245650002502256653001902281653001302300653001102313653001402324653001802338700001902356700001802375700001602393700001602409700001902425773013602444856008802580852000902668655001202677IND60635817220221122185256.0190502e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063581722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.4552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yuying10aEffect of bisphenol A and pentachlorophenol on different enzymes of activated sludge  ap. 1170-1178.  aThe relevant information on the impacts of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) on the ecological environment, especially on the group of more vulnerable activated sludge is relatively less. In order to track biological activity of the aerobic sludge which is the most extended biological stage in the process of waste water treatment, the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) on urease, invertase and dehydrogenase were analyzed by spectrophotometry. It was found that the effects of BPA on urease and invertase mainly showed activation. The maximum relative impact rate on urease and invertase reached +91.7% and +182.3% respectively. The influence of BPA on dehydrogenase was observed to show visible inhibition. The maximum relative impact rate of BPA on dehydrogenase reached −89.9%. Effect of PCP on 3 kinds of enzyme were included activation (+) and inhibition (−) with different periods and concentration of exposure experiments. The maximum of the relative impact rates were +41.2% and −19.6% for urease, +84% and −76.8% for invertase, +18.0% and −54.8% for dehydrogenase respectively. Based on evaluating the sensitivity of physiological and biochemical indicators, and the accuracy of analytical methods as well, invertase activity could be recommended as a sensitive index for characterization of activated sludge. The obtained results could be used to analyze the potential impact of EOCs on ecological environment and even social and economic activities with significant information collected. It is helpful to serve as the basis for implementing relevant environmental regulatory and making decision, and for the relating enterprises to cope with adverse changes induced by community function under stress instantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3abioactive properties 3abisphenol A 3abusiness enterprises 3aenzyme activity 3apentachlorophenol 3aspectroscopy 3aurease 3awastewater treatment 0aAerobic sludge 0aActivity 0aUrease 0aInvertase 0aDehydrogenase1 aZhao, Jingjing1 aWang, Lingwei1 aWang, Haoqi1 aZou, Xuejun1 aZhang, Jingang0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 25, v. 671 p.1170-1178dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.4553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010300156300001800259500001900277500002000296520168200316592002801998596009502026596006602121596005902187596005902246650002302305650002002328650002302348650002002371650001302391650001102404650001502415650001902430650001902449650001402468700005602482700001502538700001202553700001302565700001602578700001202594700002602606700005202632773011502684856007302799852000902872655001202881IND60739517220221123035724.0210530e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073951722DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.152272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qintao10aGenome engineering of Nannochloropsis with hundred‐kilobase fragment deletions by Cas9 cleavages  ap. 1148-1162.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIndustrial microalgae are promising photosynthetic cell factories, yet tools for large‐scale targeted genome engineering are limited. Here for the model industrial oleaginous microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica, we established a method to precisely and serially delete large genome fragments of ~100 kb from its 30.01 Mb nuclear genome. We started by identifying the ‘non‐essential’ chromosomal regions (i.e. low expression region or LER) based on minimal gene expression under N‐replete and N‐depleted conditions. The largest such LER (LER1) is ~98 kb in size, located near the telomere of the 502.09‐kb‐long Chromosome 30 (Chr 30). We deleted 81 kb and further distal and proximal deletions of up to 110 kb (21.9% of Chr 30) in LER1 by dual targeting the boundaries with the episome‐based CRISPR/Cas9 system. The telomere‐deletion mutants showed normal telomeres consisting of CCCTAA repeats, revealing telomere regeneration capability after losing the distal part of Chr 30. Interestingly, the deletions caused no significant alteration in growth, lipid production or photosynthesis (transcript‐abundance change for < 3% genes under N depletion). We also achieved double‐deletion of both LER1 and LER2 (from Chr 9) that total ~214 kb at maximum, which can result in slightly higher growth rate and biomass productivity than the wild‐type. Therefore, loss of the large, yet ‘non‐essential’ regions does not necessarily sacrifice important traits. Such serial targeted deletions of large genomic regions had not been previously reported in microalgae, and will accelerate crafting minimal genomes as chassis for photosynthetic production.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020VBA0032cChinese Academy of Sciences President’s International Fellowship Initiative  a2018YFA0902500cNational Key Research and Development Program  a31425002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31800071cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aNannochloropsis 3abiomass production 3agene expression 3agenomics 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3anuclear genome 3aphotosynthesis 3atelomeres1 aGong, Yanhai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2459-87241 aHe, Yuehui1 aXin, Yi1 aLv, Nana1 aDu, Xuefeng1 aLi, Yun1 aJeong, Byeong‐ryool1 aXu, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0548-84770 tplant journal.g2021 May, v. 106, no. 4 p.1148-1162dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.152273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245007400179300001800253520063000271536017500901592002801076650001201104650001201116650001101128650001301139650002401152650001601176650001101192653001101203653001801214653002801232700002101260700002901281700002301310773012501333856008601458852000901544655001201553IND60773963420221119082356.0220420e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077396342DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2020.17766652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriyadarshana, R.W.I.B.10aBiowaste Management: Banana Fiber Utilization for Product Development  ap. 1461-1471.  aBanana is a crop that is primarily cultivated for its fruit, mainly in the tropical countries of the world.

Although several studies have demonstrated that CYC2 genes partake in regulating floral morphogenesis in Asteraceae, the evolution of capitulum forms within a recently diverging lineage has remained poorly understood. Here, we study the molecular regulation of the shift from a radiate to a disciform capitulum within the Chrysanthemum group. This is a recently radiating group mainly comprising two genera, Chrysanthemum and Ajania, that are phylogenetically intermingled but distinct in flowerhead morphology: Chrysanthemum spp. with radiate capitula and Ajania spp. with disciform capitula. We found that the morphogenesis of zygomorphy in the marginal floret in Ajania was disrupted soon after floral primordium emergence; CYC2g, one of the CYC2 copies that was expressed prominently in the ray floret of Chrysanthemum was not expressed in flowerheads of Ajania. Weakening the expression of ClCYC2g in Chrysanthemum lavandulifolium led to the gradual transition of a ray flower toward the disc‐like form. Molecular evolutionary analyses indicated that the disciform capitulum might have evolved only once, approximately 8 Mya, arising from dysfunction of the CYC2g orthologs. A 20‐nt deletion, including a putative TATA‐box of the Ajania‐type CYC2g promoter, appeared to inhibit the expression of the gene. Considering the divergent habitats of Chrysanthemum and Ajania, we propose that the shift from radiate to disciform capitulum must have been related to changes in pollination strategies under selective pressure.  aPublisher supplied data  a31670221cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBX20190043cSupport Program for Postdoctoral Innovative Talent 3aChrysanthemum 3aTATA box 3agenes 3amorphogenesis 3aphylogeny 3apollination 3aray florets1 aChen, Jie1 aZhang, Chu‐Jie1 aRao, Guang‐Yuan1 aGuo, Yan‐Ping0 tplant journal.g2021 May, v. 106, no. 4 p.1024-1038dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.152163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245005100173520174400224592002801968650001101996650001402007650001602021650001402037650000902051650001602060650001902076653002602095653001402121653001202135653001002147653001202157700001402169700001502183700001602198700001802214700001702232700001702249773009302266856008602359852000902445655001202454IND60734160520221120090445.0220207e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073416052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e067362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapadimitriou, K.10aEndoscopic treatment of spinal arachnoid cysts  aSpinal arachnoid cysts (SAC) are intradural lesions, which may provoke a compression of the spinal cord and roots. Endoscopic techniques are increasingly used to minimize the surgical access and the postoperative scar tissue. Shunts may also represent an option. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the technique of endoscopic-assisted fenestration and positioning of a cysto-peritoneal diversion in a thoracic SAC using a flexible endoscope and to perform a systematic literature review on this subject. We reported our case and we performed a review of the literature, searching for all the adult cases of Type III SACs in English language treated through endoscopic procedures. We found 5 articles matching our search criteria and we included 9 adult patients in our analysis. Six patients were females and the most common localization was the thoracic spine. Six patients underwent selective laminectomies followed by endoscopic fenestration without cyst wall resection. Three patients had a percutaneous endoscopic inspection of the cyst and in two cases a cysto-subarachnoid shunt space was performed. Improvement of pre-operative neurological deficit was reported in six patients, no patients experienced clinical deterioration. The mean follow-up was 22 months and no progression or recurrence was reported. The implementation of endoscopy allows a minimally invasive treatments with good visualization of cyst anatomy and precise shunt positioning under real-time guidance. Endoscopy is technically demanding but it can offer similar clinical outcomes when compared to microscopic procedures with a limited rate of post-operative complications. The long-term risk of recurrence should be established by prospective studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aendoscopy 3alaminectomy 3aresection 3arisk 3aspinal cord 3athoracic spine 0aSpinal arachnoid cyst 0aEndoscopy 0aOutcome 0aShunt 0aSurgery1 aCossu, G.1 aMaduri, R.1 aValerio, M.1 aVamadevan, S.1 aDaniel, R.T.1 aMesserer, M.0 tHeliyon.g2021 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.e06736-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e067363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245011200214300001600326520198300342592002802325650001502353650001202368650000902380650001002389650002202399650001902421650002302440650001002463650001102473650001102484650001402495650001902509650002302528650002402551650001102575650001602586650001202602651001102614653001702625653002302642653002402665653002502689653001902714653003202733700002002765700001902785700002402804700002302828773011902851856008802970852000903058655001203067IND60635817620221122185310.0190613e20190710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063581762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.4582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZvereva, Elena L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2934-342110aClimate warming leads to decline in frequencies of melanic individuals in subarctic leaf beetle populations  ap. 237-244.  aIntraspecific diversity buffers populations from deleterious impacts of environmental change. Nevertheless, the consequences of climate warming for phenotypic and genetic diversity within populations and species remain poorly understood. The goal of our study was to explore among-year variations in the phenotypic structure of populations and their relationships with climate variability and population dynamics. We analysed multiyear (1992–2018) data on colour morph frequencies within populations of the leaf beetle, Chrysomela lapponica, from multiple sites in the Kola Peninsula (northwestern Russia). We observed a strong decline in the proportion of dark (melanic) morphs among overwintered beetles during the study period; this decline was consistent across all study sites. Using model selection procedures, we explained declines in the dark morph of overwintered beetles by increases in minimum spring (May–June) daily temperatures. Other climatic characteristics, pollution load, and beetle population density were unrelated to variation in colour morph frequencies. Among newly emerged beetles (August), dark morph frequencies also decreased with an increase in average spring temperatures, but were unrelated to mean temperatures during the larval development period (July). These results suggest that the two-fold decline in dark morph frequencies during the past 26 years has been driven by the 2.5 °C increase in spring temperatures, most likely because dark males lose the mating advantages over light males that they obtain during cold springs. The continued loss of dark morphs and related decrease in within-population diversity may render leaf beetle populations more vulnerable to future environmental changes, in particular to those expressed in extreme weather fluctuations. Our study demonstrates that declines in within-population diversity are already underway in subarctic areas, and that these declines are likely driven by climate warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomela 3aclimate 3acold 3acolor 3agenetic variation 3aglobal warming 3alarval development 3amales 3amodels 3amorphs 3aphenotype 3apollution load 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3aspring 3atemperature 3aweather 3aRussia 0aPolymorphism 0aPopulation density 0aSpring temperatures 0aChrysomela lapponica 0aKola Peninsula 0aWithin-population diversity1 aHunter, Mark D.1 aZverev, Vitali1 aKruglova, Oksana Y.1 aKozlov, Mikhail V.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 July 10, v. 673 p.237-244dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.4583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003800151245015000189500001400339520189200353592002802245650002702273650002302300650001702323650001302340650001502353650001602368650001802384650000902402650002102411650001502432650001002447650002402457650001602481650001302497650001102510650001902521650002402540650002102564650002602585651000902611653001302620653002202633653002602655653001902681700003302700700002302733700002402756700002002780700003002800773011302830856008602943852000903029655001203038IND60714068220221118095525.0210201e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071406822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakravan-Charvadeh, Mohammad Reza14aThe short-term effects of COVID-19 outbreak on dietary diversity and food security status of Iranian households (A case study in Tehran province)  aNAL-light  aCurrently, the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading fast in 185 countries and has engaged most people around the world. COVID-19 imposes severe and tragic consequences on people’s health due to the high rate of spread and potentially fatal impacts. In this study, the association of socio-economic factors with food security and dietary diversity is assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from 299 respondents were collected by an online standard questionnaire. Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) were calculated. A multinomial regression model was applied to determine factors associated with HDDS and HFIAS before and during COVID-19 outbreak. Food security of Iranian households improved during the initial COVID-19 pandemic period (P < 0.001). Households reduced consumption of some food groups during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Key socio-economic factors associated with food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic included personal savings, household income, employment status of head of household, and nutrition knowledge of head of household. During the COVID-19 outbreak, household size, head of household’s occupation, personal savings, and number of male children were significantly associated with dietary diversity. Distributing free food baskets to poor households, extending e-marketing, providing nutrition consultations, and organizing donations to support infected households may increase household dietary diversity and improve food security status during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Vulnerable populations in countries experiencing food insecurity, such as Iran, should be supported — not just by providing medical care and personal protective equipment, but also with flexible safety nets and food-based intervention programs to respond to population needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronavirus infections 3aat-risk population 3acase studies 3achildren 3aemployment 3afood groups 3afood security 3ahead 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3amales 3anutrition knowledge 3aoccupations 3apandemic 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asafety equipment 3asocioeconomic factors 3aIran 0aCOVID-19 0aDietary diversity 0aSocio-economic factor 0aSustainability1 aMohammadi-Nasrabadi, Fatemeh1 aGholamrezai, Saeed1 aVatanparast, Hassan1 aFlora, Cornelia1 aNabavi-Pelesaraei, Ashkan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 281 p.124537-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01646naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245010900127300001200236520065900248592002800907650002900935650002700964650001100991650001601002650001501018650002101033650001101054650001301065650002001078650001701098651001001115700001601125773015801141852000901299655001201308IND60770604520221119210206.0220319e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077060452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Sumon10aAgripreneurship: A study on the role, growth and opportunities for the agricultural development in India  ap. 200.  aThe main objective of the present study is to examine the long-term changes in rural employment trends and future growth, and adaptation of agripreneurship model to overcome basic challenges in Indian agriculture.

Also, predictive models were generated using response surface methodology. The processing parameters were moisture content (10–14 % dry basis), shaft speed of rotation (600–900 rpm), and polishing time (1–3 min). The quality parameters evaluated were milling (head rice yield, percentage broken rice, fine broken rice, and milled rice yield), cooking (optimum cooking time, kernel elongation ratio, and width expansion ratio), and sensory (flavor, aroma, appearance, texture, and overall acceptability) properties. The results showed that the interactive effects of moisture content, shaft speed, and polishing time were significant (P < 0.05) on percentage broken rice, milled rice yield, fine broken rice, optimum cooking time, kernel elongation ratio, width expansion ratio, aroma, and appearance but was not significant on head rice yield, flavor, texture, and overall acceptability. These results were similar to the regression models generated. In conclusion, the interactive effects of these processing parameters affect all the cooking properties but not all milling and sensory properties while using a one-step milling machine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflavor 3aodors 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice 3aseeds 3atexture 3awater content 0aMilling properties 0aCooking properties 0aSensory properties 0aOne-step milling machine 0aPolishing time1 aOkonkwo, Clinton E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2189-28401 aOjediran, John O.1 aHussain, Syed Z.1 aDottie, Ewhoritsemogha P.1 aAyoola, Ayooluwa S.0 tHeliyon.g2021 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.e06739-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e067393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245006000181506002800241520114400269592002801413506003701441650001101478650001901489650001501508650001501523650001001538650001301548650001801561700002401579700002701603700002501630700001701655700002501672700002101697773009601718856008301814852000901897655001201906IND60750473020221207114359.0210826s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075047302DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202133040072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErif, Maha Nugraha Setyawan10aPlacenta Expulsion-time on Different Age and Breed Cows  aResource is Open Access  aThe third stage of birth is placenta expulsion which can occur about 30 minutes after the release of the fetus but is more likely to occur between 180 to 300 minutes later. This research is expected to provide an understanding about the different time on placenta expulsion, the number of cotyledon and placenta weight that faced up by veterinarian. Cows with a body condition score between 2.5 to 3.5 and ready to give birth from various breeds were used in this study. The results showed that young cows (<5 years old; 366,50 ± 30,97 minutes) significantly had a longer placenta expulsion time than old cows (>5 years old; 251,29 ± 7,55 minutes; p<0,05). While the amount of cotyledon and placenta weight did not differ between the two age groups. Based on breeds, the young Ongole cows showed significant different on placenta expulsion time compared with old ones (397,25 ± 61,60 vs 250,80 ± 14,79 minutes; p<0,05) but had no difference with the young and old crossbreed cows. Young cows need more time for placenta expulsion than the old ones and the young Ongole cows take the longest time compared to other age and breed groups.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOngole 3abody condition 3acotyledons 3acrossbreds 3afetus 3aplacenta 3aveterinarians1 aYosua, Kristian Adi1 aTopas, Wicaksono Priyo1 aSurya, Agus Prihatno1 aSri, Gustari1 aAsmarani, Kusumawati1 aAgung, Budiyanto0 tBIO web of conferences.g2021, v. 33 p.04007-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202133040073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012700171300001800298520130300316592002801619650001301647650001901660650002001679650002501699650002001724650001501744650001501759650000901774650002001783650001601803650001901819650002001838650001001858650001701868653002601885653003301911653002101944653001901965653002001984653002002004700002402024700002202048700002402070700001902094773012502113856008602238852000902324655001202333IND60773963820221119082530.0220420e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077396382DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2020.17799012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSağlam, Serhun13aAn Evaluation on Acoustic Behavior of Untreated Tree Trunks Depending on Bark Physical Properties and Fiber Cell Structure  ap. 1507-1521.  aIn recent years, noise pollution generated by increasing global urbanization has become an important issue. This study focused on determining the sound absorption coefficients (SACs) of untreated tree trunks as natural fiber-based materials and predicting their noise reduction coefficients (NRCs). It also evaluated the effects of noise reduction using numerical data. One of the most effective acoustic characteristics is the normal incidence SAC; this was obtained for trunks belonging to species of black locust, narrow-leafed ash, stone pine, silver lime, sweet chestnut, sessile oak, maritime pine, cedar, and plane in the frequency range of 50–6000 Hz using an impedance tube based on a two-microphone transfer function method. The absorbance of sound was found to correlate with the tree species, trunk diameter, bark shape, and the bark’s fibrous structure. The results confirmed that when compared with deciduous species, the trunks of coniferous species exhibit higher NRC values which were recorded as 0.302 ± 0.005 for stone pine and 0.233 ± 0.004 for cedar. Furthermore, the surface morphology of the outer bark of different tree species obtained via scanning electron microscopy revealed that significant variations exist in the microstructure of the bark’s fiber cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aPinus pinaster 3aQuercus petraea 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aTilia tomentosa 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3abark 3acell structures 3afiber cells 3amicrostructure 3anoise pollution 3atrees 3aurbanization 0aUntreated tree trunks 0anatural fiber-based material 0asound absorption 0aimpedance tube 0abark morphology 0anoise reduction1 aGüzelçimen, Feyza1 aBingöl, Doğukan1 aÖzkan, Ulaş Yunus1 aEkici, Bülent0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 19, no. 4 p.1507-1521dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2020.17799013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011400173300001200287520127200299592002801571650002001599650001201619650001501631650001001646650001901656650001601675650001701691650001601708650001501724650002101739650001401760650001501774650001401789650001401803650000901817650000901826650001601835650001101851650002201862650001501884650001801899700003201917700001901949773013201968856008102100852000902181655001202190IND60518372520221118230148.0160507e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051837252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-016-5285-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Isawi, Rawaa H.

The aim was to evaluate the usability of river, rain, gully pot, real grey and artificial grey waters to water crops. The objectives were to evaluate variables and boundary conditions influencing the growth of chillies (De Cayenne; Capsicum annuum (Linnaeus) Longum Group 'De Cayenne') both in the laboratory and in the greenhouse. A few irrigated chilli plants suffered from excess of some nutrients, which led to a relatively poor harvest. High levels of trace minerals and heavy metals were detected in river water, gully pot effluent and greywater. However, no significant differences in plant yields were observed, if compared with standards and other yields worldwide. The highest yields were associated with river water both in the laboratory and in the greenhouse. Plant productivity was unaffected by water quality due to the high manganese, potassium, cadmium and copper levels of the greywater. These results indicate the potential of river water and gully pot effluent as viable alternatives to potable water for irrigation in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3acadmium 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adrinking water 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3ahot peppers 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3anutrients 3apotassium 3arain 3arisk 3ariver water 3arivers 3avegetable gardens 3awastewater 3awater quality1 aAlmuktar, Suhad A.

In the first phase, spectral absorbance curves were established for micro and macro algae, the greatest absorbance value was determined in UV region (300 nm to 450 nm). In the second phase, to analyze the growth of algae species depending on UV-C illumination, micro algae within three different basins with the same cross-sectional area and different water depths (D1:12.5 cm, D2:25 cm, D3:45cm) were exposed to UV-C radiation for different durations (2, 4, 6, 8 and 16 s). The maximum inhibition on the growth rate of A. maxima was observed in 16 s UV-C radiation treatment groups of D1 and D2 basins. Since Cladophora sp. macro algae are aquatic weeds floating over the water surface, they were exposed to UV-C radiation similar to micro algae only in D1 basin. The greatest reduction rate in biomass values of Cladophora sp. was observed in 16 s UV-C exposed groups.The experimental findings showed that UV-C radiation could be used to reduce growth of micro and macro algae. It was concluded based on present findings that UV-C radiation could reliably be used for efficient water use in open or closed irrigation systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladophora 3aSpirulina maxima 3aabsorbance 3aalgae 3aaquatic weeds 3abacteria 3abasins 3abiomass 3aflora 3airrigation systems 3alaboratory experimentation 3alighting 3amedicine 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater use efficiency 0aAlgal control 0aArthrospira maxima 0aCladophora sp. 0aIrrigation canal1 aAk, İlknur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0233-00251 aKurt, Mustafa0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 July 01, v. 672 p.81-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.4603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014500165520150100310592002801811650002301839650002501862650001601887650001901903650001001922650002201932650002001954650001801974650002201992650003102014650001002045650001402055650002002069650002002089650002402109650001802133650003702151650002202188650002502210650001402235650002402249650001202273653000802285653000802293700002002301700001802321700001802339700001702357773012102374856008202495852000902577655001202586IND60680681620221119194436.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068068162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2019.1036022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Minghan10aMolecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) from the blood clam Tegillarca granosa  aThe blood clam Tegillarca granosa is a member of the most economically important bivalve mollusk species in the Asia-Pacific region. T. granosa entirely depends on innate immunity for pathogen defense. However, there are very few reports on the immune responses of T. granosa to various pathogens. In our study, we cloned and characterized an ERK homolog from T. granosa, which was defined as TgERK. The full-length cDNA sequence of TgERK was 1644 bp in length and encoded a conserved S_TKc domain (residues 21–309) in the N terminus. The TgERK mRNA was universally expressed in all examined tissues, with the highest expression level found in hemocytes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Vibrio alginolyticus challenges strongly enhanced the expression of ERK in T. granosa, which was consistent with the results of an in vitro challenge study with cultured T. granosa hemocytes. Pathogen invasion also upregulated the expression of downstream genes in the ERK signaling pathway, such as CREB, c-Fos and SIRT1. Moreover, TgERK knockdown resulted in decreased expression of these downstream genes. Inhibition of ERK by its inhibitor U0126 decreased T. granosa hemocyte viability in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results demonstrated that TgERK was a crucial regulator of the immune response to pathogen invasion, which indicated new knowledge of hemocyte immunity in T. granosa and provided a novel key molecule in immune regulation for controlling diseases in T. granosa aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTegillarca granosa 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aaquaculture 3acell viability 3aclams 3acomplementary DNA 3adisease control 3adose response 3aenzyme inhibition 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3alipopolysaccharides 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amolecular cloning 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3asignal transduction 3atissues 0aERK 0aLPS1 aChen, Mingliang1 aLiu, Guosheng1 aYang, Chunyan1 aLi, Zengpeng0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2020 Apr., v. 105 p.103602-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2019.1036023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151242004700171245006600218300001800284520122000302536018201522592002801704596001001732650001201742650001001754650001101764650001001775650001801785650001801803650001301821651001301834651001001847653002101857653001001878653001301888653001701901653001801918653003201936700001701968700003101985700001402016773012502030856008602155852000902241655001202250IND60773963920221119082653.0220420e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077396392DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2020.17801812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddis, Tiliksew10a埃塞俄比亚在生产棉花品种分析10aAnalysis of the cotton varieties under production in Ethiopia  ap. 1522-1530.  aIn Ethiopia, cotton is trademarked by the name of the farm and the location or the farm owner. Variety name and fiber quality characteristics are not part of the labeling. The aim of this research is to identify the cotton varieties in Ethiopia. Dp 90 covers 90% of the total acreage while the rest of the area under production is planted with local varieties and Stam 59A. In this study Ethiopian cotton classification is done by using USTER® HVI 1000 and USTER® AFIS PRO2. Comparative analysis of the quality characteristics of Ethiopian cotton such as UHML, strength, uniformity, short fiber content, color were analyzed by USTER® HVI 1000 and fineness, maturity UQL and short fiber content by number were considered by USTER® AFIS PRO2. The data analysis using Minitab® 17 shows that local type cotton gives the best fiber properties followed by Stam 59A and Dp 90. Compared to Texas cotton, Ethiopian cotton has better uniformity due to the presence of a single variety Dp 90 despite the limitations within bale variability. For other properties, findings reveal lower quality especially in strength and upper half mean length which are the main fiber characteristics that determines the spinning quality.  aThis work received funding from Excellence in Science & Technology (ExiST) a Higher Education and TVET program Ethiopia - phase 3 PE 479-higher Education kfw project No.[51235].  aPublisher supplied data  a51235 3aacreage 3acolor 3acotton 3afarms 3afiber content 3afiber quality 3afineness 3aEthiopia 3aTexas 0aEthiopian cotton 0aDp 90 0aStam 59A 0aTexas cotton 0aAFIS fineness 0acotton fiber classification1 aKachi, Abera1 aAkankwasa, Nicholus Tayari1 aWang, Jun0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 19, no. 4 p.1522-1530dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2020.17801813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245018200170300001400352520106600366592002801432650002101460650002701481650001801508650002201526650002501548650001101573650002201584650002101606650004301627650000901670650001101679650002301690650002501713650004301738650001301781650002301794650000901817650001501826653002001841653001301861653001601874653002301890653001401913653001401927773013701941856008202078852000902160655001202169IND60589559720221118230047.0190318e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058955972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjp.2017.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimoh, Tajudeen O.10aEnzymes inhibitory and radical scavenging potentials of two selected tropical vegetable (Moringa oleifera and Telfairia occidentalis) leaves relevant to type 2 diabetes mellitus  ap. 73-79.  aMoringa oleifera Lam., Moringaceae, and Telfairia occidentalis Hook. f., Curcubitaceae, leaves are two tropical vegetables of medicinal properties. In this study, the inhibitory activities and the radical scavenging potentials of these vegetables on relevant enzymes of type 2-diabetes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase) were evaluated in vitro. HPLC-DAD was used to characterize the phenolic constituents and Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation in rat's pancreas was investigated. Various radical scavenging properties coupled with metal chelating abilities were also determined. However, phenolic extracts from the vegetables inhibited α-amylase, α-glucosidase and chelated the tested metals (Cu2+ and Fe2+) in a concentration-dependent manner. More so, the inhibitory properties of phenolic rich extracts from these vegetables could be linked to their radical scavenging abilities. Therefore, this study may offer a promising prospect for M. oleifera and T. occidentalis leaves as a potential functional food sources in the management of type 2-diabetes mellitus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aTelfairia occidentalis 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3acopper 3aenzyme inhibition 3afunctional foods 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airon 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amedicinal properties 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apancreas 3aphenolic compounds 3arats 3avegetables 0aType 2-diabetes 0aTropical 0aAntioxidant 0aLipid peroxidation 0aMedicinal 0aPhenolics0 tRevista Brasileira de Farmacognosia.g2018 Jan.,  Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.73-79dElsevier Editora Ltda.wJournal:23273x0102-695X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjp.2017.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013600168520170300304592002802007650002702035650002702062650001302089650001902102650001402121650002302135650001802158650001302176650000702189650001402196650001302210650001902223650000902242650001602251653001302267653001602280653001302296653003602309653000902345700002002354700002502374700002602399700001402425700002402439700002802463700003002491700002302521773010602544856008502650852000902735655001202744IND60792422720221121060654.0220921e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079242272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2022.1271842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavi, Ashwini10aCharacterization of petroleum degrading bacteria and its optimization conditions on effective utilization of petroleum hydrocarbons  aHydrocarbon contamination is continuing to be a serious environmental problem because of their toxicity. Hydrocarbon components have been known to be carcinogens and neurotoxic organic pollutants. The physical and chemical methods of petroleum removal have become ineffective and also are very costly. Therefore, bioremediation is considered the promising technology for the treatment of these contaminated sites since it is cost-effective and will lead to complete mineralization.The current study also concentrates on bioremediation of petroleum products by bacterium isolated from petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil. The current work shows that bacterial strains obtained from a petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated environment may degrade petroleum compounds. Two strains Bacillus licheniformis ARMP2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ARMP8 were identified as petroleum-degrading bacteria of the isolated bacterial colonies. The best growth conditions for the ARMP2 strain were determined to be pH 9, temperature 29 °C with sodium nitrate as its nitrogen source, whereas for the ARMP8 strain the optimal growth was found at pH 7, temperature 39 °C, and ammonium chloride as the nitrogen source. Both strains were shown to be effective at degrading petroleum chemicals confirmed by GCMS. Overall petroleum product degradation efficiency of the strains ARMP2 and ARMP8 was about 88 % and 73 % respectively in 48 h.The strains Bacillus licheniformis ARMP2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ARMP8 were shown to be effective at degrading petroleum compounds in the current study. Even greater results might be obtained if the organisms were utilised in consortia or the degradation time period was extended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3achlorides 3acost effectiveness 3aneurotoxicity 3anitrogen 3apH 3apetroleum 3aresearch 3asodium nitrate 3asoil 3atemperature 0aBacillus 0aPseudomonas 0aNaphthol 0aPetrol-contaminated environment 0aGCMS1 aRavuri, Mounesh1 aKrishnan, Ramkishore1 aNarenkumar, Jayaraman1 aAnu, Kasi1 aAlsalhi, Mohamad S.1 aDevanesan, Sandhanasamy1 aKamala-Kannan, Seralathan1 aRajasekar, Aruliah0 tMicrobiological research.g2022 Dec., v. 265 p.127184-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2022.1271843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010100165300001400266520121200280592002801492650002101520650001701541650001201558650001501570650003101585650001701616650001101633650001701644650001801661650001501679650002101694650001201715650001901727650001701746650001001763650001401773650001101787650003501798650001001833650001201843650001301855700001801868700001501886700001501901700001601916700001501932773010001947856008102047852000902128655001202137IND60518372720221118230058.0160414e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051837272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-015-0105-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yuanjie10aNitric oxide can induce tolerance to oxidative stress of peanut seedlings under cadmium toxicity  ap. 19-28.  aTo study the role of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a donor of NO) in alleviating cadmium (Cd) toxicity in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), peanut seedlings exposed to 50, 100, or 200 µM Cd as CdCl₂ were treated with 250 µM SNP. Cd exposure depressed plant growth, inhibited the photosynthesis, and resulted in oxidative stress. In roots, Cd was mostly trapped in the cell wall under low Cd stress, but most Cd was accumulated in the soluble fraction under high Cd concentrations. In leaves, a majority of Cd was accumulated in the cell wall regardless of Cd treatment level. Addition of SNP at 250 µM significantly alleviated Cd toxicity in peanut seedlings, including improved photosynthesis, up-regulated antioxidant system, and reduced Cd translocation from roots to shoots as evidenced by decreased Cd accumulation in stems and leaves. SNP application also changed the subcellular distribution of Cd in leaf and root tissues, by increasing Cd retention in root and leaf cell wall while reducing Cd accumulation in the soluble fractions and cell organelles. These results indicate that SNP has great application potential for improving the growth of plants under heavy metal stress such as Cd toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aantioxidants 3acadmium 3acell walls 3agene expression regulation 3aheavy metals 3aleaves 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3aorganelles 3aoxidative stress 3apeanuts 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astems 3atissues 3atoxicity1 aChen, Weifeng1 aXu, Linlin1 aKong, Jing1 aLiu, Shuang1 aHe, Zhenli0 tPlant growth regulation.g2016 May, v. 79, no. 1 p.19-28dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-015-0105-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010600173300001400279520127900293592002801572650001301600650002301613650001201636650002501648650001901673650002301692650002201715650001101737650002201748650002601770650000901796650000901805650000901814650002501823650001001848650002301858653002001881653001601901653000801917653002501925653001801950700002001968700002201988700002402010700001902034773017602053856008202229852000902311655001202320IND60589559820221118230341.0190318e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058955982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjp.2017.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Sônia J.O. de10aChemical composition and seasonality variability of the Spiranthera odoratissima volatile oils leaves  ap. 16-20.  aSpiranthera odoratissima A. St.-Hil., Rutaceae, known as “manacá” is a shrub native of the Brazilian Cerrado. Their leaves and roots are popularly used to treat rheumatism, infection and abdominal pain. This study analyzed the chemical composition of volatile oils from leaves of S. odoratissima and verified the seasonal variability of its chemical composition. The volatile oils were obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger type apparatus and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main chemical components found in samples of volatile oils were β-caryophyllene, bicyclogermacrene, δ-cadinene, amorphous-4,7(11)-diene, α-epi-muurolol, α-cadinol, α-muurolol and γ-cadinene. The hierarchical clustering identified three groups: the first was characterized by α-epi-muurolol, the second by amorphous-4,7(11)-diene and the third group was characterized by α-muurolol. The discriminant canonical analysis was used to differentiate between clusters on the basis of oil composition. The results suggest that the rainfall presented a relationship with the chemical composition of the volatile oil. This is the first study conducted on the seasonal behavior of the chemical constituents in volatile oil from leaves of S. odoratissima.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRutaceae 3abeta-caryophyllene 3acerrado 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography 3ahydrodistillation 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3amultivariate analysis 3aoils 3apain 3arain 3arheumatoid arthritis 3aroots 3aseasonal variation 0aMedicinal plant 0aSeasonality 0aPCA 0aChemical variability 0aVolatile oils1 aFerri, Pedro H.1 aFiuza, Tatiana S.1 aBorges, Leonardo L.1 aPaula, Jose R.0 tRevista Brasileira de Farmacognosia.g2018 Jan.,  Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.16-20dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de FarmacognosiawJournal:23273x0102-695X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjp.2017.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245013100159520185200290592002802142650002702170650002602197650002302223650002902246650002702275650002602302650002502328650002802353650001602381650002702397650002902424650002202453650001402475650003102489650001002520650001202530650001402542650001902556650001202575650002402587650004302611650001402654650001902668650001702687650002102704650001402725650001902739650001102758653001802769653002502787653002402812700001402836700001702850700001702867773012002884856008203004852000903086655001203095IND60680681920221119193922.0200410e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068068192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2020.1036092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Yue12aA novel C-type lectin with a YPD motif from Portunus trituberculatus (PtCLec1) mediating pathogen recognition and opsonization  aC-type lectins are a superfamily of Ca²⁺-dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins that function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in innate immune system. In this study, a new C-type lectin was identified from the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus (PtCLec1). The full-length cDNA of PtCLec1 was 873 bp encoding 176 amino acids. The predicted PtCLec1 protein contained a signal peptide and a single carbohydrate-recognition domain with a special YPD motif. The PtCLec1 transcripts were mainly detected in hepatopancreas and its relative expression levels were significantly up-regulated after the challenges of Vibrio alginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. The recombinant PtCLec1 (rPtCLec1) could bind all the tested pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN) and glucan (GLU), and microorganisms, including V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, M. luteus and P. pastoris. It also exhibited strong activity to agglutinate bacteria and yeast in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner, and such agglutinating activity could be inhibited by d-galactose and LPS. Moreover, rPtCLec1 revealed antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram-negative (V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus and P. aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and M. luteus), and promoted the clearance of V. alginolyticus in vivo and hemocyte phagocytosis in vitro. Knockdown of PtCLec1 could down-regulate the expression of phagocytosis-related genes, but enhance the expression levels of prophenoloxidase (proPO) system-related genes, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), MyD88 and Relish. All these results indicate that PtCLec1 might act as a PRR in immune recognition and an opsonin in pathogen elimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aPortunus trituberculatus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aamino acids 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3acomplementary DNA 3agalactose 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucans 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3alectins 3alipopolysaccharides 3apathogen-associated molecular patterns 3apathogens 3apeptidoglycans 3aphagocytosis 3aprophenoloxidase 3areceptors 3asignal peptide 3ayeasts 0aC-type lectin 0aPathogen recognition 0aPhagocytic activity1 aLiu, Yuan1 aGao, Fengtao1 aCui, Zhaoxia0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2020 May, v. 106 p.103609-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2020.1036093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04788naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245006400173300001800237500001100255500001500266520283000281592002803111650002403139650001503163650001203178650001503190650001903205650001603224650001003240650002503250650001203275650001303287650001103300650001903311650002103330650002203351650002303373650002503396650002403421650002303445650001803468650001703486650002503503650001103528650002003539650001503559650001003574650002703584650001703611650001803628650001003646650001803656650002003674650001603694650000903710650001703719653001103736700002303747700003003770700001903800700001803819700002703837773011203864856008103976852000904057655001204066IND60465717820221121184442.0170725e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046571782DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-015-0326-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlaza-Bonilla, Daniel10aCarbon management in dryland agricultural systems. A review  ap. 1319-1334.  aReview  a2019-12-06  aDryland areas cover about 41 % of the Earth’s surface and sustain over 2 billion inhabitants. Soil carbon (C) in dryland areas is of crucial importance to maintain soil quality and productivity and a range of ecosystem services. Soil mismanagement has led to a significant loss of carbon in these areas, which in many of them entailed several land degradation processes such as soil erosion, reduction in crop productivity, lower soil water holding capacity, a decline in soil biodiversity, and, ultimately, desertification, hunger and poverty in developing countries. As a consequence, in dryland areas proper management practices and land use policies need to be implemented to increase the amount of C sequestered in the soil. When properly managed, dryland soils have a great potential to sequester carbon if financial incentives for implementation are provided. Dryland soils contain the largest pool of inorganic C. However, contrasting results are found in the literature on the magnitude of inorganic C sequestration under different management regimes. The rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels will greatly affect dryland soils, since the positive effect of CO₂ on crop productivity will be offset by a decrease of precipitation, thus increasing the susceptibility to soil erosion and crop failure. In dryland agriculture, any removal of crop residues implies a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC). Therefore, the adoption of no-tillage practices in field crops and growing cover crops in tree crops have a great potential in dryland areas due to the associated benefits of maintaining the soil surface covered by crop residues. Up to 80 % reduction in soil erosion has been reported when using no-tillage compared with conventional tillage. However, no-tillage must be maintained over the long term to enhance soil macroporosity and offset the emission of nitrous oxide (N₂O) associated to the greater amount of water stored in the soil when no-tillage is used. Furthermore, the use of long fallow periods appears to be an inefficient practice for water conservation, since only 10–35 % of the rainfall received is available for the next crop when fallow is included in the rotation. Nevertheless, conservation agriculture practices are unlikely to be adopted in some developing countries where the need of crop residues for soil protection competes with other uses. Crop rotations, cover crops, crop residue retention, and conservation agriculture have a direct positive impact on biodiversity and other ecosystem services such as weed seed predation, abundance and distribution of a broad range of soil organisms, and bird nesting density and success. The objective of sequestering a significant amount of C in dryland soils is attainable and will result in social and environmental benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3ano-tillage 3apoverty 3aarid lands 3aseed predation 3afield crops 3atrees 3acarbon sequestration 3anesting 3aland use 3ahunger 3acarbon dioxide 3aland degradation 3aissues and policy 3awater conservation 3aconventional tillage 3aeconomic incentives 3aecosystem services 3acrop residues 3asoil quality 3adeveloping countries 3afallow 3adryland farming 3asoil water 3aweeds 3awater holding capacity 3abiodiversity 3acrop rotation 3abirds 3anitrous oxide 3adesertification 3acover crops 3arain 3asoil erosion 0acarbon1 aArrúe, José Luis1 aCantero-Martínez, Carlos1 aFanlo, Rosario1 aIglesias, Ana1 aÁlvaro-Fuentes, Jorge0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2015 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.1319-1334dSpringer Parisx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0326-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03803naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012900171300001400300500001500314520144900329592002801778650002101806650002701827650001001854650001901864650001501883650002201898650001501920650002601935650001301961650003501974650001802009650001702027650003102044650002502075650004202100650002202142650001002164650001602174650001702190650002502207650002302232650001602255653000702271653002702278653000802305653000802313653000702321653000702328653001702335653000702352653000702359653001202366653001002378653000802388653000802396653002602404653000902430653000702439653000902446653001002455653000902465653000802474653000702482653000702489653001202496653002802508653000702536700001702543700001702560700001502577700001502592700001302607700001402620700001202634700001202646700001402658700001802672773010302690856008702793852000902880655001202889IND60610044020221120220331.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061004402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Jianping10aSilencing of BnTT1 family genes affects seed flavonoid biosynthesis and alters seed fatty acid composition in Brassica napus  ap. 32-47.  a2019-12-06  aTRANSPARENT TESTA1 (TT1) is a zinc finger protein that contains a WIP domain. It plays important roles in controlling differentiation and pigmentation of the seed coat endothelium, and can affect the expression of early biosynthetic genes and late biosynthetic genes of flavonoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. In Brassica napus (AACC, 2n=38), the functions of BnTT1 genes remain unknown and few studies have focused on their roles in fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis. In this study, BnTT1 family genes were silenced by RNA interference, which resulted in yellow rapeseed, abnormal testa development (a much thinner testa), decreased seed weight, and altered seed FA composition in B. napus. High-throughput sequencing of genes differentially expressed between developing transgenic B. napus and wild-type seeds revealed altered expression of numerous genes involved in flavonoid and FA biosynthesis. As a consequence of this altered expression, we detected a marked decrease of oleic acid (C18:1) and notable increases of linoleic acid (C18:2) and α-linolenic acid (C18:3) in mature transgenic B. napus seeds by gas chromatography and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Meanwhile, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry showed reduced accumulation of flavonoids in transgenic seeds. Therefore, we propose that BnTT1s are involved in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis, and may also play a role in FA biosynthesis in B. napus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3afatty acid composition 3agenes 3aBrassica napus 3aflavonoids 3amass spectrometry 3aoleic acid 3aliquid chromatography 3arapeseed 3agenetically modified organisms 3alinoleic acid 3apigmentation 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3azinc finger motif 3atesta 3aendothelium 3abiosynthesis 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3agas chromatography 3aseed weight 0aGC 0aFlavonoid biosynthesis 0am/% 0aDAP 0aDP 0aPC 0aTT1-RNAi & R 0aDW 0aWT 0aqRT-PCR 0aseeds 0aTT1 0aDEG 0aSeed coat development 0aRNAi 0aPA 0aKEGG 0aBnTT1 0aNIRS 0aTBO 0att 0aFA 0aLC–MS 0aFatty acid biosynthesis 0aGO1 aLu, Xiaochun1 aYin, Nengwen1 aMa, Lijuan1 aLü, Jing,1 aLiu, Xue1 aLi, Jiana1 aLu, Jun1 aLei, Bo1 aWang, Rui1 aChai, Yourong0 tPlant science.g2017 Jan., v. 254 p.32-47dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245009100158300001800249520102800267592002801295650001201323650000901335650001901344650001801363650001901381700001801400700001601418700001301434700005501447773017101502856008001673852000901753655001201762IND60644494420221116144527.0190516e20190423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064449442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b010772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Li10aIdentification of Mesoscale Flow in a Bubbling and Turbulent Gas–Solid Fluidized Bed  ap. 8456-8471.  aBased on the moment consistency principle, the bubble threshold was determined by using the traversing method. A novel approach was proposed to identify bubbles and agglomerates from transient signals registered in a cold mode fluidized bed dealing with different particles. Bubble and agglomerate hydrodynamics including volume fraction, solid holdup, immigration velocity, and frequency were investigated. Adding fine powder promotes the formation of particle agglomerates at low superficial gas velocity and leads to a great bubble volume fraction at high superficial gas velocity. Bubble frequency increases significantly during the flow pattern transition from bubbling to turbulence bed. Compared with FCC particles, the mixed particles have a narrow bubble chord length distribution. The net velocity of agglomerates is positive in the center and close to zero or even negative in the vicinity of the wall. The agglomerate frequency in the mixed particle bed is significantly lower than that in the FCC particle bed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3acold 3afluidized beds 3ahydrodynamics 3aturbulent flow1 aHuang, Yahang1 aChu, Zhimin1 aCai, Min1 aLiu, Mengxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1333-17920 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Apr. 23, v. 58, no. 19 p.8456-8471dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b010773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245014400167300001400311520139400325592002801719650002201747650001801769650001201787650001901799650003001818650001901848650001201867650001601879650001101895650002601906650002001932650002501952650002201977650001701999650002502016650001702041653001902058653001702077653002002094653002502114653002502139700001702164700001602181700001502197773011902212856008802331852000902419655001202428IND60561059820221121082955.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056105982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yafei10aEffect of the transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2 on the drought response of winter wheat: Stomatal control and water use efficiency  ap. 78-84.  aClimate change predicts more frequent drought spells along with an elevation in atmospheric CO2 concentration (e[CO2]). Although the responses of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants to drought or a single generation exposure to e[CO2] have been well documented, the transgenerational effect of e[CO2] in combination of drought on stomatal behavior, plant water consumption and water use efficiency (WUE) have not been investigated. Seeds harvested from plants after two generations (2014–2015) continuously grown in ambient CO2 (a[CO2], 400μmolL−1) and e[CO2] (800μmolL−1) were sown in 4L pots, and the plants were grown separately in greenhouse cells with either a[CO2] or e[CO2]. At stem elongation stage, in each of the cells half of the plants were subjected to progressive drought stress until all the plant available soil water was depleted, and the other half were well-watered and served as controls. The results showed that transgenerational exposure of the winter wheat plants to e[CO2] could attenuate the negative impact of drought stress on dry biomass (DM) and WUE. The modulations of multi-generational e[CO2] on leaf abscisic acid concentration, stomatal conductance, and leaf water status could have contributed to the enhanced DM and WUE. These findings provide new insights into the response of wheat plants to a future drier and CO2-enriched environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabscisic acid 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3adrought 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3aplant available water 3astem elongation 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3awinter wheat 0aClimate change 0aElevated CO2 0aMaternal effect 0aStomatal conductance 0aWater use efficiency1 aLi, Xiangnan1 aYu, Jingjie1 aLiu, Fulai0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2017 Apr., v. 136 p.78-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002000175245007000195300001400265520159700279592002801876650003701904650002801941650002301969650001401992650002802006650001802034650001002052650002202062650002602084650001102110650001302121650002802134650001902162650001302181650001102194650001502205650002602220700002002246700001502266700002002281700001902301700002902320700002002349700001902369700002202388700002502410773014902435856006802584856010102652990002302753852000902776655001202785IND60643344120221122045149.0190510e20120125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064334412DNAL7 a10.3791/36362doi7 aPMC34625682pmcid7 a223149272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHook, Andrew L.10aPolymer microarrays for high throughput discovery of biomaterials  ap. e3636.  aThe discovery of novel biomaterials that are optimized for a specific biological application is readily achieved using polymer microarrays, which allows a combinatorial library of materials to be screened in a parallel, high throughput format1. Herein is described the formation and characterization of a polymer microarray using an on-chip photopolymerization technique 2. This involves mixing monomers at varied ratios to produce a library of monomer solutions, transferring the solution to a glass slide format using a robotic printing device and curing with UV irradiation. This format is readily amenable to many biological assays, including stem cell attachment and proliferation, cell sorting and low bacterial adhesion, allowing the ready identification of 'hit' materials that fulfill a specific biological criterion3-5. Furthermore, the use of high throughput surface characterization (HTSC) allows the biological performance to be correlated with physio-chemical properties, hence elucidating the biological-material interaction6. HTSC makes use of water contact angle (WCA) measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). In particular, ToF-SIMS provides a chemically rich analysis of the sample that can be used to correlate the cell response with a molecular moiety. In some cases, the biological performance can be predicted from the ToF-SIMS spectra, demonstrating the chemical dependence of a biological-material interaction, and informing the development of hit materials5,3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3abacterial adhesion 3abioassays 3abiocompatible materials 3acontact angle 3aglass 3amass spectrometry 3amicroarray technology 3amixing 3amoieties 3aphotochemical reactions 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3arobots 3astem cells 3aultraviolet radiation1 aChang, Chien-Yi1 aYang, Jing1 aScurr, David J.1 aLanger, Robert1 aAnderson, Danq(Dan G.),1 aAtkinson, Steve1 aWilliams, Paul1 aDavies, Martyn C.1 aAlexander, Morgan R.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Jan. 25, , no. 59 p.e3636-e3636dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/36363Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3636/polymer-microarrays-for-high-throughput-discovery-of-biomaterials  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100001800159245010000177300001600277520095800293592002801251650001001279650001401289650001301303650001401316650001101330650001301341650002801354650001201382650001601394650001001410650001201420773011701432856007401549852000901623655001201632IND60082119820221118123843.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008211982DNAL7 a252935522pmid7 a10.1111/nure.121312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShearer, Jane10aMethodological and metabolic considerations in the study of caffeine‐containing energy drinks  ap. 137-145.  aCaffeine‐containing energy drinks are popular and widely available beverages. Despite large increases in consumption, studies documenting the nutritional, metabolic, and health implications of these beverages are limited. This review provides some important methodological considerations in the examination of these drinks and highlights their potential impact on the gastrointestinal system, liver, and metabolic health. The gastrointestinal system is important as it comes into contact with the highest concentration of energy drink ingredients and initiates a chain of events to communicate with peripheral tissues. Although energy drinks have diverse compositions, including taurine, ginseng, and carnitine, the most metabolically deleterious ingredients appear to be simple sugars (such as glucose and fructose) and caffeine. In combination, these last two ingredients have the greatest metabolic impact and potential influence on overall health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3abeverages 3acaffeine 3acarnitine 3aenergy 3afructose 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucose 3aingredients 3aliver 3ataurine0 tNutrition reviews.g2014 Oct., v. 72 Suppl S1 p.137-145dInternational Life Sciences Institute.x0029-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nure.121313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245010100176300001600277520117100293592002801464650001501492650001701507650001601524650006601540650001301606650002101619700001801640700002701658700001301685700002501698700002201723700001701745700002301762773011201785856008901897852000901986655001201995IND60093702720221118004823.0141103e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009370272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlame, Michael10aComparison of cardiolipins from Drosophila strains with mutations in putative remodeling enzymes  ap. 512-519.  aCardiolipin is a dimeric phospholipid with a characteristic acyl composition that is generated by fatty acid remodeling after de novo synthesis. Several enzymes have been proposed to participate in acyl remodeling of cardiolipin. In order to compare the effect of these enzymes, we determined the pattern of cardiolipin molecular species in Drosophila strains with specific enzyme deletions, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with internal standards. We established the linear range of the method for cardiolipin quantification, determined the relative signal intensities of several cardiolipin standards, and demonstrated satisfying signal-to-noise ratios in cardiolipin spectra from a single fly. Our data demonstrate changes in the cardiolipin composition during the Drosophila life cycle. Comparison of cardiolipin spectra, using vector algebra, showed that inactivation of tafazzin had a large effect on the molecular composition of cardiolipin, inactivation of calcium-independent phospholipase A₂ had a small effect, whereas inactivation of acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin-acyltransferase and of the trifunctional enzyme did not affect the cardiolipin composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3acardiolipins 3afatty acids 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amutation 3aphospholipase A21 aBlais, Steven1 aEdelman-Novemsky, Irit1 aXu, Yang1 aMontecillo, Fleurise1 aPhoon, Colin K.L.1 aRen, Mindong1 aNeubert, Thomas A.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2012 July, v. 165, no. 5 p.512-519dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-30847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245007300174300001800247520116000265592002801425650001901453650001001472650002501482650001401507650002901521650002501550650002001575650002001595650001901615650001601634650001601650650001601666650001201682650002601694650002801720650001901748650001901767650000901786650001101795650001201806650001301818650001601831650001101847651001001858700002201868700002401890700002201914700003601936700004201972773011202014856008102126852000902207655001202216IND60465718220221122164455.0170725e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046571822DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-015-0331-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanyé-Mengual, Esther10aTechniques and crops for efficient rooftop gardens in Bologna, Italy  ap. 1477-1488.  aUrban rooftop farming favours local food production.

There, we set up experiments in the community rooftop garden of a public housing building in Bologna, Italy, between 2012 and 2014. We grew lettuce, a leafy vegetable, using three techniques: nutrient film, floating hydroponic and soil cultivation. We also grew tomato, chilli pepper, eggplant, melon, watermelon on soils. Data was analysed by life cycle assessment for environmental and economic performance. Results reveal that the best techniques of lettuce cultivation to address global warming were floating in the summer, with 65–85 % less environmental impact per kilogran than nutrient film; and soil production in the winter, with 85–95 % less environmental impact. Furthermore, floating production was 25 % cheaper in summer, and soil was 65 % cheaper in winter, compared to the nutrient film technique. For soil production, eggplants and tomatoes showed the best environmental performances of about 74 g CO₂ per kg. Eggplant production in soil was cheapest at 0.13 € per kg.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acrops 3aeconomic performance 3aeggplants 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3afarming systems 3afood production 3aglobal warming 3agreen roofs 3ahot peppers 3ahydroponics 3alettuce 3alife cycle assessment 3anutrient film technique 3apublic gardens 3apublic housing 3asoil 3asummer 3atillage 3atomatoes 3awatermelons 3awinter 3aItaly1 aOrsini, Francesco1 aOliver-Solà, Jordi1 aRieradevall, Joan1 aMontero, J.

As a consequence, the partitioning of membrane additives into liposomes becomes selective with respect to liposome size; i.e., membrane rigidification depletes the membrane additives in the smaller (more strongly curved) liposomes. We have measured this liposome size-selective partitioning for two membrane additives – cholesterol and the porphyrin-based photosensitizer temoporfin – using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) of liposomes and radioactive labeling of the membrane additive and lipid. The method yields either the molar cholesterol-to-lipid or the temoporfin-to-lipid ratio as a function of liposome size, from which we calculate the corresponding change of the membrane bending stiffness. For small unilamellar fluid-phase liposomes composed of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), we find that cholesterol rigidifies the host membrane in a manner consistent with previously reported measurements. In contrast, temoporfin softens this membrane. Partitioning results for gel-phase liposomes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) are also curvature-sensitive but cannot be interpreted on the basis of the bending stiffness alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acholesterol 3adeformation 3adrugs 3afractionation 3alipid bilayers 3apeptides1 aFahr, Alfred1 aKuntsche, Judith1 aMay, Sylvio0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2012 July, v. 165, no. 5 p.520-529dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-30847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013700164300001600301520130400317592002801621650001601649650003501665650002001700650001301720650001401733650002601747650001201773650002201785650001601807650001301823650001401836650001401850650001301864650002101877650001601898650001501914650001001929653004301939653002101982653001502003653001302018653001702031653001002048700001502058700001402073700001502087773011402102856008402216852000902300655001202309IND60603037220221122234651.0180712e20150206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060303722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2014.12.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerol, A.10aDetermination of selenium urinary metabolites by high temperature liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  ap. 112-119.  aThe coupling of high temperature liquid chromatography (HTLC) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) for the determination of selenium metabolites in urine samples is reported for the first time. In order to achieve “ICPMS-friendly” chromatographic conditions, the retention on a graphite stationary phase of the major selenium urinary metabolites using only plain water with 2% methanol as the mobile phase was investigated. Under the optimal conditions (T=80°C, Ql=1.2mLmin⁻¹), methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-β-d-galactopyranoside (selenosugar 1), methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-β-d-glucosopyranoside (selenosugar 2) and trimethylselenonium ion were efficiently separated in less than 7min, without any interferences due to other common selenium species (selenite, selenate, selenocystine and selenomethionine) or detectable effect of the urine matrix. The limits of detection were 0.3–0.5ng SemL⁻¹, and the precision of the analytical procedure was better than 3% (RSD%, n=5). The HTLC-ICPMS method was applied to the analysis of urine samples from two volunteers before and after ingestion of Brazil nuts or selenium supplements. The developed procedure proved to be adequate for the analytical task, providing results consistent with previous studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrazil nuts 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3adetection limit 3agraphene 3aingestion 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3aselenates 3aselenites 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3atemperature 3aurinalysis 3aurine 0aHigh temperature liquid chromatography 0aHypercarb column 0aSpeciation 0aSelenium 0aSelenosugars 0aUrine1 aArdini, F.1 aBasso, A.1 aGrotti, M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Feb. 06, v. 1380 p.112-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.12.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140242017700153245014800330300001600478500001900494520148200513592002801995650001702023650001102040650001602051650001402067650000902081650001602090650001702106700001902123700001802142700001902160700001902179700001602198773012102214856007402335852000902409655001202418IND60719208920221123043236.0201129e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071920892DNAL7 a10.1186/BF035470082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKask, K.10aBakteriologiska och histologiska förändringar i livmodern, samt återupptagandet av äggstocksaktivitet i postpartalperioden hos mjölkkor med olika mjölkningsfrekvenser10aUterine Bacteriology, Histology, Resumption of Ovarian Activity and Granulocyte Function of the Postpartum Cow in Different Milking Frequencies  ap. 287-297.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe postpartum uterine bacteriology, histology, resumption of ovarian activity and polymorphonuclear granulocyte (PMN) number and function in 18 Swedish dairy cows were studied.

All animals in both groups were free from bacteria at the latest after 6 weeks port portum and there was no difference regarding bacterial elimination and bacterial species between milking groups. No difference regarding uterine histology between milking groups was seen. In both groups, 8 cows had normal to slight infiltration of leukocytes in the endometrium at the end of sample collection. No changes in granulocyte function could be seen in the 2 milking groups. Resumption of ovarian activity was detected on day 45.6 ± 9.3 (mean ± SD) postpartum in the 2× milking group and 36.6 ± 9.0 (mean ± SD) post-partum in the 3× milking group (p = 0.05). Based on our findings, an increased milking frequency from 2 to 3 times a day did not influence the uterine function postpartum.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteriology 3abiopsy 3aendometrium 3ahistology 3amilk 3aperiodicity 3aprogesterone1 aGustafsson, H.1 aMagnusson, U.1 aBertilsson, J.1 aGunnarsson, A.1 aKindahl, H.0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g1999 Dec., v. 40, no. 4 p.287-297dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/BF035470083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100002300159245007100182300001400253520116600267592002801433650001401461650002001475650001401495650001301509650001101522650001601533650001801549650001001567651001801577773011501595856007401710852000901784655001201793IND60082120020221120084035.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008212002DNAL7 a252935472pmid7 a10.1111/nure.121462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesensten, Nancy J10aLegitimacy of concerns about caffeine and energy drink consumption  ap. 78-86.  aWhether caffeine and energy drink consumption presents a critical emerging health problem is not currently known. Available evidence suggests that energy drink consumption represents a change in the ways in which individuals in the United States consume caffeine but that the amount of caffeine consumed daily has not appreciably increased. In the present review, the question of whether Americans are sleep deprived (a potential reason for using caffeine) is briefly explored. Reported rates of daily caffeine consumption (based on beverage formulation) and data obtained from both civilian and military populations in the United States are examined, the efficacy of ingredients other than caffeine in energy drinks is discussed, and the safety and side effects of caffeine are addressed, including whether evidence supports the contention that excessive caffeine/energy drink consumption induces risky behavior. The available evidence suggests that the main legitimate concern regarding caffeine and energy drink use is the potential negative impact on sleep but that, otherwise, there is no cause for concern regarding caffeine use in the general population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3aadverse effects 3abeverages 3acaffeine 3aenergy 3aingredients 3arisk behavior 3asleep 3aUnited States0 tNutrition reviews.g2014 Oct., v. 72 Suppl S1 p.78-86dInternational Life Sciences Institute.x0029-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nure.121463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03674naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010000168300001800268500001100286520249200297592002802789650001302817650001902830650001402849650001402863650002002877650002102897650003202918650001702950650002802967700002202995700002303017700002403040700002203064773011203086856008103198852000903279655001203288IND60465718420221122164503.0170725e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046571842DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-015-0333-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWezel, Alexander14aThe blurred boundaries of ecological, sustainable, and agroecological intensification: a review  ap. 1283-1295.  aReview  aThe projected human population of nine billion by 2050 has led to ever growing discussion of the need for increasing agricultural output to meet estimated food demands, while mitigating environmental costs. Many stakeholders in agricultural circles are calling for the intensification of agriculture to meet these demands. However, it is neither clear nor readily agreed upon what is meant by intensification. Here, we compare the three major uses, ‘ecological intensification’, ‘sustainable intensification’ and ‘agroecological intensification’, by analysing their various definitions, principles and practices, and also their historical appearance and evolution. We used data from the scientific literature, the grey literature, the websites of international organizations and the Scopus and FAOLEX databases. Our major findings are: (1) sustainable intensification is the most frequently used term so far. (2) The three concepts ecological intensification, sustainable intensification and agroecological intensification overlap in terms of definitions, principles and practices, thus creating some confusion in their meanings, interpretations and implications. Nevertheless, some differences exist. (3) Sustainable intensification is more widely used and represents in many cases a rather generalised category, into which most current farming practices can be put so long as sustainability is in some way addressed. However, despite its wider use, it remains imprecisely defined. (4) Ecological and agroecological intensification do introduce some major nuances and, in general, more explicitly stated definitions. For instance, ecological intensification emphasizes the understanding and intensification of biological and ecological processes and functions in agroecosystem. (5) The notion of agroecological intensification accentuates the system approach and integrates more cultural and social perspectives in its concept. (6) Even if some boundaries can be seen, confusion is still predominant in the use of these terms. These blurred boundaries currently contribute to the use of these terms for justifying many different kinds of practices and interventions. We suggest that greater precision in defining the terms and the respective practices proposed would indicate more clearly what authors or institutions are aiming at with the proposed intensification. In this sense, we provide new definitions for all three intensification concepts based on the earlier ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagroecosystems 3adatabases 3aevolution 3afarming systems 3ahuman population 3ainternational organizations 3astakeholders 3asustainable agriculture1 aSoboksa, Gizachew1 aMcClelland, Shelby1 aDelespesse, Florian1 aBoissau, Apolline0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2015 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.1283-1295dSpringer Parisx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0333-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245012400203300001800327520098400345592002801329650001501357650001901372650001301391650001801404650002001422650001101442650001001453650000701463650001901470650001901489700001401508700001401522700001601536700005701552700006101609700005501670700002001725773017101745856008001916852000901996655001202005IND60644494820221116144515.0190516e20190424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064449482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b011622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Baochang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3435-125010aSimultaneous Absorption of NOₓ and SO₂ into Na₂SO₃ Solution in a Rotating Packed Bed with Preoxidation by Ozone  ap. 8332-8341.  aThis study employed a rotating packed bed (RPB) to enhance the absorption process of NOₓ and SO₂ into Na₂SO₃ solution with the preoxidation by ozone. The absorption performance of NOₓ and SO₂ was evaluated in terms of removal efficiency (ηR) and overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient (KGa) under various operating conditions including O₃/NOₓ molar ratio (MR), rotation speed of RPB (N), gas–liquid ratio (G/L), Na₂SO₃ concentration (CNₐ₂SO₃), inlet SO₂ concentration (CSO₂), solution pH, and oxygen concentration (CO₂). The effect laws of the operating conditions on the ηR and KGa of both NOₓ and SO₂ have been obtained. The results showed that ηR values of NOₓ and SO₂ can reach up to 90 and 99%, respectively. Therefore, this process with the advantages of high efficiency, small size, and simple process for simultaneous absorption NOₓ and SO₂ exhibits a wide application prospect in the field of flue gas purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aflue gas 3amass transfer 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3aozone 3apH 3asodium sulfite 3asulfur dioxide1 aDong, Kun1 aZhao, Wei1 aWang, Jiwei1 aChu, Guangwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3047-70241 aZhang, Liangliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6812-68601 aZou, Haikui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0681-90361 aChen, Jian-Feng0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Apr. 24, v. 58, no. 19 p.8332-8341dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b011623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008500169300001800254520199100272592002802263650001702291650001902308650001502327650001202342650001902354650001802373650002202391650001502413650002602428650000902454650001202463650001302475650001402488650001702502651001202519700002102531700001302552700001902565700002702584700002102611773011202632856008102744852000902825655001202834IND60465718620221122170839.0170725e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046571862DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-015-0330-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasielski, Joshua10aAgroforestry promotes soybean yield stability and N2-fixation under water stress  ap. 1541-1549.  aAgroforestry systems can buffer crop performance against the impacts of climate change, particularly decreases in the availability of soil water. Nonetheless, farmers are reluctant to adopt agroforestry systems due to concerns of yield losses, predominantly in the tree-crop competitive zone. Yet little is known about crop performance in the tree-crop competitive zone under water limited conditions. We therefore studied the effect of a full season water deficit on soybean N₂-fixation, nodulation, and yield in the tree-crop zone of a mature agroforestry system. We hypothesized higher N₂-fixation yet lower but stable yield in the tree-crop zone. Rainfall reduction shelters were used to reduce available soil moisture throughout the growing season in the tree-crop competitive zone of a 27-year-old tree-based intercropping agroforestry system and a paired monoculture control plot in southern Ontario, Canada. Results show that soybean yields in the tree-crop zone were lower compared to monoculture. However, soybean yields were stable in agroforestry and only in monoculture did the rainfall reduction induce a significant decline in soybean yields. Soybeans in the tree-crop zone relied heavily on N₂-fixation to meet N demand, with a percentage of N derived from atmosphere (%Ndfa) of 91 % versus 63 % in monoculture. However, total fixed N declined significantly under rainfall reduction in both the tree-crop zone and in monoculture. Of note, soybean nodulation patterns adapted to soil moisture availability, allocating a larger proportion of nodules lower on the rooting system under water limitation. Our results demonstrate that important N pathways may be altered under water limitation. We can also expect that in areas where growing conditions are predicted to become drier in the future, yields in the tree-crop competitive zone will not be reduced further, thus increasing the viability of adopting agroforestry systems in areas affected by climatic change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3afarmers 3agrowing season 3aintercropping 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3aplant available water 3arain 3arooting 3asoybeans 3aviability 3awater stress 3aOntario1 aFurze, Jessie R.1 aTan, Jun1 aBargaz, Adnane1 aThevathasan, Naresh V.1 aIsaac, Marney E.0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2015 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.1541-1549dSpringer Parisx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0330-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04063naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002600175245007400201300001400275520238300289592002802672650001802700650002802718650001802746650001702764650001602781650001802797650001302815650001302828650002502841650002002866650001102886650001502897650001902912650002602931650003102957650001902988650002003007650001703027650001703044650001303061650001903074650002303093650001203116700002703128773014903155856006803304856010503372990002303477852000903500655001203509IND60643344420221122045056.0190510e20120302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064334442DNAL7 a10.3791/36412doi7 aPMC33994642pmcid7 a224155752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolehmainen, Kathleen10aPreparation of 3d fibrin scaffolds for stem cell culture applications  ap. e3641.  aStem cells are found in naturally occurring 3D microenvironments in vivo, which are often referred to as the stem cell niche 1. Culturing stem cells inside of 3D biomaterial scaffolds provides a way to accurately mimic these microenvironments, providing an advantage over traditional 2D culture methods using polystyrene as well as a method for engineering replacement tissues 2. While 2D tissue culture polystrene has been used for the majority of cell culture experiments, 3D biomaterial scaffolds can more closely replicate the microenvironments found in vivo by enabling more accurate establishment of cell polarity in the environment and possessing biochemical and mechanical properties similar to soft tissue.3 A variety of naturally derived and synthetic biomaterial scaffolds have been investigated as 3D environments for supporting stem cell growth. While synthetic scaffolds can be synthesized to have a greater range of mechanical and chemical properties and often have greater reproducibility, natural biomaterials are often composed of proteins and polysaccharides found in the extracelluar matrix and as a result contain binding sites for cell adhesion and readily support cell culture. Fibrin scaffolds, produced by polymerizing the protein fibrinogen obtained from plasma, have been widely investigated for a variety of tissue engineering applications both in vitro and in vivo 4. Such scaffolds can be modified using a variety of methods to incorporate controlled release systems for delivering therapeutic factors 5. Previous work has shown that such scaffolds can be used to successfully culture embryonic stem cells and this scaffold-based culture system can be used to screen the effects of various growth factors on the differentiation of the stem cells seeded inside 6,7. This protocol details the process of polymerizing fibrin scaffolds from fibrinogen solutions using the enzymatic activity of thrombin. The process takes 2 days to complete, including an overnight dialysis step for the fibrinogen solution to remove citrates that inhibit polymerization. These detailed methods rely on fibrinogen concentrations determined to be optimal for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell culture. Other groups have further investigated fibrin scaffolds for a wide range of cell types and applications - demonstrating the versatility of this approach 8-12.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3abiocompatible materials 3acell adhesion 3acell culture 3acell growth 3acell polarity 3acitrates 3adialysis 3aembryonic stem cells 3aenzyme activity 3afibrin 3afibrinogen 3agrowth factors 3amechanical properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymerization 3apolysaccharides 3apolystyrenes 3atherapeutics 3athrombin 3atissue culture 3atissue engineering 3atissues1 aWillerth, Stephanie M.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Mar. 02, , no. 61 p.e3641-e3641dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/36413Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3641/preparation-of-3d-fibrin-scaffolds-for-stem-cell-culture-applications  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245008600168300001600254520079100270592002801061650001801089650003801107650001701145650001901162650001901181650001101200650001301211650001901224650001801243650003801261700001501299700001701314700001701331773011201348856008901460852000901549655001201558IND60093703220221118004809.0141103e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009370322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Dan10aMicrostructure study of liposomes decorated by hydrophobic magnetic nanoparticles  ap. 563-570.  aMagnetoliposomes, consisting of liposomes and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), have been tailored as very promising delivery vehicles in biotechnology and biomedicine applications.

This species was known previously from two nearby collections, made in 1984, in the type locality at the Ramos Mexía reservoir (Neuquén province) and was not recorded since. Fresh material from the new population enabled detailed morphological analyses, which are extensively described here, illustrated and compared to type material of the species. Based on the smooth female involucre, the species belongs to subgenus Riella Mont. However, cross-sections of this structure showed that R. choconensis has bistratose involucre walls, contrasting with the unistratose female involucres of all other species in the genus. The updated morphological data are integrated into a new key to the identification of the American species of Riella.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJunco 3aMarchantiophyta 3afemales 3aindigenous species 3asediments 3aArgentina 0aaquatic liverworts 0abryophytes 0achorology 0afloristic studies 0aSouth America 0athreatened species1 aPuche, Felisa1 aGleiser, Gabriela0 tCryptogamie.g2018 Sept. 18, v. 40, no. 12 p.131-140dAssociation des Amis des CryptogameswJournal:11621x1776-09927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5252/cryptogamie-bryologie2019v40a123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011200174300001800286520053800304592002800842650004400870650001800914650001700932650002800949650001300977650001500990650002601005700001901031700002001050700002501070700002101095700002501116700002101141700002101162700002601183700002201209700003301231773010401264856008601368852000901454655001201463IND60578271320180713000000.0170812e20160308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057827132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b024072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchelkle, Korwin

The system was optimized and validated using environmental standard compound mixtures of e.g. carbamate pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to characterize the chromatographic system, to test the stability of the retention times and orthogonality. Various stationary phases in the second dimension were compared for the LC×LC analysis of silicon rubber passive sampler extracts of a wastewater effluent. A combination of C18 and Pentafluorophenyl (PFP) was found to be most effective. Finally, the hyphenation of LC×LC with HR-ToF MS was optimized, including splitter settings, transfer of data files between the different software packages and background subtraction using instrument software tools, after which tentative identification of 20 environmental contaminants was achieved, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and food additives.

A two-year field study was planned to evaluate comparative effects of various Zn application approaches in bread wheat under plough tillage (PT) and zero tillage (ZT) system. Cultivation of wheat under ZT improved the soil organic carbon (17%), total soil porosity (11%), soil microbial biomass nitrogen (5%), and carbon (5%) in comparison to PT system averaged across the two years. Various efficiency indices were significantly influenced by Zn application methods during both years of experimentation. However, grain Zn contents were maximum with foliar-applied Zn in PT (31%) and soil-applied Zn under the ZT system (29.85%). Moreover, Zn use also enhanced the bioavailable Zn as lower phytate contents and phytate to Zn molar ratio were recorded. The highest bioavailable Zn was calculated for foliar (30%) and soil application (28%). Under both tillage systems, the maximum net benefits were obtained through Zn seed priming; nevertheless, ZT resulted in higher net benefits than PT due to low associated costs. In conclusion, Zn nutrition through different methods enhanced the productivity, profitability, and grain biofortification of wheat under PT and ZT systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abiofortification 3acrop production 3afoliar application 3ahuman health 3amicrobial nitrogen 3ano-tillage 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphytic acid 3aplows 3aporosity 3aprofitability 3aseed priming 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil treatment 3awheat 3azinc1 aHussain, Saddam 1 aIshfaq, Muhammad 1 aMatloob, Amar 1 aAli, Nauman 1 aAhmad, Muhammad 1 aAlyemeni, Mohammed Nasser,1 aAhmad, Parvaiz 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Oct. 14, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy101015663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245005200172300001400224520127400238592002801512650002201540650001401562650003001576650001201606650001301618650002301631650001801654650001001672650002201682650001501704650001401719650002001733650001601753650001201769650001201781650001101793650001401804650001001818650002201828650002001850653002801870653001801898653001301916653001901929653002301948653001801971773009601989856008702085852000902172655001202181IND60610044720221120210954.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061004472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2017.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullet, John E.10aHigh-biomass C4 grasses—Filling the yield gap  ap. 10-17.  aA significant increase in agricultural productivity will be required by 2050 to meet the needs of an expanding and rapidly developing world population, without allocating more land and water resources to agriculture, and despite slowing rates of grain yield improvement. This review examines the proposition that high-biomass C4 grasses could help fill the yield gap. High-biomass C4 grasses exhibit high yield due to C4 photosynthesis, long growth duration, and efficient capture and utilization of light, water, and nutrients. These C4 grasses exhibit high levels of drought tolerance during their long vegetative growth phase ideal for crops grown in water-limited regions of agricultural production. The stems of some high-biomass C4 grasses can accumulate high levels of non-structural carbohydrates that could be engineered to enhance biomass yield and utility as feedstocks for animals and biofuels production. The regulatory pathway that delays flowering of high-biomass C4 grasses in long days has been elucidated enabling production and deployment of hybrids. Crop and landscape-scale modeling predict that utilization of high-biomass C4 grass crops on land and in regions where water resources limit grain crop yield could increase agricultural productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aC4 plants 3aagricultural productivity 3aanimals 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3acarbohydrates 3acrops 3adrought tolerance 3afeedstocks 3aflowering 3afuel production 3agrain yield 3agrasses 3ahybrids 3amodels 3anutrients 3astems 3avegetative growth 3awater resources 0aHigh-biomass C4 grasses 0aFood security 0aBiofuels 0aFlowering time 0aDrought resilience 0aCrop modeling0 tPlant science.g2017 Aug., v. 261 p.10-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2017.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245009800166300001600264500001900280520167100299592002801970650001401998650002202012650002202034650001302056650001402069650001302083650001402096650001802110650001702128650001602145653000802161653002302169653001102192700002302203700002302226700001902249700002102268700001402289700002202303700001802325773011702343856007802460852000902538655001202547IND60686292820221120163723.0200602e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068629282DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2019.01802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Brianna R.10aHigh Rates of Obesity at Presentation Persist into Survivorship across Childhood Cancer Types  ap. 250-257.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground: Subtypes of pediatric oncology patients and childhood cancer survivors who are overweight or obese have worse prognosis than their healthy-weighted peers. Several studies have examined weight status in either pediatric patients or survivors with acute leukemia, but few have compared these data across various diagnoses. Objectives: We examined BMI from oncology diagnosis or presentation, through treatment, and into survivorship across the most common cancer types seen in pediatric oncology. Methods: Patients were categorized into three oncologic diagnoses: leukemia and lymphoma (n = 69), neural tumors (n = 80), and non-neural solid tumors (n = 80) at yearly intervals over the course of 11 years. To allow for comparisons across age groups, BMI percentiles were calculated with <5th percentile classified as underweight (n = 11), the 5th–84th percentile classified as a healthy weight (n = 129), and above the 85th percentile classified as overweight and obese (n = 87). Results: At presentation, 45.6% of leukemia and lymphoma patients were overweight or obese, and 44.3% of neural tumor patients were overweight or obese. These high obesity rates persisted into survivorship. Compared to the non-neural tumor group, the leukemia and lymphoma group had a significant increase in BMI percentile over time, while the neural tumor group did not.

Recently, anti‐TB peptides have provided an alternative approach to combat antibiotic tolerance. We have developed an effective computational predictor, identification of antitubercular peptides (iAntiTB), by the integration of multiple feature vectors deriving from the amino acid sequences via random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The iAntiTB combines the RF and SVM scores via linear regression to enhance the prediction accuracy. To make a robust and accurate predictor, we prepared the two datasets with different types of negative samples. The iAntiTB achieved area under the ROC curve values of 0.896 and 0.946 on the training datasets of the first and second datasets, respectively. The iAntiTB outperformed the other existing predictors.  aPublisher supplied data  a19H04208cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  cMinistry of Economy, Trade and Industry  cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aamino acids 3aantibiotic resistance 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3apeptides 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asupport vector machines 3atuberculosis1 aHasan, Mehedi1 aKurata, Hiroyuki0 tFEBS letters.g2019 Nov., v. 593, no. 21 p.3029-3039dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.135363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245015800158300001800316500002000334520096100354592002801315596005901343596005701402596005901459596006201518596008401580650001201664650002201676650001601698650002101714650001201735650002201747650002301769650001001792650004301802650002001845650002901865650001301894700001601907700001501923700001401938700001801952700001901970700001301989700001602002700005502018773011602073856008002189852000902269655001202278IND60786884820221119133714.0220806e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078688482DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.135372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jing10aEgr‐1 transcriptionally activates protein phosphatase PTP1B to facilitate hyperinsulinemia‐induced insulin resistance in the liver in type 2 diabetes  ap. 3054-3063.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDuring the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hyperinsulinemia is the earliest symptom. It is believed that long‐term high insulin stimulation might facilitate insulin resistance in the liver, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Herein, we report that hyperinsulinemia could induce persistent early growth response gene‐1 (Egr‐1) activation in hepatocytes, which provides negative feedback inhibition of insulin sensitivity by inducing the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase‐1B (PTP1B). Deletion of Egr‐1 in the liver remarkably decreases glucose production, thus improving systemic glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mechanistic analysis indicates that Egr‐1 inhibits insulin receptor phosphorylation by directly activating PTP1B transcription in the liver. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia accelerates insulin resistance in hepatocytes during the progression of T2DM.  aPublisher supplied data  a31601153cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a530046cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91857109cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK20160619cNature Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  a201801B054cthe program A/B for Outstanding PhD candidate of Nanjing University 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahepatocytes 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin receptors 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aphosphorylation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atyrosine1 aTao, Weiwei1 aBu, Dandan1 aZhao, Yue1 aZhang, Tongyu1 aChong, Danyang1 aXue, Bin1 aXing, Zheng1 aLi, Chaojun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9474-73210 tFEBS letters.g2019 Nov., v. 593, no. 21 p.3054-3063dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.135373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245010000205300001800305520188000323592002802203650001102231650002002242650001202262650002602274650002502300650001202325650001302337650001002350650001302360650001402373650001602387650001202403650001002415650001602425650001602441651001502457653002002472653001102492653001202503653002102515653001702536653003102553700002002584700002002604700002102624700002202645700002202667773013402689856007802823852000902901655001202910IND60671529720221120081108.0191003e20190926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067152972DNAL7 a10.1093/jmammal/gyz0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthews, Sean M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2506-758110aReproductive den selection and its consequences for fisher neonates, a cavity-obligate mustelid  ap. 1305-1316.  aSelection of habitat characteristics by reproductive females during neonate development can mediate the influence of adverse environmental conditions on the fitness of offspring. Previous research has suggested that cavities and burrows used for reproduction by cavity-obligate species offer thermoregulatory benefits, access to prey, and can limit predation pressure. As fishers (Pekania pennanti) are secondary cavity-obligate breeders, we hypothesized that they select particular characteristics of reproductive den cavities at discrete stages of offspring development to mediate adverse biotic and environmental effects on their neonates. To test our hypothesis, we located 406 reproductive dens and 154 cavity rest sites used by 65 individual adult female fishers during 11 reproductive seasons (2005–2016) in northwestern California. We counted 53 (27 F, 26 M) kits in 31 litters born to 19 females during six of these reproductive seasons. The weight of kits varied significantly by sex and by age, whereas the length of kits varied only by age, suggesting that adult females in this population might be preferentially investing in male kits. We found that natal and early-maternal dens buffered minimum temperatures significantly more than late-maternal dens and cavities used during the nonreproductive season. A male fisher skull was also less likely to fit through the cavity openings of natal dens than through the openings of cavities used by adult females during the nonreproductive season. Litter survival was significantly lower at natal dens than at late-maternal dens. The age of adult female fishers did not affect the probability of litter survival. Our results emphasize the vulnerability of vertebrate offspring during early developmental periods and how cavity-obligate species select cavities to mediate environmental conditions during reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abreeding season 3aburrows 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3afemales 3ahabitats 3amales 3aneonates 3apredation 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3askull 3atemperature 3avertebrates 3aCalifornia 0acavity-obligate 0afisher 0aneonate 0aPekania pennanti 0areproduction 0areproductive den selection1 aGreen, David S.1 aHigley, J.

In the present study, the possibility of retention modeling for method development purposes in SFC was investigated, considering several non-linear isocratic relationships. Therefore, both isocratic and gradient runs were performed, involving different column chemistries and analytes possessing diverse physico-chemical properties. The isocratic retention data of these compounds could be described accurately using the non-linear retention models typically used in HILIC and reversed-phase LC. The interconversion between isocratic and gradient retention data was found to be less straightforward than in RPLC and HILIC because of pressure effects. The possibility of gradient predictions using gradient scouting runs to estimate the retention parameters was investigated as well, showing that predictions for other gradients with the same starting conditions were acceptable (always below 5%), whereas prediction errors for gradients with a different starting condition were found to be highly dependent on the compound. The second part of the study consisted of the gradient optimization of two pharmaceutical mixtures (one involving atorvastatin and four related impurities, and one involving a 16 components mixture including eight drugs and their main phase I metabolites). This could be done via individual retention modeling based on gradient scouting runs. The best linear gradient was found via a grid search and the best multi-segment gradient via the previously published one-segment-per-component search. The latter improved the resolution between the critical pairs for both mixtures, while still giving accurate prediction errors (using the same starting concentrations as the gradient scouting runs used to build the model). The optimized separations were found in less than 3h and 8h of analysis time (including equilibration times), respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3adrugs 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3asolvents 3asupercritical fluid chromatography 0aSFC 0aUHPSFC 0aMethod development 0aRetention modeling 0aRetention prediction1 aDesfontaine, Vincent1 aDesmet, Gert1 aGuillarme, Davy0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Feb. 13, v. 1381 p.219-228dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.12.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245012100185300001300306520142900319592002801748650001001776650001201786650003301798650001501831650001301846650001301859650001301872650002301885650001501908650002201923650001601945651001101961653001201972653001301984653001201997653002802009653001302037700003402050700002802084700001802112700002602130773010802156856008702264852000902351655001202360IND60561060620221120040105.0190318e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056106062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Gabriela Ribeiro14aThe relationship between bird distribution patterns and environmental factors in an ecotone area of northeast Brazil  ap. 6-13.  aDetermining the processes that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of species diversity has been one of the great challenges for biologists. Of the many mechanisms and factors that affect diversity, environmental condition (i.e. the biophysical characteristics of habitats) is one of the main drivers structuring biological communities. In the present study, we assessed bird diversity patterns in a Cerrado-Caatinga ecotone area in the northeast of Brazil and investigated which environmental variables determined variation in species richness and composition among habitats. Cerrado areas had the highest richness of bird species among sampled sites, with ecotone areas presenting an intermediate richness, and Caatinga sites containing the lowest richness. There was a higher occurrence of generalist species from the two surrounding biomes in the ecotone region. However, some endemic species to the Caatinga were also found in the ecotone region, but only within habitat patches typical of the Caatinga. Temperature and humidity were the two most important environmental variables in explaining variation in species composition among study sites. Therefore, our results suggest climatic differences between habitat types underpin changes in local species composition and, thus, can be used to inform predictions about the potential impacts of future environmental changes on bird communities in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acerrado 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3aecotones 3ahabitats 3ahumidity 3aindigenous species 3aprediction 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aBrazil 0aCerrado 0aCaatinga 0aEcotone 0aEnvironmental variables 0aEndemism1 aSantos, Marcos Pérsio Dantas1 aCerqueira, Pablo Vieira1 aJuen, Leandro1 aBispo, Arthur Ângelo0 tJournal of arid environments.g2017 May, v. 140 p.6-13dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04560naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245014400176500001900320520269800339592002803037650002703065650001303092650001603105650002603121650001403147650001603161650001803177650001303195650002003208650001603228650001003244650001503254650001303269650001703282650003703299650002903336650002003365650001403385650001703399650003003416650001803446650001403464650001603478651001103494653003403505653002803539653002503567653003103592700005903623700006303682700003003745773009603775856009003871852000903961655001203970IND60727438620221121064226.0210415e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072743862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1058592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarazi, Yaser H.10aAntimicrobial susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from drinking water and hospitalized patients in Jordan  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an important environmental, opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen with a significant threat to public health.

Bacterial isolation and identification was performed using routine microbiological methods and confirmed using PCR technique targeting the 16S rDNA gene. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the 2-fold microdilution method. Synergy interaction between various antimicrobials was determined using the checkerboard method and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). The majority of water isolates were sensitive to gentamicin (93.3%), ticarcillin (86.7%) and ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, amikacin, colistin, piperacillin, azlocillin, aztreonam, ceftazidime and imipenem (100% each). All water isolates (100%) were resistant to amoxicillin, oxytetracycline and doxycycline (93.3% and 86.7, respectively). For the clinical isolates, all (100%) were sensitive to ceftazidime, 81.3% were sensitive to aztreonam, while 62.5% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, colistin, piperacillin, ticracillin, azlocillin, and imipenem. All clinical isolates (100%) were resistant to oxytetracycline, doxycycline and amoxicillin. Analysis of the checkerboard synergy assay of multi-drug resistant isolates (n=26) showed significant synergism (P ≤ 0.05) when ciprofloxacin or gentamicin were included in the combination. There were no significant differences in synergistic activity between ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin when combined with other antimicrobial agents of the beta-lactams or aminoglycosides classes. There were no significant differences in the synergistic activities between beta lactams – aminoglycoside and beta lactams – fluoroquinolone combinations. Results of this study indicate an alarming widespread presence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa associated with chronic suppurative infections in hospitalized patients and apparently clean drinking water in Jordan. Treatment of clinical suppurative lesions must be based on culture and in vitro susceptibility testing using potent antimicrobial combinations to avoid emergence of resistant strains and to improve the clinical outcome of treated patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aamikacin 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaztreonam 3aceftazidime 3aciprofloxacin 3acolistin 3across infection 3adoxycycline 3agenes 3agentamicin 3aimipenem 3alevofloxacin 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoxytetracycline 3apathogens 3apiperacillin 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3asynergism 3aticarcillin 3aJordan 0aMultidrug resistant pathogens 0aOpportunistic pathogens 0aNosocomial infection 0aCheckerboard synergy assay1 aAbu-Basha, Ehab1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2848-94611 aIsmail, Zuhair Bani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7267-82701 aAl-Jawasreh, Shereen Issa0 tActa tropica.g2021 May, v. 217 p.105859-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1058593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014100159300001800300520165200318592002801970650001401998650002502012650001902037650002602056650001802082650002202100650001902122650001802141650001502159650001302174650002102187650002302208650001102231650001702242650000902259650001102268650002502279650000902304650001502313700002402328700002302352700001702375773013302392856007402525852000902599655001202608IND60662097320221116230658.0190904e20130925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066209732DNAL7 a10.1039/c3em00235g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThwala, Melusi14aThe oxidative toxicity of Ag and ZnO nanoparticles towards the aquatic plant Spirodela punctuta and the role of testing media parameters  ap. 1830-1843.  aThe toxicity effects of silver (nAg) and zinc oxide (nZnO) engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) on the duckweed Spirodela punctuta were studied to investigate the potential risks posed by these ENPs towards higher aquatic plants. The influence of media abiotic factors on the stability of the ENPs was also evaluated. Marked agglomeration of ENPs was observed after introduction into testing media whereby large particles settled out of suspension and accumulated at the bottom of testing vessels. The high ionic strength (IS) promoted agglomeration of ENPs because it reduced the inter-particle repulsion caused by a reduction in their surface charge. Low dissolution was observed for nAg, reaching only 0.015% at 1000 mg L⁻¹, whilst improved dissolution was observed for nZnO, only falling below analytical quantification at 0.1 mg L⁻¹ and lower. The quantification of free radicals namely, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), indicated the induction of oxidative stress in plants exposed to the ENPs. A definite dose influence was observed for ROS/RNS volumes in plants exposed to nZnO for 14 days, a response not always observed. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in plants indicated varying degrees of oxidative toxicity caused by exposure to ENPs. This toxicity was driven mainly by particulates in plants exposed to nAg, whilst dissolved Zn²⁺ was the main driver for toxicity in plants exposed to nZnO. Our findings suggest that the toxicity of nAg and nZnO could be caused by both the particulates and ionic forms, as modified by media properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpirodela 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquatic plants 3aenvironmental factors 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aionic strength 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3aoxidative toxicity 3aoxygen 3aparticulates 3arisk 3asilver 3asuperoxide dismutase 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aMusee, N.q(Ndeke),1 aSikhwivhilu, Lucky1 aWepener, V.,0 tEnvironmental science.g2013 Sept. 25, v. 15, no. 10 p.1830-1843dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em00235g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245008400169300001800253500002000271520092200291592002801213596005601241596006001297596006001357596002701417650001601444650001301460650000901473650002001482650002101502650001601523700002301539700002201562700002601584700002401610700002101634700006001655773011601715856008001831852000901911655001201920IND60786884920221119133619.0220806e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078688492DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.135612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSt. Clair, Riley M.10aPKC induces release of a functional ectodomain of the guidance cue semaphorin6A  ap. 3015-3028.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSemaphorins (Semas) are a family of secreted and transmembrane proteins that play critical roles in development. Interestingly, several vertebrate transmembrane Sema classes are capable of producing functional soluble ectodomains. However, little is known of soluble Sema6 ectodomains in the nervous system. Herein, we show that the soluble Sema6A ectodomain, sSema6A, exhibits natural and protein kinase C (PKC)‐induced release. We show that PKC mediates Sema6A phosphorylation at specific sites and while this phosphorylation is not the primary mechanism regulating sSema6A production, we found that the intracellular domain confers resistance to ectodomain release. Finally, sSema6A is functional as it promotes the cohesion of zebrafish early eye field explants. This suggests that in addition to its canonical contact‐mediated functions, Sema6A may have regulated, long‐range, forward‐signaling capacity.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS 1625154cU.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)  aDBI REU 1262786cU.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)  a8P20GM103449cU.

The objective of this study was to resolve the dry/wet season response of respiration in CWD (R (cwd)), and investigate the importance of biotic and abiotic factors for predicting the seasonal change of R (cwd) at the ecosystem level. This study presents a 4-month time series of R (cwd) measurements conducted on 42 dead trees (26 species) at the Paracou Research Station in French Guiana. R (cwd) measurements were repeated 13 times on each CWD sample from July to November 2011, spanning the transition from wet to dry season, and then from dry season to the following wet season. Seasonal drought caused monthly R (cwd) to drop by 20.5 +/- A 5.1% over the wet-dry transition. Changes in woody tissue moisture content explained 41.9% of the measured seasonal variability in R (cwd), but 60% of the seasonal variability in mean forest R (cwd) rates could be modelled using surface soil water content. We estimate that R (cwd) is approximately 5% of annual ecosystem respiration (R (eco)) and that seasonal variations in R (cwd) contribute appreciably to seasonal variations of R (eco), and should be included in functional models simulating the response of tropical rainforest ecosystems to current and future climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3acoarse woody debris 3adrought 3adry season 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3aseasonal variation 3asoil water content 3atime series analysis 3atropical rain forests 3awater content 3awet season 3aFrench Guiana1 aStahl, C.1 aBonal, D.1 aSiebicke, L.1 aWilliams, M.1 aMeir, P.0 tEcosystems.g2013 Nov., v. 16, no. 7 p.1294-1309dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-013-9684-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015200157300001800309520115100327592002801478650001601506650002301522650002301545650002501568650001901593650001701612650001501629650002601644650000901670650004101679650001401720650001001734650001901744650002401763650001501787650001701802650002001819650001301839650001101852650001801863651001801881700001501899700001301914773013101927856007402058852000902132655001202141IND60662097420221116230454.0190904e20130724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066209742DNAL7 a10.1039/c3em00239j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Yuegang10aDetermination of estrogenic steroids and microbial and photochemical degradation of 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in lake surface water, a case study  ap. 1529-1535.  aIn this study, a GC-MS technique was applied to determine 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), an active ingredient of oral contraceptives, and its fate in Lake Quinsigamond, Massachusetts, USA. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study of EE2 and its microbial and photochemical degradation in a lake ecosystem. EE2 was detected at a concentration up to 11.1 ng L⁻¹. At this concentration EE2 may affect the reproduction of fish and other aquatic organisms in the lake due to its high estrogenic activity. EE2 was persistent to the biodegradation by the microorganisms in the lake. Under aerobic conditions a long lag phase (42 days) was observed before the biodegradation of EE2 and a half-life of 108 days was estimated. Under anaerobic conditions, EE2 experienced even a longer acclimation stage (63 days) and a slower microbial degradation in the lake water. The photodegradation of EE2 was rapid in the lake surface water under natural sunlight, with a half-life of less than 2 days in summer sunny days. Compared to biodegradation, photodegradation may represent a predominant removal mechanism for EE2 in natural surface waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aactive ingredients 3aaerobic conditions 3aanaerobic conditions 3abiodegradation 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aestrogenic properties 3afish 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahalf life 3alakes 3amicroorganisms 3aoral contraceptives 3aphotolysis 3areproduction 3asolar radiation 3asteroids 3asummer 3asurface water 3aMassachusetts1 aZhang, Kai1 aZhou, Si0 tEnvironmental science.g2013 July 24, v. 15, no. 8 p.1529-1535dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em00239j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245014000166300001800306520147600324592002801800650002301828650001901851650001201870650002001882650001601902651000901918651001501927651001201942651001601954653001801970653002201988653002602010653001902036653002002055700002402075700002402099700003202123700002002155700003602175773013402211856007802345852000902423655001202432IND60671529920221120081101.0191003e20190926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067152992DNAL7 a10.1093/jmammal/gyz0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollazo, Jaime A.10aPopulation estimates of Antillean manatees in Puerto Rico: an analytical framework for aerial surveys using multi-pass removal sampling  ap. 1340-1349.  aEffective management of the threatened Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) in Puerto Rico requires reliable estimates of population size. Estimates are needed to assess population responses to management actions, and whether recovery objectives have been met. Aerial surveys have been conducted since 1976, but none adjusted for imperfect detection. We summarize surveys since 1976, report on current distribution, and provide population estimates after accounting for apparent detection probability for surveys between June 2010 and March 2014. Estimates in areas of high concentration (hotspots) averaged 317 ± 101, three times higher than unadjusted counts (104 ± 0.56). Adjusted estimates in three areas outside hotspots also differed markedly from counts (75 ± 9.89 versus 19.5 ± 3.5). Average minimum island-wide estimate was 386 ± 89, similar to the maximum estimate of 360 suggested in 2005, but fewer than the 700 recently suggested by the Puerto Rico Manatee Conservation Center. Manatees were more widespread than previously understood. Improving estimates, locally or island-wide, will require stratifying the island differently and greater knowledge about factors affecting detection probability. Sharing our protocol with partners in nearby islands (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola), whose populations share genetic make-up, would contribute to enhanced regional conservation through better population estimates and tracking range expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichechus manatus 3aaerial surveys 3aislands 3apopulation size 3aprobability 3aCuba 3aHispaniola 3aJamaica 3aPuerto Rico 0aaerial survey 0aAntillean manatee 0adetection probability 0aremoval method 0arepeated counts1 aKrachey, Matthew J.1 aPollock, Kenneth H.1 aPérez-Aguilo, Francisco J.1 aZegarra, Jan P.1 aMignucci- Giannoni, Antonio A.,0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2019 Sept. 26, v. 100, no. 4 p.1340-1349dAmerican Society of MammalogistswJournal:11623x0022-23727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyz0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010200172300001800274520133300292592002801625650004401653650002401697650002501721650001901746650001801765650001901783650002301802650003001825650001301855650002801868650001101896650001301907650001301920700002301933700001901956700001701975700002101992700002102013700001702034700003102051700002202082700002302104700002302127773010402150856008602254852000902340655001202349IND60578271820221119141416.0170812e20160308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057827182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b024832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarkakaty, Balaka10aAmidine-Functionalized Poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone) for Selective and Efficient CO2 Fixing  ap. 1523-1531.  aDevelopment of novel polymeric materials capable of efficient CO₂ capture and separation under ambient conditions is crucial for cost-effective and practical industrial applications. Here we report the facile synthesis of a new CO₂-responsive polymer through postpolymerization modification of poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone) (PVDMA). The reactive pendant azlactone groups of PVDMA are easily modified with 4-(N-methyltetrahydropyrimidine)benzyl alcohol (PBA) without any byproduct formation. FTIR and TGA experiments show the new PBA-functionalized polymer powder can reversibly capture CO₂ at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. CO₂ capture was selective, showing a high fixing efficiency even with a mixed gas system (20% CO₂, 80% N₂) similar to flue gas. CO₂ release occurred at room temperature, and release profiles were investigated as a function of temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations coupled with modeling and simulation reveal the presence of two CO₂ binding sites in the PBA-functionalized polymer resulting in a two-step CO₂ release at room temperature. The ease of material preparation, high fixing efficiency, and robust release characteristics suggest that postpolymerization modification may be a useful route to designing new materials for CO₂ capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3abenzyl alcohol 3abinding sites 3acarbon dioxide 3acost effectiveness 3adensity functional theory 3aflue gas 3aindustrial applications 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apolymers1 aBrowning, Katie

Recent advances linking physicochemical properties to spectroscopic analyzes (UV, Fluorescence, IR) have shown that the refractory property is favored by several physicochemical parameters: weight, hydrophobicity, aromaticity and chemical functions. Currently, the most effective developments for the quantification of refractory compounds are obtained with hyphenated methods, based on steric separation of the macromolecular species by steric exclusion chromatography (SEC)/PDA/Fluorescence systems. Hyphenated techniques using High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS), ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry with Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and NMR have been developed to analyze macromolecules in wastewater with minor sample preparation procedures. A particular class has been identified, the melanoidins, generated by Maillard reactions between sugars, amino acids, peptides and proteins present in wastewater and sludge, but low molecular weight compounds formed as intermediates, such as ketones, aldehydes, pyrazines, pyridines or furans, are also recalcitrant and are complex to identify in the complex matrices. The lack of available standards for the study of these compounds requires the use of specific techniques and data processing. Advances in chemometrics are obtained in the development of molecular or physicochemical indices resulting from the data generated by the analytical detectors, such as aromaticity calculated by SUVA₂₅₄ and determined by UV, fluorescence, molar mass, H/C ratio or structural studies (measuring the amount of unsaturated carbon) given by hyphenated techniques with SEC. It is clear that nitrogen compounds are widely involved in refractoriness. New trends in nitrogen containing compounds characterization follow two axes: through SEC/PDA/Fluorescence and HRMS/NMR techniques with or without separation. Other techniques widely used in food or marine science are also being imported to this study, as it can be seen in the use of “omics” methods, high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and chromatography at the critical condition, rounding out the important developments around SEC. While improving the performance of stationary phases is one of the challenges, it results in a fundamental understanding of the retention mechanisms that today provide us with more information on the structures identified. The main objective of this review is to present the spectroscopic and physicochemical techniques used to qualify and characterize refractoriness with a specific focus on chemometric approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemometrics 3afluorescence 3afurans 3agel chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3amarine science 3amass spectrometry 3amelanoidins 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apeptides 3apyrazines 3apyridines 3asludge 3athin layer chromatography 3awastewater 0aRecalcitrant organic compounds 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aSize exclusion chromatography 0aHyphenated techniques1 aGehin, Nicolas1 aBalayssac, Stéphane1 aGilard, Véronique1 aMazeghrane, Sofiane1 aHaddad, Mathieu1 aGaval, Gilberte1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4127-53991 aPaul, Etienne1 aGarrigues, Jean-Christophe0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 1152 p.338284-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11651x0003-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2021.3382843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245018200172300001600354520106400370592002801434650001501462650001301477650001801490650001601508650001101524650002601535650004401561650001401605650002901619700001701648700002501665700001701690700001701707700001601724700001601740700001601756773011301772856008901885852000901974655001201983IND60093703820221118004754.0141103e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009370382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnappy, C.S.10aStructural complexity in isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipid cores of Sulfolobus and other archaea revealed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 648-655.  aLiquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry of membrane lipid cores from Sulfolobus species reveals isomeric forms of ring-containing isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether components not previously recognised via the use of NMR and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry techniques. Equivalent isomerism was confirmed for the components in other hyperthermophilic genera and in sediments which contain the lipids of mesophilic archaea. The recognition of the isomeric structures in distinct archaeal clades suggests that profiles of tetraether lipids reported previously may have oversimplified the true lipid complexity in archaeal cultures and natural environments. Accordingly, the extent of variation in tetraether structures revealed by the work should direct more informative interpretations of lipid profiles in the future. Moreover, the results emphasise that tandem mass spectrometry provides a unique capability for assigning the structures of intact tetraether lipid cores for co-eluting species during chromatographic separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSulfolobus 3aglycerol 3aisomerization 3aisoprenoids 3alipids 3aliquid chromatography 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asediments 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aBarillà, D.1 ade Blaquiere, J.P.A.1 aMorgan, H.W.1 aNunn, C.E.M.1 aSuleman, M.1 aTan, C.H.W.1 aKeely, B.J.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2012 Sept., v. 165, no. 6 p.648-655dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-30847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001300170245010800183300001600291500001500307520127600322592002801598650001801626650001001644650004301654650002501697650001501722650001201737650001001749650002401759650002001783650001101803650002501814650001401839650002601853650002201879650002001901650001101921650001201932650001501944650000901959650002001968650005801988650004302046650006502089651001502154651001802169653004002187653001802227700001602245700001902261700001902280773010102299856008702400852000902487655001202496IND4471439520221120080725.0141112e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447143952DNAL7 a218803592pmid7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2011.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGosz, E.10aEnzymatic activities in spermatozoa and butyltin concentrations in Baltic turbot (Scophthalmus maximus)  ap. 188-195.  a2019-12-06  aSpermatozoal enzymes of fish (NAD⁺- and NADP-dependent dehydrogenases and creatine kinase (CK)) were previously determined to be sensitive to tributyltin (TBT) in laboratory experiments and were thus indicated for use as biomarkers for TBT exposure. However, the potential ability of spermatozoal enzymes as biomarkers of TBT exposure has never been recapitulated in a field study. For this purpose, the kinetic activities of spermatozoal enzymes of the natural turbot Scophthalmus maximus population from the Gulf of Gdańsk (GDA) and the Pomeranian Bay (POM) in the southern Baltic Sea were measured. Gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to determine the concentrations of TBT and its breakdown products, dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT), in the muscle, liver and testes of the male turbot. Males from GDA had significantly higher enzymatic activities and butyltin (BT) content in tissues than those from POM. A general linear model (GLM) showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and CK activities increased significantly with BT concentration in the testes and liver. We indicate the potential effects of TBT pollution on the spermatozoal enzymes of Baltic turbot.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3aliver 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amalate dehydrogenase 3abiomarkers 3amuscles 3amales 3asperm concentration 3acreatine kinase 3aturbot 3aScophthalmus maximus 3apollution 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amass spectrometry 3aenzyme activity 3atestes 2aAnimals 2aFlatfishes 2aMale 2aOceans and Seas 2aOrganotin Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aSpermatozoaxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 3aBaltic Sea 0aBaltic States 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase 0aPsetta maxima1 aHorbowy, J.1 aRuczyńska, W.1 aZiętara, M.S.0 tMarine environmental research.g2011 Oct., v. 72, no. 4 p.188-195dElsevier Ltdx0141-11367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2011.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012800172300001600300520114100316592002801457653003001485653001501515653001501530653001201545653001601557700002701573700001901600700002101619700002101640773010101661856008201762852000901844655001201853IND60610045120221120211016.0180824e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061004512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clay.2017.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Hassani, Kaoutar10aEffect of morphological properties of layered double hydroxides on adsorption of azo dye Methyl Orange: A comparative study  ap. 124-131.  aThe present research discussed the utilization of layered double hydroxides (LDH) materials with different morphologies as adsorbents for Methyl Orange (MO) removal from aqueous solution. The adsorption properties of LDH with flower-like morphology (f-LDH) have been investigated for azo dye, Methyl Orange (MO), and compared to conventional stone-like coprecipitated LDH phases (c-LDH). Flower-like LDH with high specific surface area of 133m²/g were synthesized by coprecipitation method in dilute alkaline solution. With relatively high specific surface areas, the as-prepared flower-like LDH, when tested as adsorbents in azo dye removal, showed excellent performance and were better than those of conventional coprecipitated LDH. The adsorption isotherms, kinetics and mechanisms for azo dye MO onto as-prepared flower-like LDH were also investigated. The high uptake capability of the as-prepared flower-like adsorbents 500.6mg of MO/g of LDH make them potentially attractive adsorbents in water purification avoiding calcination step. Hence, a low cost material will be acquired with much more benefits namely preserving energy.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLayered double hydroxides 0aMorphology 0aAdsorption 0aAzo dye 0aFlower-like1 aBeakou, Buscotin Horax1 aKalnina, Daina1 aOukani, Elhassan1 aAnouar, Abdellah0 tApplied clay science.g2017 May, v. 140 p.124-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26773x0169-13177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clay.2017.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245023700197300001600434500000900450520195300459592002802412596004202440650001802482650001502500650002102515650002202536650002202558650002302580650001202603650001702615650001102632650001102643650001502654650001602669700002002685700002202705700001902727700001902746700001802765773011702783856007402900852000902974655001202983IND60767689320221121223724.0220220e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076768932DNAL7 a10.1111/nbu.125352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGokani, Nikhil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4961-632710aUK Nutrition Research Partnership ‘Hot Topic’ workshop report: A ‘game changer’ for dietary health – addressing the implications of sport sponsorship by food businesses through an innovative interdisciplinary collaboration  ap. 115-122.  aNews  aOverweight and obesity is a global concern as a significant risk factor for non‐communicable diseases. Increased energy intake due to greater consumption of energy‐dense food or non‐alcoholic beverages high in fat, saturated fat, sugar or salt (‘HFSS food’) is the main explanation for population weight gain. The principal drivers underlying this consumption are the commercial determinants of health in the food chain, particularly the marketing of HFSS food. In the UK, some rules do regulate certain forms of HFSS food marketing (such as television and online advertising to children) and the government is considering strengthening these. However, although sports sponsorship by ‘HFSS food businesses’ (defined as a business preparing, cooking, storing, handling, distributing, supplying or selling food and whose products are primarily HFSS) is increasingly recognised as linked to HFSS food consumption, it has received little attention. This is all the more concerning in light of the recent proliferation of ‘HFSS food businesses’ and HFSS products partnering with sports organisations. Against this background, we hosted a workshop to focus on the relationship between health, nutrition and the sponsorship of sport and related marketing by ‘HFSS food businesses’ and to consider the implications for obesity prevention strategies in the UK and beyond. This innovative workshop capitalised on, and contributed to, ongoing efforts to conceptually unite existing research by bringing together an interdisciplinary team of experts providing unique and complementary perspectives on how to address sports sponsorship as one of the channels through which ‘HFSS food businesses’ contribute to poor nutrition and diet‐related diseases.

Because ignoring context information can be beneficial, this is called a "less-is-more effect." The fact that organisms are so sensitive to the context is thus paradoxical and calls for the inclusion of an ecological perspective. In an experiment with starlings, adding cues that identified the context impaired performance in simultaneous prey choices but improved it in sequential prey encounters, in which subjects could reject opportunities in order to search instead in the background. Because sequential prey encounters are likely to be more frequent in nature, storing and using contextual information appears to be ecologically rational on balance by conditioning acceptance of each opportunity to the relative richness of the background, even if this causes context-dependent suboptimal preferences in (less-frequent) simultaneous choices. In ecologically relevant scenarios, more information seems to be more.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSturnus vulgaris 3ahumans1 aKacelnik, Alex0 tScience.g2011 Nov. 18, v. 334, no. 6058 p.1000-1002dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12096263Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011700177300001400294520117400308592002801482650001201510650002001522650003301542650002301575650001201598650002301610650001801633650001101651650001501662650002501677650002401702650000901726650001201735650001601747651001301763653001801776653002401794653001101818653001501829653002401844700002301868773010901891856008702000852000902087655001202096IND60561060920221120040221.0190318e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056106092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesalegn Yayeh Ayal,10aFarmers' perceptions of climate variability and its adverse impacts on crop and livestock production in Ethiopia  ap. 20-28.  aThis article explores farmers' perceptions of the manifestations of global change as a whole and of climate variability in particular, and its effects on the agricultural production in selected highland areas of Ethiopia. Primary data was collected using group and individual interviews, complemented by observations and a survey. The study shows that more that eighty percent of farmers felt the various manifestations and effects of climate variability. The study reveals that sex, age, income and educational level are determinant factors of farmers' perceptions on the manifestations and effects of climate variability on crop and livestock production. Farmers' perceptions of change in temperature are cognate with meteorological data analysis. However, their perceptions were found to be in disagreement with meteorological rainfall trends. This research concludes by suggesting realistic and achievable recommendations to enhance the adaptive capacity of farmers to climate extremes and the existing and future physical, biological and epidemiological challenges on crop and livestock production, so that shortfalls on farmers adaptive capacity can be addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adry environmental conditions 3aeducational status 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3aglobal change 3aincome 3ainterviews 3alivestock production 3ameteorological data 3arain 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aEthiopia 0aGlobal change 0aClimate variability 0aFarmer 0aPerception 0aAdaptation strategy1 aLeal Filho, Walter0 tJournal of arid environments.g2017 May, v. 140 p.20-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013300166300001600299520158700315592002801902653003901930653000901969653001501978653001401993653001102007653000902018700001802027700001902045700002402064773010502088856008202193852000902275655001202284IND60610045220221120211011.0180824e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061004522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clay.2017.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBejarano, Ana10aParameters influencing adsorption of Paraburkholderia phytofirmans PsJN onto bentonite, silica and talc for microbial inoculants  ap. 138-145.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the mineral carriers bentonite, silica and talc as potential supports for immobilization of the plant growth promoting bacterium Paraburkholderia phytofirmans PsJN, and determine the factors influencing bacterial adsorption to provide stable and efficient microbial inoculants for use in the field. Results reveal that adsorption of PsJN depends on pH, the number of immobilized cells decreasing from pH5.5 to 9. Zeta potential measurements indicated that the surface charge of the carrier had certain, but not major influence on bacteria immobilization. The amount of Mg²⁺ contained in the carrier was a key feature, determining the extent of immobilization of PsJN in buffer (talc>bentonite>silica). Moreover, we evaluated the hydrophobicity and its influence on adsorption of PsJN by measuring the contact angle and the number of adsorbed bacterial cells. Highest number of bacterial cells was found on talc, the most hydrophobic material of the three tested ones (bentonite: 3.8×10⁹CFUg⁻¹; silica: 3.0×10⁹CFUg⁻¹; talc: 1.4×10¹⁰CFUg⁻¹). By contrast, similar immobilization capacity was observed on the three materials, when bacteria culturing and bacteria adsorption were performed in a single step. This might be related to the fact that during culturing biofilm is formed as a result of clonal growth of initially attached bacteria, rather than the recruitment of planktonic cells.Altogether, the important factors for adsorption in buffer (pH5.5) appeared to be mainly the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aParaburkholderia phytofirmans PsJN 0aPGPB 0aAdsorption 0aBentonite 0aSilica 0aTalc1 aSauer, Ursula1 aMitter, Birgit1 aPreininger, Claudia0 tApplied clay science.g2017 June 01, v. 141 p.138-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26773x0169-13177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clay.2017.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015300163300001800316500001100334520189300345592002802238650001702266650002602283650002502309650002302334650001502357650001302372650002002385650001602405650001502421700002202436700002302458700002102481700002602502773011202528856008102640852000902721655001202730IND60465720320221120194410.0170725e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046572032DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-015-0320-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRey, Freddy10aIntegrating ecological engineering and ecological intensification from management practices to ecosystem services into a generic framework: a review  ap. 1335-1345.  aReview  aThere are many management approaches proposed to link practices and ecosystem services. Their common aim is to improve the levels of specific ecosystem services by driving key ecosystem functions. However, an operational common grid of analysis is needed. Among these approaches, scientists have recently put forward ecological engineering and ecological intensification which provide relevant examples for building and testing a common grid. Here, we propose to integrate ecological engineering and ecological intensification into a generic framework from management practices to ecosystem services. The novelty of this framework is to consider management practices as gradients of inputs to ecosystems. Specifically, management actions are defined according to the type and level of inputs, characterized along a gradient from endogenous to exogenous inputs, and from biological to artificial inputs. Our framework highlights the importance of the interactions between management practices and natural capital properties. These interactions determine the ecosystem functions that will sustain target ecosystem services. We then show how ecological engineering and ecological intensification can be distinguished and unified within our framework. To illustrate this, we use four ecological engineering and ecological intensification case studies representing different types and levels of inputs. Our proposed framework should thus help (1) researchers to make improved assessments of the links between practices, ecosystem structure and functions, and ultimately services, and to foster improved meta-, cost-benefit- and life-cycle analyses and evaluations of ecosystem management approaches; (2) project designers by improving the adequacy of their action to the specified target; and (3) managers to establish the specifications of the ecosystem management adapted to their objective.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aecosystem engineering 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3amanagers 3anatural capital 3aresearchers 3ascientists1 aCécillon, Lauric1 aCordonnier, Thomas1 aJaunatre, Renaud1 aLoucougaray, Grégory0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2015 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.1335-1345dSpringer Parisx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0320-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009700167300001400264520103100278592002801309650001801337650001201355650002101367650002601388650002201414650002001436650001801456700001601474700001601490773009401506856008401600852000901684655001201693IND60113050420221118222449.0141111e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011305042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFougère, L.10aEvaluation of a liquid chromatography method for quality control of methylated cyclodextrins  ap. 42-47.  aHalo C18 column (fused core particles) and Chromolith RP18 column (monolith) were evaluated in liquid chromatography in order to analyze methylated-β-cyclodextrins (Me-β-CD) with various degrees of substitution, DS such as the number of methyl groups per cyclodextrin ring. Chromolith RP18 enables a performing analysis of Me-β-CD with low DS but is not suitable for dimethyl-β-cyclodextrins (DM-β-CD). On the other hand, Halo C18 column allows an improved fingerprint of CDs having a DS from 4.9 up to a value major than 14 and avoiding the use of various chromatographic systems. Thus, liquid chromatography performed with this column and an evaporative light scattering detector can be used as a generic system for methylated CD analysis. Moreover, fused core particles of Halo C18 column enables a rapid analysis and liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray-mass spectrometry appears as a powerful tool to determine co-elution and to characterize various isomers of complex methylated-β-cyclodextrin mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyclodextrins 3aisomers 3alight scattering 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aquality control 3arapid methods1 aElfakir, C.1 aLafosse, M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 1277 p.42-47dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245009400185300001800279520134400297592002801641650001201669650002001681650001701701650001901718650000901737650001101746650002501757650001501782650002301797650003101820650001201851650001201863650004301875650001101918650002001929650001501949650001501964650001501979650000901994650000902003650002102012650005202033700002402085700002602109700002202135700001802157773010102175856008102276852000902357655001202366IND50070793320221119160122.0160903e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007079332DNAL7 a238736122pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-013-9732-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Su-Ping10aRelative transgene expression frequencies in homozygous versus hemizygous transgenic mice  ap. 1143-1154.  aWe have used a simple binomial model of stochastic transgene inactivation at the level of the chromosome or transgene, rather than the cellular level, for the analysis of two mouse transgenic lines that show variegated patterns of expression. This predicts the percentages of cells that express one, both or neither alleles of the transgene in homozygotes from the observed percentages of cells, which express the transgene in hemizygotes. It adequately explained the relationship between the numbers of cells expressing the transgene in hemizygous and homozygous mosaic 21OH/LacZ mouse adrenals and mosaic BLG/7 mouse mammary glands. The binomial model also predicted that a small proportion of cells in mosaic mammary glands of BLG/7 homozygotes would express both BLG/7 alleles but published data indicated that all cells expressing the transgene showed monoallelic expression. Although it didn’t fit all of the BLG/7 data as precisely as a more complex model, which used several ad hoc assumptions to explain these results, the simple binomial model was able to explain the relationship in observed transgene expression frequencies between hemizygous and homozygous mosaic tissues for both 21OH/LacZ and BLG/7 mice. It may prove to be a useful general model for analysing other transgenic animals showing mosaic transgene expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3agene expression 3ahomozygosity 3amammary glands 3amice 3amodels 3astochastic processes 3atransgenes 3atransgenic animals 2aAdrenal Cortexxmetabolism 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aChromosomal Position Effectsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aHemizygote 2aHomozygote 2aLac Operon 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aSteroid 21-Hydroxylasexbiosynthesisxgenetics.1 aOpsahl, Margaret L.1 aWhitelaw, C.

It is currently the dominant modernisation pathway. The second, biodiversity-based agriculture, aims to develop ecosystem services provided by biological diversity. It currently exists only as a niche. Here we review challenges of implementing biodiversity-based agriculture: managing, at the local level, a consistent transition within and among farming systems, supply chains and natural resource management. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing conceptual frameworks developed to analyse farming, social-ecological and socio-technical systems. Then we present an integrative framework tailored for structuring analysis of agriculture from the perspective of developing a territorial biodiversity-based agriculture. In addition, we propose a participatory methodology to design this agroecological transition at the local level. This design methodology was developed to support a multi-stakeholder arena in analysing the current situation, identifying future exogenous changes and designing (1) targeted territorial biodiversity-based agriculture, (2) the pathway of the transition and (3) the required adaptive governance structures and management strategies. We conclude by analysing key challenges of designing such a complex transition, developing multi-actor and multi-domain approaches based on a combination of scientific and experiential knowledge and on building suitable boundary objects (computer-based and conceptual models, indicators, etc.) to assess innovative systems designed by stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental impact 3afarming systems 3agovernance 3amodels 3amodernization 3anatural resource management 3astakeholders 3asupply chain1 aTherond, Olivier1 aFares, M’hand0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2015 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.1237-1257dSpringer Parisx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0318-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014300159300001600302500002000318520067500338592002801013596010401041650003001145650003001175650001001205650001101215650002101226650001501247650001801262650002201280650002101302650001301323651001701336700002001353700005801373700002101431700002301452700002101475700002401496700002201520700002601542773012601568856007401694852000901768655001201777IND60767689720221122004126.0220220e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076768972DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.129012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Keith J.10aFirst detection of human pathogenic variant of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in field‐collected Haemaphysalis longicornis, Pennsylvania, USA  ap. 143-148.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, an invasive species associated with human pathogens, has spread rapidly across the eastern USA.

We identified a novel dual‐specificity kinase gene that is differentially expressed between long and short day‐treated L. migratoria. To determine its function on photoperiodic diapause induction, we cloned the specific gene. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that this dual‐specificity kinase is of the mycetozoa protein kinase‐like (MPKL) type and may have been transferred horizontally from Mycetozoa to L. migratoria. RNA interference results confirm that MPKL promotes photoperiodic diapause induction of L. migratoria. Furthermore, MPKL significantly inhibits Akt and FOXO (i.e. forkhead box protein O) phosphorylation levels in ovaries, and also enhances reactive oxygen species, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, whereas peroxidase activity is decreased under both photoperiodic regimes. The findings of the present study offer insight into the molecular mechanism responsible for dual‐specificity kinase‐induced diapause in insects.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐34‐07BcChina Agriculture Research System  a61661136004cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. ST/N006712/1cSTFC Newton Agritech Programme of UK 3aLocusta migratoria 3aRNA interference 3acatalase 3adiapause 3adual-specificity kinase 3agenes 3aoverwintering 3aperoxidase 3aphosphorylation 3aphylogeny 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aUllah, Hidayat1 aJarwar, Aftab Raza1 aNong, Xiangqun1 aTu, Xiongbing1 aZhang, Zehua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0648-89540 tFEBS letters.g2019 Nov., v. 593, no. 21 p.3064-3074dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.135443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245011800198300001600316500001900332500002000351520086900371592002801240596004501268650002801313650002001341650002301361650002101384650001201405650001401417650001801431650002501449650001301474700005901487700005801546773012601604856007301730852000901803655001201812IND60719210320221122201053.0201129e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071921032DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.127742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzdil, Kamuran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0852-785410aLow socioeconomic level and enterobius vermicularis: A interventional study to children and their mothers in home  ap. 882-891.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo determine the effects of care and monitoring provided at home to children in whom Enterobius vermicularis is detected and their mothers on the presence of observing the parasite and the knowledge and practices of the children and their mothers on the issue.

The shallow surficial groundwater and surface water in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) were characterized. The chemical composition of sulfate and chloride in groundwater increased with depth. The average concentration of chloride averaged 182Â mgâLâ1 at 6Â m deep and increased gradually to 1,010Â mgâLâ1 at 15Â m deep, 1,550Â mgâLâ1 at 30Â m deep to reach 7,800Â mgâLâ1 at 60Â m deep. Comparatively, the surface water chemical composition in the surrounding areas showed much lower cationic and anionic charge. The specific conductivity and total dissolved solids of surface water in canals (close to the mining operations) are <900Â Î¼Sâcmâ1 and <600Â mgâLâ1, respectively, which should be compared to groundwater quality in wells from the EAA area (>2,000Â Î¼Sâcmâ1 and >1,000Â mgâLâ1, respectively). A steady-state groundwater fluid flow and transient solute transport modeling exercise was conducted to estimate surface/groundwater interactions. The modeled solute in surface water was transported downgradient through groundwaters, migrated approximately 30Â m from the source area (after 5Â years of operation), and needed more than 116Â years to dissipate. An upward transport was also identified whereby chloride and sulfate, naturally present in deeper groundwaters, migrated approximately 200Â m (after 1Â year of mining) into the pristine shallower aquifer and reached the surface water with a concentration equaling 80% of that in the rock mining pit.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3aconstructed wetlands 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrologic models 3alimestone 3amining 3asulfates 3asurface water 3atotal dissolved solids 3atransient flow 3awater quality 3awater table 3awells1 aRivero, Rosanna1 aDavis, Stephen E., IIIcIII1 aVan Lent, Thomas0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2011 May, v. 217, no. 1-4 p.95-104dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0570-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245010100195300001800296506007600314520159000390592002801980506003702008650002702045650001702072650001402089650002402103650002302127650002202150650001602172650001302188650001102201650001902212650001702231650003202248650000902280650001502289650001802304650001902322650000902341700001902350700002902369700002002398700002002418700002102438773010302459856007502562852000902637655001202646IND60531016720221207055306.0160723e20121113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053101672DNAL7 a10.1021/bi301062y2doi7 aPMC35672512pmcid7 a230507012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Rong10aMethylthioadenosine Deaminase in an Alternative Quorum Sensing Pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ap. 9094-9103.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPseudomonas aeruginosa possesses an unusual pathway for 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) metabolism involving deamination to 5′-methylthioinosine (MTI) followed by N-ribosyl phosphorolysis to hypoxanthine and 5-methylthio-α-d-ribose 1-phosphate. The specific MTI phosphorylase of P. aeruginosa has been reported [Guan, R., Ho, M. C., Almo, S. C., and Schramm, V. L. (2011) Biochemistry 50, 1247–1254], and here we characterize MTA deaminase from P. aeruginosa (PaMTADA). Genomic analysis indicated the PA3170 locus to be a candidate for MTA deaminase (MTADA). Protein encoded by PA3170 was expressed and shown to deaminate MTA with 40-fold greater catalytic efficiency for MTA than for adenosine. The kcₐₜ/Kₘ value of 1.6 × 10⁷ M–¹ s–¹ for MTA is the highest catalytic efficiency known for an MTA deaminase. 5′-Methylthiocoformycin (MTCF) is a 4.8 pM transition state analogue for PaMTADA but causes no significant inhibition of human adenosine deaminase or MTA phosphorylase. MTCF is permeable to P. aeruginosa and exhibits an IC₅₀ of 3 nM on cellular PaMTADA activity. PaMTADA is the only activity in P. aeruginosa extracts to act on MTA. MTA and 5-methylthio-α-d-ribose are involved in quorum sensing pathways; thus, PaMTADA is a potential target for quorum sensing. The crystal structure of PaMTADA in complex with MTCF shows the transition state mimic 8(R)-hydroxyl group in contact with a catalytic site Zn²⁺, the 5′-methylthio group in a hydrophobic pocket, and the transition state mimic of the diazepine ring in contact with a catalytic site Glu.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aactive sites 3aadenosine 3aadenosine deaminase 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3adeamination 3agenomics 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3ahypoxanthine 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aloci 3ametabolism 3aphosphorylase 3aquorum sensing 3azinc1 aHo, Meng-Chiao1 aFröhlich, Richard F.

It is identified that the first-order adsorption rate constants (k ₁ = 0.06∼0.51 h⁻¹) were proportional to the high aromaticity and/or low polarity of biochars and the strong hydrophobicity of the COCs. The saturated adsorption capacity for the COCs was followed by the order of RH500 > CS500 > CS700 > CS300. RH500 showed the highest adsorption capacity for the COCs due to its high surface area (SA) and total pore volume (TPV). However, CS500 with low SA and TPV development highlighted the important roles of the aromaticity and/or low polarity on the COCs adsorption. In addition, 1,2,4-TCB showed the highest saturated adsorption capacity on all biochars, followed by TCE, 1,2-DCB, and MCB. The results further revealed the positive effects of the physical properties (α, N M, ε ₁, and ε ₂), the hydrophobicity and electrostatic forces (i.e., π-π interaction and electron donor-acceptor interaction) between the adsorbates and the aromatic moieties of biochar surfaces on the adsorption of COCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDCB (herbicide) 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3achemical structure 3acorn stover 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophobicity 3akinetics 3amodels 3arice 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atrichloroethylene1 aQian, Linbo1 aYan, Jingchun1 aChen, Mengfang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Feb., v. 24, no. 6 p.5554-5565dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8303-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016500168300001800333520157100351592002801922650001401950650000901964650001301973650001601986650002602002650001002028650001602038651001002054700002102064700002002085700002202105700001902127773011602146856008102262852000902343655001202352IND60440615320221118065050.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044061532DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4337-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwatsuki, Teruki10aHydrochemical disturbances measured in groundwater during the construction and operation of a large-scale underground facility in deep crystalline rock in Japan  ap. 3041-3057.  aChanges in the hydrochemical conditions of groundwater were evaluated following the construction of a large-scale underground facility at the Mizunami Underground Research Laboratory (MIU), Japan. The facility was constructed to a depth of 500 m in sedimentary and granitic rocks. Drawdown of the groundwater level in the range of several tens to hundreds of meters was observed up to hundreds of meters away from the shafts during the first ten years of facility construction and operation. Subsequent changes in groundwater chemistry occurred due to upconing of high-salinity groundwater from the deepest part of the shaft and the infiltration of low-salinity shallow groundwater. We predict that future deep groundwater chemistry in the vicinity of the MIU facility will resemble that of the present-day shallow groundwater. Multivariate statistical analysis provides fundamental insights into such a site. We found that the extent of hydrochemical variability related to MIU construction and operation was dependent on the distance from the facility shafts and galleries and on hydrogeological compartmentalization resulting from lithological boundaries (such as permeable conglomerates vs. more compact lithological units) and other features (such as faults or clay layers). We conclude that hydrochemical impact assessment of groundwater in low-permeability rock is essential prior to the construction of such a facility. This should include characterization of hydrogeological structures and compartments to propose suitable location of shafts and galleries.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aclay 3adrawdown 3agroundwater 3amultivariate analysis 3arocks 3awater table 3aJapan1 aHagiwara, Hiroki1 aOhmori, Kazuaki1 aMunemoto, Takashi1 aOnoe, Hironori0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Aug., v. 74, no. 4 p.3041-3057dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4337-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245013900155300001600294500001500310520176200325592002802087650002802115650001302143650001602156650002702172650002302199650002602222650002102248650002002269650001802289650002302307650002302330650002202353650001602375650001102391651001802402653002402420653003002444653002502474653003002499653001902529653002202548653001202570700001902582700001902601700002602620700002402646773010402670856007502774852000902849655001202858IND4395657420221119133844.0151127e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439565742DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-06-0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Cody J.10aAssessing the Reflective Characteristics of Palmer Amaranth (Amaranthus Palmeri) and Pitted Morningglory (Ipomoea Lacunosa) Accessions  ap. 293-298.  a2019-12-06  aA hand-held hyperspectral radiometer was used to measure differences in reflectance characteristics of 24 Palmer amaranth and 15 pitted morningglory accessions collected from the central and southern United States. A hyperspectral reflectance reading was collected from two mature leaves at 24 and 27 d after emergence (DAE) for each accession. Two analysis techniques, linear discriminant analysis and best spectral-band combination (BSBC) analysis, were performed using various vegetation indices, spectral bands, and individual wavelengths. Differentiation of individual accessions was difficult. Palmer amaranth accession classification accuracies were < 50%% using both analysis techniques, except one accession collected in South Carolina (63%%), when pooled over data acquisition dates. Pitted morningglory accession classification accuracies were also generally < 50%%. Classification accuracies were higher using BSBC analysis at 24 DAE; however, at 27 DAE only one accession resulted in classification accuracy > 30%%. These results suggest there are only slight reflectance differences within Palmer amaranth and pitted morningglory accessions. These differences may not be predictable based upon accession origin because of the genetic diversity of Palmer amaranth and pitted morningglory. However, differentiation between Palmer amaranth and pitted morningglory was 100%%. Thus, spectral sensors used to differentiate between Palmer amaranth and pitted morningglory do not need to be calibrated for a particular region of the United States, and differentiation between these two species can be made using reflectance characteristics.Nomenclature: Palmer amaranth,Amaranthus palmeri S.

To address this a DEP force equation is proposed that replaces a previous empirical relationship between the macroscopic and microscopic forms of the Clausius–Mossotti factor. This equation relates the DEP response of a protein directly to the dielectric increment δε⁺ and decrement δε⁻ that characterize its β‐dispersion at radio frequencies, and also indirectly to its intrinsic dipole moment by way of providing a measure of the protein's effective volume. A parameter Γₚw, taken as a measure of cross‐correlated dipole interactions between the protein and its water molecules of hydration, is included in this equation. For 9 of the 12 proteins, for which an evaluation can presently be made, Γₚw has a value of ≈4600 ± 120. These conclusions follow an analysis of the failure of macroscopic dielectric mixture (effective medium) theories to predict the dielectric properties of solvated proteins. The implication of a polarizability greatly exceeding the intrinsic value for a protein might reflect the formation of relaxor ferroelectric nanodomains in its hydration shell.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectrophoresis 3aelectrophoresis 3aequations 3aradio 3athermal energy1 aPethig, Ronald1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9797-145X0 tElectrophoresis.g2021 Mar., v. 42, no. 5 p.513-538dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2020002553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245008800161300001600249520079800265592002801063653003001091653002101121653002801142653001101170700001901181700001901200773015601219856007201375852000901447655001201456IND60131658520221119075311.0151127e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013165852DNAL7 a10.1638/03-053.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRotstein, David S.10aLaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in a north american black bear (ursus americanus)  ap. 543-545.  aA 10-yr-old female black bear (Ursus americanus) at the North Carolina Zoological Park presented with a 2-wk history of intermittent coughing and stertor.

This study seeks to characterize some reproductive traits of female C. shufeldtii as they correlate to body size. We recorded measurements of 23 berried specimens collected from an east Texas freshwater marsh, and established a positive correlation between female carapace length and number of eggs, as well as female total length and number of juveniles. Females were larger and had larger clutches than those reported from Louisiana.

The epicuticular and total waxes of both citrus cultivars were mostly composed of aldehydes, alkanes, fatty acids and primary alcohols. The epicuticular wax accounted for 80% of the total wax in the Newhall fruits and was higher than that in the Satsuma fruits. Scanning electron microscopy showed that larger and more wax platelets were deposited on the surface of Newhall fruits than on the Satsuma fruits. Moreover, the expression levels of genes involved in the wax formation were consistent with the biochemical and crystal morphological analyses. These diversities of fruit wax between the two cultivars may contribute to the differences of fruit postharvest storage properties, which can provide important information for the production of synthetic wax for citrus fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus sinensis 3aCitrus unshiu 3aSatsuma 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aalkanes 3achemical composition 3acultivars 3aepicuticular wax 3afatty acids 3afruits 3agene expression 3agenes 3asatsumas 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awaxes 0aWax 0aCitrus fruits 0aGC–MS 0aGene expression1 aHao, Haohao1 aLiu, Runsheng1 aMa, Qiaoli1 aXu, Juan1 aChen, Feng1 aCheng, Yunjiang1 aDeng, Xiuxin0 tFood chemistry.g2014 June 15, v. 153 p.177-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245008700159300001600246520220000262592002802462653001202490653002102502653001402523653001702537653001402554700001802568773015602586856007202742852000902814655001202823IND60131658720221119075356.0151127e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013165872DNAL7 a10.1638/03-117.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCitino, Scott B.10aEfficacy and long-term outcome of gastritis therapy in cheetahs (acinonyx jubatus)  ap. 401-416.  aA prospective clinical trial evaluating efficacy and long-term outcome of treatments for lymphoplasmacytic gastritis in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) was conducted. The study evaluated efficacy of 11 different antibiotic and antiinflammatory treatment protocols in 32 cheetahs (19 male, 13 female) for reducing gastric inflammation and Helicobacter colonization and monitored the course of disease through histologic grading of gastric biopsies. All cheetahs were biopsied up to 1 wk before treatment and then rebiopsied within 1 mo after treatment. Most animals were reassigned to a second treatment regimen within 6 mo. Each animal received from one to three treatments during the study period. After the trial, gastric biopsies were obtained from each cheetah annually until death or transfer from the facility to assess disease progression. The trial and follow-up period spanned 10 yr. At onset of the trial, all 32 cheetahs had some degree of gastritis, and 26 cheetahs (81%%) were colonized with Helicobacter. Inflammatory lesions worsened regardless of treatment or the presence of Helicobacter. No treatment had a significant effect on inflammatory changes except the lansoprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin treatment group, which produced a short-term decrease in inflammation when compared to controls. Prednisone had no effect on gastric inflammation. Overall, 65%% of colonized cheetahs were initially cleared of histologic evidence of Helicobacter by treatment, with short-term eradication occurring in 100%% of the animals treated with omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin or tetracycline/metronidazole/Pepto-Bismol for 28 days. Long-term follow-up of treated animals in this study clearly demonstrated that these treatments had little effect on life-long progression of gastritis or on Helicobacter burden in individual cheetahs, although some treatments provided short-term reduction in gastritis and Helicobacter. These results provide evidence that Helicobacter alone is not the cause of gastritis in cheetahs and do not support the use of antibacterial treatments in cheetahs unless significant clinical signs (e.g., frequent vomiting/regurgitation, weight loss) are apparent.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCheetah 0aAcinonyx jubatus 0agastritis 0aHelicobacter 0atreatment1 aMunson, Linda0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2005 Sept., v. 36, no. 3 p.401-416dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/03-117.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01629naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245009300157300001600250520068600266592002800952650001100980650001400991650001501005650000701020650001101027650002301038650001401061700001901075773013401094856007801228852000901306655001201315IND60792046320221122210237.0220904e20101213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079204632DNAL7 a10.17221/80/2008-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTemiz, H.10aEffect of pekmez addition on the physical, chemical, and sensory properties of ice cream  ap. 538-546.  aThe effecs of pekmez concentrates (0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0%) on the physical, chemical, and sensory properties of ice cream samples were examined.

In present study, protective effect of quercetin (Que) on titanium dioxide nanoparticle (NTiO₂)-induced spermatogenesis defects in mice was investigated. Thirty-two Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice were randomly divided into four groups. Que group received 75 mg/kg of Que for 42 days. NTiO₂ group received 300 mg/kg NTiO₂ for 35 days. NTiO₂ + Que group initially received 75 mg/kg Que for 7 days and was followed by concomitant administration of 300 mg/kg NTiO₂ for 35 days. Control group received only normal saline for 42 days. Sperm parameters, testosterone concentration, histological criteria, and apoptotic index were assessed. Product of lipid peroxidation (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities were also evaluated for oxidative stress in testicular tissue. Administration of NTiO₂ significantly induced histological changes in testicular tissue; increased apoptotic index; and decreased testicular weight, testosterone concentration, and sperm quality (p < 0.01). In the testis, NTiO₂ increased oxidative stress through an increase in lipid peroxidation and a decrease in SOD and CAT activities (p < 0.05). Que pretreatment could significantly attenuate testicular weight; apoptotic index; and histological criteria including vacuolization, detachment, and sloughing of germ cells in seminiferous tubules. Serum and tissue testosterone levels were significantly increased in Que-pretreated mice (p < 0.01). Sperm parameters including sperm number, motility, and percentage of abnormality were also effectively improved by Que pretreatment (p < 0.01). Pretreatment of Que significantly ameliorated oxidative stress and increased the activities of SOD and CAT in testicular tissue. These results indicate that sperm production can be increased by Que pretreatment in NTiO₂-intoxicated mice. The improved sperm quality and reverse testis histology by Que pretreatment may be a consequence of elevation testosterone concentration, reduction in germ cell apoptosis, and suppression of oxidative stress in testicular tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiomedical research 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3ahistology 3alipid peroxidation 3amales 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aquercetin 3aseminiferous tubules 3asperm quality 3aspermatogenesis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atestosterone 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity1 aOrazizadeh, Mahmoud1 aMoradi-Gharibvand, Nahid1 aHemadi, Masoud1 aMansouri, Esrafil0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Feb., v. 24, no. 6 p.5595-5606dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8325-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006300170500001900233520085100252592002801103650001001131650001601141650001801157650001101175650001801186650002101204650001601225650001201241700001601253700001401269700001601283700001301299700001801312700002001330700001501350773011101365856008601476852000901562655001201571IND60700793820221122223251.0200907e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070079382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2020.1047842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiaoxiang10aAntiviral effects of human milk oligosaccharides: A review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVirus infections can threaten human life and health and often cause considerable losses to society. There are multiple ways for viruses to invade host cells. Therefore, it is immensely important to inhibit the contact between virus and host cell receptors. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) can not only benefit the infant brain development and the immune system enhancement, but also prevent cells from virus infections due to their similar structures with viral receptors, such as histo-blood group antigens, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin, and sialic acid receptors. In this review, we outline the current knowledge on the complex structures of HMOs and the characteristics of infection by viruses, as well as discuss the mechanisms by which HMOs protect cells against various virus invasions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3abreast milk 3acell adhesion 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3aoligosaccharides 3asialic acid 3aviruses1 aWu, Desheng1 aWen, Yuxi1 aGao, Luying1 aLiu, Dan1 aZhong, Ruting1 aYang, Chengfeng1 aZhao, Chao0 tInternational dairy journal.g2020 Nov., v. 110 p.104784-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2020.1047843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245013300175300001600308520108300324592002801407650001501435650001001450650001701460650002501477650001001502650002101512650001501533650001501548650002101563650002501584650001601609650001601625653002501641653000801666653001501674653000801689653001501697700002001712700001901732700001901751773012301770856008901893852000901982655001201991IND60543414120221119092257.0190410e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054341412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Chien-wei10aInvestigations of riboflavin photolysis via coloured light in the nitro blue tetrazolium assay for superoxide dismutase activity  ap. 262-267.  aDetermination of the superoxide dismutase activity is an important issue in the fields of biochemistry and the medical sciences. In the riboflavin/nitro blue tetrazolium (B2/NBT) method, the light sources used for generating superoxide anion radicals from light-excited riboflavin are normally fluorescent lamps. However, the conditions of B2/NBT experiments vary. This study investigated the effect of the light source on the light-excitation of riboflavin. The effectiveness of the photolysis was controlled by the wavelength of the light source. The spectra of fluorescent lamps are composed of multiple colour lights, and the emission spectra of fluorescent lamps made by different manufacturers may vary. Blue light was determined to be the most efficient for the photochemical reaction of riboflavin in visible region. The quality of the blue light in fluorescent lamps is critical to the photo-decomposition of riboflavin. A blue light is better than a fluorescent lamp for the photo-decomposition of riboflavin. The performance of the B2/NBT method is thereby optimized.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablue light 3acolor 3afluorescence 3afluorescent lighting 3alamps 3amedical sciences 3aphotolysis 3ariboflavin 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atetrazolium 3awavelengths 0aSuperoxide dismutase 0aLED 0aBlue light 0aNBT 0aRiboflavin1 aChen, Liang Yu,1 aChou, Chan-wei1 aLiang, Ji-yuan0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 July, v. 148 p.262-267dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011000160300001800270520150200288592002801790650002901818650001101847650001401858650002401872650001501896650002401911650001101935650002301946650001101969650001001980650002201990650001502012651001002027651001502037700001502052700001702067700001702084700002002101700001702121773011602138856008102254852000902335655001202344IND60440615820221118064952.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044061582DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4391-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yue10aProvenance discrimination of surface sediments using rare earth elements in the Yalu River estuary, China  ap. 3507-3517.  aRare earth elements (REE) are important tracers with which to explore sediment provenance. This study analyzed the distribution features of REE in surface sediments of the Yalu River estuary and determined their provenance. Estuarine systems of small rivers such as the Yalu River are suitable “target areas” to understand sediment transport and transfer processes. The fractional characteristics of REE distribution plots, La/Yb₍UCC₎, Eu and Ce anomalies, La/Yb − ∑REE dendrograms, and discriminant functions can all be used for provenance discrimination of the surface sediments in the Yalu River estuary. All these indicate that REE can be one of the most important tools for the study of the coupling mechanism between the watershed and coast, either as a provenance tracer or as a signal of environmental change. The results from this study show that the middle and upper reaches of the Yalu River do not directly supply sediments to the estuarine delta. The western branch transported most material before the construction of the Shuifeng Reservoir in 1941, and these sediments have diffused to other sections via re-suspension. The Dayang River directly supplies sediments to the coasts of the northern Yellow Sea, which is transported toward land under the action of tidal currents or storm surges. These findings also reveal that anthropogenic activities have halted Yalu River estuarine delta preservation and dominated regional landform development in the last 100 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3aestuarine sediments 3aprovenance 3arare earth elements 3arivers 3asediment transport 3astorms 3atides 3atracer techniques 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYellow Sea1 aCheng, Yan1 aLiu, Jingwei1 aZhang, Liang1 aZhang, Chunpeng1 aZheng, Cunde0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Aug., v. 74, no. 4 p.3507-3517dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4391-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013000172300001800302500001400320520104800334592002801382596007701410650003701487650000801524650001501532650001301547650001801560650001201578650003801590650001401628650001301642650002601655650001401681653002801695653001201723653001801735653000901753700002201762700002801784700002101812700002201833773013801855856008501993852000902078655001202087IND60692769320221119143525.0200503e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069276932DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2016.11564822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYusakul, Gorawit10aEffect of linker length between variable domains of single chain variable fragment antibody against daidzin on its reactivity  ap. 1306-1312.  aNAL-light  aThe peptide linker between variable domains of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains is one of important factors that influence the characteristics of scFv, including binding activity and specificity against target antigen. The scFvs against daidzin (DZ-scFvs) with different linker lengths were constructed in the format of VH-(GGGGS)ₙ-VL (n = 1, 3, 5, and 7). They were expressed in the hemolymph of silkworm larvae using the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) bacmid DNA system, and their reactivity against daidzin and related compounds were evaluated using an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA), which is applicable for quantitative analysis of daidzin. The results showed that the reactivity of scFvs against daidzin was increased, whereas specificity slightly decreased when their peptide linker was lengthened. These results suggested that the linker length of DZ-scFvs contributes to its reactivity. In addition, the results emphasize that the linker length could control the reactivity of DZ-scFvs.  aPublisher supplied data  cFuji Foundation for Protein Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009475 3aBombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aDNA 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiotechnology 3adaidzin 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahemolymph 3apeptides 3aquantitative analysis 3asilkworms 0aBmNPV bacmid DNA system 0aicELISA 0alinker length 0ascFv1 aSakamoto, Seiichi1 aPongkitwitoon, Benyakan1 aTanaka, Hiroyuki1 aMorimoto, Satoshi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 July 2, v. 80, no. 7 p.1306-1312dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2016.11564823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001700181245010500198300001800303506007600321520148000397592002801877506003701905650001701942650001501959650001301974650000901987650001501996650002102011650001602032650001602048650002602064650003302090650001302123650005502136650004802191650005302239650005102292650002102343653000902364653001402373653002102387653002202408653001502430653002402445700001402469700001502483700001802498700001602516700001802532700001302550700001702563773014102580856007402721852000902795655001202804IND60118924820221207113332.0141127e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011892482DNAL7 a248349202pmid7 aPMC41126262pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chuang10aMutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa  ap. 4149-4157.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRoot hairs are important for nutrient uptake, anchorage, and plant–microbe interactions. From a population of rice (Oryza sativa) mutagenized by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), a short root hair2 (srh2) mutant was identified. In hydroponic culture, srh2 seedlings were significantly reduced in root hair length. Bubble-like extrusions and irregular epidermal cells were observed at the tips of srh2 root hairs when grown under acidic conditions, suggesting the possible reduction of the tensile strength of the cell wall in this mutant. Map-based cloning identified a mutation in the gene encoding xyloglucan (XyG) 6-xylosyltransferase (OsXXT1). OsXXT1 displays more than 70% amino acid sequence identity with the previously characterized Arabidopsis thaliana XYG XYLOSYL TRANSFERASE 1 (AtXXT1) and XYG XYLOSYL TRANSFERASE 2 (AtXXT2), which catalyse the transfer of xylose onto β-1,4-glucan chains. Furthermore, expression of the full-length coding sequence of OsXXT1 could complement the root hair defect, and slow growth and XyG synthesis in the Arabidopsis xxt1 xxt2 double mutant. Transgenic plants expressing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter under the control of the OsXXT1 promoter displayed GUS expression in multiple tissues, most prominently in root epidermal cells. These results demonstrate the importance of OsXXT1 in maintaining cell wall structure and tensile strength in rice, a typical grass species that contains relatively low XyG content in cell walls.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3acell walls 3amutation 3arice 3aroot hairs 3atensile strength 3axyloglucans 2aArabidopsis 2aCell Wallxphysiology 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMutation 2aOryzaxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPentosyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTensile Strength 0aRice 0aroot hair 0atype I cell wall 0atype II cell wall 0axyloglucan 0axylosyltransferase.1 aLi, Shuai1 aNg, Sophia1 aZhang, Baocai1 aZhou, Yihua1 aWhelan, James1 aWu, Ping1 aShou, Huixia0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Aug., v. 65, no. 15 p.4149-4157dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01444naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007400160300001800234520034700252592002800599650002300627650002800650650001900678650002100697650002600718700002200744700002500766700002300791700002200814700002000836700002100856773013400877856007401011852000901085655001201094IND60660259120221121060447.0190823e20140724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066025912DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03903c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Helen L.12aA bioorthogonal ⁶⁸Ga-labelling strategy for rapid in vivo imaging  ap. 9557-9560.  aHerein, we describe a fast and robust method for achieving ⁶⁸Ga-labelling of the EGFR-selective monoclonal antibody (mAb) Cetuximab using the bioorthogonal Inverse-electron-Demand Diels–Alder (IeDDA) reaction.

The SN2-type stereoselective Mitsunobu glycosylation is generally applicable to various unprotected pyranoses as glycosyl donors in combination with a wide range of acidic glycosyl acceptors such as carboxylic acids, phenols, and imides, retaining its high stereoselectivity (33 examples). Glycosylation of a carboxylic acid with unprotected α-d-mannose proceeded also in an SN2 manner to directly afford a usually less accessible 1,2-cis-mannoside.

Halogen chemistry is currently missing in most global and climate models, and is effective at removing O ₃ at altitudes where intercontinental O ₃ transport occurs. It further helps explain the low O ₃ levels in preindustrial times. Public health concerns arise from bioaccumulation of the neurotoxin mercury in fish. Our results emphasize that bromine chemistry in the free troposphere oxidizes mercury at a faster rate, and makes water-soluble mercury available for scavenging by thunderstorms. Naturally occurring bromine in air aloft illustrates global interconnectedness between energy choices affecting mercury emissions in developing nations and mercury deposition in, e.g., Nevada, or the southeastern United States.  aHalogens in the troposphere are increasingly recognized as playing an important role for atmospheric chemistry, and possibly climate. Bromine and iodine react catalytically to destroy ozone (O ₃), oxidize mercury, and modify oxidative capacity that is relevant for the lifetime of greenhouse gases. Most of the tropospheric O ₃ and methane (CH ₄) loss occurs at tropical latitudes. Here we report simultaneous measurements of vertical profiles of bromine oxide (BrO) and iodine oxide (IO) in the tropical and subtropical free troposphere (10°N to 40°S), and show that these halogens are responsible for 34% of the column-integrated loss of tropospheric O ₃. The observed BrO concentrations increase strongly with altitude (∼3.4 pptv at 13.5 km), and are 2–4 times higher than predicted in the tropical free troposphere. BrO resembles model predictions more closely in stratospheric air. The largest model low bias is observed in the lower tropical transition layer (TTL) over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, and may reflect a missing inorganic bromine source supplying an additional 2.5–6.4 pptv total inorganic bromine (Br y), or model overestimated Br y wet scavenging. Our results highlight the importance of heterogeneous chemistry on ice clouds, and imply an additional Br y source from the debromination of sea salt residue in the lower TTL. The observed levels of bromine oxidize mercury up to 3.5 times faster than models predict, possibly increasing mercury deposition to the ocean. The halogen-catalyzed loss of tropospheric O ₃ needs to be considered when estimating past and future ozone radiative effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aaltitude 3abioaccumulation 3abromine 3aclimate models 3adeveloping countries 3aemissions 3aenergy 3afish 3amercury 3aneurotoxins 3aozone 3apublic health 3astorms 3atroposphere 3aNevada 3aSoutheastern United States 0aatmospheric chemistry 0aoxidative capacity 0ahalogens 0aheterogeneous chemistry 0aUTLS1 aSchmidt, Johan A.1 aBaidar, Sunil1 aCoburn, Sean1 aDix, Barbara1 aKoenig, Theodore K.1 aApel, Eric1 aBowdalo, Dene1 aCampos, Teresa L.1 aEloranta, Ed1 aEvans, Mathew J.1 aDiGangi, Joshua P.1 aZondlo, Mark A.1 aGao, Ru-Shan1 aHaggerty, Julie A.1 aHall, Samuel R.1 aHornbrook, Rebecca S.1 aJacob, Daniel1 aMorley, Bruce1 aPierce, Bradley1 aReeves, Mike1 aRomashkin, Pavel1 ater Schure, Arnout1 aVolkamer, Rainer0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 July 28, v. 112, no. 30 p.9281-9286dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15051421123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245010900199300002000308520095600328592002801284650001801312650001901330650001401349650002101363650001401384650002201398650002001420650002201440650001801462650002801480650001901508650001201527650001901539650001701558650002101575700001401596700005501610700005901665700001801724700005601742700001701798700001401815700005601829700001701885700005601902700006201958700002202020700006202042773014902104856007602253852000902329655001202338IND60655142620221122132434.0190731e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065514262DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b055642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9007-551310aSemi-artificial Photosynthetic CO₂ Reduction through Purple Membrane Re-engineering with Semiconductor  ap. 11811-11815.  aThe engineering of biological pathways with man-made materials provides inspiring blueprints for sustainable fuel production. Here, we leverage a top-down cellular engineering strategy to develop a new semi-artificial photosynthetic paradigm for carbon dioxide reduction via enveloping Halobacterium purple membrane-derived vesicles over Pd-deposited hollow porous TiO₂ nanoparticles. In this biohybrid, the membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin, not only retains its native biological function of pumping protons but also acts as a photosensitizer that injects light-excited electrons into the conduction band of TiO₂. As such, the electrons trapped on Pd cocatalysts and the protons accumulated inside the cytomimetic architecture act in concert to reduce CO₂ via proton-coupled multielectron transfer processes. This study provides an alternative toolkit for developing robust semi-artificial photosynthetic systems for solar energy conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalobacterium 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acell engineering 3aelectrons 3aenergy conversion 3afuel production 3amembrane proteins 3ananoparticles 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotons 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 3atitanium dioxide1 aZhang, He1 aGuo, Peijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5732-70611 aZhang, Jingjing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4768-23121 aTira, Gregory1 aKim, Yu-jin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4339-92801 aWu, Yimin A.1 aLiu, Yuzi1 aWen, Jianguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3755-00441 aRajh, Tijana1 aNiklas, Jens1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6462-26801 aPoluektov, Oleg G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3067-92721 aLaible, Philip D.1 aRozhkova, Elena A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8498-82280 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 July 15, v. 141, no. 30 p.11811-11815dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b055643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013100164300001600295520133800311592002801649650002101677650001201698650001401710650001101724650002601735650001601761650001401777650002501791650002601816650002001842650001201862650001301874650001801887650001801905650001301923650001501936650000701951650001801958650001301976650001301989650001302002650001302015650001102028650001702039650001802056653000802074653000802082653000802090653000802098653000802106653000802114653000902122653001202131653000802143653000802151653000802159653000702167653000802174653001002182653003102192653002502223653001902248653001402267653003102281700001402312700005302326773009602379856008502475852000902560655001202569IND60601705520221122043420.0190411e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060170552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.protis.2018.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Rui10aComprehensive Study of Cultivation Conditions and Methods on Lipid Accumulation of a Marine Protist, Thraustochytrium striatum  ap. 451-465.  aThis research studied the influences of cultivation conditions (carbon/nitrogen source concentration, initial pH, salinity, and rotation speed) on cell growth and fatty acid (FA) production/composition of a marine protist, Thraustochytrium striatum. Fed-batch was also studied to improve cell growth and FA production. The optimum cell growth (∼5g/L dry cell mass, DCM) occurred under the cultivation conditions of T=25°C, glucose=30g/L, yeast extract/peptone (YEP)=4g/L, salinity=100% of seawater, pH=6-7, and rotation speed=120rpm. Starch/glycerol and yeast extract were the best carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively for achieving the maximum cell growth. Low carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio benefited cell growth while high C/N ratio was conducive to FA accumulation. The maximum lipid content of 25% (g/g DCM) was obtained at glucose/YEP of 30/1 (w/w). Starch and ammonia chloride were suggested to be used as carbon and nitrogen sources. Compared to batch, fed-batch increased FA content significantly from 27 to 38%, primarily including 35% of C16:0, 42% of C18:1, 9% of C18:2 and 5% of EPA/DHA. The major FAs of T. striatum were palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids along with a small amount of docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids, which suggests lipid from T. striatum be suitable for biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThraustochytrium 3aammonia 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acell growth 3achlorides 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afuel production 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3alinoleic acid 3alipid content 3anitrogen 3aoleic acid 3apH 3apalmitic acid 3apeptones 3aprotists 3asalinity 3aseawater 3astarch 3astearic acid 3ayeast extract 0aASW 0aDCM 0aDHA 0aEPA 0aDPA 0aARA 0aFAME 0aLC-PUFA 0aDDI 0aMSG 0aTFA 0aYE 0aYEP 0aLipid 0apolyunsaturated fatty acid 0aextracellular enzyme 0amarine protist 0afed-batch 0aThraustochytrium striatum.1 aLi, Xiang1 aZheng, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3419-94630 tProtist.g2018 Aug., v. 169, no. 4 p.451-465dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12496x1434-46107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2018.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01328naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014200158300001800300520028800318592002800606650000800634650001500642650002700657650002300684650002300707650002900730650001900759700001800778773013400796856007500930852000901005655001201014IND60659059220221121025027.0190827e20110823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065905922DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13592a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDivsar, Faten10aElectrochemiluminescence detection of near single DNA molecules by using quantum dots–dendrimer nanocomposites for signal amplification  ap. 9879-9881.  aAn ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescent biosensor was developed for detection of near single DNA molecules with a linear range of 7 orders of magnitude by combining the specific recognition of a molecular beacon with signal amplification of quantum dots–dendrimer nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3ananocomposites1 aJu, Huangxian0 tChemical communications.g2011 Aug. 23, v. 47, no. 35 p.9879-9881dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc13592a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03808naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001300181245015900194300001800353506007600371520162200447592002802069506003702097650001802134650001102152650001002163650001602173650001902189650003102208650006102239650004802300650004402348650003802392650002902430650002002459650003202479650003002511650002402541650002602565650002202591653002202613653002002635653002202655653002802677653002602705653002102731700002002752700001402772700001502786700001902801700001602820700001502836700001702851700001802868700001902886700001702905773014102922856007403063852000903137655001203146IND60118924920221207113347.0141127e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011892492DNAL7 a248035052pmid7 aPMC41126272pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru1902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu10aPlastid casein kinase 2 knockout reduces abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity, thermotolerance, and expression of ABA- and heat-stress-responsive nuclear genes  ap. 4159-4175.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlastid casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a major Ser/Thr-specific enzyme for protein phosphorylation in the chloroplast stroma and its kinase activity is regulated by redox signals. To understand the role of CK2 phosphorylation of chloroplast proteins in abiotic stress signalling, an Arabidopsis plastid CK2 (CKA4) knockout mutant was investigated in terms of the plant response to abscisic acid (ABA) and heat stress. CKA4 expression was upregulated by ABA and heat treatment. The cka4 mutant showed reduced sensitivity to ABA during seed germination and seedling growth, and increased stomatal aperture and leaf water loss with a slightly reduced leaf ABA level. The cka4 mutant was more sensitive to heat stress than the wild-type Columbia-0. The expression levels of a number of genes in the ABA regulatory network were reduced in the cka4 mutant. Many heat-upregulated genes (heat-shock factors and heat-shock proteins) were also reduced in the cka4 mutant. The cka4 mutant showed reduced expression levels of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase target genes (atpB and psbA). CKA4 knockout mutation also resulted in a reduction in expression of some critical genes (PTM, ABI4, and PRS1) involved in retrograde signalling from the chloroplast to the nucleus. Similar results were observed in mutant plants with the knockout mutation in both CKA4 and CKA3, which encodes a nuclear CK2 α3 subunit. CKA3 expression was not responsive to ABA and heat stress. These results suggest that CKA4 is an enhancing factor in abiotic stress signalling through modulating the expression of some molecular players in retrograde signalling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabscisic acid 3acasein 3agenes 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 2aAbscisic Acidxphysiology. 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCasein Kinase IIxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aHot Temperature 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aPlant Stomataxphysiology 2aProlinexmetabolism 2aStress, Physiological 2aWaterxphysiology 0aABA insensitivity 0agene expression 0aknockout mutation 0aplastid casein kinase 2 0aretrograde signalling 0athermotolerance.1 aChang, Hongping1 aHu, Shuai1 aLu, Xiutao1 aYuan, Congying1 aZhang, Chen1 aWang, Ping1 aXiao, Wenjun1 aXiao, Langtao1 aXue, Gang-Ping1 aGuo, Xinhong0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Aug., v. 65, no. 15 p.4159-4175dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru1903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245010600209300001500315520150100330592002801831650001701859650001101876650001901887650002301906650002001929650002301949650002601972650001201998650001502010650001902025650001302044650002202057650001802079650001502097650002602112650001602138651001902154651001102173653002702184653002302211653002402234653002502258653003002283653002702313700001902340700001702359700001802376700001902394773012302413856008502536961001202621852000902633655001202642IND60601705620221122002231.0200210e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060170562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2018.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenDor, Todd K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0132-770210aEcosystem services and U.S. stormwater planning: An approach for improving urban stormwater decisions  ap. 92-103.  aGreen stormwater infrastructure (GI) is gaining traction as a viable complement to traditional “gray” infrastructure in cities across the United States. As cities struggle with decisions to replace deteriorating stormwater infrastructure in the face of looming issues such as population growth and climate change, GI may offer a cost-effective, efficient, and sustainable approach. However, decision makers confront challenges when integrating GI within city plans, including uncertainties around GI capacity and maintenance, resistance to collaboration across city governance, increasingly inflexible financing, accounting practices that do not incorporate the multiple values of GI, and difficulties in incorporating ecological infrastructure into stormwater management. This paper presents an ecosystem services framework for assessing the context-specific needs of decision makers, while considering the strengths and limitations of GI use in urban stormwater management. We describe multiple dimensions of the planning system, identify points of intervention, and illustrate two applications of our framework – Durham, North Carolina and Portland, Oregon (USA). In these case studies, we apply our ecosystem services framework to explicitly consider tradeoffs to assist planning professionals who are considering implementation of GI. We conclude by offering a research agenda that explores opportunities for further evaluations of GI design, implementation, and maintenance in cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental science 3afunding 3agovernance 3ainfrastructure 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3aprofessionals 3astormwater 3astormwater management 3auncertainty 3aNorth Carolina 3aOregon 0aEnvironmental planning 0aEcosystem services 0aStormwater planning 0aGreen infrastructure 0aStormwater infrastructure 0aLow impact development1 aShandas, Vivek1 aMiles, Brian1 aBelt, Kenneth1 aOlander, Lydia0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2018 Oct., v. 88 p.92-103dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2018.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245009600200300001800296500002000314520199100334592002802325650002902353650001702382650001002399650002602409650003002435650001102465650001602476650002102492650001202513651001502525651001202540700006002552700002702612700006502639700006102704773012502765856007402890852000902964655001202973IND60791220420221118043616.0220826e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079122042DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.144542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalentowitz, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9720-907810aPlant dispersal characteristics shape the relationship of diversity with area and isolation  ap. 1599-1608.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The relation of plant dispersal syndromes with insular species richness patters remains one of the challenges in island biogeography, especially as people have affected species distribution patterns. This study disentangles how dispersal syndromes influence the relationship of richness with area and isolation while also accounting for the human impact on island biodiversity. It builds on the potential of islands at the mesoscale and of similar origin to contribute to the ongoing discussion in island biogeography on what determines species richness and filtering. LOCATION: Denmark, 54 islands in the North and Baltic Sea. TAXON: Vascular plants, including pteridophytes. METHODS: Generalized linear models (GLMs) and linear regressions are used to analyse how dispersal syndromes influence the relationships of species numbers with island area and isolation, as well as island inhabitation and human density, respectively. RESULTS: Species numbers, seed mass and the proportion of zoochore and anemochore species are positively related to island area while the share of water‐dispersed species decreases with increasing area. Isolation is weakly related to mean seed mass but has no explaining power for species numbers and the presence of specific dispersal syndrome on the target islands. Species richness and seed mass were positively related to human presence. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Human impact for centuries has not overwritten the strong relationship of species richness with area on the Danish Islands but is affecting the shape of this relationship. Island area constitutes a strong filter for different dispersal syndromes and leads to the assumption that heavier and animal‐dispersed seeds are positively related to area due to the presence of more bird and mammal species. Human‐induced loss of isolation caused by ongoing traffic and the connection of landmasses by bridges and ferries may be a reason for the overall low explanatory power of island isolation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiogeography 3abirds 3aferns and fern allies 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3aseed weight 3aspecies richness 3atraffic 3aBaltic Sea 3aDenmark1 aTroiano, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2448-27211 aChristiansen, Julie B.1 aSteinbauer, Manuel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7142-92721 aBarfod, Anders S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6298-18230 tJournal of biogeography.g2022 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.1599-1608dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.144543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03569naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100002700159245011600186300001800302520167200320592002801992650001602020650001702036650001902053650001902072650001202091650002602103650001702129650001902146650004102165650003002206650001202236653002902248653000802277653001502285653001902300653001802319653000902337653000802346653002802354653003102382653000802413653002202421653001902443653003102462653002902493653000902522700002102531700001802552700002802570700001802598700002402616700001902640700002702659700002102686773014102707856007402848852000902922655001202931IND60118925020221119120317.0141127e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011892502DNAL7 a248680382pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru1912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorcar-Castell, Albert10aLinking chlorophyll a fluorescence to photosynthesis for remote sensing applications: mechanisms and challenges  ap. 4065-4095.  aChlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) has been used for decades to study the organization, functioning, and physiology of photosynthesis at the leaf and subcellular levels. ChlF is now measurable from remote sensing platforms. This provides a new optical means to track photosynthesis and gross primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Importantly, the spatiotemporal and methodological context of the new applications is dramatically different compared with most of the available ChlF literature, which raises a number of important considerations. Although we have a good mechanistic understanding of the processes that control the ChlF signal over the short term, the seasonal link between ChlF and photosynthesis remains obscure. Additionally, while the current understanding of in vivo ChlF is based on pulse amplitude-modulated (PAM) measurements, remote sensing applications are based on the measurement of the passive solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which entails important differences and new challenges that remain to be solved. In this review we introduce and revisit the physical, physiological, and methodological factors that control the leaf-level ChlF signal in the context of the new remote sensing applications. Specifically, we present the basis of photosynthetic acclimation and its optical signals, we introduce the physical and physiological basis of ChlF from the molecular to the leaf level and beyond, and we introduce and compare PAM and SIF methodology. Finally, we evaluate and identify the challenges that still remain to be answered in order to consolidate our mechanistic understanding of the remotely sensed SIF signal.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3aphotosynthesis 3aremote sensing 2aBiomass 2aChlorophyllxanalysis 2aFluorescence 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRemote Sensing Technology 2aSeasons 0aGross primary production 0aGPP 0aleaf level 0aphotosystem II 0aphotosystem I 0aPSII 0aPSI 0aphotosynthesis dynamics 0apulse amplitude modulation 0aPAM 0aPSII connectivity 0aremote sensing 0asolar-induced fluorescence 0asun-induced fluorescence 0aSIF.1 aTyystjärvi, Esa1 aAtherton, Jon1 avan der Tol, Christiaan1 aFlexas, Jaume1 aPfündel, Erhard E.1 aMoreno, José,1 aFrankenberg, Christian1 aBerry, Joseph A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Aug., v. 65, no. 15 p.4065-4095dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru1913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01436naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012300156300001800279520034600297592002800643650002400671650002600695650001400721650001200735650001000747650001900757650002000776700001900796700001800815700001900833700001700852773013400869856007401003852000901077655001201086IND60660259320221121074525.0190823e20140722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066025932DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03905j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyejin10aNitrogen-centered radical-mediated C–H imidation of arenes and heteroarenes via visible light induced photocatalysis  ap. 9273-9276.  aThe C–H imidation of arenes and heteroarenes has been achieved via visible light induced photocatalysis.

While distribution modelling methods have been applied mostly to single species, modelling of communities and ecosystems (EDM; ecosystem‐level distribution modelling) produces results that are more directly relevant for management and decision‐making. Although the choice of predictors is a pivotal part of the modelling process, few studies have compared the suitability of different sets of predictors for EDM. In this study, we compare the performance of 50 single environmental variables with that of 11 composite landscape gradients (CLGs) for prediction of ecosystem types. The CLGs represent gradients in landscape element composition derived from multivariate analyses, for example “inner‐outer coast” and “land use intensity.” LOCATION: Norway. METHODS: We used data from field‐based ecosystem‐type mapping of nine ecosystem types, and environmental variables with a resolution of 100 × 100 m. We built nine models for each ecosystem type with variables from different predictor sets. Logistic regression with forward selection of variables was used for EDM. Models were evaluated with independently collected data. RESULTS: Most ecosystem types could be predicted reliably, although model performance differed among ecosystem types. We identified significant differences in predictive power and model parsimony across models built from different predictor sets. Climatic variables alone performed poorly, indicating that the current climate alone is not sufficient to predict the current distribution of ecosystems. Used alone, the CLGs resulted in parsimonious models with relatively high predictive power. Used together with other variables, they consistently improved the models. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of variable selection in EDM. We argue that the use of composite variables as proxies for complex environmental gradients has the potential to improve predictions from EDMs and thus to inform conservation planning as well as improve the precision and credibility of red lists and global change assessments.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Research Council of Norway  cNorwegian Environment Agency  cNorwegian Biodiversity Information Centre 3abiodiversity 3aclimatic factors 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aelemental composition 3aglobal change 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aNorway1 aHorvath, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6017-53851 aVollering, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7409-28981 aErikstad, Lars1 aHalvorsen, Rune1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6859-77261 aBryn, Anders1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4712-82660 tDiversity & distributions.g2020 Aug., v. 26, no. 8 p.928-943dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.130603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245012100180300001800301520084000319592002801159650001301187650002101200650001601221650001001237650001901247650002901266650002001295650001201315650001501327650001701342650000901359650002101368650000701389650000901396653002301405653002801428653002901456653001901485653002001504700003101524700002201555700002201577773010501599856005101704852000901755655001201764IND50087099920221119102304.0140412e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008709992DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2011.5554232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRigobello, Eliane Sloboda10aInfluence of the apparent molecular size of aquatic humic substances on colour removal by coagulation and filtration  ap. 1767-1777.  aThis study aims to verify the influence of the apparent molecular size of aquatic humic substances (AHSs) on the effectiveness of coagulation with aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride.

Metabolic networks are one of the most useful tools to analyze data for this purpose. This study integrates differential expression profiles of multiple Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that have evolved in eight different stress conditions (ethanol, caffeine, coniferyl aldehyde, iron, nickel, phenylethanol, and silver) and enzyme kinetics into a genome‐scale metabolic model of yeast, following a new enhanced method. Flux balance analysis, flux variability analysis, robustness, phenotype phase plane, minimization of metabolic adjustment, survivability, sensitivity analyses, and random sampling are conducted to identify the most common and divergent points within strains. Results were examined both individually and comparatively, and the target reactions, metabolites, and enzymes were identified. Our results showed that the models reconstructed by our methodology were able to simulate experimental conditions where efficient protein allocation was the main goal for survival under stressful conditions, and most of the metabolic changes in the adaptation process mainly arose from the differences in the metabolic reactions of energy maintenance (through coenzyme‐A and FAD utilization), cell division (folate requirement of DNA synthesis), and cell wall formation (through sterol and ergosterol biosynthesis).  aPublisher supplied data  cBogaziçi Üniversitesi 3aDNA replication 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aaldehydes 3abiosynthesis 3acaffeine 3acell division 3acell walls 3acoenzyme A 3adata analysis 3aenergy 3aenzyme kinetics 3aergosterol 3aevolution 3afolic acid 3agene expression regulation 3airon 3ametabolites 3amodels 3anickel 3aphenotype 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3asilver 3ayeasts1 aÇakar, Zeynep Petek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2278-36701 aÜlgen, Kutlu O.0 tYeast.g2022 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.449-465dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39201x0749-503X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.38063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01638naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245014600164300001800310500001900328520054600347592002800893650001600921650001400937650002100951650001400972650001400986700005501000700005601055773012101111856008301232852000901315655001201324IND60699481620221119160712.0200619e20200610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069948162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c015772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Cheng10aPalladium-Catalyzed Site-Selective Benzocylization of Aromatic Acids with o-Fluoro-Substituted Diaryliodonium Salts toward 3,4-Benzocoumarins  ap. 4776-4780.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBy using 2-fluoro-substituted diaryliodonium salts, a novel benzocylization has been accomplished for the synthesis of 3,4-benzocoumarin derivatives via a cascade of ortho-arylation and defluorination in the presence of palladium catalysts.

More stimulating effect on their growth, especially on S. thermophilus, revealed resistant starch. Addition of this polysaccharide improved also the rheological properties of yogurts, which showed higher viscosity than samples produced without it. Addition of honeysuckle berries preparation significantly influenced the yogurts’ color, giving them deep purple color, and their antioxidant potential. During storage, contents of anthocyanin and iridoid compounds were decreasing, but antioxidant activity in the products remained stable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acolor 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3arefrigeration 3aresistant starch 3aviscosity 3ayogurt1 aKucharska, Alicja Z.1 aDąbrowska, Anna 1 aZięba, Tomasz 1 aBobak, Łukasz 1 aChrzanowska, Józefa 0 tFoods.g2021 May 21, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100611593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245012600200300001600326500002000342520211800362592002802480650002002508650002002528650002802548650003002576650001302606650001102619650001502630650001202645651003302657700003102690700002202721700002202743700003002765700002102795773012702816856007302943852000903016655001203025IND60701117420221118074040.0200707e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070111742DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.130682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Orin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8935-124210aIntegrating citizen science data with expert surveys increases accuracy and spatial extent of species distribution models  ap. 976-986.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Information on species’ habitat associations and distributions, across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, is a fundamental source of ecological knowledge. However, collecting information at relevant scales is often cost prohibitive, although it is essential for framing the broader context of more focused research and conservation efforts. Citizen science has been signalled as an increasingly important source to fill in data gaps where information is needed to make comprehensive and robust inferences on species distributions. However, there are perceived trade‐offs of combining highly structured, scientific survey data with largely un‐structured, citizen science data. METHODS: We explore these trade‐offs by applying a simplified approach of filtering citizen science data to resemble structured survey data and analyse both sources of data under a common framework. To accomplish this, we integrated high‐resolution survey data on shorebirds in the northern Central Valley of California with observations in eBird for the entire region that were filtered to improve their quality. RESULTS: The integration of survey data with the filtered citizen science data resulted in improved inference and increased the extent and accuracy of distribution models on shorebirds for the Central Valley. The structured surveys improved the overall accuracy of ecological inference over models using citizen science data only by increasing the representation of data collected from high‐quality habitats for shorebirds. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The practical approach we have shown for data integration can also be used to improve the efficiency of designing biological surveys in the context of larger, citizen science monitoring efforts, ultimately reducing the financial and time expenditures typically required of monitoring programs and focused research. The simple method we present can be used to integrate other types of data with more localized efforts, ultimately improving our ecological knowledge on the distribution and habitat associations of species of conservation concern worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitizen science 3adata collection 3aenvironmental knowledge 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amonitoring 3asurveys 3aCentral Valley of California1 aRuiz‐Gutierrez, Viviana.1 aReynolds, Mark D.1 aGolet, Gregory H.1 aStrimas‐Mackey, Matthew1 aFinḳ, Daniyel,0 tDiversity & distributions.g2020 Aug., v. 26, no. 8 p.976-986dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.130683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012100169300001600290520172800306592002802034650001602062650002002078650002402098650001102122650002102133650001102154650001602165650001602181650002202197650001302219650002102232650002202253650001702275650002502292650001902317650001902336650001202355650001202367650001802379650002702397650001602424650001202440650001802452650002002470650001002490650005102500650001002551650001302561650002302574653002102597653001302618653002002631653001202651653002502663700002502688700002302713700002402736773010402760856008602864852000902950655001202959IND60600259220221119070249.0180703e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060025922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2013.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qirui10aMolecular identification and expression analysis of a diapause hormone receptor in the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea  ap. 250-257.  aDiapause hormone (DH) is an insect neuropeptide that is highly effective in terminating the overwintering pupal diapause in members of the Helicoverpa/Heliothis complex of agricultural pests, thus DH and related compounds have promise as tools for pest management. To augment our development of effective DH analogs and antagonists that could be used as diapause disruptors this study focuses on the cloning and identification of the DH receptor (DHR) in the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea. The full-length dhr cDNA contains 2153 nucleotides encoding 511 amino acids. Our results suggest there are at least two splicing variants of Hezea-DHR. Hydrophobicity analysis and sequence alignment indicate that Hezea-DHR has 7 transmembrane regions and a highly conserved C-terminal region that is also present in related receptors. Hezea-DHR has 95%, 82% and 79% identity to a partial DHR sequence from Heliothis virescens, a full-length DHR in Orgyia thyellina, and DHR-1 in Bombyx mori, but only 45–49% identity to pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide receptor (PBANR). Expression of dhr mRNA remained low in whole body extracts throughout diapause and in young nondiapausing pupae, but was distinctly elevated as development ensued in pharate adults 7 days after pupation. The highest expression of dhr mRNA we noted was in the ovary. A DHR fusion protein with enhanced-green fluorescent protein was successfully expressed heterologously in X. laevis oocytes, as verified by fluorescent imaging and Western blots, but an electrophysiological assay failed to detect receptor–ligand binding activity, which suggests that an essential cofactor and/or accessory protein is required for functional activity of the DHR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aHeliothis virescens 3aOrgyia 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aamino acids 3aantagonists 3acomplementary DNA 3adiapause 3adiapause hormone 3aelectrophysiology 3afluorescence 3afluorescent proteins 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3ainsects 3aligands 3amessenger RNA 3aneuropeptide receptors 3anucleotides 3aoocytes 3aoverwintering 3apest management 3apests 3apheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide 3apupae 3apupation 3asequence alignment 0aDiapause hormone 0aReceptor 0aXenopus oocytes 0aAnalogs 0aDiapause termination1 aPiermarini, Peter M.1 aNachman, Ronald J.1 aDenlinger, David L.0 tPeptides.g2014 Mar., v. 53 p.250-257dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2013.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245004100160300002000201520033600221592002800557650001400585650002300599650002500622650001100647700001800658700001600676700002000692700001700712700001500729700001600744700001300760700001900773700001800792700002200810700001700832700002100849773013600870856007401006852000901080655001201089IND60660259620221120033045.0190823e20140826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066025962DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03911d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIonescu, Robert10aOxygen etching of thick MoS₂ films  ap. 11226-11229.  aOxygen annealing of thick MoS₂ films results in randomly oriented and controllable triangular etched shapes, forming pits with uniform etching angles.

Due to environmental destruction and overfishing, the population of this species is under threat. In order to protect this endangered species, it is important to have the genome sequenced. Reference genomes are essential for studying population genetics, domestic farming, and genetic resource protection. However, currently, no reference genome is available for Trachidermus fasciatus, and this has greatly hindered the research on this species. In this study, we integrated nanopore long-read sequencing, Illumina short-read sequencing, and Hi-C methods to thoroughly assemble the Trachidermus fasciatus genome. Our results provided a chromosome-level high-quality genome assembly with a predicted genome size of 542.6 Mbp (2n = 40) and a scaffold N50 of 24.9 Mbp. The BUSCO value for genome assembly completeness was higher than 96%, and the single-base accuracy was 99.997%. Based on EVM-StringTie genome annotation, a total of 19,147 protein-coding genes were identified, including 35,093 mRNA transcripts. In addition, a novel gene-finding strategy named RNR was introduced, and in total, 51 (82) novel genes (transcripts) were identified. Lastly, we present here the first reference genome for Trachidermus fasciatus; this sequence is expected to greatly facilitate future research on this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrachidermus fasciatus 3aendangered species 3afish 3agenome assembly 3ananopores 3apopulation genetics 3aEast Asia1 aZhang, Xu 1 aLv, Feng 1 aSang, Mengmeng 1 aHu, Hairong 1 aWang, Jinqiu 1 aLiu, Dong 0 tGenes.g2021 May 06, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120506923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03605naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015100174300002000325520172500345592002802070650002502098650001102123650001602134650001702150650001402167650002702181650001602208650001402224650001702238650001702255650001602272650004202288650002802330650001902358650001902377650003602396650001802432650001002450650001002460650002002470650001702490650002102507650003102528650001402559650001302573650003202586700003702618700002702655700002302682700002802705700003502733773015502768856008302923852000903006655001203015IND60777738120221120123231.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077773812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-18899-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalaf, Hanaa Mohamed10aRole of Platelet-activating factor and HO-1 in mediating the protective effect of rupatadine against 5-fluorouracil-induced hepatotoxicity in rats  ap. 40190-40203.  a5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug, but its hepatotoxicity challenges its clinical use. Thus, searching for a hepatoprotective agent is highly required to prevent the accompanied hepatic hazards. The current study aimed to investigate the potential benefit and mechanisms of action of rupatadine (RU), a Platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, in the prevention of 5-FU-related hepatotoxicity in rats. Hepatotoxicity was developed in male albino rats by a single 5-FU (150 mg/kg) intra-peritoneal injection on the 7th day of the experiment. RU (3 mg/kg/day) was orally administrated to the rodents for 10 days. Hepatic toxicity was assessed by measuring both liver and body weights, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST), hepatic oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide levels (NOx), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD)), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Inflammatory markers expressions (inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukins; IL-1B, IL-6), the apoptotic marker (caspase-3), and PAF were measured in the hepatic tissue. 5-FU-induced hepatotoxicity was proved by the biochemical along with histopathological assessments. RU ameliorated 5-FU-induced liver damage as proved by the improved serum ALT, AST, and hepatic oxidative stress parameters, the attenuated expression of hepatic pro-inflammatory cytokines and PAF, and the up-regulation of HO-1. Therefore, it can be concluded that RU pretreatment exerted a hepatoprotective effect against 5-FU-induced liver damage through both its powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbino 3aantagonists 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3adrug therapy 3afluorouracil 3aglutathione 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahistopathology 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3aplatelet-activating factor 3apollution 3aresearch 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aHafez, Sara Mohamed Naguib Abdel1 aAbdalla, Ahlam Mohamed1 aWelson, Nermeen N.1 aAbdelzaher, Walaa Yehia1 aAbdelbaky, Fatma Alzhraa Fouad0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 26 p.40190-40203dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18899-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151242018900169245015100358300001600509520111800525536015501643592002801798596008601826650001901912650003301931650002601964650002701990650002602017650001402043650002702057650002302084650001702107650002902124651002102153653001302174653002902187653001702216653003802233653001302271700001702284700001802301773011902319856008602438852000902524655001202533IND60679287120221121135907.0200509e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067928712DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2019.16805792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Nho-Eul10aAnálisis de residuos múltiples de 203 pesticidas detectados en fresas empleando cromatografía líquida de espectrometría de masas en tándem en combinación con el método QuEChERS10aMulti-residue analysis of 203 pesticides in strawberries by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in combination with the QuEChERS method  ap. 976-987.  aHerein, a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) procedure together with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was applied to the multi-residue analysis of 203 pesticides in strawberries. To reduce the amount of co-eluents, we compared several dispersive solid-phase extraction cleanup procedures and found that cleanup using octadecylsilane provided the best recoveries. Spiked-sample recoveries of 70–120% with relative standard deviations of <20% were obtained for all tested pesticides except for quinmerac. Matrix-matched calibration curves exhibited good linearities (R² > 0.99), and the limits of quantification (LOQs) were lower than the maximum residue limits recommended by the European Commission and Korea Food and Drug Administration. The developed method was applied to real samples, revealing that their pesticide contents exceeded the corresponding LOQs. The obtained results demonstrate that octadecylsilane-based dispersive solid-phase extraction is a rapid and high-throughput cleanup procedure for the multi-residue analysis of pesticides in strawberries.  aThis research was supported by the Main Research Program (E0187200-02) of the Korea Food Research Institute funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT.  aPublisher supplied data  aE0187200-02cKorea Food Research Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003712 3aEuropean Union 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aliquid chromatography 3amaximum residue limits 3amultiresidue analysis 3aquinmerac 3asolid phase extraction 3astandard deviation 3astrawberries 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aKorean Peninsula 0aQuEChERS 0apesticide multi-residues 0astrawberries 0adispersive solid-phase extraction 0aLC-MS/MS1 aYoo, Miyoung1 aNam, Tae-gyu,0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 17, no. 1 p.976-987dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2019.16805793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012600159520184200285592002802127650003102155650001302186650001302199650001502212700001902227700001402246700001802260773013002278856007502408852000902483655001202492IND60794328320221119122510.0220922e20220911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079432832DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141845352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yifeng 10aAnalysis of the Long-Term Characteristics of BDS On-Orbit Satellite Atomic Clock: Since BDS-3 Was Officially Commissioned  aSatellite atomic clocks are the key elements for position, navigation, and timing services of the Global navigation satellite system (GNSS); it is necessary to research the characteristics of BDS-3 on-orbit satellite atomic clocks for their further optimization. In this study, clock offset data with a duration of 620 days since BDS-3 was officially commissioned were applied to long-term characteristic analysis. To begin with, the precision clock offset data of Deutsches geoforschungs zentrum (GFZ) processed by a MAD-based method were used as reliable test data. Herein, the working principle and main characteristics of satellite atomic clocks are analyzed and discussed, and thus, a comprehensive long-term characteristic analysis scheme is designed. On this basis, the performance indicators—mainly including physical parameters, periodic characteristics, frequency drift rate, frequency accuracy, frequency stability—were calculated and analyzed respectively, revealing the long-term characteristics of the BDS in orbit satellite atomic clocks during the test period. The results of experimental data testify that the performance of BDS-3 satellite atomic clocks is significantly superior to that of BDS-2, especially in terms of drift rate and frequency stability, and the performance of passive hydrogen maser (PHM) is generally superior to that of rubidium atomic frequency standards (RAFS). Within about half a year since BDS-3 was officially commissioned, the frequency stability of BDS-3 satellite atomic clock gradually improved and then reached the order of 10⁻¹⁵, reflecting the effectiveness of system maintenance and inter-satellite link. Furthermore, some novel conclusions are drawn, such as the long-term period term of the fitting residual and drift rate, which may be caused by the earth’s revolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahydrogen 3arubidium 3asatellites1 aXu, Jiangning 1 aWu, Miao 1 aLi, Fangneng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 11, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141845353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245011700165520152500282592002801807650003301835650001101868650003501879650001001914650001701924650001001941650000901951700003401960700002401994700002802018700002002046700002002066700002702086700002202113773011802135856007702253852000902330655001202339IND60742526820221117020147.0210624e20210531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074252682DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100612512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBielecka, Joanna 10aIdentifying the Food Sources of Selected Minerals for the Adult European Population among Rice and Rice Products  aThe problem of dietary deficiency of several essential elements among different stages of life is still observed. The consumption of whole grains (among others unprocessed rice) is recommended as a part of a healthy diet. This research aimed to determine the content of selected macro- and microelements in rice and rice products to verify whether the tested products could be regarded as a source of selected minerals in the diet of the adult European population. Methods: A total of 99 samples from 12 groups of rice products (basmati, black, brown, parboiled, red, wild, white rice and expanded rice, rice flakes, flour, pasta, and waffles) were obtained. The atomic absorption spectrometry method (AAS) was used to determine the content of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Se and Zn in the study material. Results: The average measured contents of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Se and Zn were as follows: 226.3 ± 160.6 mg/kg, 3.6 ± 2.8 mg/kg, 9.4 ± 7.0 mg/kg, 618.0 ± 498.4 mg/kg, 16.7 ± 10.0 mg/kg, 242.9 ± 140.4 µg/kg and 19.5 ± 15.0 mg/kg, respectively. Statistical analyses confirmed the differences in the levels of the studied elements between the subgroups of processed and unprocessed products. Considering the tolerable upper intake level of studied elements, the tested products could be regarded as safe to consume. Conclusion: All tested products can be recommended as a source of Cu, Mn, and Se, while a majority of studied products can be considered a source of Mg and Zn in the diet of the adult European population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTolerable Upper Intake Level 3aadults 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aflour 3ahealthy diet 3apasta 3arice1 aMarkiewicz-Żukowska, Renata 1 aNowakowski, Patryk 1 aPuścion-Jakubik, Anna 1 aGrabia, Monika 1 aMielech, Anita 1 aSoroczyńska, Jolanta 1 aSocha, Katarzyna 0 tFoods.g2021 May 31, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100612513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006600149245018900215300001600404520155000420592002801970650001001998650001402008650002102022650001902043650001102062650001202073650001502085650000902100650003102109650001902140650002102159650001402180653003302194653002502227653001102252653001602263653001002279653000702289653000902296653000702305653001202312653000702324653000902331653000902340653000802349653000802357653000802365653000702373653001002380653000702390700003502397700002602432773013002458856008402588852000902672655001202681IND60601706220221122054301.0200614e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060170622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2018.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez-Sabatel, Saioa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9864-994810aImpact of oil and inulin content on the stability and rheological properties of mayonnaise-like emulsions processed by rotor-stator homogenisation or high pressure homogenisation (HPH)  ap. 195-203.  aReduced-fat mayonnaise-like emulsions with varying oil (1.5, 20 and 52 wt%) and inulin (0, 6 and 12 wt%) contents were produced by rotor-stator (RS) homogenisation or additional high pressure homogenisation at 103 MPa (HPH). Emulsions were stored (180 days) and assessed by visual observation and by backscattering, rheological, colour and particle size distribution determinations. Results showed that long-term stable reduced-fat emulsions can be achieved by inulin addition. RS homogenisation is only able to produce stable emulsions (non-creaming and/or non-sedimenting) for the highest tested oil (52 wt%) or inulin (12 wt%) concentrations. When emulsions stability allowed the comparison among RS and HPH samples (non-creamed or sedimented samples), the latest showed increased viscosities and solid-like behaviours. These patterns are similar to the ones showed by commercial and traditional full-fat mayonnaises. The combination of oil and inulin concentrations with HPH can be used to develop stable reduced-fat mayonnaise with a range of rheological properties.High pressure homogenisation (HPH) is an emerging technology with potential application for pasteurisation/sterilisation of liquid products. The results obtained in this study demonstrate this technology could also be suitable for the development of stable reduced-fat emulsions with a range of textures and including functional ingredients such as inulin. HPH also allows a significant reduction in the added inulin which could decrease the costs of production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aemulsions 3afunctional foods 3ahomogenization 3ainulin 3aliquids 3amayonnaise 3aoils 3aparticle size distribution 3apasteurization 3aproduction costs 3aviscosity 0aHigh pressure homogenisation 0aReduced-fat emulsion 0aInulin 0aOil content 0aANOVA 0aBS 0aCmin 0aCp 0ad (0.5) 0aDP 0aG′ 0aG″ 0aHPH 0aLDL 0aPSD 0aRS 0atanδ 0aη1 aMartínez de Marañón, Iñigo1 aArboleya, Juan-Carlos0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2018 Aug., v. 48 p.195-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2018.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009900164520127000263592002801533650002401561650001801585650001401603650001201617650001001629650002301639650001301662650001501675700002001690700002201710700002001732773011801752856007701870852000901947655001201956IND60742526920221117015948.0210624e20210531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074252692DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100612522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aĆorković, Ina 10aHydrogels: Characteristics and Application as Delivery Systems of Phenolic and Aroma Compounds  aComplex challenges are facing the food industry as it develops novel and innovative products for the consumer marketplace. Food processing and preservation are primarily based on achievement and maintenance of safety in order to protect consumers, as well as extending product shelf life under the relevant conditions of storage, transport and distribution. Maximizing retention of bioactives with recognized positive effects on health typically comes under consideration when the previous two priorities have been achieved. This review introduces the potential applications of hydrogels as delivery systems of high-value bioactives like phenolics and aromas. If they are successfully encapsulated within the gel structures, their release can be controlled, which opens a wide range of applications, not only in food, but also in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Hydrogels are three-dimensional network structures which can absorb significant amounts of water. They have the ability to thicken the system and therefore can be used to design products with desired properties. In order to preserve the valuable components, it is necessary to know their physicochemical properties, in addition to the properties of the polymer used for hydrogel preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3afood industry 3ahydrogels 3amarkets 3aodors 3aphenolic compounds 3apolymers 3ashelf life1 aPichler, Anita 1 aSimunovic, Josip,1 aKopjar, Mirela 0 tFoods.g2021 May 31, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100612523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013400172300001400306520147200320592002801792650003201820650001601852650000901868650002301877650001301900650001001913650001101923650001401934650001101948650001201959650001001971650001001981650001401991650002102005650000902026650001502035650001002050653001602060653001102076653002402087653002102111653001502132653000902147700001902156700002102175773008702196856008602283852000902369655001202378IND60600259620221119070207.0180703e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060025962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2013.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGobeil, Fernand10aPreclinical pharmacology, metabolic stability, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of the peptidic kinin B1 receptor antagonist R-954  ap. 82-89.  aWe previously showed that R-954 (AcOrn[Oic²,(αMe)Phe⁵,dβNal⁷,Ile⁸]desArg⁹-bradykinin) is a potent, selective and stable peptide antagonist of the inducible GPCR kinin B1 receptor. This compound shows potential applications for the treatment of several diseases, including cancer and neurological disturbances of diabetes. To enable clinical translation, more information regarding its pharmacological, pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicological properties at preclinical stage is warranted. This was the principal objective of the present study. Herein, specificity of R-954 was characterized in binding studies on 133 human molecular targets to reveal minor cross-reactivities against the angiotensin AT2 and the bombesin receptors (110- and 330-fold lower affinity than for B1R, respectively). The pharmacokinetic of R-954 was studied in both normal and streptozotocin-diabetic anaesthetized rats providing half-lives of 1.9–2.7h. R-954 does not appear to be metabolized in the rat circulation and in several rat tissue homogenates, as the kidney, lung and liver. It appears to be excreted as parent drug in the bile (21%) and in urine. A preliminary toxicological profile of R-954 was obtained in rats under various administration routes. R-954 appears to be well tolerated. Overall, these results indicate that R-954 exhibits favorable preclinical pharmacological/PK characteristics and encouraging safety profiles, suitable for early studies in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aantagonists 3abile 3abombesin receptors 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3afruits 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3aneoplasms 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3atoxicology 3aurine 0aB1 receptor 0aKinins 0aPeptidic antagonist 0aPharmacokinetics 0aToxicology 0aRats1 aSirois, Pierre1 aRegoli, Domenico0 tPeptides.g2014 Feb., v. 52 p.82-89dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2013.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014800161300001800309520152100327592002801848650001201876650001401888650002301902650001101925650001701936650002601953650001001979650001801989650001202007650001902019650001702038650001302055653003002068653001102098653001602109653001302125653001602138700001602154700001902170700001702189700002202206700001602228773012302244856008002367852000902447655001202456IND60564330620221122064801.0170318e20170308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056433062DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b012842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoo, Won-Tae10aNanoscale PdO Catalyst Functionalized Co3O4 Hollow Nanocages Using MOF Templates for Selective Detection of Acetone Molecules in Exhaled Breath  ap. 8201-8210.  aThe increase of surface area and the functionalization of catalyst are crucial to development of high-performance semiconductor metal oxide (SMO) based chemiresistive gas sensors. Herein, nanoscale catalyst loaded Co₃O₄ hollow nanocages (HNCs) by using metal–organic framework (MOF) templates have been developed as a new sensing platform. Nanoscale Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were easily loaded on the cavity of Co based zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-67). The porous structure of ZIF-67 can restrict the size of Pd NPs (2–3 nm) and separate Pd NPs from each other. Subsequently, the calcination of Pd loaded ZIF-67 produced the catalytic PdO NPs functionalized Co₃O₄ HNCs (PdO–Co₃O₄ HNCs). The ultrasmall PdO NPs (3–4 nm) are well-distributed in the wall of Co₃O₄ HNCs, the unique structure of which can provide high surface area and high catalytic activity. As a result, the PdO–Co₃O₄ HNCs exhibited improved acetone sensing response (Rgₐₛ/Rₐᵢᵣ = 2.51–5 ppm) compared to PdO–Co₃O₄ powders (Rgₐₛ/Rₐᵢᵣ = 1.98), Co₃O₄ HNCs (Rgₐₛ/Rₐᵢᵣ = 1.96), and Co₃O₄ powders (Rgₐₛ/Rₐᵢᵣ = 1.45). In addition, the PdO–Co₃O₄ HNCs showed high acetone selectivity against other interfering gases. Moreover, the sensor array clearly distinguished simulated exhaled breath of diabetics from healthy people’s breath. These results confirmed the novel synthesis of MOF templated nanoscale catalyst loaded SMO HNCs for high performance gas sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3acoordination polymers 3agases 3ananoparticles 3apowders 3asemiconductors 3asurface area 3azeolites 0ametal−organic framework 0aZIF-67 0agas sensors 0acatalyst 0ametal oxide1 aYu, Sunmoon1 aChoi, Seon-Jin1 aJang, Ji-Soo1 aCheong, Jun Young1 aKim, Il-Doo0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 08, v. 9, no. 9 p.8201-8210dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b012843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01381naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013100156300001800287520030200305592002800607650000800635650002300643650002300666650003000689650001900719650001400738650002100752700001800773700001500791700002000806773013400826856007400960852000901034655001201043IND60660260120221122031445.0190823e20140724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066026012DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03925d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXi, Dongmei10aDetection of cancer cells using triplex DNA molecular beacons based on expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)  ap. 9547-9549.  aA novel strategy was proposed for Ramos cell detection by combining the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) with the cell aptamer recognition and the triplex molecular beacons.

The case study of Chrysomelidae  ap. 3565-3579.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChrysomelidae is a family of phytophagous insects with a highly variable degree of trophic specialization. The aim of this study is to test whether species feeding on different plants (generalists) harbour more complex microbiotas than those feeding on a few or a single plant species (specialists). The microbiota of representative leaf beetle species was characterized with a metabarcoding approach targeting V1–V2 and V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA. Almost all the analysed species harbour at least one reproductive manipulator bacteria (e.g., Wolbachia, Rickettsia). Two putative primary symbionts, previously isolated only from a single species (Bromius obscurus), have been detected in two species of the same subfamily, suggesting a widespread symbiosis in Eumolpinae. Surprisingly, the well‐known aphid symbiont Buchnera is well represented in the microbiota of Orsodacne humeralis. Moreover, in this study, using Hill numbers to dissect the components of the microbiota diversity (abundant and rare bacteria), it has been demonstrated that generalist insect species harbour a more diversified microbiota than specialists. The higher microbiota diversity associated with a wider host‐plant spectrum could be seen as an adaptive trait, conferring new metabolic potential useful to expand the diet breath, or as a result of environmental stochastic acquisition conveyed by diet.  aPublisher supplied data  aUMIL‐RSP2015‐2017cUniversità degli Studi di Milano 3aAphidoidea 3aBromius obscurus 3aDNA barcoding 3aRickettsia 3aWolbachia 3acase studies 3adiet 3aforaging 3ahost plants 3amicroorganisms 3aphytophagous insects 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis1 aMagoga, Giulia1 aGionechetti, Fabrizia1 aDe Biase, Alessio1 aMontagna, Matteo0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2022 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.3565-3579dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.158473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100002000159245008700179300001800266520150400284592002801788650002001816650002601836650000801862650001901870650002201889650003101911650001901942650003101961650001401992650003302006650003902039650002202078650001502100653002602115653003002141653003502171653004002206653002402246700002002270700001802290700002102308700001202329700001602341700001902357700001802376700002002394700002402414773014102438856007402579852000902653655001202662IND60118925820221119120412.0141127e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011892582DNAL7 a248680372pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru2002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSohn, Seong-Han10aCell-autonomous-like silencing of GFP-partitioned transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana  ap. 4271-4283.  aWe previously reported the novel partitioning of regional GFP-silencing on leaves of 35S–GFP transgenic plants, coining the term “partitioned silencing”. We set out to delineate the mechanism of partitioned silencing. Here, we report that the partitioned plants were hemizygous for the transgene, possessing two direct-repeat copies of 35S–GFP. The detection of both siRNA expression (21 and 24 nt) and DNA methylation enrichment specifically at silenced regions indicated that both post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) were involved in the silencing mechanism. Using in vivo agroinfiltration of 35S–GFP/GUS and inoculation of TMV–GFP RNA, we demonstrate that PTGS, not TGS, plays a dominant role in the partitioned silencing, concluding that the underlying mechanism of partitioned silencing is analogous to RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). The initial pattern of partitioned silencing was tightly maintained in a cell-autonomous manner, although partitioned-silenced regions possess a potential for systemic spread. Surprisingly, transcriptome profiling through next-generation sequencing demonstrated that expression levels of most genes involved in the silencing pathway were similar in both GFP-expressing and silenced regions although a diverse set of region-specific transcripts were detected.This suggests that partitioned silencing can be triggered and regulated by genes other than the genes involved in the silencing pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aRNA 3agene silencing 3atransgenic plants 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Silencing 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aPhenotype 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aTobaccoxgenetics 2aTransgenes 0aNicotiana benthamiana 0aGFP-partitioned silencing 0acell-autonomous-like silencing 0apost-transcriptional gene silencing 0asystemic silencing.1 aFrost, Jennifer1 aKim, Yoon-Hee1 aChoi, Seung-Kook1 aLee, Yi1 aSeo, Mi-Suk1 aLim, Sun-Hyung1 aChoi, Yeonhee1 aKim, Kook-Hyung1 aLomonossoff, George0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Aug., v. 65, no. 15 p.4271-4283dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru2003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151242020700165245016000372300001800532520102100550536024201571592002801813596010101841596010201942650002302044650001602067650002502083650002702108650001702135650001202152650001802164650002102182650000702203650001702210650002002227650001302247650001902260650001702279650001402296653003202310653002302342653002002365653001602385653002502401653002602426700001702452700001302469700001602482700001602498700001902514773012102533856008602654852000902740655001202749IND60679287620221119151808.0200509e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067928762DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2019.16956772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jiage10aMejora de la proteína soluble, la producción de polipéptidos y las propiedades funcionales de la harina de soya [soja] desnaturalizada por calor, mediante la fermentación de Monascus purpureus 0409310aEnhancement of soluble protein, polypeptide production and functional properties of heat-denatured soybean meal by fermentation of Monascus purpureus 04093  ap. 1014-1022.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fermentation parameters on heat-denatured soybean meal by Monascus purpureus 04093 on the soluble protein and polypeptide production and to evaluate the antioxidant activity and functional properties of the fermented products. The optimal fermentation parameters were obtained as follows: 11.25% soybean meal loaded in a 80 g/500 mL flask with 0.02 g/L Na₂SO₄ at 28°C and pH 6.5 for 96 h. The soluble protein and polypeptide yield reached 290.9 ± 3.4 mg/g and 106.6 ± 0.9 mg/g, respectively, which was 3.25 and 12.25 times that of the control, respectively. Moreover, the polysaccharide and amino acid contents, the antioxidant activities, the emulsifying properties and foaming capacities were significantly enhanced by Monascus fermentation (P < 0.05). The results indicated the viability of soybean meal in combination with Monascus for producing proteins with desirable characteristics as functional ingredients utilized in the food industry.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the 12th Five-Year Plan [2014BA22B00]; and the Application Technology Research and Development Program of Heilongjiang Province, China [GC13B208].  aPublisher supplied data  a2014BA22B00cNational Key Technology Research and Development Program of the 12th Five-Year Plan  aGC13B208cApplication Technology Research and Development Program of Heilongjiang Province, China 3aMonascus purpureus 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3aemulsifying properties 3afermentation 3afoaming 3afood industry 3afunctional foods 3apH 3apolypeptides 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3asodium sulfate 3asoybean meal 3aviability 0aHeat-denatured soybean meal 0aMonascus purpureus 0asoluble protein 0apolypeptide 0aantioxidant capacity 0afunctional properties1 aZhu, Xiuqing1 aShi, Lin1 aNi, Chunlei1 aHou, Juncai1 aCheng, Jianjun0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 17, no. 1 p.1014-1022dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2019.16956773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01375naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013300156300002000289520036900309592002800678650002100706650002700727650002300754650001600777650002300793650001700816700002000833773013600853856007500989852000901064655001201073IND60659060320221121203448.0190827e20110830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065906032DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13622d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dong-Mi10aHighly enantioselective recognition of a wide range of carboxylic acids based on enantioselectively aggregation-induced emission  ap. 10139-10141.  aA new chiral fluorescence receptor, designed to exploit aggregation-induced emission (AIE), exhibited not only an exceptionally high enantioselectivity but was also applicable to a wide range of chiral carboxylic acids.

Consumers of spirits could enjoy the unique flavor, and producers could gain an opportunity for brand development. In total, eight old apple cultivars (Sarija, Žuja, Samoniklica, Prijedorska zelenika, Bobovec, Masnjača, Lijepocvjetka, and Šarenika) and three pear cultivars (Budaljača, Krakača, and Kalićanka) from Bosnia and Herzegovina were used for the spirits production and for characterizing the flavor of distillates. Golden Delicious was used as a representative of commercial apple cultivar. The aroma profile was conducted through the identification of minor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the sensory perception of spirits. Analysis of the VOCs was performed by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) techniques after enrichment via solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Sensory evaluation was performed by 12 trained panelists. Overall, 35 minor volatile compounds were found in spirits: 13 esters, 7 alcohols, 6 acids, 5 terpenes, and 4 aldehydes. Significant differences were detected in the distribution and quantity of the VOCs, which were fruit cultivar-dependent. Spirits made from Šarenika apple cultivar showed the largest amount of all acids, especially short- and medium-chain fatty acids; however, this richness was not correlated with pleasant sensory attributes. Spirits obtained from Prijedorska zelenika and Masnjača apple cultivars had the best sensory attributes. Budeljača and Krakača pears are promising cultivars as flavoring in spirits production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acultivars 3aflavor 3afruits 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aodors 3apears 3asensation 3asensory evaluation 3asolid phase microextraction 3aterpenoids 3avolatile organic compounds 3aBalkans 3aBosnia-Herzegovina1 aGaši, Fuad 1 aLeitner, Erich 1 aBlesić, Milenko 1 aAkagić, Asima 1 aŽuljević, Sanja Oručević1 aKurtović, Mirsad 1 aRatković, Davorka Đukić1 aMurtić, Mirela Smajić1 aAkšić, Milica Fotirić1 aMeland, Mekjell 0 tFoods.g2021 June 01, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100612583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001700169245008600186300001800272520116100290592002801451650001301479650001801492650001701510650001801527650001001545650002001555650002401575650002901599650005301628650002901681650001801710650003001728650002101758700001401779700002001793773009201813856008601905852000901991655001202000IND4465333120221121043558.0141111e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446533312DNAL7 a234426202pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonecsni, K.10aChitosan–tripolyphosphate submicron particles as the carrier of entrapped rutin  ap. 1775-1779.  aChitosan (CH)–tripolyphosphate (TPP) submicron particles were formed as carriers of entrapped rutin, and the release properties characterized using simulated gastric juices and fluids of the small intestine. Particle size, charge and entrapment efficiencies were investigated as a function of the CH:TPP molar ratio (2.0:1.0–5.0:1.0). Size was found to decrease from ∼814nm for the 2.0:1:0 mass ratio to ∼528nm for the ratios between 2.5:1.0 and 4.0:1.0, and then again to ∼322nm for the 5:0:1.0 mass ratio, whereas all particles carried a positive surface charge, increasing from +21 to +59mV as the ratio increased from 2.0:1.0 to 5.0:1.0. The percent entrapment was found to rise from 3.68% to 57.6% as the ratios increased from 2.0:1:0 to 4.0:1:0, before reaching a plateau. Submicron particles (4.0:1.0 mass ratio only) were found to retain rutin in simulated gastric fluids, whereas in conditions which simulated fluids from the small intestine, only 20% of the entrapped rutin was released and 80% remained absorbed to the CH:TPP carriers. Such particles have applications for the delivery of phenolics in food and natural health products.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3agastric juice 3ahealth foods 3aparticle size 3arutin 3asmall intestine 2aChitosanxchemistry 2aDrug Carriersxchemistry 2aDrug Delivery Systemsxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aNanoparticlesxchemistry 2aParticle Size 2aPolyphosphatesxchemistry 2aRutinxchemistry1 aLow, N.H.1 aNickerson, M.T.0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 134, no. 4 p.1775-1779dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003300144245014900177300001600326520202300342592002802365650001602393650001802409650002202427650001902449650001202468650002602480650001302506650002202519650002102541650001402562650002602576650001202602650001502614650001502629650002102644650001102665650001902676650001702695650001102712650001102723651001902734653002002753653003102773653002702804653001802831653003802849653001602887700002502903773010402928856007803032852000903110655001203119IND60679287820221119200853.0191221e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067928782DNAL7 a10.2478/acpa-2019-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeonipekun, Peter Adegbenga10aPalaeoclimatology and biostratigraphic significance of late Neogene/Quaternary vegetational changes recorded in the offshore western Niger Delta  ap. 373-390.  aAttempts at reconstructing palaeoclimatic changes over time using palynomorphs of three oil wells drilled in the shallow offshore Niger Delta led to cluster analysis-aided recognition of seven pollen zones. These pollen zones are equivalent to ten palaeoclimatic zones with alternating dry and wet conditions. The palynomorphs were classified into phytoecological groups and changes in their relative abundances were employed to interpret the palaeoclimatic conditions of their source areas. Contrasting fluctuations in the proportions of the Spore (Pteridophytes) phytoecological group and those of the Poaceae were the main basis for palaeoclimatic inferences. Trends of the occurrence of other phytoecological groups were used to substantiate our palaeoclimatic inferences. In the latest Miocene (5.8–5.5 Ma), climatic conditions were mainly wet until between 5.5 and 5.0 Ma, when extreme dry conditions prevailed. The early Pliocene part (5.0–>3.4 Ma) was generally wet, while the late Pliocene part (<3.0–2.7 Ma) was extremely dry, with wet conditions re-occurring at the latest Pliocene/earliest Pleistocene boundary at a lower magnitude than those of the early Pliocene. This is inferred from the bloom of open vegetation Acanthaceae undif., Polygala sp. and Asystacia gangetica, along with montane Podocarpus milanjianus from 2.4 Ma through 2.0 Ma and younger. The Acanthaceae bloom recorded the evolution of A. gangetica in the latest Pliocene/earliest Pleistocene at around 2.0 Ma in the Niger Delta. The upper Early Pliocene regional wet event is associated with distinct peaks of riverine forest, freshwater swamp and mangrove pollen. Our results further support earlier findings from other parts of West Africa with respect to palaeoclimatic changes in the late Neogene/earliest Quaternary. Equivalent qualitative palynostratigraphic events were recognized within the pollen zones which are useful for age determination, and the significance of biostratigraphic correlation of the zones is stressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthaceae 3aMiocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3aPoaceae 3aPodocarpus latifolius 3aPolygala 3aage determination 3aclimatic factors 3aevolution 3aferns and fern allies 3aforests 3afreshwater 3aoil fields 3apaleoclimatology 3apollen 3ariparian areas 3ariver deltas 3aspores 3aswamps 3aWestern Africa 0abiostratigraphy 0apalaeovegetational changes 0aphytoecological groups 0apalaeoclimate 0aLate Neogene/earliest Pleistocene 0aNiger Delta1 aSowunmi, M.

The utilization of solar energy for water purification through solar stills is an environmental friendly and sustainable approach. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a valuable and cost-effective tool for the simulation of fluid and thermal phenomena in solar stills as well as for their optimization for maximum productivity. The objective of the current study is to present a comprehensive review of the significance of the CFD tool in analysis, performance estimation, and design improvements of solar still. Various studies in this direction are classified according to the comprehensiveness of the modeling approach employed. The approaches are classified into three categories. The assumptions and governing equations for various approaches are presented. It is highlighted that the relatively simpler CFD modeling of only the humid air zone in the solar still, which relies on the availability of experimental data, the modeling approach has now evolved to an advanced level and can give predictive estimates by using only the ambient atmospheric conditions and solar irradiation as input. Various studies are also classified based on configurations, computational domain, and operational and geometrical parametric range. The key results from various CFD studies are summarized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acost effectiveness 3afluid mechanics 3apollution 3aresearch 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3asolar still 3awater management 3awater purification1 aMittal, Gaurav1 aSharma, Ram K.1 aSingh, Desh Bandhu1 aTiwari, Sumit1 aSinhmar, Harender1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0627-00820 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 26 p.38673-38714dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18952-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005500145245008400200300001800284500002000302520130900322592002801631596010501659596005101764596011401815596002801929596005301957596004802010596006202058596005902120596005902179650002102238650001002259650001502269650001402284650001302298650001702311650001002328650001302338650001802351650001702369650003402386650001802420650002002438650001202458700001602470700001202486700001202498700001502510700001602525700001602541700001702557700005802574700005402632700001702686700001502703700001802718700001302736773013102749856008002880961001302960852000902973655001202982IND60791221920221118043542.0220826e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079122192DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.159192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Wenjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9026-722110aBotrytis cinerea BcSSP2 protein is a late infection phase, cytotoxic effector  ap. 3420-3435.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBotrytis cinerea is a broad‐host‐range necrotrophic phytopathogen responsible for serious diseases in leading crops. To facilitate infection, B. cinerea secretes a large number of effectors that induce plant cell death. In screening secretome data of B. cinerea during infection stage, we identified a phytotoxic protein (BcSSP2) that can also induce immune resistance in plants. BcSSP2 is a small, cysteine‐rich protein without any known domains. Transient expression of BcSSP2 in leaves caused chlorosis that intensifies with time and eventually leads to death. Point mutations in eight of 10 cysteine residues abolished phytotoxicity, but residual toxic activity remained after heating treatment, suggesting contribution of unknown epitopes to protein phytotoxicity. The expression of bcssp2 was low during the first 36 h after inoculation and increased sharply upon transition to late infection stage. Deletion of bcssp2 did not cause statistically significant changes in lesions size on bean and tobacco leaves. Further analyses indicated that the phytotoxicity of BcSSP2 is negatively regulated by the receptor‐like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Collectively, our findings show that BcSSP2 is an effector protein that toxifies the host cells, but is also recognized by the plant immune system.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018‐620‐003‐001cHubei Province Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Center Project  cInstitute of Plant Protection and Soil Science  cHubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Key Laboratory of Integrated Pest Management on Crops in Central China  cMinistry of Agriculture  cP.R.

The weight average molecular weight (Mw) and linear chain length distribution were determined by high‐performance size‐exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and high‐performance anion‐exchange chromatography (HPAEC), respectively. The objective was to understand the role of amylose involvement in the formation of SNP showing different crystalline structures (A‐ and B‐types). The HPSEC profiles of SNP before debranching from waxy, normal, and high‐amylose maize starches showed broad monomodal peaks. Debranched SNP from waxy maize eluted in a single narrow peak, whereas those from nonwaxy starches showed a multimodal distribution. Similar trends were also observed for the chain length distribution patterns, for which the longest detectable chains (degree of polymerization [DP] 31) in waxy maize were significantly lower than those of nonwaxy maize starches (DP 55–59). This indicated the potential amylose involvement in the SNP structure of normal and high‐amylose starches. Further evidence of amylose involvement was ascribed to the resistance of SNP toward amylolysis (Hylon VII > Hylon V > normal > waxy). The amylase‐resistant residues of SNP from high‐amylose maize starches were composed of both low Mw linear and branched chains.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada 3aacid hydrolysis 3aamylases 3aamylose 3aanion exchange chromatography 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3agel chromatography 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asulfuric acid 3awaxy corn1 aVasanthan, Thava1 aHoover, Ratnajothi1 aIzydorczyk, Marta0 tCereal chemistry.g2017 Mar., v. 94, no. 2 p.262-269dCereal ChemistrywJournal:1935x0009-03527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM-02-16-0028-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012300163520146100286592002801747650002401775650001601799650002401815650002601839650001401865650001801879650001701897650003001914650002101944650001001965650001201975650001801987650001802005650002202023700001902045700001802064700002002082773011902102856007702221852000902298655001202307IND60742527720221117020604.0210624e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074252772DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100612592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yongshou 10aAmaranth Supplementation Improves Hepatic Lipid Dysmetabolism and Modulates Gut Microbiota in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet  aDiet-induced obesity is often associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis, lipid metabolism disorders, and chronic inflammation. Consumption of the pseudocereal Amaranthus mangostanus has multiple nutritional benefits. We investigated the effects of dietary amaranth on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in high-fat (HF) diet-fed mice. C57BL/6J mice were provided either a control diet, HF diet, or HF diet containing 10% amaranth powder (Ama) for 8 weeks. Ama supplementation significantly reduced the levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and phospholipids in the liver. Moreover, Ama supplementation downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes including Hmgcr, Fdt1, and Sgle in the liver. The gut microbiota analysis showed that Ama supplementation reversed HF diet-induced reduction in bacterial diversity and richness. Additionally, beta diversity analysis of the inter-group variability in community structure showed a clear separation between the HF and Ama groups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis revealed that 11 taxa were enriched in the Ama group, whereas 9 taxa were increased in the HF group. We found that family Porphyromonadaceae and unclassified S24-7 showed a strong positive and negative correlation with the lipid parameters, respectively. Taken together, these results indicated that dietary Ama may attenuate HF diet-induced deterioration of gut microbiota structure and hepatic lipid metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus tricolor 3acholesterol 3acommunity structure 3adiscriminant analysis 3adysbiosis 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3aobesity 3aphospholipids 3apseudocereals 3aspecies diversity1 aFukui, Rikako 1 aJia, Huijuan 1 aKato, Hisanori 0 tFoods.g2021 June 01, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100612593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01950naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012400169300001600293520102000309592002801329650001601357650001901373650002901392700001701421700001601438700001601454700001901470773009901489856005101588852000901639655001201648IND50088083120221117233409.0140412e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008808312DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2012.7210182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yongmei10aReceived power optimization for the unconstrained case between the emitted and received polarizations of radar antennas  ap. 228-236.  aA new procedure is proposed to find the optimum polarizations for the case of unconstrained relationship between the emitted and received polarizations of radar antennas. Similar to the three-step procedure, the optimum polarizations are found by adjusting the polarizations of radar antennas to result in maximum or minimum received power. But the proposed procedure is different from the three-step procedure, in which the proposed one can be applied to both the coherent and the incoherent scattering cases. The transmitted optimal polarization states are obtained by optimizing the polarimetric power received under the conditions of antenna mismatched/matched receiving for the partially polarized waves. Real polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are used to compare the proposed procedure with the currently available procedures. The results indicate that the proposed procedure is validated to be efficient in calculating the optimal polarization states of the receiving and transmitting antenna.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolarimetry 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aLi, Diangang1 aYuan, Qilun1 aChen, Qiang1 aKuang, Gangyao0 tRemote sensing letters.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 4, no. 3 p.228-236dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2012.721018  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245014300166300001800309520037400327592002800701650002200729650000900751650001800760650001300778650004400791650002700835653002300862653000900885653002400894653001800918700002200936700002100958773015600979856008001135852000901215655001201224IND60522240820221119112613.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052224082DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-11-12172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdou, Hanan E.10aOxidative Addition of Methyl Iodide to Dinuclear Gold(I) Amidinate Complex: Schmidbaur’s Breakthrough Reaction Revisited with Amidinates  ap. 1480-1482.  aOxidative-addition of methyl iodide, CH₃I, to the dinuclear gold amidinate [Au₂(o-Me₂-form)2] in THF generates a metal-metal bonded Au(II) product, formulated as [Au₂(o-Me₂-form)₂CH₃I], in quantitative yield under nitrogen at 0 °C and in absence of light.

We conducted a 3 year study of passive restoration in mixed Dipterocarp forests dominated by Shorea robusta to examine the effectiveness of exclusion (fencing and fire suppression) on diversity, density, and richness of regenerating tree seedlings and saplings. We analyzed excluded and disturbed paired sites. We observed exclusion was effective in increasing seedling richness and occurrence of S. robusta and Syzygium cumini. A significant improvement in sapling strata (diversity, density, and richness) from excluding the disturbances was observed. Mean sapling density estimated was about 500% higher in excluded compared to disturbed sites. Probability of occurrence of S. robusta and Dalbergia latifolia saplings increased due to exclusion. That said, presence of exotic species Chromolaena odorata was higher in excluded sites reflecting the need for assisted natural regeneration in forests. This study has demonstrated passive restoration as an effective approach for improving natural regeneration in mixed Dipterocarp forest ecosystems and possibly other similar forest types, and will serve as a reference document for future restoration interventions.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Wyoming  cWyoming Reclamation and Restoration Center 3aChromolaena odorata 3aDalbergia latifolia 3aShorea robusta 3aSyzygium cumini 3adeveloping countries 3afire suppression 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest types 3aintroduced species 3anatural regeneration 3aprobability 3asaplings 3aseedlings 3aNepal1 aStahl, Peter D.0 tRestoration ecology.g2019 May, v. 27, no. 3 p.581-591dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.129043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008500165300001800250520116300268592002801431650001401459650003501473650001301508650003101521650000801552650002601560650001901586650000901605650001701614651001601631651001201647700002701659700001701686700002101703700002001724700002001744773011601764856008101880852000901961655001201970IND60440611720221118065117.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044061172DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4446-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanov, E.

A special study of these entities to classify them in one group or another was necessary. Recently published data of remote sensing (satellite images) of high resolution allow distinguishing a variety of snow and ice objects (accurate to 0.5 m). In identifying sustainable nival-glacial formations it was necessary to measure the characteristic parameters of these objects and their boundaries using topographic maps, satellite images, and GPS devices. The GIS project and the database of nival-glacial formations for the quantitative analysis of the accumulated information have been created. The glaciers of mountain ridges of East Siberia significantly reduced in thickness for the last decades, and their abrupt degradation is manifested in the last 5–10 years. The main glaciers of the Barguzinskiy ridge decreases with 0.002 km² year⁻¹ that is comparable with the reduction rate of the glaciers of the Eastern Sayan ridge, but is less than of the representative of the Kodar ridge the Azarovoy glacier.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3ageographic information systems 3aglaciers 3aglobal positioning systems 3aice 3aquantitative analysis 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3aspatial data 3aLake Baikal 3aSiberia1 aPli︠u︡snin, V.

J.10aEarly Marine Survival of Coho Salmon in the Strait of Georgia Declines to Very Low Levels  ap. 424-439.  aThe marine survival of juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch from the time they enter the Strait of Georgia in mid-May to the time of our trawl survey in mid-September declined from an average of about 15%% in 1998 to approximately 1%% in 2007. Early marine survival rates for juvenile coho salmon have been consistently low (<5%%) since 2002, and the rate of decline in early marine survival was greater for hatchery fish than for wild fish. This suggests that hatchery coho salmon are perhaps less able to survive than wild fish in the current marine ecosystem. The steady decline in total marine survival for coho salmon over the past four decades coincided with a warming of the Strait of Georgia, where both sea surface and sea bottom temperatures have increased by approximately 1°°C since 1970. Another factor that appears to have contributed to the decline in early marine survival since the late 1990s is an increase in the number of days with an average sustained wind strength greater than 25 km/h. The linkage between wind strength and marine survival requires further study, but wind strength is known to affect the timing and level of primary productivity. The processes that caused the declining marine survival remain to be identified and may include factors associated with disease originating in both freshwater and salt water, metabolic stress, competition, and predation. The data suggest that coho salmon brood year strength is now mostly determined during the first 4 months spent in the Strait of Georgia. If the current low levels of marine survival continue, management initiatives to protect wild coho salmon will be urgently required, and it will be timely to critically evaluate the hatchery programs and policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3afreshwater 3ahatcheries 3aissues and policy 3ajuveniles 3amarine ecosystems 3apredation 3aprimary productivity 3asaline water 3asurveys 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3awild fish 3awind 3aBritish Columbia1 aSweeting, R.

The corresponding brush-type chiral stationary phases (CSPs) were characterized as zwitterionic ion-exchange-type materials and exhibited remarkable enantioselectivity for their zwitterionic target analytes, viz. underivatized amino acids and aminosulfonic acids. We rationally designed structural modifications on the strong cation exchange (SCX) subunit of the zwitterionic SO and investigated the influence on chiral recognition power for amphoteric solutes. SOs with chiral isopropyl- or cyclohexyl-moieties in vicinity to the SCX site showed broadest application range by baseline resolving 39 out of 53 test compounds, including α-, β-, and γ-amino acids with different substitution patterns. Furthermore, we introduced two pseudoenantiomeric zwitterionic CSPs which combined the unique features of providing comparable enantioselectivities but reversed enantiomer elution orders. By application of slightly acidic polar organic mobile phases as preferred elution mode, we found that certain amounts of aprotic acetonitrile in protic methanol substantially increased enantioselectivity and resolution of amino acids in a structure-dependent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinchona 3aacetonitrile 3aacids 3aamino acids 3acation exchange 3achromatography 3aenantiomers 3amethanol 3asilica gel 3asolutes 3azwitterions1 aSić, Siniša1 aLindner, Wolfgang0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Dec. 21, v. 1269 p.287-296dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04880naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245010900203300001400312520268700326592002803013650001903041650001203060650001903072650001203091650001903103650001503122650002103137650001003158650002503168650002503193650001503218650002003233650002003253650001003273650001603283650002903299650002203328650001303350650002103363650001203384650002003396650001303416650001803429650001103447651001203458653001603470653001003486653001903496653002503515653001903540653001003559653002603569653001503595653001803610653001503628653001703643653001403660653001303674653002503687700002703712700001903739700001803758700001503776700005903791700002103850700001703871700001803888773010103906856008204007852000904089655001204098IND60542200520221118075630.0190402e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054220052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2015.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolf, Joost1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8713-091010aCombined analysis of climate, technological and price changes on future arable farming systems in Europe  ap. 56-73.  aIn this study, we compare the relative importance of climate change to technological, management, price and policy changes on European arable farming systems. This required linking four models: the SIMPLACE crop growth modelling framework to calculate future yields under climate change for arable crops; the CAPRI model to estimate impacts on global agricultural markets, specifically product prices; the bio-economic farm model FSSIM to calculate the future changes in cropping patterns and farm net income at the farm and regional level; and the environmental model INTEGRATOR to calculate nitrogen (N) uptake and losses to air and water. First, the four linked models were applied to analyse the effect of climate change only or a most likely baseline (i.e. B1) scenario for 2050 as well as for two alternative scenarios with, respectively, strong (i.e. A1-b1) and weak economic growth (B2) for five regions/countries across Europe (i.e. Denmark, Flevoland, Midi Pyrenées, Zachodniopomorski and Andalucia). These analyses were repeated but assuming in addition to climate change impacts, also the effects of changes in technology and management on crop yields, the effects of changes in prices and policies in 2050, and the effects of all factors together. The outcomes show that the effects of climate change to 2050 result in higher farm net incomes in the Northern and Northern–Central EU regions, in practically unchanged farm net incomes in the Central and Central–Southern EU regions, and in much lower farm net incomes in Southern EU regions compared to those in the base year. Climate change in combination with improved technology and farm management and/or with price changes towards 2050 results in a higher to much higher farm net incomes. Increases in farm net income for the B1 and A1-b1 scenarios are moderately stronger than those for the B2 scenario, due to the smaller increases in product prices and/or yields for the B2 scenario. Farm labour demand slightly to moderately increases towards 2050 as related to changes in cropping patterns. Changes in N2O emissions and N leaching compared to the base year are mainly caused by changes in total N inputs from the applied fertilizers and animal manure, which in turn are influenced by changes in crop yields and cropping patterns, whereas NH3 emissions are mainly determined by assumed improvements in manure application techniques. N emissions and N leaching strongly increase in Denmark and Zachodniopomorski, slightly decrease to moderately increase in Flevoland and Midi-Pyrenées, and strongly decrease in Andalucia, except for NH3 emissions which zero to moderately decrease in Flevoland and Denmark.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aammonia 3aanimal manures 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3acrops 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental models 3afarm labor 3afarm management 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afertilizers 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3aleaching 3amanure spreading 3amarkets 3anet farm income 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aprices 3aDenmark 0aAgriculture 0aCAPRI 0aClimate change 0aEnvironmental impact 0aFarming system 0aFSSIM 0aIntegrated assessment 0aINTEGRATOR 0aModel linkage 0aN emission 0aPrice change 0aScenarios 0aSIMPLACE 0aTechnological change1 aKanellopoulos, Argyris1 aKros, Johannes1 aWebber, Heidi1 aZhao, Gang1 aBritz, Wolfgang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8532-38231 aReinds, Gert Jan1 aEwert, Frank1 ade Vries, Wim0 tAgricultural systems.g2015 Nov., v. 140 p.56-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2015.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245009100214520113100305592002801436650001501464650002301479650001301502650002001515650002601535650002201561650002801583650001501611650002101626650002301647650003001670651001401700651001501714653001301729653001501742653001001757653001601767653003101783700001901814700006301833700005901896700005801955700005902013700001802072700006302090700006702153773011702220856008602337852000902423655001202432IND60700790820221120143526.0200831e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070079082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1127152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkramov, Davlat Kh.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5653-173810aPhytochemical analysis and biological evaluation of Lagochilus species from Uzbekistan  aThe species of the genus Lagochilus (Lamiaceae) are widespread in Central, South-Central, and Eastern Asia.

A new iridoid, glucoside 7- cinnamoyllamalbide, along with known compounds lagochilin, 5-hydroxy-7,4′-dimethoxyflavone, daucosterol, β-sitosterol, 8-acetylharpagide were isolated from L. gypsaceus. The high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was used to determine the chemical fingerprints of 7 different Lagochilus species (L. acutilobus, L. gypsaceus, L. inebrians, L. olgae, L. proskorjakovii, L. setulosus, L. vvedenskyi). Among the tested species, lagochilin content was highest in the endemic species L. inebrians collected from the Djizzakh region of Uzbekistan. In free radical scavenging and reducing power assays, L. inebrans and L. vvedenskyi exhibited the strongest abilities. Regarding cholinesterases, amylase and glucosidase inhibition abilities of the tested samples, 5-hydroxy-7,4′-dimethoxyflavone was the most active compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagochilus 3aactive ingredients 3aamylases 3abeta-sitosterol 3abiological assessment 3aenzyme inhibition 3afree radical scavengers 3aglucosides 3aherbal medicines 3aindigenous species 3athin layer chromatography 3aEast Asia 3aUzbekistan 0aIridoids 0aLagochilin 0aHPTLC 0aAntioxidant 0aEnzyme inhibitory activity1 aBacher, Markus1 aBöhmdorfer, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1400-33951 aRosenau, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6636-92601 aZengin, Gokhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5165-60131 aPotthast, Antje1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1981-22711 aNahar, Lutfun1 aSarker, Satyajit D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4038-05141 aMamadalieva, Nilufar Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1756-36380 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 154 p.112715-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1127153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014800166300001800314520154100332592002801873650002801901650001001929650001301939650002601952650001501978650002601993650001202019650001602031650002002047700001902067700002702086700001902113700002102132700002002153773009802173856008602271852000902357655001202366IND60577525320221118012220.0170809e20160202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057752532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b043172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, Marc10aLoad Rate and Temperature Dependent Mechanical Properties of the Cortical Neuron and Its Pericellular Layer Measured by Atomic Force Microscopy  ap. 1111-1119.  aWhen studying the mechanical properties of cells by an indentation technique, it is important to take into account the nontrivial pericellular interface (or pericellular “brush”) which includes a pericellular coating and corrugation of the pericellular membrane (microvilli and microridges). Here we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study the mechanics of cortical neurons taking into account the presence of the above pericellular brush surrounding cell soma. We perform a systematic study of the mechanical properties of both the brush layer and the underlying neuron soma and demonstrate that the brush layer is likely responsible for the low elastic modulus (<1 kPa) typically reported for cortical neurons. When the contribution of the pericellular brush is excluded, the average elastic modulus of the cortical neuron soma is found to be 3–4 times larger than previously reported values measured under similar physiological conditions. We also demonstrate that the underlying soma behaves as a nonviscous elastic material over the indentation rates studied (1–10 μm/s). As a result, it seems that the brush layer is responsible for the previously reported viscoelastic response measured for the neuronal cell body as a whole, within these indentation rates. Due to of the similarities between the macroscopic brain mechanics and the effective modulus of the pericellular brush, we speculate that the pericellular brush layer might play an important role in defining the macroscopic mechanical properties of the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3abrain 3acoatings 3amechanical properties 3amicrovilli 3amodulus of elasticity 3aneurons 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity1 aDokukin, Maxim1 aKalaparthi, Vivekanand1 aSpedden, Elise1 aSokolov, Igorʹ,1 aStaii, Cristian0 tLangmuir.g2016 Feb. 02, v. 32, no. 4 p.1111-1119dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b043173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03584naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245004700174300001800221520203100239592002802270650001302298650001202311650001102323650001202334650002202346650001302368650001102381650000902392650001302401650001302414650001002427650001402437650001802451650001902469650001102488650000702499650001502506650001602521650001102537650001002548650001302558650001402571650001102585650001102596650001102607650001202618650002702630650001802657650000902675651001602684700002102700700002202721700002102743773011602764856008102880852000902961655001202970IND60440611820221118065222.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044061182DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4201-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkli︠a︡rov, E. V.,10aNatural pollutants of Northern Lake Baikal  ap. 2143-2155.  aHot and cold springs in the northwestern shore of Lake Baikal are investigated as natural pollutants of the lake, which can interfere with its chemistry. The study includes chemical analyses of lake water samples from different depths in the North Baikal basin, as well as waters of hot and cold onshore springs, and Baikal tributaries collected in 2007 through 2013. Thermal waters in the shore of Lake Baikal have much higher SO₄, Cl, F, Na, and SiO₂ concentrations than those in the lake water, as well as ten to hundred times greater enrichments in Li, Rb, Cs, Ga, As and W. Mineral water in cold springs is generally similar to the Baikal water with respect to total dissolved solids (TDS) and major- and trace-element chemistry. However, the Milky cold spring discovered in the lower reaches of the B. Cheremshan River within a few km from the lake stands out in its unusual Ca–Mg–SO₄ composition, low pH (3.57) and high TDS (535 mg/l), and trace-element enrichments in Al, Mn, Ni, Co, Zn, Y, and REE. The concentrations of these elements are still higher, up to one or two orders of magnitude, in suspended solids abundant in the spring water. This water composition is typical rather of mine drainage in sulfide mineralization provinces and prompts the existence of a sulfide orebody in the area. Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, and Cd occur in the dissolved form, and their concentrations in stream water near the B. Cheremshan inlet into Baikal are only slightly lower than immediately downstream of the spring; REE and Y are ten times lower because of precipitation from the river water. However, all metals the spring water leaches from the surrounding rocks eventually end up in Lake Baikal. Although the spring has much greater enrichments relative to the Baikal water in a number of elements, it hardly can cause any significant change to the lake composition. Only local chemical anomalies of Mn, Al, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd, REE and Y can be expected in the bottom sediments where the lake uptakes the B. Cheremshan stream.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3abasins 3acadmium 3achemical analysis 3achlorine 3acobalt 3acold 3adrainage 3afluorine 3alakes 3amanganese 3amineral water 3amineralization 3anickel 3apH 3apollutants 3ariver water 3arivers 3arocks 3asampling 3asediments 3asilica 3asodium 3asolids 3astreams 3atotal dissolved solids 3awater quality 3azinc 3aLake Baikal1 aSklyarova, O.

The country intends to submit agricultural emissions reductions as part of this target, with livestock production identified as offering significant abatement potential. Focusing on the Cerrado core (central Brazilian savannah), this paper investigates the cost-effectiveness of this potential, which involves some consideration of both the private and social costs and benefits (e.g. including avoided deforestation) arising from specific mitigation measures that may form part of Brazil's definition of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Measures (NAMAs). The analysis used an optimisation model to define abatement costs. A baseline projection suggests that beef production in the region will emit 2.6Gt CO2e (CO2 equivalent) from 2010 to 2030, corresponding to 9% of national emissions (including energy, transport, waste, livestock and agriculture). By implementing negative-cost measures identified in a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) by 2030, the 2.6Gt CO2e could be reduced by around 24%. Pasture restoration, involving avoided deforestation, offers the largest contribution to these results. As the Brazilian Cerrado is seen as a model for transforming other global savannahs, the results offer a significant contribution by identifying alternatives for increasing productivity while minimizing national and global external costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3acarbon dioxide 3acerrado 3acost effectiveness 3adeforestation 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3alivestock production 3amarginal abatement cost curve 3ameat production 3amodels 3apastures 3asavannas 3awastes 3aBrazil 0aClimate change 0aMarginal abatement cost curves 0aMitigation measures 0aSustainable intensification 0aGrassland restoration 0aLinear programming1 aBarioni, Luis G.1 aAlbertini, Tiago Zanett1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4031-89161 aEory, Vera1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7134-32331 aTopp, Cairistiona F.E.1 aFernandes, Fernando A.1 aMoran, Dominic0 tAgricultural systems.g2015 Nov., v. 140 p.48-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2015.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245011000165300001400275520125700289592002801546650001501574650001601589650001601605650002301621650001601644650002601660650002101686650001801707650002001725650001701745650001301762650002501775650002001800651001101820700002501831700002501856700002001881773012901901856007802030852000902108655001202117IND60792043320221120135206.0220904e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079204332DNAL7 a10.17221/673/2016-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBranka, Kresović10aYield and chemical composition of soybean seed under different irrigation regimes in the Vojvodina region  ap. 34-39.  aThe goal of the present research is to determine an effective sprinkler irrigation strategy for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in temperate climate conditions, in order to maximize yields and seed quality. A three-year field experiment with four different irrigation treatments was conducted on Calcic Chernozem in the Vojvodina region of Serbia. The irrigation regimes included: no irrigation; full irrigation (I<sub>100</sub>); and two deficit irrigation treatments – 65% of I<sub>100</sub> (I<sub>65</sub>) and 40% of I<sub>100</sub>. The irrigation treatments generally had a statistically significant effect on the increase of soybean yield and protein content. Irrigation did not have a significant effect on the oil content. In general, irrigation increased K, P, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn and B concentrations and decreased Ca and Fe concentrations in soybean seed. The results show that irrigation with the largest amount of water (treatment I<sub>100</sub>) provided no potential benefit in terms of soybean yield and chemical composition. Treatment I<sub>65</sub>, which exhibited the most favourable watering conditions, is the best choice to maximize yield and ensure a good chemical composition of soybean under these agroecological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3aGlycine max 3aagroecology 3adeficit irrigation 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3airrigation rates 3alipid content 3aprotein content 3aseed quality 3asoybeans 3asprinkler irrigation 3atemperate zones 3aSerbia1 aBosko Andrija, Gajic1 aAngelina, Tapanarova1 aGoran, Dugalić0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 63, no. 1 p.34-39dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/673/2016-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245015600163300001400319520167900333592002802012650002002040650000802060650001802068650001302086650001502099650001402114650001902128650002402147650001402171650001102185650002502196651001402221651001802235653001702253653001602270653001202286653001202298653001102310653002302321653001302344653001802357700002102375773014502396856007702541852000902618655001202627IND60738212520221120161852.0210521e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073821252DNAL7 a10.3897/asp.79.e625542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikes, Derek S.10aPhylogeny and evolution of large body size in the rove beetle genus Phlaeopterus Motschulsky, 1853 (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Omaliinae: Anthophagini)  ap. 75-98.  aThe omaliine rove beetle genus Phlaeopterus Motschulsky, 1853 contains 22 species.

Two species have not been collected since 1979 and 1984, one of which, Phlaeopterus bakerensis Mullen and Campbell, 2018, is a contender for the largest-bodied species among the over 1,600 species of the subfamily Omaliinae. Here, we present the first phylogeny of the genus, using Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses based on DNA sequences from the mitochondrial gene COI and morphological data. We tested previous taxonomic hypotheses and most were rejected by all three analyses. Phlaeopterus castaneus Casey, 1893 is non-monophyletic based on COI sequences and may have hybridized with P. loganensis Hatch, 1957. We found support for the monophyly of the genus Phlaeopterus. Our analyses suggest the common ancestor of the genus had small-bodied adults (maximum body size under 5 mm) with ocelli. Within this small-bodied radiation of species, ocelli were lost once and there were two separate evolutionary transitions to large-bodied adults. Although all the large-bodied species are snowfield-associated and only 25% of the small-bodied species are, we did not find statistical support for a relationship between large body size and use of snowfield habitats. These findings represent the first modern phylogenetic reconstruction of species-level relationships within the rove beetle subfamily Omaliinae using both morphological and molecular data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA 3aStaphylinidae 3aancestry 3aarthropods 3abody size 3aclimate change 3amitochondrial genes 3amonophyly 3aocelli 3astatistical analysis 3aEast Asia 3aNorth America 0aPhlaeopterus 0arove beetle 0aVellica 0aLesteva 0aUnamis 0amaximum likelihood 0aBayesian 0aDNA barcoding1 aMullen, Logan J.0 tArthropod systematics & phylogeny.g2021 May 13, v. 79 p.75-98dSenckenberg Gesellschaft für NaturforschungwJournal:27525x1864-83127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/asp.79.e625543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013300163300001600296500001900312520124000331592002801571650002601599650001601625650002101641650001301662650002501675650002801700650001001728650000901738650001701747653002001764653001901784653001701803653001001820700001201830700001101842700001701853700001401870700005301884773013501937856008102072852000902153655001202162IND60711349420221122091034.0200922e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071134942DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596200005442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Y.

The four treatments were no nitrogen (N) (CK); 100% chemical fertilizer N (urea; T1); 70% chemical fertilizer N + 30% organic manure N (T2) and 50% chemical fertilizer N + 50% organic manure N (T3), with the same amount of applied nitrogen (120 kg/ha). The results showed the maximum grain yield (3049 kg/ha), crop nitrogen uptake (216 kg/ha), NUE (65.4%) and accumulated nitrate nitrogen (NO₃⁻-N in 0–200 cm, 142 kg/ha) were observed in the T1 among all treatments in the first year. However, the largest grain yield (5074 kg/ha), crop nitrogen uptake (244 kg/ha) and NUE (82.5%) were under T2 treatment in the second year. Furthermore, T2 had the maximum NO₃⁻-N content in 0–100 cm layer (116 kg/ha), especially 0–40 cm layer, and the lowest NO₃⁻-N content in 100–200 cm (58.8 kg/ha). However, 50% organic manure N in T3 increased apparent nitrogen loss by 39.0% compared to that in T2. Therefore, 30% organic manure N application was more conducive for enhancing wheat yield and NUE and promoting environmental safety after 1-year fertilization time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural sciences 3agrain yield 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aswine 3aurea 3awinter wheat 0anitrogen uptake 0aorganic manure 0asubstitution 0ayield1 aLei, T.1 aDu, W.1 aLiang, C.

Through ordination altitude, clay, potassium content of the substrate and, to a lesser extent, habitats were identified as underlying environmental factors determining the composition of these plant communities. The edaphic parameters showed some correlation with subsurface geology, but microclimatic conditions, water availability and level of disturbance appeared to override the effect of nutrient composition provided by different substrate. Communities of conservation importance, such as plant communities composed of Karoo shrubs, are prevalent on the mountain plateau, presenting an isolated outpost of Nama Karoo vegetation. The transitional status between desert and savanna, remnant patches of Nama Karoo and the high habitat diversity mark the importance of this high altitude area for biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclay 3aecotones 3ahabitats 3amicroclimate 3amountains 3anutrient content 3aplant communities 3apotassium 3asavannas 3ashrubs 3aNamibia0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2001 Feb., v. 12, no. 1 p.53-60dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2001.tb02616.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01686naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245011300160300001600273520064600289592002800935653002800963653002800991653002901019653002101048653001201069653001201081700002301093700002001116773015501136856007201291852000901363655001201372IND60131655220221119082714.0151127e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013165522DNAL7 a10.1638/03-030.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlasier, Megan W.10aRetrospective evaluation of measles antibody titers in vaccinated captive gorillas (gorilla gorilla gorilla)  ap. 198-203.  aRetrospective analyses of banked serum samples and medical records from captive western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Lincoln Park Zoo showed that vaccination of gorillas with a human vaccine induced antibody production.

While the probe itself exhibited fluorescence emission in the yellow region (λem=544nm and 567nm), binding with Zn2+ induced strong emission in the orange region (λem=600nm) which was mainly due to a combination of CHEF and ICT mechanism. The probe was found to be highly sensitive toward the detection of zinc and the limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 9×10−7M. The possibility of using this probe for real-time analysis was strongly supported by the striking stability of fluorescence signal for more than five days with similar fluorescence intensity as observed during instant signaling. The present probe works within physiological pH range and is devoid of any interference caused by the same group elements such as Cd2+/Hg2+. The probe possesses excellent excitation/emission wavelength profile and can penetrate cell membrane to image low concentration of zing inside living system. The in situ formed zinc-probe ensemble was further explored as ratiometric sensing platform for detecting another bio-relevant analyte phosphate anion through a zinc-displacement approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3apH 3aphosphates 3awavelengths 3azinc1 aGaur, Pankaj1 aMukherjee, Trinetra1 aMukhopadhyay, Subhrakanti1 aGhosh, Subrata0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 July, v. 148 p.181-187dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245012000165300001200285520073100297592002801028650002901056650002401085650001501109650001501124650001201139650002301151650001701174650002201191650001201213650001401225650001901239650001201258650001801270650002001288650001501308650001101323700002301334700001901357700002401376700002601400700002001426773012901446856004601575852000901621655001201630IND4423104520221118013532.0120727e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442310452DNAL7 a10.1065/espr2006.06.3162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanichelli, Dario10aProduction of Ethanol by an Integrated Valorization of Olive Oil Byproducts.

Olive-oil milling wastewater is considered as one of the most polluting agro-industrial residues, but fortunately due to its high content of organic matter, it has the potential to be a valuable starting material to obtain bio-ethanol via fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The fermentation of olive-oil milling wastewater has been demonstrated with good yield of ethanol (8-12%v/v) once the level of reducing sugars is appropriate and the phenolic fraction, which inhibits the yeast, is removed.Materials and Methods:-Results:-Discussion:-Conclusions:-Recommendations and Perspectives:-  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aagricultural wastes 3abioethanol 3abyproducts 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aindustrial wastes 3amilling 3aolive oil 3aorganic matter 3aphenols 3araw materials 3areducing sugars 3awastewater 3ayeasts1 aCarloni, Francesco1 aHasanaj, Ermal1 aD’Andrea, Nausica1 aFilippini, Alexander,1 aSetti, Leonardo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2007 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.5-6dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1065/espr2006.06.316  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008900171300001800260500001900278520099300297592002801290596011601318650001601434650002501450650001801475650003301493650001301526650001101539650002101550650001501571650002601586650001301612650002001625650002101645650002601666653004401692653004501736653001501781700002001796700002101816700001601837700001501853700002401868773013801892856008502030852000902115655001202124IND60692765620221119145628.0200503e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069276562DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2016.11460722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaruyama, Ryuto10aSearching for novel ATF4 target genes in human hepatoma cells by microarray analysis  ap. 1149-1154.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aActivating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a transcription factor with an important biological activity. ATF4 is induced by various stresses, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α. ATF4 is also involved in lipid metabolism. In the present study, we performed a microarray experiment to identify new ATF4 target genes, particularly those involved in lipid metabolism, and identified C12orf39, CSTA, and CALCB as novel ATF4 target genes. An amino acid response element (AARE) as an ATF4-binding site is present in the promoter regions of these genes. In a detailed analysis using luciferase assay, we showed that ATF4 activated C12orf39 promoter activity and that this activation was diminished by deletion or mutation of the AARE sequence in the promoter region. Our results suggest that C12orf39, CSTA, and CALCB are novel ATF4 target genes and that C12orf39 promoter activity is activated by ATF4 through AARE.  aPublisher supplied data  a15H05781a25126703a25504003cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691 3aamino acids 3abioactive properties 3abiotechnology 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3alipid metabolism 3aluciferase 3amicroarray technology 3amutation 3aphosphorylation 3apromoter regions 3atranscription factors 0aactivating transcription factor 4(ATF4) 0aendoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) 0amicroarray1 aShimizu, Makoto1 aIshijima, Tomoko1 aNakai, Yuji1 aInoue, Jun1 aSatō, Ryūichirō,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 June 2, v. 80, no. 6 p.1149-1154dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2016.11460723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100005500193245016400248506007600412506003100488520107400519592002801593596008301621506003701704650001201741650001201753650001601765650001401781650001501795650000901810650001901819650001201838650001801850650001101868650001601879650001501895653002801910653002101938653001701959653002501976700002402001700006202025773011702087856008602204852000902290655001202299IND60700791120221207063441.0200831e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070079112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1127302chorus7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1127302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Bon-Jae1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1805-790810aOptimized screw profile design proved to inhibit re-agglomeration that occurs during extrusion of fine-milled forest residuals for producing fermentable sugars  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe re-agglomeration phenomenon occurring during the extrusion process for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass under high temperature reduces the fermentable sugar yields. Prevention of the re-agglomeration at high-temperature extrusion is critical to enhancing the sugar yield. Lignocellulosic biomass was ground through a multi-step milling process and used as the raw material. The extrusion process was performed with different feedstock moisture contents of 50, 55, and 60 % (w.b.) and at barrel temperatures of 50, 100, 150, and 200 °C to create an environment that leads to re-agglomeration of the material after extrusion. A specific screw configuration was used to minimize the re-agglomeration and by modifying the heating and cooling zones. Water evaporation that induces the re-agglomeration during the extrusion process was inhibited with the new screw design without remarkable changes in the particle sizes. The particle sizes of D10, D50, and D90 were determined as 4.51–5.34 μm, 26.80–29.47 μm, and 102.33–110.67 μm, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomass 3acooling 3aevaporation 3aextrusion 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3alignocellulose 3amilling 3aparticle size 3asugars 3atemperature 3awaste wood 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aRe-agglomeration 0aPretreatment 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis1 aWolcott, Michael P.1 aGanjyal, Girish M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2093-62120 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 154 p.112730-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1127303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013900166300001800305520187100323592002802194650001502222650001402237650001702251650001702268650001902285650002202304650001902326650001302345650001302358650002002371650001302391650002002404700001802424700001102442700002102453700001802474700001802492773009802510856008602608852000902694655001202703IND60577525620221118012156.0170809e20160202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057752562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b044192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenfold, J.10aTuning Polyelectrolyte–Surfactant Interactions: Modification of Poly(ethylenimine) with Propylene Oxide and Blocks of Ethylene Oxide  ap. 1073-1081.  aSignificantly enhanced adsorption at the air–water interface arises in polyelectrolyte/ionic surfactant mixtures, such as poly(ethylenimine)/sodium dodecyl sulfate (PEI/SDS), down to relatively low surfactant concentrations due to a strong surface interaction between the polyelectrolyte and surfactant. In the region of charge neutralization this can result in precipitation or coacervation and give rise to undesirable properties in many applications. Ethoxylation of the PEI can avoid precipitation, but can also considerably weaken the interaction. Localization of the ethoxylation can overcome these shortcomings. Further manipulation of the polyelectrolyte–surfactant interaction can be achieved by selective ethoxylation and propoxylation of the PEI amine groups. Neutron reflectivity and surface tension data are presented here which show how the polyelectrolyte–surfactant interaction can be manipulated by tuning the PEI structure. Using deuterium labeled surfactant and polymer the neutron reflectivity measurements provide details of the surface composition and structure of the adsorbed layer. The general pattern of behavior is that at low surfactant concentrations there is enhanced surfactant adsorption due to the strong surface interaction; whereas around the region of the SDS critical micellar concentration, cmc, the surface is partially depleted of surfactant in favor bulk aggregate structures. The results presented here show how these characteristic features of the adsorption are affected by the degree of ethoxylation and propoxylation. Increasing the degree of propoxylation enhances the surfactant adsorption, whereas varying the degree of ethoxylation has a less pronounced effect. In the region of surfactant surface depletion increasing both the degree of ethoxylation and propoxylation result in an increased surface depletion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adeuterium 3aelectrolytes 3aethoxylation 3aethylene oxide 3aionic surfactants 3aneutralization 3aneutrons 3apolymers 3apropylene oxide 3asulfates 3asurface tension1 aThomas, R.

This fishery is primarily a consumptive fishery. The stock has been successfully rebuilding but remains below statutory rebuilding goals. Managers accordingly have restrained the annual quota primarily by increasing size limits, with a resulting increase in discard mortality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate new approaches to bag and size limits that minimize discard mortality while increasing angler satisfaction within the constraints of promulgated catch quotas. Three alternative management scenarios (slot limit, reduced minimum size, and cumulative size scenarios) were tested on party boats from New Jersey and New York. Total catch (by number) was lowest for control fishing trips (2006 state regulation) and higher for all three experimental scenarios because the experimental scenarios resulted in a greater number of kept fish. Discard-to-catch ratio (by fish weight and number) was highest for control trips, and landings (by weight and number) were lowest for the control scenario. Recreational fishermen operating under the reduced minimum size and cumulative size scenarios kept the most fish; these scenarios had the lowest discard-to-catch ratios. The slot limit scenario was intermediate in the discard-to-catch ratio and also in the number of kept fish. All three alternative management scenarios resulted in landing more fish under a biomass-neutral fishery to retain catch within allocation limits. Relative to 2006 legal conditions, the alternative scenarios produced proportional increases in landings by a factor of 1.75 to 2.09, while reducing discard mortality by 41––63%% and maintaining the same total fishing mortality (landings plus discards) by weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParalichthys dentatus 3aboats 3acoasts 3afisheries 3afishermen 3aflounder 3amanagers 3amortality 3aNew Jersey 3aNew York1 aPowell, Eric N.1 aDePersenaire, John1 aKing, Sarah E.0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2010 Mar.,  p.412-423dThe American Fisheries Societyx1942-51207nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245019400168300001600362520127700378592002801655650002001683650001401703650001401717650001101731650002001742650001501762650002401777650001901801650001201820653001701832653001201849653001501861653002501876653001201901700002001913700001701933700001901950700006101969773011602030856008102146852000902227655001202236IND60694334720221120063551.0200511e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069433472DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820200002192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarton, Diane P.10aInfection of Hexametra angusticaecoides Chabaud & Brygoo, 1960 (Nematoda: Ascarididae) in a population of captive crested geckoes, Correlophus ciliatus Guichenot (Reptilia: Diplodactylidae)  ap. 673-680.  aHere we report on the infection of captive crested geckos Correlophus ciliatus Guichenot (Reptilia: Diplodactylidae), with adults of the ascaridoid nematode, Hexametra angusticaecoides Chabaud & Brygoo, 1960 (Ascarididae). A population of captive crested geckoes became ill and died within a short period of time. Nematodes were recovered from the crested geckoes examined from within the coelomic cavity, penetrating various organs and migrating through subcutaneous tissues, as well as emerging through the geckos' skin. One gecko was treated with levamisole following surgical excision of nematodes from under the skin; this gecko survived. The potential source of the nematode infection in the captive geckoes is discussed. It is most likely that wild-caught Madagascan mossy geckoes, Uroplatus sikorae Boettger (Reptilia: Gekkonidae), introduced the infection to the colony. Molecular sequences of the nematodes are the first produced for the members of this genus. A redescription of the species and its genetic characterization based on the internal transcribed spacer sequence data is provided, suggesting some of the morphological criteria that have been used in the past to distinguish between Hexametra spp. may have been intraspecific morphological variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplodactylidae 3aHexametra 3aUroplatus 3aadults 3aanimal diseases 3alevamisole 3anematode infections 3aredescriptions 3atissues 0aAscaridoidea 0acaptive 0amorphology 0amolecular sequencing 0areptile1 aMartelli, Paolo1 aLuk, William1 aZhu, Xiaocheng1 aShamsi, Shokoofeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8606-64000 tParasitology.g2020 May, v. 147, no. 6 p.673-680dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200002193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04453naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245014200207300001400349520238500363592002802748650000802776650001802784650001202802650001702814650001502831650002902846650002402875650002502899650001902924650002502943650002002968650002902988650001203017650001003029650002903039650002103068650001703089650002203106650002503128650002103153650001903174650001103193650001703204650002203221650002003243650002403263650001203287650001503299650001803314650002103332651001203353653002003365653003403385653003603419653001703455653001103472653001703483700002503500700002103525700001703546773010103563856008203664852000903746655001203755IND60542200920221118074825.0190402e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054220092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2015.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Susanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2424-713410aCosts and benefits of ammonia and particulate matter abatement in German agriculture including interactions with greenhouse gas emissions  ap. 58-68.  aThe abatement of ammonia (NH3) and particulate matter (PM) emissions in agriculture reduces damages to human health and biodiversity and provides benefits for society, but also imposes costs on farmers. As NH3 and PM emissions partly originate from the same activities as greenhouse gases, interactions may exist between NH3 and PM emission abatement and greenhouse gas emissions. This study is aimed at estimating the costs and benefits of NH3 and PM emission abatement measures, considering interactions with agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. We combined an economic-ecological farm model for estimating emission reductions and abatement costs with an integrated environmental impact assessment model for estimating the benefits for human health and biodiversity, with applications to three Federal States in Germany. We reasoned that benefits exceed costs and that synergies with greenhouse gas reduction exist. All NH3 and PM emission abatement measures affected greenhouse gases. In crop production, conservation tillage increased farmers' gross margins and reduced both PM emissions and, via soil carbon sequestration, also greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits depended on the soil type and its carbon sequestration potential, which differ across regions. The substitution of urea fertiliser for calcium ammonium nitrate reduced both NH3 and greenhouse gas emissions. In livestock production, the measures with the highest net benefits were chemical washers for exhaust-air purification, injection or cultivator manure application and concrete manure storage cover. Low-protein pig feeding increased farmers' gross margins and also achieved high net benefits, with the benefits of greenhouse gas emission reduction exceeding those of NH3 emission reduction. Low-protein poultry feeding and biofilters for air purification yielded negative net benefits and were therefore not recommended for implementation. The results confirm interactions of NH3 and PM emission abatement measures with greenhouse gas emissions and suggest that all relevant emission types be integrated in an analysis. Air pollution abatement and climate change mitigation have mainly been addressed in separate policies. Our results suggest that these policies are better integrated so as to stimulate synergies and to define the appropriate ambition level of emission reduction targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aammonia 3abiodiversity 3abiofilters 3acalcium ammonium nitrate 3acalcium fertilizers 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aconservation tillage 3acrop production 3aenvironmental assessment 3afarmers 3afarms 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3alivestock production 3amanure spreading 3amanure storage 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3apoultry feeding 3aprofits and margins 3asociety 3asoil types 3aswine feeding 3aurea fertilizers 3aGermany 0aCost-efficiency 0aEconomic-ecological modelling 0aEnvironmental impact assessment 0aDamage costs 0aHealth 0aBiodiversity1 aAngenendt, Elisabeth1 aBeletskaya, Olga1 aZeddies, J.,0 tAgricultural systems.g2015 Dec., v. 141 p.58-68dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2015.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245017100157300002000328520140100348592002801749650002201777650001901799650001701818650001901835650001001854650001401864650002301878650001301901650001801914650004401932700001901976700002001995700002102015773012402036856007402160852000902234655001202243IND60636343020221122003942.0190408e20190402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063634302DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra01468c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamasaka, Go10aMechanistic insight into the catalytic hydrogenation of nonactivated aldehydes with a Hantzsch ester in the presence of a series of organoboranes: NMR and DFT studies  ap. 10201-10210.  aMechanistic studies on the organoborane-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of nonactivated aldehydes with a Hantzsch ester (diethyl-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate) as a synthetic NADH analogue were performed by NMR experiments and DFT calculations. In the reaction of benzaldehyde with the Hantzsch ester, the catalytic activity of tris[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane was superior to that of other borane catalysts, such as tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, trifluoroborane etherate, or triphenylborane. Stoichiometric NMR experiments demonstrated that the hydrogenation process proceeds through activation of the aldehyde by the borane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer from the Hantzsch ester to the resulting activated aldehyde. DFT calculations for the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde with the Hantzsch ester in the presence of borane catalysts supported the reaction pathway and showed why the catalytic activity of tris[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane is higher than that of the other boron catalysts. Association constants and Gibbs free energies in the reaction of boron catalysts with benzaldehyde or benzyl alcohol, which were investigated by ¹H NMR analyses, also indicated why tris[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane is a superior catalyst to tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, trifluoroborane etherate, or triphenylborane in the hydrogenation reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3abenzaldehyde 3abenzyl alcohol 3aboron 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrides 3ahydrogenation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aTsuji, Hiroaki1 aEhara, Masahiro1 aUozumi, Yasuhiro0 tRSC advances.g2019 Apr. 02, v. 9, no. 18 p.10201-10210dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra01468c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01870naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245005600173300001600229500001900245520054900264536007200813592002800885650001500913650002400928650001300952650001600965650001400981650001900995651001801014653001601032653001501048653002301063653002301086653002501109653001901134653002401153700002201177700002001199700001501219773009701234856008401331852000901415655001201424IND60738212920221120172124.0210531e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073821292DNAL7 a10.3897/phytokeys.177.631162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLannuzel, Guillaume10aLagenophora (Asteraceae, Astereae) in New Caledonia  ap. 125-138.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe genus Lagenophora Cass. is taxonomically revised for New Caledonia with two species recognised.

Two experiments were performed: the first evaluated the fermentation characteristics, chemical composition and determined the organic acids in cactus pear silages with the inclusion of five levels of maniçoba (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%) in six opening times (1, 7, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days). The second experiment determined the nutrient intake, digestibility, water balance and nitrogen balance in Canindé goats fed diets based on cactus pear silage with the inclusion of four levels of maniçoba (25, 50, 75 and 100%), with six animals per treatment. The increase in maniçoba levels in cactus pear silage provided a linear increase in the butyric acid, dry matter (DM), ether extract, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, water intake via drinking fountain and metabolic water, and reduced the pH, lactic acid, acetic acid, mineral matter, total carbohydrates, non-fibrous carbohydrates, water intake via food, total water intake, water excreted in the faeces, water excreted in the urine, total water excretion and water balance. Quadratic behaviour was observed for N-NH₃, DM recovery and propionic acid, with an increase in maniçoba levels in cactus pear silages. Regarding the different opening times, there was a significant effect in pH, N-NH₃, acetic acid, lactic acid and butyric acid (P < 0.050). The inclusion of maniçoba in cactus pear silage improved the fermentation characteristics and nutritional quality to be used in diets for goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aacid detergent fiber 3aagricultural sciences 3abutyric acid 3acactus pears 3acellulose 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afermentation 3agoat feeding 3ahemicellulose 3alactic acid 3alignin 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen balance 3anutrient intake 3anutritive value 3apH 3apropionic acid 3asilage 3aurine 0aCanindé goat 0aManihot pseudoglaziovii 0aOpuntia fícus indica 0asemiarid region 0awater supply1 aAraujo, G.

A set of experiments was realized in three years. The influence of extreme soil load with PAHs (soil contaminated by floods and sludge application) on their content in plants was observed in a pot trial. A laboratory column extract trial investigated PAHs transfer from the soil into soil solution in different conditions. The results showed that the transfer of PAHs into plants is influenced mainly by chemical characteristics of the substances (the number and position of aromatic nuclei); by soil characteristics (content and quality of soil organic matter) and by plant characteristics (plant species and plant bodies). The roots of tested plants were loaded with PAHs thanks to the transfer of less-nuclei compounds (2&ndash;3 nuclei) in soil solution into the roots and thanks to the binding of more nuclei compounds (4&ndash;6 nuclei) on organic substances in epidermis and primary bark of roots. These results were confirmed by a laboratory column trial.  aPublisher supplied data 3abark 3aenvironment 3asludge 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3asoil solution1 aČechmánková, J.1 aSkála, J.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 56, no. 9 p.434-443dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/7/2010-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245009600133300001600229520158400245592002801829650001601857650001901873650002201892650002501914650002501939650001101964650002201975650001901997650001102016650001902027650001902046650001602065700002102081700001802102700002002120700002102140700002602161700001702187700001602204700001902220700001702239700002002256700002902276700001502305700002202320700002002342700001802362700002002380700002102400700002002421700001902441700002002460700001802480700001702498700002102515700002202536700001502558773010602573852000902679655001202688IND60459379620221121012307.0151110e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045937962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRose, Kenneth A.10aEnd-To-End Models for the Analysis of Marine Ecosystems: Challenges, Issues, and Next Steps  ap. 115-130.  aThere is growing interest in models of marine ecosystems that deal with the effects of climate change through the higher trophic levels. Such end-to-end models combine physicochemical oceanographic descriptors and organisms ranging from microbes to higher-trophic-level (HTL) organisms, including humans, in a single modeling framework. The demand for such approaches arises from the need for quantitative tools for ecosystem-based management, particularly models that can deal with bottom-up and top-down controls that operate simultaneously and vary in time and space and that are capable of handling the multiple impacts expected under climate change. End-to-end models are now feasible because of improvements in the component submodels and the availability of sufficient computing power. We discuss nine issues related to the development of end-to-end models. These issues relate to formulation of the zooplankton submodel, melding of multiple temporal and spatial scales, acclimation and adaptation, behavioral movement, software and technology, model coupling, skill assessment, and interdisciplinary challenges. We urge restraint in using end-to-end models in a true forecasting mode until we know more about their performance. End-to-end models will challenge the available data and our ability to analyze and interpret complicated models that generate complex behavior. End-to-end modeling is in its early developmental stages and thus presents an opportunity to establish an open-access, community-based approach supported by a suite of true interdisciplinary efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3adevelopmental stages 3aecosystem management 3ahumans 3amarine ecosystems 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3aspace and time 3atrophic levels 3azooplankton1 aAllen, J.

We compared the blood meal size and the energy expended for digestion by fleas from the 15ᵗʰ generation of each line on these hosts between hosts within a line and between lines within a host asking (a) whether fleas adapt to a novel host (increased blood consumption/decreased energy expended for digestion); (b) if yes, whether this adaptation leads to the loss of ability to exploit an original host, and (c) whether the success of adaptation to a novel host depends on its ecological co-occurrence with a flea. The blood consumption and digestion energetics of fleas fed on the principal host differed from those on other hosts. The effect of the principal host on feeding performance differed between fleas, with S. cleopatrae consuming less blood and expending more energy for digestion on the principal than on any other host, whereas the opposite was true for X. ramesis. No changes in feeding performance on a novel host over generations were found. We propose several explanations for the lack of adaptation to a novel host over time. We explain the poor performance of S. cleopatrae on its principal host via its immune response mounting pattern. We argue that the principal host of a parasite is not necessarily the host on which the parasite demonstrates the best performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopsylla 3ablood 3ablood meal 3adigestion 3afeeding behavior 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3amodels 3aparasites 3aportion size 0aAdaptation 0ablood meal size 0aenergy expenditure 0afleas1 aFielden, Laura J.1 aWarburton, Elizabeth M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8125-27411 avan der Mescht, Luther1 aKrasnov, Boris R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0382-33310 tParasitology.g2020 May, v. 147, no. 6 p.721-728dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200002443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245008900203300001600292520169900308592002802007650002502035650002302060650002302083650002102106650002002127650002602147650001402173650001402187650001802201650002802219650002902247650003302276650001902309650001502328650001102343650001202354650000902366650001002375650001002385650001902395650001102414650001902425650003502444650001502479650001302494650001402507650001602521650001002537650001702547651001102564653001802575653002202593700001702615700001902632700001802651700001902669700002002688700001902708700002502727700002002752700002102772773011602793856008102909852000902990655001202999IND60694335120221120072847.0200511e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069433512DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820200003352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, V.

In this context, domestic animals, wild fauna and humans are exposed to mutual exchange of parasites, microorganisms and diseases. We studied tick parasitism of wild carnivores and domestic dogs, and the environmental of questing ticks, in extensive cattle ranch areas intermingled with natural vegetation, and in a natural reserve, both in a region of Cerrado biome, Midwestern Brazil. From 2008 to 2015, we inspected 119 wild carnivores from nine species, and collected six tick species (Amblyomma sculptum, Amblyomma ovale, Amblyomma dubitatum, Amblyomma tigrinum, Dermacentor nitens and Rhipicephalus microplus). The most numerous and infested hosts were Cerdocyon thous, Lycalopex vetulus, Chrysocyon brachyurus, Puma concolor and Conepatus amazonicus. From 139 domestic dogs, we collected A. sculptum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and R. microplus. From vegetation, samplings resulted in A. sculptum, A. dubitatum, A. ovale, Amblyomma rotundatum and R. microplus, with dominance of A. sculptum. Domestics and wild animals presented high overlapping of infestations by A. sculptum, a generalist and anthropophilic tick species. This tick is the most important vector of the Brazilian spotted fever, a lethal human disease.

Therefore, to assess the impact of reclaimed water irrigation on endophytic bacterial communities and potential pathogens, a pot experiment was conducted to compare reclaimed water irrigation with tap water irrigation using pepper as a test crop. In this work, the diversity and community structure of endophytic bacteria were investigated, as well as the potential pathogens in peppers irrigated with full reclaimed water or diluted reclaimed water, using a combined approach of Illumina-MiSeq amplicon sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR. 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses demonstrated that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla both in root and fruit endophytes. Pseudomonas, Comamonas, and Flavobacterium were the dominant endophytic potential pathogens. Furthermore, some phytopathogens were also identified, including Ralstonia and Erwinia. Additionally, our results showed that the concentrations of Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas syringae were significantly lower in plant endophytes irrigated with diluted reclaimed water than those of irrigated with undiluted reclaimed water, indicating that mixing reclaimed water and tap water in appropriate proportions may reduce the abundances of potential pathogens in endophytes. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of bacterial communities in pepper endophytes exposed to reclaimed water irrigation and proposes a potential strategy to decrease human and crop health risks from pathogens in reclaimed water, thereby improving crop safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aCapsicum annuum 3aComamonas 3aErwinia 3aEscherichia coli 3aFirmicutes 3aFlavobacterium 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aRalstonia 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3acrop safety 3aendophytes 3afruits 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3apepper 3aplant pathogens 3apublic health 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil ecology 3atap water 3awastewater irrigation 3awastewater treatment 0aReclaimed water irrigation 0aBacterial community 0aPathogens1 aHu, Zhao,1 aFan, Xiangyang1 aCui, Erping1 aLi, Zhongyang1 aMa, Huanhuan1 aGao, Feng0 tApplied soil ecology.g2020 Dec., v. 156 p.103627-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1036273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010700169300002000276520199400296592002802290650001402318650001802332650000902350650001902359650001402378650001102392650002202403700001702425700002302442700002902465700001702494773010102511856008602612852000902698655001202707IND60577526120221118012315.0170809e20161011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057752612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b016812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhengjia10aEffect of Substrate Morphology on the Odd–Even Effect in Hydrophobicity of Self-Assembled Monolayers  ap. 10358-10367.  aSurface roughness, often captured through root-mean-square roughness (Rᵣₘₛ), has been shown to impact the quality of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formed on coinage metals. Understanding the effect of roughness on hydrophobicity of SAMs, however, is complicated by the odd–even effecta zigzag oscillation in contact angles with changes in molecular length. We recently showed that for surfaces with Rᵣₘₛ > 1 nm, the odd–even effect in hydrophobicity cannot be empirically observed. In this report, we compare wetting properties of SAMs on Ag and Au surfaces of different morphologies across the Rᵣₘₛ ∼ 1 nm limit. We prepared surfaces with comparable properties (grain sizes and Rᵣₘₛ) and assessed the wetting properties of resultant SAMs. Substrates with Rᵣₘₛ either below or above the odd–even limit were investigated. With smoother surfaces (lower Rᵣₘₛ), an inverted asymmetric odd–even zigzag oscillation in static contact angles (θₛ) was observed with change from Au to Ag. Asymmetry in odd–even oscillation in Au was attributed to a larger change in θₛ from odd to even number of carbons in the n-alkanethiol and vice versa for Ag. For rougher surfaces, no odd–even effect was observed; however, a gradual increase in the static contact angle was observed. Increase in the average grain sizes (>3 times larger) on rough surfaces did not lead to significant difference in the wetting properties, suggesting that surface roughness significantly dominated the nature of the SAMs. We therefore infer that the predicted roughness-dependent limit to the observation of the odd–even effect in wetting properties of n-alkanethiols cannot be overcome by creating surfaces with large grain sizes for surfaces with Rᵣₘₛ > 1 nm. We also observed that the differences between Au and Ag surfaces are dominated by differences in the even-numbered SAMs, but this difference vanishes with shorter molecular chain length (≤C₃).  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3acontact angle 3agold 3ahydrophobicity 3aroughness 3asilver 3asurface roughness1 aChen, Jiahao1 aGathiaka, Symon M.1 aOyola-Reynoso, Stephanie1 aThuo, Martin0 tLangmuir.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 32, no. 40 p.10358-10367dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b016813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012900168300001600297500001900313520141800332592002801750650002001778650001301798650002601811650001201837650000901849650002001858650001601878650001101894650001401905650001401919650001501933650001401948650002301962650002201985650001102007650001802018653001502036653001202051653001102063653001002074700006302084700001302147700001602160773013502176856008102311852000902392655001202401IND60711350020221120211332.0200922e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071135002DNAL7 a10.1017/S002185962000060X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLillywhite, R.D.14aThe response of winter barley (Hordeum vulgare) and forage maize (Zea mays) crops to polyhalite, a multi-nutrient fertilizer  ap. 269-278.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolyhalite is a multi-nutrient mineral ore containing potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S). Historically, it has enjoyed minor use as a fertilizer, but the opening of a new mine in the UK will make larger quantities available. Therefore, an examination of the performance of crops fertilized with polyhalite, or selected commercial alternatives, was pertinent and is reported here. Four field trials were carried out between 2013 and 2016 to investigate the response of winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and forage maize (Zea mays L.) to different application rates of polyhalite, potassium chloride (muriate of potash, MOP) and potassium sulphate (sulphate of potash, SOP) fertilizers. Potassium and S nutrition were the focus of these trials as they limit field production more often than Mg and Ca. Polyhalite was found to be an effective source of both K and S for crop production. In three out of four trials, application of polyhalite resulted in similar or greater K offtake compared with both MOP and SOP; MOP application resulted in greater K offtake in one trial. In three out of four trials, application of polyhalite resulted in similar or better S offtake compared with both MOP and SOP; SOP application resulted in greater S offtake in one trial. Polyhalite and MOP treatments produced similar total dry weight in all four trials, but were slightly inferior to SOP treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aZea mays 3aagricultural sciences 3acalcium 3acorn 3acrop production 3afertilizers 3aforage 3amagnesium 3anutrition 3apolyhalite 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3apotassium sulfate 3asulfur 3awinter barley 0aFertilizer 0asulphur 0abarley 0amaize1 aWiltshire, J.

The properties of the adsorbent were characterized using various techniques including FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, and BET. The influence of five parameters such as pH, temperature, contact time, initial dye concentration, and adsorbent dosage on the removal percentage of the dye was investigated. The optimum conditions of 5.83, 34.32 °C, 5.20 min, 392.10 ppm, and 0.007 g were achieved for pH, temperature, contact time, initial dye concentration, and adsorbent dosage, respectively. The maximum removal percentage of 99.48% was obtained under the optimum condition that exhibited high adsorption potential of the used adsorbent. Central composite design (CCD) under response surface methodology and artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) were utilized for optimization of parameters. Comparison of the results of the two models in terms of coefficient of determination (R²) and mean absolute percentage error confirmed the prediction potential of CCD and ANN-GA. Higher ability and accuracy of ANN-GA in prediction was found based on given results. The experimental equilibrium data were studied by Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevic isotherm models and explored that the data well presented by Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacity of 416.66 mg/g. The adsorption kinetic was well-fitted by the pseudo-second-order model. The thermodynamics of the adsorption displayed spontaneous and endothermic nature of the process. Regeneration investigation showed that Zein/nHAp can impressively be reused, indicating that the adsorbent was a promising one for the removal of Congo red from aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aalgorithms 3aaqueous solutions 3aendothermy 3ahydroxyapatite 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3azein1 aSemnani, Abolfazl1 aTeimouri, Abbas1 aKahkesh, Homa1 aMomeni Isfahani, Tahereh1 aHabibollahi, Saeed0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2018 Sept., v. 26, no. 9 p.3677-3697dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870065x1566-25437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-018-1246-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013100170300001400301520134600315592002801661650002501689650002101714650001501735650001701750650001801767650002401785650002001809650001501829700002101844700001601865700002101881773009301902856008101995990002302076852000902099655001202108IND60093446720221123044715.0141103e20121203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009344672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2011.10.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrvölgyi, Mónika10aQuantitative dynamical relationships for the effect of rotation rate on frequency and waveform of electrochemical oscillations  ap. 56-65.  aWe investigate the effect of changing mass transfer conditions through variation of rotation rate of a rotating disk electrode on features of oscillatory dynamics of negative differential resistance electrochemical systems. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of a prototype two-variable electrochemical model show that for oscillations close to a Hopf bifurcation the frequency (ω) increases with increase in rotation rate (d) following an approximate square root formula ω∝d¹/². For relaxation oscillations, the oscillations maxima, minima, and transition points between the high- and low-current states do not depend on rotation rate; the oscillation waveform invariance is explained using nullcline analysis by showing that the rotation does not affect the nullcline of the fast variable (electrode potential) along which the oscillations occur. The numerical and theoretical predictions are confirmed in experiments with copper electrodissolution in phosphoric acid electrolyte using a rotating electrode setup. The results thus indicate that simplifying concepts related to invariant manifolds and parameter dependence of bifurcation points (principle of critical simplification) are efficient approaches to obtaining quantitative dynamical relationships for decoding complexity in electrochemical reaction systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3aphosphoric acid 3aprediction1 aGáspár, Vilmos1 aNagy, Timea1 aKiss, Istvan Z.,0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Dec. 3, v. 83 p.56-65dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2011.10.0733Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100001600200245013000216300001600346500001500362520065600377592002801033650001201061650001701073650001501090650001601105650002401121650002601145650001901171650001701190650002501207650001201232650006901244650006901313650003701382650003301419650002101452650005401473650001501527650001201542650003801554653001701592653001101609653001901620653001501639700002001654700001601674700001901690700002001709773011601729852000901845856008301854655001201937IND9200544920221118010439.0181203e19901001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920054492DNAL7 a22700442pmid7 a10.1258/0023677907808659942doi4 a0023-6772(19901001)24:4L.341;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkerman, L.10aIn vivo activity of orally administered antibiotics and chemotherapeutics against acute septicaemic pasteurellosis in rabbits  ap. 341-344.  a2019-12-04  aDifferent antibiotics and chemotherapeutics were tested for therapeutic efficacy in rabbits, in an experimental model using a Pasteurella multocida strain which causes hyperacute septicaemia in this animal species.

Methods: Cross-sectional study with older adults (≥60 years) of both sexes enrolled in the Family Health Strategy program in Palmas (TO). Sociodemographic aspects, health conditions, and functionality were evaluated as independent variables and Body Mass Index (BMI) for general adiposity and Waist Circumference (WC) for central adiposity as dependent variables. Descriptive analysis and hierarchical multiple Poisson regression with robust variance were performed. Results: A total of 449 seniors (50.6% women) from 60 to 92 years of age, average of 68.3 years, were evaluated. The prevalence of general adiposity was 46.8% (95% CI: 42.2%–51.4%) and central adiposity was 78.8% (95% CI: 74.7%–82.3%). The prevalence of both outcomes was significantly higher among women and the participants with a history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and rheumatic diseases and those dependent in activities of daily living (ADL) than among men. Lower frequency of adiposity (general and central) was found with increasing age. After adjustment, the prevalence of both outcomes was significantly higher in women aged 70–79 years and hypertensive. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the need to establish nutritional status monitoring and direct obesity prevention and control interventions in programs to promote health and quality of life of older adults and those in the stages prior to old age.  aThis work was supported by the Higher Education Personnel Improvement Coordination (CAPES) under Grant number 190815/2014.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3aquality of life 3avariance 3awaist circumference 0aElderly 0aprevalence 0afunctionality 0anutrition1 aSantos, Kíllya de Paiva1 aCastro, Joice da Silva1 aJuvanhol, Leidjaira Lopes1 aRezende, Fabiane Aparecida Canaan1 aRibeiro, Andréia Queiroz0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2020 Nov. 16, v. 39, no. 8 p.739-746dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2020.17349893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011300175300001200288520166800300592002801968650002501996650002302021650001902044650002202063650002102085650001902106650002902125650001502154650001702169650001202186650002402198650002202222650002702244650001902271653001802290653001002308653002702318653000902345653002402354653001102378700002302389700006202412700005802474773010702532856008802639852000902727655001202736IND60629196320221121063201.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062919632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzpila, Krzysztof10aWing measurement can be used to identify European blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) of forensic importance  ap. 1-8.  aCorrect species identification is a crucial step in research and the practice of forensic entomology. At the moment the most common and widely used tool for this purpose are taxonomic keys based on morphological characters. During recent decades molecular methods have been used more and more often for species identification. Automated species identification can also be based on wing measurements. This method proved to be reliable in the case of some groups of necrophagous Diptera from various geographical regions. Up to now, this method has not been applied to a wide range of species of European Calliphoridae. We have used 968 specimens representing 15 species and 6 genera. Identification was based on 15 landmarks located at wing vein junctions. Wing shape differed markedly between the studied species. The overall correct classification rate at the level of species was 97.1%. Seven species, including Calliphora vomitoria, Chrysomya albiceps, Phormia regina, Protophormia terraenovae and Lucilia sericata were identified without error. Lucilia caesar and Lucilia illustris, which are considered relatively difficult to distinguish, were correctly classified in 93.0% and 94.1% cases, respectively. The correct classification rate at the level of genera was 99.2%. The results presented here suggest that wing measurements are a promising alternative to other methods of identification of necrophagous Calliphoridae. This method can be particularly useful for identification of large samples of females collected during carrion succession studies. It can also be used to double check identification performed by a taxonomist using traditional methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalliphora vomitoria 3aChrysomya albiceps 3aLucilia caesar 3aLucilia illustris 3aLucilia sericata 3aPhormia regina 3aProtophormia terraenovae 3aautomation 3adead animals 3afemales 3aforensic entomology 3aforensic sciences 3aspecies identification 3ataxonomic keys 0aCalliphoridae 0aImago 0aSpecies identification 0aWing 0aForensic entomology 0aEurope1 aŻmuda, Aleksandra1 aAkbarzadeh, Kamran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8330-72721 aTofilski, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3898-70290 tForensic science international.g2019 Mar., v. 296 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245010700176300001600283520130800299592002801607650001901635650001801654650001901672650001601691650002401707650001501731650002601746653002601772653000901798653003101807653002801838653000901866700001801875700002501893773012101918856008202039852000902121655001202130IND60532931120221118141257.0160728e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053293112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViale-Bouroncle, Sandra10aNOTCH1 signaling regulates the BMP2/DLX-3 directed osteogenic differentiation of dental follicle cells  ap. 500-504.  aDental follicle cells (DFCs) are dental stem/progenitor cells and the genuine precursors of alveolar osteoblasts and dental cementoblasts. A previous study showed that the transcription factor DLX3 (distal less homeobox 3) supports the osteogenic differentiation in DFCs via a positive feedback loop with the bone morghogenetic protein (BMP) 2. Until today, however, the control of this BMP2/DLX3 pathway by additional signaling pathways remains elusive. Previous studies also suggested that the NOTCH signaling pathway plays a role in the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs. In this study we showed that DLX3 overexpression and the initiation of the osteogenic differentiation by BMP2 or dexamethasone induced the NOTCH signaling pathway in DFCs. However, the induction of NOTCH-signaling impaired not only the osteogenic differentiation (ALP activity and mineralized nodules) but also the expression of the transcription factor DLX3 and the activation of the BMP-signaling pathway. So, NOTCH signaling plays a regulatory role for the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs. In conclusion, results of our study suggest that the NOTCH-signaling pathway, which is activated during the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs, regulates the BMP2/DLX3 directed differentiation of DFCs via a negative feed-back loop.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3adexamethasone 3amineralization 3aosteoblasts 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3atranscription factors 0aDental follicle cells 0aDLX3 0aOsteogenic differentiation 0aNOTCH signaling pathway 0aBMP21 aGosau, Martin1 aMorsczeck, Christian0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 443 p.500-504dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100002200200245010800222300001600330500001500346520025100361592002800612650002000640650002100660650002300681650001400704650001400718650000900732650002600741650000900767650001400776650001400790650001200804650003600816650001100852650006300863650000900926650006800935650000901003650001701012653001701029653002101046653001501067653001401082653002301096653001501119653001701134653002001151653001201171653002201183700002101205773011601226852000901342856008301351655001201434IND9200545220221118010733.0181203e19901001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920054522DNAL7 a22700472pmid7 a10.1258/0023677907808658772doi4 a0023-6772(19901001)24:4L.358;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunskaar, Steinar10aAllergy to laboratory mice and rats: a review of the pathophysiology, epidemiology and clinical aspects  ap. 358-379.  a2019-12-04  aAllergy to laboratory animals (mice and rats) is reviewed.

Chemically stable, magnetic rattle-type core–shell particles, comprising metallic cobalt nanoparticles in hollow silica microspheres, were prepared by the sol–gel reaction of alkylsilyl trichlorides around water droplets in a water-in-oil emulsion. Sulfonic groups were immobilized on the external surface of the core–shell particles through silylation with 3-mercaptopropyl(trimethoxysilane) and subsequent oxidization of the thiol groups by nitric acid. The sulfonic groups acted as adsorption sites for Zn and Pb ions under acidic conditions and as catalytically active sites for the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate in aqueous media. The enclosed Co was not eroded during the regeneration of the adsorbent/catalyst by 1 M HCl. The chemical stability arose from the dense non-porous shell, which prevents the passage of solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aethyl acetate 3aheavy metals 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrolysis 3alead 3amagnetism 3ametal ions 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3anitric acid 3asilica 3asilylation 3asolvents 3athiols 3azinc1 aTakeda, Y.1 aWatanabe, N.1 aHaeiwa, T.1 aSakai, T.1 aMishima, S.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Mar. 25, v. 2, no. 16 p.5751-5758dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta15405j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245009600186300001600282520202400298592002802322650001602350650001802366650003202384650002102416650002102437650001102458650001502469650001402484650003002498650001202528650002602540650002602566650004602592650005002638650005802688650004202746650005302788650004102841650002402882650002402906650002402930650002602954700001502980700001802995700001803013773011603031856005503147852000903202655001203211IND4482175020221119154420.0120821e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448217502DNAL7 a228036232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03290.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasuda, H.10aCharacterization of three propane‐inducible oxygenases in Mycobacterium sp. strain ENV421  ap. 175-181.  aAims: Mycobacterium sp. strain ENV421 has the ability to cometabolize a variety of chemicals following growth on propane as a sole source of carbon and energy. In this study, we used genetic and biochemical approaches to identify and characterize multiple propane‐inducible oxygenase genes in ENV421. Methods and Results: Gene clusters encoding a CYP153‐type cytochrome P450 oxygenase (P450), an AlkB‐type alkane monooxygenase (AlkB) and a soluble diiron monooxygenase were identified and cloned using degenerate PCR primers. Reverse transcriptase PCR showed that all three gene clusters were induced by propane. Substrate specificity studies revealed that despite the fact that ENV421 does not grow on medium length alkanes, cloned versions of both the AlkB and P450 were capable of octane oxidation, forming n‐octanol. Additionally, the P450 oxygenase had the ability to oxidize indole, medium‐to‐long‐chain alkylbenzenes and a variety of para‐substituted methylalkylbenzenes. Successful cloning and expression of the diiron monooxygenase was not achieved, so its substrate specificity could not be determined. Conclusions: Three types of short‐to‐medium‐chain alkane oxygenases were induced by propane in ENV421, even though the cloned AlkB and P450 oxygenases did not oxidize propane. Curiously, they both oxidized octane, which is not a growth substrate for ENV421. Furthermore, the P450, typically operating as terminal alkane hydroxylase, exhibited interesting regio‐ and stereoselectivity, catalysing linear alkanes, alkylbenzenes and indole. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study describes the first example of a propane‐inducible P450 with a broad substrate specificity, including linear alkanes, alkylbenzenes and a multiring compound. The induction of three distinct oxygenase classes by propane is also an interesting finding because it might explain why propane serves as an effective stimulant that promotes the biodegradation of a various environmental contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3aMycobacterium 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3acytochrome P-450 3amultigene family 3aoctane 3aoxygenases 3apollution 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apropane 3asubstrate specificity 2a1-Octanolxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP4Axgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMycobacteriumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aOctanesxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPropanexmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity1 aMcClay, K.1 aSteffan, R.J.1 aZylstra, G.J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2012 Sept., v. 55, no. 3 p.175-181dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03290.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011300162300001600275520104500291592002801336650003101364650002401395650002401419650001301443650001601456650000901472650001701481650001901498650001401517650003201531653001001563653000901573653001301582653001501595653002601610653002301636653002801659653001001687700001501697700002001712700001401732700001401746700001701760700001601777700001301793773012101806856008201927852000902009655001202018IND60532931320221118141251.0160728e20140103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053293132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dan10aLuteolin exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the activity of heat shock protein 90 in macrophages  ap. 326-332.  aSeptic diseases represent the prevalent complications in intensive care units. Luteolin, a plant flavonoid, has potent anti-inflammatory properties; however, the molecular mechanism beneath luteolin mediated immune modulation remains unclear. Here in vitro investigations showed that luteolin dose-dependently inhibited LPS-triggered secretion and relocation of high mobility group B-1 (HMGB1) and LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and nitric oxide (NO) in macrophages. The mechanism analysis demonstrated that luteolin reduced the release of HMGB1 through destabilizing c-Jun and suppressed HMGB1-induced aggravation of inflammatory cascade through reducing Akt protein level. As an inhibitor of Hsp90, luteolin destabilized Hsp90 client protein c-Jun and Akt. In vivo investigations showed that luteolin effectively protected mice from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lethality. In conclusion, the present study suggested that luteolin may act as a potential therapeutic reagent for treating septic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aheat shock proteins 3alipopolysaccharides 3aluteolin 3amacrophages 3amice 3anitric oxide 3anucleoproteins 3asecretion 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aHMGB1 0aRAGE 0aLuteolin 0aMacrophage 0aHeat shock protein 90 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aHigh mobility group B-1 0ac-Jun1 aBi, Aijing1 aDong, Xiaoliang1 aJiang, Yi1 aRui, Bing1 aLiu, Jinjiao1 aYin, Zhimin1 aLuo, Lan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Jan. 03, v. 443 p.326-332dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016400154300001800318500002000336520116500356592002801521596007601549650002001625650001101645650001401656650001801670650001601688650001001704650001301714650001601727650000901743650000901752650001801761650001401779650001401793650002001807650000901827650001501836650003301851650000901884651001701893700001801910700001901928700001801947700002001965700001601985700005702001773015302058856007502211852000902286655001202295IND60786542820221122075827.0220804e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078654282DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.122912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Yang10aGenotype x Environmental Effects on Yielding Ability and Seed Chemical Composition of Industrial Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) Varieties Grown in North Dakota, USA  ap. 1417-1425.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe influence of growing conditions in North Dakota on grain yield and seed composition was evaluated for industrial hemp varieties (Cannabis sativa L.) grown in North Dakota, USA. Average grain yield across varieties was 2138 kg ha⁻¹. Crude protein content of undehulled industrial hemp flour from 10 varieties ranged from 32.7% to 35.9%; and oil content ranged from 24.3% to 28.1%. All industrial hemp flours were excellent natural sources of iron (46.7%), manganese (169.1%), copper (29.0%), zinc (28.2%), phosphorus (41.0%), and magnesium (33.7%) on a per serving basis (30 g per serving) for percent recommended daily intake (% RDI). Oils from most of the varieties differed significantly for the fatty acid (FA) profile. The n6/n3 ratio ranged from 3.2 to 5.1. Principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that CFX‐2 and CRS‐1 grew well in North Dakota based on grain yield, flour, and oil quality. In this study, the chemical composition of flour was not influenced by crop year; but crop year did effect the nutritional mineral composition. These results may have important implications for the use of industrial hemp in food applications.  aPublisher supplied data  cNorth Dakota State Board of Agricultural Research and Education (SBARE) 3aCannabis sativa 3acopper 3acrop year 3acrude protein 3afatty acids 3aflour 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ahemp 3airon 3alipid content 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3aoils 3aphosphorus 3aprincipal component analysis 3azinc 3aNorth Dakota1 aZha, Fengchao1 aPeckrul, Allen1 aHanson, Bryan1 aJohnson, Burton1 aRao, Jiajia1 aChen, Bingcan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4989-547X0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2019 Dec., v. 96, no. 12 p.1417-1425dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.122913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245017700204300001800381500001900399520184300418592002802261650002602289650001202315650001302327650002602340650002002366650001602386650000902402650001502411650001302426650001502439650002002454650001302474651001202487700002102499700001802520700002002538700005502558773014002613856007902753852000902832655001202841IND60655818120221122122407.0190807e20190705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065581812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b020662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMundy, Lukas J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7806-730710aExtracts of Passive Samplers Deployed in Variably Contaminated Wetlands in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region Elicit Biochemical and Transcriptomic Effects in Avian Hepatocytes  ap. 9192-9202.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecent contaminant monitoring in boreal wetlands situated in Alberta’s Athabasca oil sands region revealed increased concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in passive sampling devices deployed in wetlands close to bitumen surface mining operations. In this study, graded concentrations of semipermeable membrane device (SPMD) extracts, collected from 4 wetlands with variable burdens of PACs, were administered to chicken and double-crested cormorant (DCCO) embryonic hepatocytes to determine effects on 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and mRNA expression. Concentrations and composition of PACs detected in SPMDs varied among sites, and the proportion of alkyl PACs was greater than parent compounds at all sites. ΣPACs was the highest in SPMDs deployed within 10 km of mining activity (near-site wetland [5930 ng SPMD–¹]) compared to those ∼50 km south (far-site wetland [689 ng SPMD–¹]). Measures of EROD activity and Cyp1a4 mRNA expression allowed the ranking of wetland sites based on aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated end points; EROD activity and Cyp1a4 mRNA induction were the highest at the near-site wetland. ToxChip PCR arrays (one chicken and one DCCO) provided a more exhaustive transcriptomic evaluation across multiple toxicological pathways following exposure to the SPMD extracts. Study sites with the greatest PAC concentrations had the most genes altered on the chicken ToxChip (12–15/43 genes). Exposure of avian hepatocytes to SPMD extracts from variably contaminated wetlands highlighted traditional PAC-related toxicity pathways as well as other novel mechanisms of action. A novel combination of passive sampling techniques and high-throughput toxicity evaluation techniques shows promise in terms of identifying hotspots of chemical concern in the natural environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhalacrocorax auritus 3abitumen 3achickens 3aenvironmental science 3agene expression 3ahepatocytes 3aoils 3atechnology 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atranscriptomics 3awetlands 3aAlberta1 aWilliams, Kim L.1 aChiu, Suzanne1 aPauli, Bruce D.1 aCrump, Doug1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2915-49890 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 July 05, v. 53, no. 15 p.9192-9202dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b020663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015200171300001600323500001900339520144100358592002801799596012001827650002301947650001501970650001701985650001002002650001302012650001402025650001602039650001702055650001402072650003102086650000902117653001402126653001302140653001502153653002102168700002402189773014102213856008602354852000902440655001202449IND60717746820221118024257.0201119e20201116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071774682DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2020.17895182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Sushil K.10aCan Vitamin D and L-Cysteine Co-Supplementation Reduce 25(OH)-Vitamin D Deficiency and the Mortality Associated with COVID-19 in African Americans?  ap. 694-699.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEarly reports indicate an association between the severity of the COVID-19 infection and the widespread 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency known to exist in populations around the world. Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common among African American (AA) communities, where the COVID-19 infection rate is three-fold higher, and the mortality rate nearly six-fold higher, compared with rates in predominantly white communities. COVID-19 infection primarily affects the lungs and airways. Previous reports have linked 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency with subclinical interstitial lung disease. AA are at risk for lower cellular glutathione (GSH) levels, and GSH deficiency epigenetically impairs VD biosynthesis pathway genes. Compared with vitamin D alone, co-supplementation of vitamin D and L-cysteine (a GSH precursor) showed a better efficacy in improving levels of GSH and VD-regulatory genes at the cellular/tissue level, increasing 25(OH) vitamin D levels, and reducing inflammation biomarkers in the blood in mice studies. We propose that randomized clinical trials are needed to examine the potential of co-supplementation with anti-inflammatory antioxidants, vitamin D and L-cysteine in correcting the 25(OH)VD deficiency and preventing the ‘cytokine storm,’ one of the most severe consequences of infection with COVID-19, thereby preventing the adverse clinical effects of COVID-19 infection in the vulnerable AA population.  aPublisher supplied data  aRO1 AT007442a1R33 AT010637cNational Institutes of Health/National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health 3aCOVID-19 infection 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3ablood 3acysteine 3acytokines 3aglutathione 3ainflammation 3amortality 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk 0aVitamin D 0aCOVID-19 0aL-cysteine 0aAfrican American1 aParsanathan, Rajesh0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2020 Nov. 16, v. 39, no. 8 p.694-699dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2020.17895183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015600163300001400319520131700333592002801650650002201678650001501700650002801715650001301743650002301756650001401779650002101793650001501814650003701829650001001866650001601876650001501892650001301907650001401920650003401934650003301968650002402001650001102025650002002036650001502056653003302071653001302104653001502117653002302132653001602155700001802171700001502189700001502204700001702219773011002236856008302346852000902429655001202438IND60628583820221119173759.0190207e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062858382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaikap, A.12aA novel non-enzymatic zinc oxide thin film based electrochemical recyclable strip with device interface for quantitative detection of catechol in water  ap. 32-36.  aCatechol, one of the major effluents released by various chemical and metal processing industries, causes severe pollution of groundwater. Monitoring of catechol in water using cost-effective, handheld sensor is demanding for the safety of the environment. In this work, non-enzymatic zinc oxide thin film based electrochemical strip sensor is developed on conducting glass substrate for detection of catechol. The preparation of strip without employing standard Pt or Ag/AgCl electrodes and simply depositing ZnO through wet chemical process represents a cost-effective innovative technique. The ZnO thin film is characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffractometer (GIXRD). Catechol is electrochemically detected by means of cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. A prominent redox peak of the developed strip attributed to the detection of catechol is observed at −0.26 V in cyclic voltammetry. The strip is integrated with readout meter and an algorithm is built based on the experimentally observed linear variation of amperometric current with catechol concentration. The quantitative detection performance is demonstrated by testing 0.1–12 ppm catechol solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalgorithms 3aatomic force microscopy 3acatechol 3acost effectiveness 3aeffluents 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aglass 3agroundwater 3amonitoring 3aplatinum 3apollution 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensors (equipment) 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3azinc oxide 0aElectrochemical strip sensor 0aCatechol 0aZinc oxide 0aCyclic voltammetry 0aAmperometry1 aMukherjee, K.1 aMondal, B.1 aMandal, N.1 aMeikap, A.K.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 128 p.32-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002000160245008300180300001600263520202200279592002802301650001102329650002402340650001002364650001202374650001602386650001302402650001602415650002102431650001202452650000902464650001602473650001902489650002702508650001402535650001102549650001102560650001202571650001202583650002102595650002302616650002302639650001302662650001102675650001602686650001302702650002402715650002002739650001302759650000902772650002102781650003202802651001502834700001402849700002402863700001902887773013702906856008103043852000903124655001203133IND4477392120221119020011.0120419e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447739212DNAL7 a218410872pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2011-39722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlhidary, I.

Wethers were randomly divided into 2 groups of 6 wethers each, housed individually in an environmental chamber, and subjected to 2 d of thermoneutral conditions (TNC) followed by either 7 d of TNC (maximum temperature of 24°C, minimum temperature of 16°C) or 7 d of hot conditions (maximum temperature of 38°C, minimum temperature of 28°C), and then 2 d of TNC. These treatments were applied in 2 replicates, with each replicate in a separate environmental chamber. Rectal temperature (RT) and respiration rate were measured daily at 0600, 0800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, and 1800 h. Feed and water intakes were measured daily, and wethers were weighed on d 1 and 11. Blood samples were collected from each whether on d 2 and 6, and serum was assayed for concentrations of creatine, glucose, total protein, cholesterol, NEFA, calcium, sodium, and potassium. Exposure to a high ambient temperature resulted in an 0.8°C increase in RT (P < 0.001), an increase in respiration rate (P < 0.001) by 66 breaths/min, and a 2.7 L/d increase in water intake (P < 0.0001). Feed intake decreased by 22% (P < 0.0001), BW decreased by 5.2% (P < 0.03), and creatine concentration was reduced (P < 0.05). No differences (P > 0.05) between treatments were observed for any of the remaining serum variables. These results indicate that Australian Merino sheep were able to maintain RT within the normal range during exposure to a prolonged increase in heat and that they recovered quickly from the negative effect of heat stress within 2 d of conditions returning to TNC. It would appear that they have a high heat tolerance, and further studies are needed to examine the effects of a greater heat load to determine the temperature-humidity index thresholds for Australian Merino sheep.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aambient temperature 3ablood 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3acreatine 3afeed intake 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aphysiological response 3apotassium 3asodium 3asummer 3awethers 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperature 2aCreatinexanalysis 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDrinking 2aEating 2aEnvironment 2aGenotype 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aHot Temperature 2aHumidity 2aMale 2aRespiratory Rate 2aSheep, Domesticxphysiology 0aQueensland1 aShini, S.1 aAl Jassim, R.

A.10aImprovement in the performance of a zinc ion-selective potentiometric sensor using modified core/shell Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ nanoparticles  ap. 105925-105933.  aA novel, simple, accurate and sensitive zinc ion-selective potentiometric sensor was fabricated by modifying the surface of Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ nanoparticles using a ligand (L) prepared by a coupled reaction between (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilan (APTMS) and 2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (2-H-3-MBA). The prepared Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). In addition, Fe₃O₄@SiO₂, Fe₃O₄@SiO₂–APTMS, and Fe₃O₄@SiO₂–L were characterized by FTIR. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to confirm the surface modification of the Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ nanoparticles. The effects of individual variables such as the amount of graphite powder, Fe₃O₄@SiO₂–L and sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB) used in the composition of the carbon paste electrode (CPE) in addition to their possible interactions were investigated and optimized using a central composite design (CCD) under response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal values of graphite powder, Fe₃O₄@SiO₂–L and NaTPB in a proper amount of paraffin oil obtained were 72, 15 and 6 mg, respectively. The prepared electrode applied for sensing Zn²⁺ ions demonstrated a linear range of 2.5 × 10⁻⁶ to 1.00 × 10⁻¹ mol L⁻¹. The detection limit, slope and response time of this sensor were found to be 10⁻⁶ mol L⁻¹, 29.451 and 14 s, respectively. The potentiometric response of the prepared electrode based on Fe₃O₄@SiO₂–L was independent of the pH of the test solution over the pH range of 4–6, which is an advantage of this electrode having a neutral working pH. This sensor was successfully used for the sensitive determination of trace amounts of Zn²⁺ in samples of water. The moderate selectivity coefficient evaluated by the fixed interference method (FIM) indicated an efficient discriminating ability of the proposed electrode for Zn²⁺ ion assessment. It was also found to be well repeatable and reproducible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon electrodes 3adetection limit 3agraphene 3aions 3airon oxides 3aligands 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc1 aHajati, S.1 aGhaedi, M.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Dec. 14, v. 5, no. 128 p.105925-105933dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra16572e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245015000187300001600337520150400353592002801857650001701885650002301902650002501925650001701950650001301967650002101980650001902001650001902020650002002039650003102059650001002090650001502100650001202115650002302127650001002150650001002160650001202170650002102182650001302203650001802216650001002234650001302244650001602257653001302273653003002286653002102316653001902337653002302356653002302379700002002402700001802422700002402440773013602464856008202600852000902682655001202691IND60516221920221116143536.0190726e20120828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051622192DNAL7 a220856162pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145110058732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMueller, Kristin10aInfluence of broccoli extract and various essential oils on performance and expression of xenobiotic- and antioxidant enzymes in broiler chickens  ap. 588-602.  aThe aim of our present study was to examine the regulation of xenobiotic- and antioxidant enzymes by phytogenic feed additives in the intestine and the liver of broilers. A total of 240 male Ross-308 broiler chickens (1 d old) were fed a commercial starter diet for 2 weeks. On day 15, the birds were assigned to six treatment groups of forty birds each. The control (Con) group was fed a diet without any additive for 3 weeks. The diet of group sulforaphane (SFN) contained broccoli extract providing 0·075 g/kg SFN, whereas the diets of the other four groups contained 0·15 g/kg essential oils from turmeric (Cuo), oregano (Oo), thyme and rosemary (Ro). Weight gain and feed conversion were slightly impaired by Cuo and Oo. In the jejunum SFN, Cuo and Ro increased the expression of xenobiotic enzymes (epoxide hydrolases 1 and 2 and aflatoxin B1 aldehyde reductase) and of the antioxidant enzyme haeme oxygenase regulated by an ‘antioxidant response element’ (ARE) compared to group Con. In contrast to our expectations in the liver, the expression of these enzymes was decreased by all the additives. Nevertheless, all the additives increased the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of the jejunum and the liver and reduced Fe-induced lipid peroxidation in the liver. We conclude that the up-regulation of ARE genes in the small intestine reduces oxidative stress in the organism and represents a novel mechanism by which phytogenic feed additives improve the health of farm animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaldehyde reductase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abroccoli 3abroiler chickens 3aessential oils 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahydrolases 3ajejunum 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amales 3aoregano 3aoxidative stress 3arosemary 3astarter diets 3athyme 3aturmeric 3aweight gain 0aChickens 0aPhytogenic feed additives 0aBroccoli extract 0aEssential oils 0aXenobiotic enzymes 0aAntioxidant system1 aBlum, Nicole M.1 aKluge, Holger1 aMueller, Andreas S.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Aug. 28, v. 108, no. 4 p.588-602dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145110058733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245008400198300001800282506007600300520181900376592002802195506003702223650001902260650003302279650001802312650002202330650001702352650002602369650001202395650001902407650002102426650001302447650002102460650001802481650001102499650001402510650002102524650001702545650003002562650003702592700002202629700001302651700002402664700002002688773008502708856007402793852000902867655001202876IND60082286320221207101014.0141017e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008228632DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.123282doi7 aPMC38316522pmcid7 a236595712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Zhimin10aHuman β‐defensin‐3 structure motifs that are important in CXCR4 antagonism  ap. 3365-3375.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPreviously, we reported that human β‐defensin (hBD)‐3 can both antagonize CXCR4 function on T cells and promote receptor internalization in the absence of activation. In the present study, we explored the important structural elements of hBD‐3 that are involved in blocking CXCR4 activation by its natural ligand, stromal‐derived factor 1α (SDF‐1α; CXCL12). Results from site‐directed mutagenesis studies suggest that the ability of hBD‐3 to inhibit SDF‐1α–CXCR4 interaction, as assayed either by blocking SDF‐1 binding to CXCR4 or antagonizing SDF‐1‐induced Ca²⁺ mobilization, is correlated with the presence of hBD‐3 cysteine residues, specific surface‐distributed cationic residues, and the electrostatic properties and availability of both hBD‐3 termini. Specifically, hBD‐3 activity against CXCR4 is reduced by: (a) replacing all six cysteines; (b) replacing the cationic residues with acidic ones in the N‐terminus and C‐ terminus; (c) removal of the first 10 N‐terminal residues; and (d) replacing the surface‐exposed basic residues Lys8, Lys32 and Arg36 with neutral ones. The hBD‐3–CXCR4 interaction has potentially wide‐ranging implications for HIV‐related biology, as well as for a host of CXCR4‐dependent activities, including hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, carcinogenesis, and immune cell trafficking. CXCR4 is highly expressed on T cells, monocytes, and epithelial cells. Therefore, understanding the structure–function relationship between hBD‐3 and CXCR4 that accounts for the antagonistic interaction between the two molecules may provide new insights into HIV/highly active antiretroviral therapy‐related pathology, as well as novel insights into the interaction between innate and adaptive immunity at mucosal sites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCXCR4 receptor 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3aangiogenesis 3aantiretroviral agents 3acalcium 3acarcinogenesis 3achemokine CXCL12 3acysteine 3aepithelial cells 3ahematopoiesis 3ahumans 3amonocytes 3amucosal immunity 3aneurogenesis 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3astructure-activity relationships1 aDubyak, George R.1 aJia, Xun1 aLubkowski, Jacek T.1 aWeinberg, Aaron0 tFEBS journal.g2013 July, v. 280, no. 14 p.3365-3375dBlackwellx1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.123283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012200153300001600275500002000291520135300311592002801664596008201692596004501774596004501819650001501864650001101879650001501890650001401905650001801919650000901937650000901946650001301955650001001968650001001978650001001988650001101998700002102009700002102030700006302051773012202114856007402236852000902310655001202319IND60787034720221118162412.0220807e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078703472DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.137932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yinan10aPotential roles of smell and taste in the orientation behaviour of coral‐reef fish larvae: insights from morphology  ap. 311-323.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn ontogenetic analysis of the olfactory organ and the number and distribution of internal taste buds was carried out in two neon gobies (Elacatinus lori and Elacatinus colini) with the goal of revealing morphological trends that might inform an understanding of the roles of olfaction and taste in larval orientation behaviour. The pattern of development of the olfactory organ is unremarkable and enclosure of the olfactory epithelium occurs concurrently with metamorphosis and settlement in both species. Like other gobies, juvenile and adult E. lori and E. colini lack complex olfactory lamellae, and lack the accessory nasal sacs present in some adult gobies that could facilitate active olfactory ventilation (i.e., sniffing). A small number of internal taste buds are present at hatch with most found in the caudal region of the buccal cavity (on gill arches, roof of buccal cavity). As taste bud number increases, they demonstrate an anterior spread to the lips, buccal valves and tongue (i.e., tissue covering the basihyal). In the absence of an active ventilatory mechanism for the olfactory organs, the water that moves through the buccal cavity with cyclic gill ventilation may provide chemical cues allowing the internal taste buds to play a role in chemical‐mediated orientation and reef‐seeking behavior in pelagic larval fishes.  aPublisher supplied data  a#IOS‐1501651cNational Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement  a#OCE1459546cNational Science Foundation  a#OCE1459224cNational Science Foundation 3aElacatinus 3aadults 3aepithelium 3ajuveniles 3ametamorphosis 3aneon 3anose 3aontogeny 3apalps 3asmell 3ataste 3atongue1 aMajoris, John E.1 aBuston, Peter M.1 aWebb, Jacqueline F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5017-36180 tJournal of fish biology.g2019 July, v. 95, no. 1 p.311-323dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.137933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245007100172300001400243520079200257592002801049650002201077650002001099650001201119650002201131650001001153650001501163650001401178650001301192651001001205653002001215653001001235653001601245653003201261653001701293653001101310700002601321773012201347856008001469852000901549655001201558IND60622430420221118082327.0181125e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062243042DNAL7 a10.1177/09730052145265022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Chandan Kumar10aIssues of Conservation and Livelihood in a Forest Village of Assam  ap. 47-68.  aThe creation of the forest villages in the northeast Indian state of Assam, like the rest of India, was a part of the colonial forest management policy. These villages were established within the limits of the reserved forests for assured supply of labour for the colonial forest department. Later on, many recognized forest villages came up with landless peasants migrating to the forest areas in search of land and livelihood. However, their growing population and demand for land coupled with the highhandedness of the forest department gave rise to intense conflict between the two. This conflict has assumed a much more complex character in the recent times giving rise to serious contestations and challenges with regard to people’s rights and conservation approach of the state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest management 3aforest reserves 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3alivelihood 3apeasantry 3avillages 3aIndia 0aForest villages 0aAssam 0aland rights 0aForest Right Act (FRA) 2006 0aconservation 0aNameri1 aŚarmā, Indrāṇī,0 tInternational journal of rural management.g, v. 10, no. 1 p.47-68dSAGE PublicationswJournal:21330x0973-06807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09730052145265023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008000171300001600251520115900267592002801426650001201454650001701466650001301483650001101496650001001507650002001517650001501537650001801552650001301570650001601583650001001599700001701609700001601626700001701642773007801659856008601737852000901823655001201832IND60084913120221120204804.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008491312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jiangfeng10aPerformance analysis of Isopropanol–Acetone–Hydrogen chemical heat pump  ap. 261-267.  aThe performance of an Isopropanol–Acetone–Hydrogen (IAH) chemical heat pump system is investigated in terms of enthalpy efficiency (COP) and exergy efficiency, in which the exothermic and endothermic reactions take place in the gas phase. The increase of reflux ratio, temperature of endothermic reaction and temperature of exothermic reaction reduces the performance of the heat pump when the other operating parameters remain unchanged. However, the performance of the IAH chemical heat pump improves with the increase of the ratio of molar quantity of hydrogen to that of acetone in the entry of exothermic reactor and the number of heat transfer units of regenerator. Generally, a better performance of the chemical heat pump corresponds to a larger number of trays in the distillation column. The performance of the system can be improved significantly after multi-parameter optimization design. The coefficient of performance (COP) pays more attention to the heat released from the exothermic reactor, while the exergy efficiency takes into consideration of both heat released from the exothermic reactor and temperature of exothermic reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3adistillation 3aenthalpy 3aexergy 3agases 3aheat production 3aheat pumps 3aheat transfer 3ahydrogen 3atemperature 3atrays1 aHuai, Xiulan1 aLi, Xunfeng1 aXu, Mingtian0 tApplied energy.g2012 May, v. 93 p.261-267dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245010900169300001800278520160600296592002801902650001601930650002301946650001101969650001101980650001901991650001902010650001202029650001502041650002302056650002202079650001202101650001502113650001302128650001302141700005802154700001902212700005502231700006002286700002102346700006002367700005902427773014602486856007602632852000902708655001202717IND60632397020190520000000.0190314e20190205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063239702DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b135932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarné-Sánchez, Arnau10aPostsynthetic Covalent and Coordination Functionalization of Rhodium(II)-Based Metal–Organic Polyhedra  ap. 4094-4102.  aMetal–organic polyhedra (MOP) are ultrasmall (typically 1–4 nm) porous coordination cages made from the self-assembly of metal ions and organic linkers and are amenable to the chemical functionalization of its periphery; however, it has been challenging to implement postsynthetic functionalization due to their chemical instability. Herein, we report the use of coordination chemistries and covalent chemistries to postsynthetically functionalize the external surface of ≈2.5 nm stable Rh(II)-based cuboctahedra through their Rh–Rh paddlewheel units or organic linkers, respectively. We demonstrate that 12 N-donor ligands, including amino acids, can be coordinated on the periphery of Rh-MOPs. We used this reactivity to introduce new functionalities (e.g., chirality) to the MOPs and to tune their hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics, which allowed us to modulate their solubility in diverse solvents such as dichloromethane and water. We also demonstrate that all 24 organic linkers can be postsynthetically functionalized with esters via covalent chemistry. In addition, we anticipate that these two types of postsynthetic reactions can be combined to yield doubly functionalized Rh-MOPs, in which a total of 36 new functional molecules can be incorporated on their surfaces. Likewise, these chemistries could be synergistically combined to enable covalent functionalization of MOPs through new linkages such as ethers. We believe that both reported postsynthetic pathways can potentially be used to engineer Rh-MOPs as scaffolds for applications in delivery, sorption, and catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acatalytic activity 3aesters 3aethers 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3ametal ions 3amethylene chloride 3aoptical isomerism 3arhodium 3asolubility 3asolvents 3asorption1 aAlbalad, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5850-67231 aGrancha, Thais1 aImaz, Inhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0278-11411 aJuanhuix, Judith1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3728-82151 aLarpent, Patrick1 aFurukawa, Shuhei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3849-80381 aMaspoch, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1325-91610 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 141, no. 9 p.4094-4102dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b135933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245004700169300001300216500001500229520125000244592002801494650001901522650001601541650002301557650001701580650001001597650001701607650001201624650001101636650001901647650001301666650002601679650002501705650001501730650001701745650001201762653001901774653001601793653001401809653001701823653002201840653001701862700002301879700001501902700006401917773009501981856008802076852000902164655001202173IND60540281320221120031449.0190318e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054028132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKruk, Jerzy10aPlastochromanol-8: Fifty years of research  ap. 9-16.  a2019-12-06  aPlastochromanol-8 (PC-8) is an antioxidant that, together with tocopherols and tocotrienols, belongs to the group of tocochromanols. Plastochromanol-8 has been found to occur in several plant species, including mosses, and lichens. PC-8 is found in seeds, leaves and other organs of higher plants. In leaves, PC-8 is restricted to chloroplasts. The identification of tocopherol cyclase (VTE1) as the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of PC-8 suggests that plastoglobules are the primary site of its biosynthesis. Other enzymes related with PC-8 biosynthesis in plastoglobules include: NDC1 and the ABC1-like kinase ABC1K3. The antioxidant properties of PC-8 are similar to those of other chloroplastic antioxidants in polar solvents but considerably they are enhanced in hydrophobic environments, suggesting that the unsaturated side chain performs some quenching activity. As a result of a non-enzymatic reaction, singlet oxygen can oxidize any of the 8 double bonds in the side chain of PC-8, giving at least eight hydroxy-PC-8 isomers. This review summarizes current evidence of a widespread distribution of PC-8 in photosynthetic organisms, as well as the contribution of PC-8 to the pool of lipid-soluble antioxidants in both leaves and seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3asinglet oxygen 3atocopherols 3atocopherol cyclase 3abiosynthesis 3aseeds 3atocotrienols 3aisomers 3aleaves 3ahydrophobicity 3asolvents 3amosses and liverworts 3aantioxidant activity 3aautotrophs 3achloroplasts 3alichens 0aTocochromanols 0aTocopherols 0aVitamin E 0aantioxidants 0aPlastochromanol-8 0aAntioxidants1 aSzymańska, Renata1 aCela, Jana1 aMunné-Bosch, Sergi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6523-68480 tPhytochemistry.g2014 Dec., v. 108 p.9-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245012400202300002000326520165100346592002801997650001302025650000802038650001602046650001002062650001902072650001302091650001702104653001602121653001402137653001302151653001402164653001002178700002102188773014202209856007802351852000902429655001202438IND60608711720221121021027.0180808e20180716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060871172DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b066862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKizilkan, Emre1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7666-834710aBioinspired Further Enhanced Dry Adhesive by the Combined Effect of the Microstructure and Surface Free-Energy Increase  ap. 26752-26758.  aSilicone elastomers are known for having low surface free energies generally leading to poor adhesive performances. This surface characteristic can be enhanced by plasma treatments. The microstructured silicone elastomer surfaces can demonstrate superior adhesive performance that is more than 10 times higher in terms of pull-off forces, compared to their unstructured counterpart. Here, we have demonstrated that the combination of these two methods further enhances adhesive performance, especially when the surfaces are biomimetic micro/nanopatterned with, e.g., beetle-inspired mushroom-shaped adhesive microstructure (MSAMS). The plasma treatment time and pressure parameters were varied for the unstructured and MSAMS poly(vinylsiloxane) surfaces to find optimum parameters for maximum adhesion performance. Air plasma treatment induced average adhesive enhancement forces up to 30% on the unstructured surface, but the MSAMS surface demonstrated an enhancement of adhesive forces up to 91% higher than that of an untreated, microstructured control, despite the plasma-treated surface area of the structured surface being only 50% of that of the unstructured surface. High-speed video-recordings of individual microstructures in contact with a glass surface shows that the origin of the adhesion enhancement is due to the special detachment mechanism of individual microstructures that allows sustaining a wider contact area at detachment. We believe that this integration of the plasma treatment with MSAMS suggests a versatile way of functionalization that can further advance the adhesive ability of low-surface-energy polymer surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aair 3abiomimetics 3aglass 3amicrostructure 3asilicone 3asurface area 0abiomimetics 0aadhesives 0apolymers 0asilicones 0agecko1 aGorb, Stanislav,0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 July 16, v. 10, no. 31 p.26752-26758dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b066863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03989naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100002400195245014300219300001400362506007600376506003100452520199100483592002802474596006002502596009202562506003702654650002602691650001302717650001102730650001802741650001502759650002302774650000902797650001302806650001502819650001602834650001502850650002002865650001502885651001102900653002702911653001702938653003202955653001502987653003703002700002803039700002203067700002103089700002703110773010503137856008703242856004503329961001603374852000903390655001203399IND60639249120221215142402.0190530e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063924912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.0382chorus7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeBruler, Daniel G.10aSoil phosphorus fractions vary with harvest intensity and vegetation control at two contrasting Douglas-fir sites in the Pacific northwest  ap. 73-83.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aEffects of intensive forest management on soil phosphorus (P) are unclear and may impact long-term site productivity. We assessed changes in P availability over 10 years associated with harvest intensity (bole-only vs. whole-tree harvest) and vegetation control treatments (initial vegetation control (IVC) vs. five years of annual vegetation control (AVC)) using a P fractionation procedure. Fractions were characterized at 0–15, 15–30, and 30–60 cm soil depths in two coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) plantations with strongly contrasting soil properties near Matlock, WA (young soils formed in glacial outwash) and Molalla, OR (relatively old soils formed in igneous residuum and exhibiting andic properties). Al and Fe concentrations associated with short-range order minerals were greater at Molalla than Matlock and generally decreased with depth at both sites. We observed decreases in most total-P and P-fraction concentrations across the three soil depths at the Molalla site. Effects were less pronounced and generally inconsistent at the Matlock site. Decreases in total P and P fraction concentrations were greatest in the AVC treatments at Matlock, but opposite trends were observed at Molalla where decreases were greatest with IVC. There was no difference between harvest treatments on the change in P fractions in most instances, with the exception of the 30–60 cm depth at Matlock where concentrations of some P fractions were maintained or increased with bole-only harvesting. Ten-year responses indicate harvest intensity has limited effects on long-term productivity associated with soil P because of the large size of the soil P pools and the relatively small changes in soil P that occurred with treatment. Decreases in P concentrations with AVC at Matlock and IVC at Molalla were larger than the other treatments and highlight the important role of vegetation in P dynamics following harvesting at these sites.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006959  cVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000072630 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aaluminum 3acoasts 3afractionation 3aharvesting 3aintensive forestry 3airon 3aminerals 3aphosphorus 3aplantations 3asoil depth 3asoil properties 3avegetation 3aOregon 0aSite-specific response 0aScotch broom 0aLong-term soil productivity 0aPhosphorus 0aSelective dissolution extraction1 aSchoenholtz, Stephen H.1 aSlesak, Robert A.1 aStrahm, Brian D.1 aHarrington, Timothy B.0 tGeoderma.g2019  15, v. 350 p.73-83dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.0383Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/6392491  aUSDA/FSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010400172300001800276500001500294520130900309592002801618650001401646650001501660650001801675650001601693650001101709650002001720650001401740650002101754650002801775650002301803650001501826650001401841650003001855653001801885700002401903700002101927700001701948700002301965700001801988700002202006773009302028856008402121852000902205655001202214IND60122317920221116205007.0150325e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012231792DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2014.9517322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaggioni, Daniele10aMyricetin and Naringenin Inhibit Human Squamous Cell Carcinoma Proliferation and Migration In Vitro  ap. 1257-1267.  a2019-12-04  aIn this study the potential anticancer effect of 2 flavonoids, myiricetin (MYR) and naringenin (NAR) has been evaluated on an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line, SCC-25, and HaCaT cells. Both the flavonoids inhibited SCC-25 cell growth, although NAR selectively affected cancer cells without impairing HaCaT cell growth. The cell proliferation inhibition by MYR and NAR was not related to apoptosis induction, but on cell cycle impairment, because a G ₀/G ₁ and a G ₂/M blockage was highlighted following 24 h of treatment in SCC-25 and HaCaT cells, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that MYR induced a decrease of Cyclin D ₁ in SCC-25 and of Cyclin B ₁ in HaCaT cells, while NAR negatively modulated Cyclin D ₁ expression in SCC-25 cells. Wound-healing and cell invasion assays demonstrated that both the flavonoids were able to reduce motility on both SCC-25 and HaCaT cells. In conclusion the results of the present study show the anticancer potential of NAR and MYR on OSCC because they exert cytostatic effect by the impairment of cell cycle progression. Moreover both the flavonoids inhibit cell migration, thus highlighting their potential effect as antimetastatic agents. Therefore, MYR and NAR appear as promising candidate as oral cancer chemopreventive agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3amyricetin 3anaringenin 3acell movement 3acell growth 3ahumans 3achemoprevention 3anutrition 3aWestern blotting 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3acell proliferation 3acell cycle 3aapoptosis 3aanticarcinogenic activity 0acell invasion1 aNicolini, Gabriella1 aRigolio, Roberta1 aBiffi, Luisa1 aPignataro, Lorenzo1 aGaini, Renato1 aGaravello, Werner0 tNutrition and cancer.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 66, no. 7 p.1257-1267dRoutledgex1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2014.9517323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245007300170300001500243520095500258592002801213650001101241650002001252650002501272650001501297650001901312650001201331650003401343650001301377650002501390650001001415651001001425653002701435653002401462653002101486653001601507773012301523856008001646852000901726655001201735IND60622430720221118082434.0181125e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062243072DNAL7 a10.1177/09730052145465932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShankar, S.

In this regard, an alternative to supplement or compliment government’s work is necessary to improve tribal livelihoods. Non-government organizations (NGOs) which gained importance since seventh five-year plan were taking efforts for linking tribals to markets. Dhruva is one such NGO established in Gujarat state.

In this work, HCCI combustion mode, by using ethanol as fuel, is analysed in order to clarify the role of specific technical solutions, such as power boosting, downsizing, swirl motion, and of the thermo-physical properties of ethanol on emissions and performance of the engine. A multidimensional numerical approach, coupled with a kinetic reaction mechanism for ethanol oxidation and NOₓ formation, is proposed and validated against experimental measurements. Specifically, CO emissions assessment is a major issue of this work, as this pollutant is strictly related to inhomogeneities in the combustion chamber near the walls and a multidimensional approach with an adequate grid resolution is mandatory for a correct simulation. CO, CO₂, UHC and NOₓ emissions, specific fuel consumption, heat release rate and in-cylinder pressure are evaluated in order to give recommendations on the most suitable technological solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3aethanol 3aethanol fuels 3aheat 3apetroleum 3apollutants1 aMagi, Vinicio0 tApplied energy.g2012 May, v. 93 p.277-287dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01271naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245013900154300001600293520032300309592002800632650002300660650002300683650002000706650001500726650001800741700002000759773012100779856007200900852000900972655001200981IND60662257520221119052056.0190904e20060801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066225752DNAL7 a10.1039/b604801c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Wen-Hua13aAn efficient and practical synthesis of chiral imidazolium ionic liquids and their application in an enantioselective Michael reaction  ap. 731-734.  aWe have developed a practical and efficient synthesis of chiral imidazolium ionic liquids by only two or three steps from cheap N-methylimidazole with 67-81% overall yields.

In general, soil scientists can: i) collect new data in the field and ignore the data that are available, ii) rely entirely on legacy soil data or iii) combine available legacy data with new data collection. This study aims to analyse and discuss the choices soil scientists make to balance between the use of legacy soil data and the collection of new soil data. A literature review on soil data acquisition was carried out and illustrated that the use of legacy soil data is still often very limited, while soil data availability increased over recent decades. Studies that use legacy soil data often use conventional soil data, which are criticised in literature. A regional and local case study was carried out to illustrate the choices that have to be made for obtaining the required soil data. It turned out that both case studies preferred to combine new soil data collection and legacy soil data. Many of the reviewed studies could reduce their sampling effort by making better use of available data, tools and techniques. Besides, soil scientists can help facilitating soil data acquisition by developing soil data warehouses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adatabases 3asampling 3ascientists 3asoil 0aConventional soil map 0aSampling effort 0aScale level 0aSoil data acquisition 0aSoil data warehouses 0aSoil survey1 aStoorvogel, J.J.1 aLutz, F.1 aClaessens, L.0 tGeoderma.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 348 p.181-188dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011100170300001600281520170900297592002802006650001602034650001402050650001102064650001102075650002102086650001202107650002302119650001802142650002902160650001902189650001802208773007802226856008602304852000902390655001202399IND60084913420221120204612.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008491342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcManus, M.C.10aEnvironmental consequences of the use of batteries in low carbon systems: The impact of battery production  ap. 288-295.  aAdoption of small scale micro-generation is sometimes coupled with the use of batteries in order to overcome daily variability in the supply and demand of energy. For example, photovoltaic cells and small wind turbines can be coupled with energy storage systems such as batteries. When used effectively with renewable energy production, batteries can increase the versatility of an energy system by providing energy storage that enables the systems to satisfy the highly variable electrical load of an individual dwelling, therefore changing usage patterns on the national grid. A significant shift towards electric or hybrid cars would also increase the number of batteries required. However, batteries can be inefficient and comprise of materials that have high environmental and energy impacts. In addition, some materials, such as lithium, are scarce natural resources. As a result, the overall impact of increasing our reliance on such “sustainable or “low carbon” systems may in fact have an additional detrimental impact. This paper reviews the currently available data and calculated and highlights the impact of the production of several types of battery in terms of energy, raw materials and greenhouse gases. The impact of the production of batteries is examined and presented in order that future studies may be able to include the impact of batteries more easily within any system. It is shown that lithium based batteries have the most significant impact in many environmental areas in terms of production. As the use phases of batteries are extremely variable within different situations this has not been included here, instead providing comprehensive data for the production stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3abatteries 3acarbon 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gases 3alithium 3aphotovoltaic cells 3araw materials 3arenewable energy sources 3asupply balance 3awind turbines0 tApplied energy.g2012 May, v. 93 p.288-295dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245010900185300001800294520111600312592002801428650001801456650002701474650002601501650001301527650001801540650001501558650001101573650001601584650001301600650002201613650001401635650001101649650001701660700001601677700001501693700001801708700001401726700001701740773011601757856008101873852000901954655001201963IND60080009120221123013915.0150216e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008000912DNAL7 a248285812pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-014-0948-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qingling10aGenome Shuffling and Ribosome Engineering of Streptomyces actuosus for High-Yield Nosiheptide Production  ap. 1553-1563.  aNosiheptide is one of the EU-approved sulfur-containing peptides in feed industry to inhibit the growth of the majority of Gram-positive bacteria. The main purpose of this study is directed to breed the high nosiheptide-producers by genome shuffling and ribosome engineering in Streptomyces actuosus AW7. The starting population for shuffling was generated by combining⁶⁰Coγ-irradiation with LiCl mutagenesis treatments on the spores. After four rounds of protoplast fusion exposed to streptomycin as adaptive pressure, a high-yield recombinant strain D92 was obtained. In a 10-L fermenter, nosiheptide production reached 1.54 g/L which was 9.20-fold compared to that of the parental strain. Hyphae development, metabolic process, and ribosomal protein S12 sequence were investigated to characterize the differentiation among the recombinants. Several mutations in S12 were believed to be responsible to streptomycin resistance in the tested strain. The results demonstrated that the combination of genome shuffling and ribosome engineering is an efficient approach to breed high-yield industrial strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA shuffling 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStreptomyces actuosus 3abreeding 3afeed industry 3afermenters 3ahyphae 3amutagenesis 3apeptides 3aprotoplast fusion 3aribosomes 3aspores 3astreptomycin1 aZhang, Dong1 aLi, Yudong1 aZhang, Fuming1 aWang, Cao1 aLiang, Xinle0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2014 July, v. 173, no. 6 p.1553-1563dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-014-0948-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012000170300001600290520139700306592002801703650002101731650002001752650001301772650001501785650001201800650001601812650001401828650001601842650001401858650001701872650001501889651001201904700002201916773008001938856008602018852000902104655001202113IND60085054920221120100029.0141101e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008505492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadhi, Hassan10aQuantifying the domestic electricity consumption for air-conditioning due to urban heat islands in hot arid regions  ap. 371-380.  aAuthoritative reports show that building electricity consumption can increase steadily once temperature values within urban regions exceed their rural values. This study first assesses the role of higher temperatures in the variation of Bahrain’s domestic electricity consumption for air-conditioning, using the cooling degree days (CDD) as a quantitative index. It then examines how this consumption is affected by urban features. The assessment is performed using established scenarios of the urban heat island (UHI), advanced statistics of building stock and data for electricity consumption. Simple regression equations are developed to predict the effects of temperature alterations on the electricity consumption. This work shows that the variation in CDD is a direct result of modifications to the urban microclimate. The annual total urban CDD value is up to 17% higher than the rural CDD value. A sharp increase of up to 10% in electricity consumption for air-conditioning occurs in urban regions from April to October. Estimates of the electricity demand for dense urban centres that are based on air temperature values measured in open areas, such as airports, can cause an error of almost 6%. The developed statistical equations can be a valuable and convenient method of quantifying the domestic electricity consumption for air-conditioning in Bahrain and other Gulf countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aair temperature 3aairports 3aarid zones 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aequations 3aheat island 3aheat sums 3amicroclimate 3astatistics 3aBahrain1 aSharples, Stephen0 tApplied energy.g2013 Dec., v. 112 p.371-380dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245004300163300001800206520084900224592002801073650002401101650001301125650002801138650003001166650001401196650001401210650001301224650001401237650002001251650001101271700002401282700002201306700001501328700005901343700005801402773014601460856007601606852000901682655001201691IND60632397320190520000000.0190314e20190208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063239732DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b136452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrebs, Kilian M.10aPhosphine-Stabilized Digermavinylidene  ap. 3424-3429.  aAn intramolecular germylene-phosphine Lewis pair (1) was reacted with germanium dichloride to give in 92% yield a phosphine adduct of a chloro substituted germyl-germylene (2).

Seven team sport athletes (maximal oxygen uptake, 47.6 ± 4.2 mL·kg–¹·min–¹) completed a 60-min simulated team sport match before and after either 4 days of HIGH or LOW training loads. Venous blood samples were taken pre-match, immediately post-match, and 2 h post-match for interlukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, xanthine oxidase (XO), and hypoxanthine. Following HIGH training load, sprint velocity decreased (p < 0.001) and total distance covered was reduced (HIGH 5495 ± 670 m, LOW 5608 ± 674 m, p = 0.02) was observed during the simulated match protocol compared with the LOW match simulation. Decreased performance capacity was accompanied by a significant increase in serum CK concentration (HIGH 290 ± 62 U·L–¹, LOW 199 ± 33 U·L–¹, p = 0.005). The HIGH training also resulted in a decreased post-match hypoxanthine and MCP-1 and an increase in XO concentration 2 h post-match. Four days of increased training load reduced running performance during the match simulation and altered the metabolic and inflammatory response to high-intensity intermittent exercise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aanaerobiosis 3aathletes 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3achemokine CCL2 3acreatine kinase 3aexercise 3ahypoxanthine 3ainflammation 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amuscles 3anutrition 3aoxygen 3asports 3axanthine oxidase 0ahypoxanthine 0axanthine oxidase 0afatigue 0amuscle damage 0ainterlukin-6 0amonocyte chemoattractant protein-11 aWallace, Lee Kenneth1 aBentley, David John1 aCoutts, Aaron James0 tApplied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.g2012 Mar. 27, v. 37, no. 2 p.315-322dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/h2012-0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011600156300002000272520144900292592002801741650002501769650002101794650002101815650002001836650002601856650002601882650002901908650001201937650001101949650001401960650001801974650001901992650001502011650001202026650002802038650002302066650001702089650001402106650001702120650002702137650001702164650002202181650002102203700001602224700001402240700002002254700001402274700001402288700001502302700001502317700001402332773012502346856007402471852000902545655001202554IND60669310620221119145632.0190920e20151013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066931062DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra16583k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShemesh, R.10aNovel LDPE/halloysite nanotube films with sustained carvacrol release for broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity  ap. 87108-87117.  aThe emergence of antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria has led to renewed interest in exploring the potential of plant-derived antimicrobials e.g., essential oils (EOs), as an alternative strategy to reduce microbial contamination. However, the volatile nature of EOs presents a major challenge in their incorporation into polymers by conventional high-temperature processing techniques. Herein, we employ halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) as efficient nano-carriers for carvacrol (a model EO). This pre-compounding encapsulation step imparts enhanced thermal stability to the carvacrol, allowing for its subsequent melt compounding with low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The resulting polymer nanocomposites exhibit outstanding antimicrobial properties with a broad spectrum of inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua in biofilms, and Alternaria alternata. Their antimicrobial effectiveness is also successfully demonstrated in complex model food systems (soft cheese and bread). This superior activity, compared to other studied carvacrol containing films, is induced by the significantly higher carvacrol content in the film as well as its slower out-diffusion from the hybrid system. Thus, these new active polymer nanocomposites presents an immense potential in controlling microbial contamination and biofilm related adverse effects, rendering them as excellent candidate materials for a wide range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria innocua 3aadverse effects 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3abreads 3acarvacrol 3aencapsulation 3aessential oils 3ahalloysite 3amelting 3amicrobial contamination 3amodel food systems 3ananocarriers 3ananotubes 3apolyethylene 3apolymer nanocomposites 3asoft cheeses 3athermal stability 3avirulent strains1 aKrepker, M.1 aNatan, M.1 aDanin-Poleg, Y.1 aBanin, E.1 aKashi, Y.1 aNitzan, N.1 aVaxman, A.1 aSegal, E.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 13, v. 5, no. 106 p.87108-87117dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra16583k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014800161300001600309520182900325592002802154650001402182650002502196650002202221650002002243650002502263650001802288650001702306650001802323650001702341650001302358650001802371650002202389651001002411700001502421700001402436700001702450773010502467856008102572852000902653655001202662IND50073137920221119063212.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007313792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-013-0795-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yi10aLitter decomposition reduces either N2O or NO production in strongly acidic coniferous and broad-leaved forest soils under anaerobic conditions  ap. 549-557.  aPURPOSE: The beneficial effect to the environment of nitrate (NO₃⁻) removal by denitrification depends on the partitioning of its end products into nitrous oxide (N₂O), nitric oxide (NO), and dinitrogen (N₂). However, in subtropical China, acidic forest mineral soils are characterized by negligible denitrification capacity and thus reactive forms of N could not be effectively converted to inert N₂, resulting in a negative environmental consequence. In this study, the influences of C input from litter decomposition on denitrification rate and its gaseous products under anoxic conditions in the acidic coniferous and broad-leaved forest soils in subtropical China were investigated using the acetylene (C₂H₂) blockage technique in the laboratory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The coniferous and broad-leaved forest soils with and without litter addition were incubated under anaerobic conditions for 244 h. There were three treatments for each forest soil including addition of 0.5 and 1% corresponding litter (gram of litter per gram of soil) and the control without addition of litter. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results showed that litter addition into the broad-leaved forest soil had no effect on average rates of denitrification (calculated as the sum of NO, N₂O, and N₂), whereas in the coniferous forest soil, the addition resulted in a significant increase in average denitrification rate. In the broad-leaved forest soil, both rates of litter addition decreased the production of NO but increased the production of N₂, and high rates of litter addition into the coniferous forest soil promoted the reduction of N₂O to N₂. CONCLUSIONS: Increased decomposition of litter in the forest soils could effectively reduce N₂O and NO production through denitrification under anaerobic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aanaerobic conditions 3adeciduous forests 3adenitrification 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest litter 3aforest soils 3amineral soils 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3asubtropical soils 3aChina1 aWang, Jing1 aLiu, Yang1 aCai, Zu-Cong0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2014 Mar., v. 14, no. 3 p.549-557dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-013-0795-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245009200165300001600257520177400273592002802047650001302075650001602088650002102104650001102125650001602136650001102152651001002163700001602173700001802189700001702207773007802224856008602302852000902388655001202397IND60084913620221120204753.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008491362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jin10aQuantitative assessment of bioenergy from crop stalk resources in Inner Mongolia, China  ap. 305-318.  aInner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) is one of China’s strategic energy bases for the 21st century. While bioenergy in IMAR may play an important role in securing future energy supply, little research has been done so far, particularly for crop stalk resources as a potential source of bioenergy in this region. In this study we systematically analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of crop stalk resources, evaluated the bioenergy potential of crop stalk resources, and explored possible pathways of developing stalk-based energy strategies in Inner Mongolia. Our results show that the total crop stalk yield in IMAR increased consistently from 1980 to 2008, with an average annual increase of 16.3%. Between 2004 and 2008, 26.14million tons of crop stalks were produced each year in IMAR, 8.82million tons of which could be used for biofuel production. Grain crops contributed most to the total amount of stalks for energy production, of which corn stalks were the largest contributor, accounting for 62% of the total crop stalk yield. Based on the current trend, crop stalk yields may continue to increase in the future. Geographically, the abundance of biofuelable crop stalk resources, either on a per capita or per unit of area basis, had a spatial pattern of “high on East and West and low in the middle”. Our findings suggest that IMAR has the potential for developing stalk-based bioenergy to improve its current overwhelmingly coal-dominated energy structure. However, more detailed and comprehensive studies are needed to figure out how exactly such bioenergy development should be carried out in a way that would promote the regional sustainability of Inner Mongolia – i.e., simultaneously providing social, economic, and ecological benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acorn stover 3acropping systems 3aenergy 3agrain crops 3ayields 3aChina1 aWu, Jianguo1 aLiu, Fengqiao1 aHan, Xingguo0 tApplied energy.g2012 May, v. 93 p.305-318dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001400171245011100185300001600296520095300312592002801265650001501293650001501308650001701323650001701340650001501357650002901372650002501401650001501426650002501441650002801466650004401494650002201538650004501560650002201605653001701627653002301644653001701667653001701684653001501701700001401716700001701730700001501747700001901762700001301781700001701794773010601811856008701917852000902004655001202013IND50069542620221121234606.0200405e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006954262DNAL7 a239992672pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.08.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhen10aRemoval of heavy metals from aqueous solution by lipopeptides and lipopeptides modified Na-montmorillonite  ap. 378-386.  aThe removal of Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺, Cd²⁺, Pb²⁺ and Hg²⁺ from aqueous solution by lipopeptides produced from solid-state fermentation (LPSSF) and LPSSF modified Na-montmorillonite clays (LPSSF/Na-MMT) was investigated. The results showed that the LPSSF had certain adsorption capability for the metal ions and the modification of Na-MMT with LPSSF at a weight ratio of 1:50 (LPSSF:Na-MMT) had the best adsorption capacity and adsorption rate. The adsorption of heavy metal ion on these adsorbents was monolayer sorption. And the rate limiting step of the adsorption process was thought as chemical sorption. The N–C–O and CC/CN groups of the LPSSF are the functional groups that were responsible for complexing the metal ions. The desorption rate of metal ions reached over 80% at 500mg/L of LPSSF. The LPSSF/Na-MMT (1:50) was reusable and performed well in the complex system, indicating its potential application in wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3aheavy metals 3alipopeptides 3ametal ions 3asolid state fermentation 3awastewater treatment 2aAdsorption 2aBentonitexchemistry 2aLipopeptidesxchemistry 2aMetals, Heavyxisolation & purification 2aSodiumxchemistry 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aX-Ray Diffraction 0aHeavy metals 0aNa-montmorillonite 0aLipopeptides 0aModification 0aAdsorption1 aGao, Chao1 aWu, Yanliang1 aSun, Lifei1 aHuang, Xiaolei1 aRan, Wei1 aShen, Qirong0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Nov., v. 147 p.378-386dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.08.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245016100159300001800320520104800338592002801386650002201414650001901436650002001455650001401475650001501489650001401504650001201518650001901530650002201549650001601571700001701587700001601604700001601620700001401636700001801650700001901668700001901687700001601706700001801722700005601740700005401796700001701850773014701867856007602014852000902090655001202099IND60632397420221122235209.0190314e20190222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063239742DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b136732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Qiutong10aConvincing Synthesis of Atomically Thin, Single-Crystalline InVO₄ Sheets toward Promoting Highly Selective and Efficient Solar Conversion of CO₂ into CO  ap. 4209-4213.  aAtomically thin, single-crystalline InVO₄ sheets with the uniform thickness of ∼1.5 nm were convincingly synthesized, which was identified with strong, low-angle X-ray diffraction peaks. The InVO₄ atomic layer corresponding to 3 unit cells along [110] orientation exhibits highly selective and efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO₂ into CO in the presence of water vapor. Surface potential change measurement and liquid photoluminescence decay spectra confirm that the atomically ultrathin structure can shorten the transfer distance of charge carriers from the interior onto the surface and decrease the recombination in body. It thus allows more electrons to survive and accumulate on the surface, which is beneficial for activation and reduction of CO₂. In addition, exclusively exposed {110} facet of the InVO₄ atomic layer was found to bind the generating CO weakly, facilitating quick desorption from the catalyst surface to form free CO molecules, which provides an ideal platform to catalytically selective CO product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3adesorption 3aelectrons 3aliquids 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3awater vapor1 aBai, Xiaowan1 aMan, Zaiqin1 aHe, Huichao1 aLi, Liang1 aHu, Jianqiang1 aAlsaedi, Ahmed1 aHayat, Tasawar1 aYu, Zhentao1 aZhang, Weihua1 aWang, Jinlan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4529-874X1 aZhou, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9480-25861 aZou, Zhigang0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Feb. 22, v. 141, no. 10 p.4209-4213dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b136733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245013000160300002000290520089700310592002801207650001101235650000901246650002101255650001701276650001101293650002201304650001201326650001601338650002201354653003101376653001601407653001401423653001301437653001801450700002301468700002201491700002201513700002301535700001701558700002101575700001901596700006101615700006201676700005401738773014201792856007801934852000902012655001202021IND60608712020180906000000.0180808e20180711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060871202DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b068972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jiajia10aLight-Induced Interfacial Dynamics Dramatically Improve the Photocurrent in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells: An Electrolyte Effect  ap. 26241-26247.  aA significant increase in the photocurrent generation during light soaking for solar cells sensitized by the triphenylamine-based D−π–A organic dyes (PD2 and LEG1) and mediated by cobalt bipyridine redox complexes has been observed and investigated. The crucial role of the electrolyte has been identified in the performance improvement. Control experiments based on a pre-treatment strategy reveals TBP as the origin. The increase in the current and IPCE has been interpreted by the interfacial charge-transfer kinetics studies. A slow component in the injection kinetics was exposed for this system. This change explains the increase in the electron lifetime and collection efficiency. Photoelectron spectroscopic measurements show energy shifts at the dye/TiO₂ interface, leading us to formulate a hypothesis with respect to an electrolyte-induced dye reorganization at the surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3adyes 3aelectric current 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3amaterials science 3asoaking 3asolar cells 3aspectral analysis 0adye-sensitized solar cells 0aelectrolyte 0ainterface 0adynamics 0alight soaking1 aEl-Zohry, Ahmed M.1 aTrilaksana, Herri1 aGabrielsson, Erik1 aLeandri, Valentina1 aEllis, Hanna1 aD’Amario, Luca1 aSafdari, Majid1 aGardner, James M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4782-49691 aAndersson, Gunther1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5742-30371 aKloo, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0168-29420 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 July 11, v. 10, no. 31 p.26241-26247dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b068973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04023naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013000171300001400301520221400315592002802529650001902557650001602576650001302592650002502605650002602630650002002656650002402676650002402700650000902724650002002733650001002753650004202763650002302805650001302828650002502841650001502866650001502881650003002896650001802926650001202944650001202956650000902968653002502977653002003002653001703022653003803039653003103077700001503108700002003123700002203143700001803165700001903183700001603202773009503218856008703313852000903400655001203409IND60639249520221120034259.0190523e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063924952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaodong10aSoil alkaline phosphatase activity and bacterial phoD gene abundance and diversity under long-term nitrogen and manure inputs  ap. 36-44.  aThe impact of long-term inputs of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer and swine manure on soil alkaline phosphatase activity is important for phosphorus (P) availability, although its associated gene abundance and diversity within the soil bacterial community are poorly understood. Topsoil (0–10 cm) samples were taken from triplicate field plots that had been maintained under continuous maize (Zea mays) cropping for 28 years with either no nutrient inputs (control), annual inputs of mineral N (urea), swine manure, or combined mineral N-swine manure. Potential alkaline phosphatase activity was determined, together with phoD gene abundance and diversity that using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that potential alkaline phosphatase activity and phoD gene abundance were markedly lower in soil from the mineral N treatment compared with the control. On the other hand, long-term swine manure inputs, with and without mineral N, decreased potential alkaline phosphatase activity and phoD gene abundance compared with the control, although concentrations of plant-available P were higher in manure-amended soils. Distinct separation of phoD gene bacterial communities were associated to each fertilization regime, while less pronounced separation was observed between control and mineral N-swine manure treatments. Furthermore, long-term mineral N and swine manure inputs altered the phoD gene community composition. The relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium was higher in mineral N than control soils, and Pseudomonas was less abundant in swine manure than control soils. Our results indicated that long-term application of mineral N in the absence of P inputs significantly reduced potential alkaline phosphatase activity, abundance and community diversity of phoD gene was attributed to a combination of factors, including a 10-fold increase in soil acidity, decreased soil microbial activity, and the apparent inherent stability of organic P in this soil. The findings of this study demonstrated that long-term mineral N inputs adversely impacted the dynamics and bioavailability of P in soil maintained under continuous cropping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium 3aPseudomonas 3aZea mays 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abacterial communities 3abioavailability 3acommunity structure 3acontinuous cropping 3acorn 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobial activity 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3apig manure 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoil bacteria 3asoil pH 3atopsoil 3aurea 0aAlkaline phosphatase 0aUrea fertilizer 0aSwine manure 0aphoD gene abundance and diversity 0aHigh-throughput sequencing1 aJiang, Nan1 aCondron, Leo M.1 aDunfield, Kari E.1 aChen, Zhenhua1 aWang, Jingkuan1 aChen, Lijun0 tGeoderma.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 349 p.36-44dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245007800174300001400252520122500266592002801491650002001519650001501539650001501554650002701569650002201596650002201618650001301640650001601653650001901669650002401688650002101712650002101733650001301754653000801767653000901775653000801784653000801792653000901800653000801809653000901817653000801826653000801834653000901842653000801851653000801859653000701867653001801874653001301892653002501905653001401930653001601944653002201960653002101982653001802003653002002021653002202041653004702063653002802110653002902138700006202167773009602229856008802325852000902413655001202422IND60540281820221120030433.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054028182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKärkönen, Anna10aReactive oxygen species in cell wall metabolism and development in plants  ap. 22-32.  aAlthough reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly toxic substances that are produced during aerobic respiration and photosynthesis, many studies have demonstrated that ROS, such as superoxide anion radical (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are produced in the plant cell wall in a highly regulated manner. These molecules are important signalling messengers playing key roles in controlling a broad range of physiological processes, such as cellular growth and development, as well as adaptation to environmental changes. Given the toxicity of ROS, especially of hydroxyl radical (OH), the enzymatic ROS production needs to be tightly regulated both spatially and temporally. Respiratory burst oxidase homologues (Rboh) have been identified as ROS-producing NADPH oxidases, which act as key signalling nodes integrating multiple signal transduction pathways in plants. Also other enzyme systems, such as class III peroxidases, amine oxidases, quinone reductases and oxalate oxidases contribute to apoplastic ROS production, some especially in certain plant taxa. Here we discuss the interrelationship among different enzymes producing ROS in the plant cell wall, as well as the physiological roles of the ROS produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aaerobiosis 3acell walls 3agrowth and development 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aoxalates 3aperoxidases 3aphotosynthesis 3asignal transduction 3asuperoxide anion 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aDPI 0aCuAO 0aGLP 0aKCN 0aMAMP 0aNox 0aPAMP 0aPAO 0aPCD 0aRboh 0aROS 0aSOD 0aTE 0aAmine oxidase 0aApoplast 0aClass III peroxidase 0aCell wall 0aDevelopment 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aHydroxyl radical 0aNADPH oxidase 0aOxalate oxidase 0aQuinone reductase 0aRboh (respiratory burst oxidase homologue) 0aReactive oxygen species 0aSuperoxide anion radical1 aKuchitsu, Kazuyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8854-03750 tPhytochemistry.g2015 Apr., v. 112 p.22-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015100154300002000305520130200325592002801627650002201655650003701677650001501714650001401729650002201743650001201765650001801777650001201795650000901807650001201816650002001828650001901848650001301867650001801880650003301898650001701931650001201948700001501960700001901975700001801994700001402012700001402026773012502040856007402165852000902239655001202248IND60669310820221119145654.0190920e20151016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066931082DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra16589j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Chao10aSelf-template synthesis of hierarchical magnetic porous carbon fibers derived from Fe(BTC)-coated bamboo fibers for fast removal of methylene blue  ap. 87616-87625.  aHierarchical magnetic porous carbon fibers (MBFs) were fabricated by annealing Fe(BTC)-coated bamboo fibers, which were produced using a new synthesis route for growing Fe(BTC) on bamboo fiber materials, in a nitrogen atmosphere. The materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area measurement, and vibrating sample magnetometry. The obtained MBF composites possess both high surface areas and magnetic characteristics. Their adsorption properties were preliminarily tested by the adsorptive removal of methylene blue from aqueous solution. Results demonstrated that the obtained hybrid materials possess high adsorption capacity and can be easily recycled from liquid media by using an external magnetic field. MBF adsorption reached equilibrium within approximately 1 min and the adsorption capacity rapidly reached 143 mg g⁻¹. Most importantly, MBF can be reused after washing with ethanol. After six reuses, the removal efficiency could still reach 80%. Moreover, the low-cost raw material used (i.e., bamboo) is abundant and renewable. This study indicated that the as-prepared MBF composites show great potential for use in a wide range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aannealing 3aaqueous solutions 3abamboos 3acarbon fibers 3aethanol 3airon 3aliquids 3amagnetic fields 3amethylene blue 3anitrogen 3araw materials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3awashing1 aMa, Junjun1 aZhou, Lincheng1 aShao, Yanming1 aWu, Qiong1 aWang, Fei0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 16, v. 5, no. 106 p.87616-87625dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra16589j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245018200170300001800352500001500370520140200385592002801787650003301815650001501848650001501863650002201878650002101900650001901921650001001940650002501950650001201975650002601987650001502013650001602028653001802044700002602062700002302088700002602111700002102137773008602158856007402244852000902318655001202327IND60082287220221118035536.0141017e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008228722DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.128942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNascimento, Alessandro S.10aInsights into the structure and function of fungal β‐mannosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 2 based on multiple crystal structures of the Trichoderma harzianum enzyme  ap. 4165-4178.  a2019-12-06  aHemicellulose is an important part of the plant cell wall biomass, and is relevant to cellulosic ethanol technologies. β‐Mannosidases are enzymes capable of cleaving nonreducing residues of β‐d‐mannose from β‐d‐mannosides and hemicellulose mannose‐containing polysaccharides, such as mannans and galactomannans. β‐Mannosidases are distributed between glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 1, 2, and 5, and only a handful of the enzymes have been structurally characterized to date. The only published X‐ray structure of a GH family 2 mannosidase is that of the bacterial Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron enzyme. No structures of eukaryotic mannosidases of this family are currently available. To fill this gap, we set out to solve the structure of Trichoderma harzianum GH family 2 β‐mannosidase and to refine it to 1.9‐Å resolution. Structural comparisons of the T. harzianum GH2 β‐mannosidase highlight similarities in its structural architecture with other members of GH family 2, reveal the molecular mechanism of β‐mannoside binding and recognition, and shed light on its putative galactomannan‐binding site.

This concept suggests that several specifications which are desired for cancer cell targeting and imaging studies can be satisfied at the same time in one multifunctional scaffold. Besides, such scaffolds exhibit multi-colour properties when combined with a targeting moiety. For this purpose, a fluorescent and functional monomer, 3-(1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)phenol (PIP) and an antibody labelling kit (CF555) were merged on the same scaffold to generate the proposed bioprobe. This design offers multicolour cell images by emitting at dual wavelengths with no quenching in its fluorescent property. Also, pendant alcohol groups in the structure of PIP enable covalent attachment to labelled protein, CF555/anti-CD44 in order to enhance the biological activity and specificity towards the target. After combining with the targeting moiety, the bioconjugate was characterized, tested for in vitro studies, and the cellular internalization was monitored in live cells via the fluorescence microscope technique. The present work with such a strategy explores the potential use of the proposed fluorescent probe for the first time. The aim is to achieve targeted imaging of CD44 positive U87-MG cancer cells and determine specific cellular labelling via fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abioactive properties 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopes 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3ain vitro studies 3amoieties 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphenols 3awavelengths1 aDemir, B.1 aBarlas, F.

Air was used as the gasifying agent as well as a fluidizing gas. Fuel was fed into the top of the gasifier and air was introduced from the bottom through a distributor. In order to control the composition of the product gas, the amounts of feedstock and gasifying agent being fed into the gasifier were varied, and the temperature distribution in the gasifier and the composition of the syngas were monitored. It was shown that the distribution of the reaction zones in the gasifier could be controlled by the air injection rate, and the composition of the syngas by the equivalence ratio of the reactants. Although the obtained syngas had a low caloric value, its heating value is adequate for power generation using a syngas engine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass 3afeedstocks 3afluidized beds 3afuels 3agasification 3aheat 3apower generation 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aYang, Chang Won1 aKim, Beom Jong1 aKim, Kwang-su,1 aLee, Jeung Woo1 aMoon, Ji Hong1 aYang, Won1 aYu, Tae U1 aLee, Uen Do0 tApplied energy.g2013 Dec., v. 112 p.414-420dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.03.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010600173300001400279520139800293592002801691650001501719650001201734650001601746650001901762650001601781650000901797650001401806650000701820650001101827650001601838650002301854650001101877650001001888651001201898700002701910700002601937700001801963773009001981856008702071852000902158655001202167IND60085055620221120095839.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008505562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2010.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomić, Željka10aArsenic distribution, concentration and speciation in groundwater of the Osijek area, eastern Croatia  ap. 37-44.  aGroundwater is the main source of drinking water for the population of nearly 200,000 people in eastern Croatia. The largest town in the region is Osijek whose citizens are supplied with drinking water obtained from groundwater from the “Vinogradi” well field. This study investigated and determined As occurrence in groundwater of the Osijek area. Groundwater samples were taken from 18 water wells and 12 piezometers with a depth ranging between 21 and 200m. Over the 10-a period to 2007, a mean As concentration of 240μgL⁻¹ was found. There was no statistically significant secular change in concentration over that period, however small but significant seasonal variations were noted, with the highest seasonal As concentrations over the period May 2006–February 2007 being observed in summer. The predominant As species observed was As(III), constituting 85% and 93% of total As in piezometers and water wells, respectively. Higher concentrations of As tended to be found in deeper wells with the mean As concentration in shallow groundwater (<50m) and deep groundwater (>50m) being 27μgL⁻¹, and 205μgL⁻¹, respectively. Geochemically, the groundwaters show similarities to those in other parts of the Pannonian Basin. Arsenic(tot) is weakly correlated with pH and Fe, negatively correlated with Mn and has no significant correlation with any of EC, COD-Mn or alkalinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aarsenic 3acorrelation 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3airon 3amanganese 3apH 3apeople 3apiezometers 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3awells 3aCroatia1 aHabuda-Stanić, Mirna,1 aKalajdžić, Brankica1 aKuleš, Mirko0 tApplied geochemistry.g2011 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.37-44dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2010.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012200166300001600288520194500304592002802249650001902277650001702296650002302313650001102336650001402347650001702361650001702378651001002395700002002405700001302425700001902438773007802457856008602535852000902621655001202630IND60084914220221120214314.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008491422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Sheng10aLearning rates and future cost curves for fossil fuel energy systems with CO₂ capture: Methodology and case studies  ap. 348-356.  aThe broadly applicable equations for estimating learning rates of cost variables in energy systems with CO₂ capture (CC) are formulated, in which the effect of overall plant efficiency upgrade on learning rates is reflected. Based on the equations, as a case study, we estimate the learning rates, predict the future cost trend of IGCC power plants with CC in China, and examine the effect of plant efficiency upgrade on its future cost. It is revealed that the learning rates of the whole CC plant are relevant not only to the learning rate of each subunit, but also to its cost proportion and the overall plant efficiency upgrade. Results from case study show that the learning rates of IGCC+CC in China are in the range of 0.0964–0.2022 for unit investment, 0.0726–0.1489 for COE, and 0.0636–0.1462 for cost of CO₂ avoidance (COA). When the cumulative production reaches 100GW, the investment for IGCC+CC will decrease from the current level (approximately 2150$/kW) to around 760–1350$/kW, COE will decrease to 46–68$/MWh, and COA will fall from 33.4$/t to 16–25$/t. Sensitivity analysis indicates that overall plant efficiency upgrade and the capacity at which learning begins pose significant effects on cost reduction. Compared with PC+CC, for gradual learning with a low learning rate, the unit investment of IGCC+CC will be a little bit higher than that of PC+CC in the future. For rapid and moderate learning, IGCC+CC will be more expensive than PC+CC in the near term, while breakeven points are observed with the cumulative experiences growing, indicating that IGCC+CC can economically perform better than PC+CC in the medium and long term. The paper provides an approach to estimate the learning rates of CC plants, and thus to project their future cost curves, which will help to formulate the first clear-cut CCS roadmap in China and to aid the identification of key CC technologies that should be focused on.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aequations 3afossil fuels 3apower plants 3aChina1 aZhang, Xiaosong1 aGao, Lin1 aJin, Hongguang0 tApplied energy.g2012 May, v. 93 p.348-356dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002400186245010100210300001200311506007600323520176200399592002802161506003702189650002202226650001702248650002202265650001902287650001502306650001602321650002002337650002602357650004302383650001902426650003202445650001102477650002502488650003802513700002002551700001702571700001902588700001802607700002202625700002402647700002202671773008802693856007902781852000902860655001202869IND60080009820221207133236.0150503e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008000982DNAL7 a249874482pmid7 aPMC40767682pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-4811-10-172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Donnelly, Kerry10aIsolation and kinetic characterisation of hydrophobically distinct populations of form I Rubisco  ap. 284.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Rubisco (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is a Calvin Cycle enzyme involved in CO₂assimilation. It is thought to be a major cause of photosynthetic inefficiency, suffering from both a slow catalytic rate and lack of specificity due to a competing reaction with oxygen. Revealing and understanding the engineering rules that dictate Rubisco’s activity could have a significant impact on photosynthetic efficiency and crop yield. RESULTS: This paper describes the purification and characterisation of a number of hydrophobically distinct populations of Rubisco from both Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea extracts. The populations were obtained using a novel and rapid purification protocol that employs hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) as a form I Rubisco enrichment procedure, resulting in distinct Rubisco populations of expected enzymatic activities, high purities and integrity. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate here that HIC can be employed to isolate form I Rubisco with purities and activities comparable to those obtained via ion exchange chromatography (IEC). Interestingly, and in contrast to other published purification methods, HIC resulted in the isolation of a number of hydrophobically distinct Rubisco populations. Our findings reveal a so far unaccounted diversity in the hydrophobic properties within form 1 Rubisco. By employing HIC to isolate and characterise Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea, we show that the presence of these distinct Rubisco populations is not species specific, and we report for the first time the kinetic properties of Rubisco from Brassica oleracea extracts. These observations may aid future studies concerning Rubisco’s structural and functional properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica oleracea 3aCalvin cycle 3aSpinacia oleracea 3acarbon dioxide 3acrop yield 3aengineering 3aenzyme activity 3afunctional properties 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3aion exchange chromatography 3aoxygen 3apurification methods 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase1 aZhao, Guangyuan1 aPatel, Priya1 aButt, M Salman1 aMak, Lok Hang1 aKretschmer, Simon1 aWoscholski, Rudiger1 aBarter, Laura M C0 tPlant methods.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.284-284dSpringer-Verlagx1746-48117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4811-10-173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012100166300001400287520153800301592002801839650001401867650004401881650003701925650001701962650001501979650001201994650002002006650001402026650001102040650001302051650001302064650001802077650001802095650001402113650001802127650001602145650001402161650003702175653001802212653002802230653001802258653002002276700005502296700001602351773010002367856008302467852000902550655001202559IND60639250020221119111511.0190718e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063925002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qiuchen10aTuning butene selectivities by Cu modification on Pd-based catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene  ap. 12-23.  aPd-based bimetallic catalysts have shown unique selectivity to alkenes in the selective hydrogenation reactions, but often at the expense of activity. Therefore, the modification by a non-precious metal with similar or increased activity is crucial in lowering the catalyst cost. In the current study, γ-Al2O3 supported Pd–Cu catalysts with different metal ratios were investigated in the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. The adsorption properties of hydrogen and C4 species over model surfaces Pd(1 1 1), Pd1Cu3(1 1 1) and Cu(1 1 1) were studied by DFT calculations, and it was predicted that the Pd–Cu bimetallic catalysts should be more selective to butenes than the Pd monometallic catalyst. Moreover, the γ-Al2O3 supported Pd–Cu catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness co-impregnation, and were characterized by TEM, CO pulse titration, TPR, N2O chemisorption, FT-IR of adsorbed CO and XPS; the catalytic study was performed in a fixed-bed reactor as well as in a batch reactor equipped with FT-IR. By the addition of Cu, Pd active sites were diluted, and the particle sizes were reduced. The Pd–Cu bimetallic catalysts exhibited surprisingly higher activity than Pd at low temperatures. In consistent with the DFT results, Pd–Cu bimetallic catalysts showed higher selectivities to total butenes and 1-butene. By analyzing the characterization and the hydrogenation test results, the electronic effect and geometric effect should be responsible in enhancing activity and tuning selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aalkenes 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acopper 3ageometry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3anitrous oxide 3apalladium 3aparticle size 3atemperature 3atitration 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPdCu catalyst 0aSelective hydrogenation 0a1,3-butadiene 0aDFT calculation1 aHou, Ruijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5426-30041 aSun, Kening0 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 June, v. 374 p.12-23dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010900167300001600276520076000292592002801052650001201080650001401092650001301106650000901119650001501128650001201143650001601155650001601171650001401187700002201201700002001223700002901243700002001272700002201292773011501314856008201429852000901511655001201520IND4405498520221118143816.0180619e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440549852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00412-008-0148-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Kazuya10aProduction of diploid and triploid offspring by inbreeding of the triploid planarian Dugesia ryukyuensis  ap. 289-296.  aTriploidy has generally been considered to be an evolutionary dead end due to problems of chromosomal pairing and segregation during meiosis. Thus, the formation of tetraploids and diploids from triploid types is a rare phenomenon. In the present study, we demonstrated that inbreeding of the triploid planarian Dugesia ryukyuensis resulted in both diploid and triploid offspring in nature. In the triploids of D. ryukyuensis, chiasmata between homologous chromosomes were observed in both female and male germ lines. This result suggests that both diploid and triploid offspring of this species are produced bisexually by zygotic fusion between sperm and eggs. Hence, this phenomenon may be a novel mechanism in planarian for escaping the triploid state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDugesia 3achiasmata 3adiploidy 3aeggs 3ainbreeding 3aprogeny 3aspermatozoa 3atetraploidy 3atriploidy1 aIshizu, Hirotsugu1 aArioka, Sachiko1 aPadilla Cabrera, Jocelyn1 aHoshi, Motonori1 aMatsumoto, Midori0 tChromosoma.g2008 June, v. 117, no. 3 p.289-296dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46537x0009-59157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-008-0148-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245007500192300001200267520121000279592002801489653001101517653002001528653002201548653002201570653001701592700002101609773008701630856011701717852000901834655001201843IND60126255420221121234629.0151105e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012625542DNAL7 a10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0001:FPOBEA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaccarone, Alan D.10aForaging Patterns of Breeding Egrets at Coastal and Interior Locations  ap. 1-7.  aWe compared the feeding patterns of Great Egrets (Casmerodius albus) and Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) in flowing and still aquatic habitats of coastal (New York City) and interior (Wichita, Kansas) locations. These included strike rate, prey capture rate, strike success, ““idle time”” and diet. We tested the hypothesis that widely-distributed species of wading birds that face different ecological conditions across their geographic range modify their feeding behavior to match local conditions. If this hypothesis is correct, then the feeding patterns of egrets at the coastal site will differ from those in the interior. Great Egrets in coastal habitats had higher capture rates and strike rates than interior birds, but strike success was similar in both areas. The diets of coastal and interior Great Egrets were broadly similar. Great Egrets also spent less ““idle time”” while foraging at coastal sites than at interior sites. Snowy Egrets had higher capture rates at interior sites, but strike rates did not differ between study areas.

BC450 out-performed the other BCs at varying Cd concentrations and can remove nearly 100% Cd from aqueous solution within 1 h at initial Cd ≤ 50 mg l−1. The process of Cd sorption by BC450 followed the pseudo-second order kinetics with the equilibrium being achieved after 24 h with initial Cd ranging from 100 to 500 mg l−1. The maximum Cd sorption capacity of BC450 was estimated to be 70.3 mg g−1 based on Langmuir model, which is prominent among a range of low-cost sorbents. Based on the balance analysis between cations released and Cd sorbed onto BC450 in combination with SEM-EDX and XPS data, ion-exchange followed by surface complexation is proposed as the dominant mechanism responsible for Cd immobilization by BC450. In parallel, XRD analysis also suggested the formation of insoluble Cd minerals (CdCO3, Cd3P2, Cd3(PO4)2 and K4CdCl6) from either (co)-precipitation or ion exchange. Results from this study highlighted that the conversion of water hyacinth into biochar is a promising method to achieve effective Cd immobilization and improved management of this highly problematic invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochar 3acadmium 3acations 3ainvasive species 3aion exchange 3aminerals 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 0aInvasive plants 0aWater hyacinth 0aBiochar 0aCadmium 0aSorption1 aWang, Xin1 aYin, Daixia1 aPeng, Bo1 aTan, Changyin1 aLiu, Yunguo1 aTan, Xiaofei1 aGoo, S.

The role of X‐ray crystallography in structure‐assisted drug discovery against these targets is discussed. Aspects dealt with in this review include the emergence of the SARS coronavirus in 2002–2003 and of the MERS coronavirus 10 years later and the origins of these viruses. The crystal structure of the free SARS coronavirus Mᵖʳᵒ and its dependence on pH is discussed, as are efforts to design inhibitors on the basis of these structures. The mechanism of maturation of the enzyme from the viral polyprotein is still a matter of debate. The crystal structure of the SARS coronavirus PLᵖʳᵒ and its complex with ubiquitin is also discussed, as is its orthologue from MERS coronavirus. Efforts at predictive structure‐based inhibitor development for bat coronavirus Mᵖʳᵒs to increase the preparedness against zoonotic transmission to man are described as well. The paper closes with a brief discussion of structure‐based discovery of antivirals in an academic setting.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChiroptera 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantiviral agents 3acrystal structure 3acrystallography 3adrugs 3apH 3aproteinases 3aubiquitin 3aviruses0 tFEBS journal.g2014 Sept., v. 281, no. 18 p.4085-4096dBlackwellx1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.129363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245008300163300001300246500000900259520151300268592002801781650001801809650002501827650002201852650002701874650002701901650001401928650001901942650002801961650002801989650001902017650002102036650001202057650001702069700001702086700001602103773011802119856008102237852000902318655001202327IND60665165820221123041447.0191228e200101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066516582DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2001.41162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudnik, N.S.14aThe Extent of Use of Plant Genetic Resources in Research—A Literature Survey  ap. 6-10.  aepub  aOur aim was to assess the level of use of conserved plant genetic resources (PGR) in crop genetic research. To do this, we analyzed in detail the reports from four internationally recognized journals published in 1996. These journals were Crop Science, Euphytica, Plant Breeding, and Theoretical and Applied Genetics Our results indicate that about 23% of the articles published in these journals reported work conducted with material that originated in an ex situ PGR collection or was collected directly in the field. We also analyzed our results to determine the range of species and research topics involved, the sources of materials used, and the users of PGR for research. Of the material used, 80% was accessed from ex situ germplasm collections housed in genebanks in 27 countries and seven centers of the CGIAR. The rest of the studies utilized material gathered directly in the field. Almost all work was produced at national research centers and universities; very little work from private industry was published in the journals covered. Just under 20% of the institutions represented by authors were located in developing countries. Work published involved 112 species and included assessments of genetic diversity among accessions (42% of the studies), studies of the inheritance of biotic stress resistance (29%), taxonomic and phylogenetic analyses (16%), as well as cytologic, molecular and conservation research. Our research demonstrates a significant use of conserved material in research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotic stress 3adeveloping countries 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm conservation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aphylogeny 3aplant breeding 3aplant genetic resources 3aplant growth substances 3aprivate sector 3astress tolerance 3asurveys 3auniversities1 aThormann, I.1 aHodgkin, T.0 tCrop science.g2001 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.6-10dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2001.41163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012800168300001500296520130100311592002801612650003001640650001601670650002201686650001501708650002501723650001501748650001001763650001801773650001601791650001101807650001101818650001501829650001701844650001901861650001801880650001101898653001401909653003101923653002201954653001701976653003501993653001402028653001202042653002402054700002102078700002002099700001902119700002402138700002002162700001702182700001802199773009702217856008802314852000902402655001202411IND60540282320221120031351.0190318e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054028232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yuan14aThe fungal leaf endophyte Paraconiothyrium variabile specifically metabolizes the host-plant metabolome for its own benefit  ap. 95-101.  aFungal endophytes live inside plant tissues and some have been found to provide benefits to their host. Nevertheless, their ecological impact is not adequately understood. Considering the fact that endophytes are continuously interacting with their hosts, it is conceivable that both partners have substantial influence on each other’s metabolic processes. In this context, we have investigated the action of the endophytic fungus Paraconiothyrium variabile, isolated from the leaves of Cephalotaxus harringtonia, on the secondary metabolome of the host-plant. The alteration of the leaf compounds by the fungus was monitored through metabolomic approaches followed by structural characterization of the altered products. Out of more than a thousand molecules present in the crude extract of the plant leaf, we have observed a specific biotransformation of glycosylated flavonoids by the endophyte. In all cases it led to the production of the corresponding aglycone via deglycosylation. The deglycosylated flavonoids turned out to display significant beneficial effects on the hyphal growth of germinated spores. Our finding, along with the known allelopathic role of flavonoids, illustrates the chemical cooperation underlying the mutualistic relationship between the plant and the endophyte.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephalotaxus harringtonia 3aallelopathy 3abiotransformation 3aendophytes 3aenvironmental impact 3aflavonoids 3afungi 3aglycosylation 3ahost plants 3ahyphae 3aleaves 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3aplant extracts 3aplant tissues 3aspores 0aEndophyte 0aPlant secondary metabolome 0aBiotransformation 0aMetabolomics 0aPlant–endophyte interactions 0aMutualism 0aFlavone 0aSignaling molecules1 aAmand, Séverine1 aBuisson, Didier1 aKunz, Caroline1 aHachette, François1 aDupont, Joëlle1 aNay, Bastien1 aPrado, Soizic0 tPhytochemistry.g2014 Dec., v. 108 p.95-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012200165300001400287520125700301592002801558650001201586650002201598650001601620650001101636650001301647650001801660650001301678650001201691650001301703650001801716653004401734653002901778653004001807653003101847653002201878700006201900700005901962773010002021856008302121852000902204655001202213IND60639250220221119113115.0190718e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063925022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠulce, Anda10aKinetic analysis of the asymmetric hydrogenation of ß-keto esters over α-amino acid-functionalized Pt nanoparticles  ap. 82-92.  aAnalysis of the kinetics for the asymmetric hydrogenation of ß-keto esters over Pt nanoparticles (NPs) in the liquid-phase reveal a unique reaction pathway that is active on α-amino acid-functionalized Pt NPs but absent on “ligand-free” Pt NPs. Differences in both the apparent activation energies and the reaction orders with respect to organic reactant concentrations and the hydrogen partial pressure are interpreted through rate expressions derived from sequences of elementary steps. The hydrogenation proceeds by a classical Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism that sequentially adds two chemisorbed hydrogen atoms to the carbonyl group of the reactant on the surfaces of “ligand-free” Pt NPs. In contrast, the hydrogenation over ligand-functionalized Pt NPs appears to proceed by a concerted addition of two hydrogen atoms to the carbonyl group of the reactant mediated by the amino group of the α-amino acid ligand. Furthermore, the acidity and flexibility of the ligands likely influence their activation energies. Importantly, over ligand-functionalized Pt NPs no evidence for a background reaction on bare Pt ensembles was found, which implies that the origin of the enantiodifferentiation lies in two diastereomeric reaction pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aactivation energy 3aamino acids 3aesters 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3akinetics 3aligands 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 0aStereoselective heterogeneous catalysis 0aAsymmetric hydrogenation 0aLigand-functionalized nanoparticles 0aLigand acceleration effect 0aReaction kinetics1 aFlaherty, David W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0567-84811 aKunz, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2512-93160 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 June, v. 374 p.82-92dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012400169500001900293520149100312592002801803650001601831650002001847650002601867650002101893650001401914650001701928650001701945650001501962650001701977650001401994650001102008650001402019650001402033650000702047650001102054650001302065653002402078653002002102653002502122653001302147653001702160700001302177700001602190700001302206700001902219700005702238700001402295773010302309856008702412852000902499655001202508IND60723437420221120130559.0210401e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072343742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1115732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Daquan10aFacile preparation of pH/redox dual-responsive biodegradable polyphosphazene prodrugs for effective cancer chemotherapy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn order to maximize the therapeutic effect and and minimize the systemtic side effect of the small molecule anticancer drugs, biodegradable drug delivery systems (DDSs) that respond to tumor microenvironment (TME) have attracted significant attention. Herein, a novel redox/pH dual-responsive and biodegradable polyphosphazene (PPZ) nano-prodrugs have been prepared via one-pot crosslinking of vanillin modified DOX (VMD, acid-sensitive) and 4,4′-dihydroxydiphenyl disulfide (HPS, GSH-responsive) with hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP). The phenol groups of the as-synthesized VMD and HPS have high nucleophilic substitution activity towards HCCP under base catalyst and afforded PPZ nano-prodrugs, denoted as HCCP-VMD-HPS, with a high drug loading ratio of up to 56.4 %. As expected, the skeleton of the PPZ consisting of imine bonds in VMD and the disulfide bonds in HPS and cyclotriphosphazenes inclined to be decomposed in low pH conditions and high level of GSH environments. The antitumor drug DOX was found to be controlled released in TME conditions (extracellular, pH∼6.8 and endosomes, lysosomes pH∼5.0 with ∼10 mM GSH), rather than neutral physiological conditions (pH 7.4 with ∼20 μM GSH). Moreover, the resulting HCCP-VMD-HPS nano-prodrug have obvious cytotoxicity to cancer cells while a negligible side effect to normal cells. We therefore believe that the prepared redox/pH dual-responsive and biodegradable PPZ DDSs have great potential in various field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aadverse effects 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiodegradability 3acatalysts 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3adisulfides 3adrug therapy 3aendosomes 3aimines 3alysosomes 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aphenol 3avanillin 0aRedox/pH responsive 0aPolyphosphazene 0aDrug delivery system 0aProdrugs 0aChemotherapy1 aZhou, Na1 aZhang, Ning1 aZhi, Zhe1 aShao, Yongping1 aMeng, Lingjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0428-97801 aYu, Demei0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Apr., v. 200 p.111573-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1115733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012700153300002000280520072100300592002801021650002201049650001301071650002201084650001101106650001101117650001401128650001901142650001901161650002001180650001701200650001801217650001701235650003701252650001401289650001201303700001801315700001801333773012601351856007401477852000901551655001201560IND60669311620221119144116.0190920e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066931162DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra16612h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Di10aSynthesis and characterization of upconversion nanoparticles with shell structure and ligand-free hydrophilic modification  ap. 83149-83154.  aYtterbium and erbium co-doped sodium yttrium fluoride (NaYF₄:Er³⁺, Yb³⁺) rare-earth upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with different phases were prepared and characterized.

The crystal structure, morphology and upconversion spectra of the sample were investigated using X-ray powder diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, and laser upconversion spectrometry with a 980 nm diode laser. Finally, UCNPs with core–shell structure were modified to be hydrophilic by ligand-free hydrophilic modification. Moreover, the water dispersible UCNPs have much stronger luminescence compared with hydrophobic UCNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acoatings 3acrystal structure 3adiodes 3aerbium 3afluorides 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alight intensity 3aluminescence 3ananoparticles 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aytterbium 3ayttrium1 aSong, Xiaoyan1 aXing, Jinfeng0 tRSC advances.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 5, no. 101 p.83149-83154dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra16612h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01693naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245005700163300001600220520057200236592002800808650000800836650001900844650001400863650002300877650002300900650002000923650001200943650001300955650000900968650001300977700002100990700002001011700001701031700002201048700002201070773012201092856007201214852000901286655001201295IND60662258620221119051549.0190904e20060901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066225862DNAL7 a10.1039/b605405f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeldebrant, David J.10aLiquid polymers as solvents for catalytic reductions  ap. 807-815.  aNonvolatile solvents eliminate the health and environmental risks associated with volatile solvent use, but may pose their own risks and separation problems.

Adopting interpretivist approach, this study aimed at assessing the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in rural poverty reduction using the experience of the Hunger Project (THP) in selected rural communities in Ghana. Purposive and cluster sampling techniques were used to select 37 respondents, drawn from five different ‘epicentres’ who have benefitted from THP. The study found out that THP has helped to reduce poverty levels of rural people in the Asante Akyem South District through their programmes that train, empower and resource beneficiaries. Beneficiaries have become self-reliant, socially responsible and active, economically empowered who continue to impact their households and beyond; this has cascading effect on further rural poverty reduction. The study also identifies few challenges that affect THP’s programmes. The study concludes that THP’s ‘four-phase epicentric approach’ to community development enables self-reliance, people’s involvement and holds great promise for holistic poverty eradication effort in the district. The poverty eradication component of ‘Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Beyond 2015’ makes the role of the ‘third sector’ quintessential; policy suggestions from the study serve as an input for NGOs’ decision-making processes in an attempt to scale up their poverty reduction activities in rural communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity development 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3anongovernmental organizations 3apeople 3arural communities 3arural population 3arural poverty 3asampling 3aGhana 0aNGOs 0apoverty reduction 0adeveloping countries 0astakeholders 0aempowerment1 aMusah-Surugu, Issah Justice1 aBawole, Justice Nyigmah1 aNurudeen, Suleiman0 tInternational journal of rural management.g, v. 11, no. 2 p.85-110dSAGE PublicationswJournal:21330x0973-06807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09730052156019443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011800160300001800278500002000296520139400316592002801710650001501738650000801753650002201761650001601783650001301799650001701812650001201829650001101841650001101852700006301863700002101926700002001947700002201967700001901989773015302008856007502161961001302236852000902249655001202258IND60786539920221122233807.0220804e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078653992DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.120892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, Robert O.10aThioether‐Functionalized Corn Oil Biosorbents for the Removal of Mercury and Silver Ions from Aqueous Solutions  ap. 1189-1200.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHeavy‐metal contamination is one of the most important environmental problems faced in the world, particularly in developing countries. Metals such as silver and mercury from drinking water, food, and air sources can accumulate in living organisms and present significant health concerns. Meanwhile, the demand for these metals in many industries continues to increase. In the present study, thioether‐functionalized corn oil (TFCO) from a photoinitiated thiol‐ene synthesis was utilized to remove Ag⁺ and Hg²⁺ ions from an aqueous solution. An aqueous solution containing AgNO₃ and Hg[NO₃]₂ was prepared and contacted directly with TFCO. After vortex mixing for 60 s, the experiment ran for 351 min with the aqueous phase being periodically sampled for the analysis of metal ions (M ⁿ⁺). Results showed that 88.9% of Ag⁺ and 99.6% of Hg²⁺ ions were removed from the aqueous phase by the TFCO. Mass balances indicated that the total M ⁿ⁺ concentration in the oil phase was 13.890 g kg⁻¹ under the conditions studied. TFCO exhibited higher selectivity for removing Hg²⁺ than for Ag⁺ ions. Analysis of the adsorption kinetics showed that a pseudosecond‐order model may be used to determine the rate of Ag⁺ ion sorption by the oil phase. The presence of the Hg²⁺ ions interfered with the adsorption of Ag⁺ ions from the aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosorbents 3acorn oil 3aheavy metals 3amercury 3amodels 3asilver1 aBantchev, Grigor B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2790-51951 aDoll, Kenneth M.1 aAscherl, Kim L.1 aLansing, James C.1 aMurray, Rex E.0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2018 Sept., v. 95, no. 9 p.1189-1200dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.120893Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016500169300001600334520165700350592002802007650002202035650001402057650001602071650001602087650001602103650001402119650001502133650002002148650001302168650001402181650001402195650001702209650001502226650002402241650001002265700001602275700001502291700001802306773012502324856008202449852000902531655001202540IND60777327920221123033347.0220516e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077732792DNAL7 a10.1134/S102279542205009X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamsabadi, E.

Eight cultivars, namely Kouhdasht, Mehregan, Karim, line 17, N-80-19, Atrak, N-92-9, and Ehsan were crossed. Agronomical, phenological and morphological attributes including, days to emergency, days to flowering, days to maturity, flag leaf length, flag leaf weight, flag leaf width, length of grain filling period, number of spikes, number of grains per spike, spike weight per plant, grain yield, plant height, awn length, peduncle length, spike length, stem diameter, stem weight, total spike weight, and grain weight per spike were recorded. Polymorphic Informative Content for markers ranged from 0.791 for the BARC173 to 0.194 for the XBARC171. Regression analysis showed that twenty-nine SSR informative alleles were related to traits. Then, SSR informative alleles were used as input of artificial intelligence methods. Five algorithms were used for network training to predict grain yield. Based on the analysis of MLP, the validation accuracy prediction varied from 0.96 for the phenotypic data to 0.99 for the combined data. The ANFIS with five inputs and the least mean square error and an accuracy of more than 98% was the best system to estimate hybrid yield using phenotypic data. Yield of hybrids evaluated by the neural-genetic model to predict hybrid yield of wheat by the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of parents, and it was recommended as a suitable and reliable model to predict the best hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3afuzzy logic 3agrain yield 3aleaf length 3aleaf mass 3aleaf width 3aneural networks 3apeduncle 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3awheat1 aSabouri, H.1 aSoughi, H.1 aSajadi, S.

To this end, we have constructed electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), also referred to as supercapacitors, using thick, ultracompressible graphene-coated carbon nanotube aerogels as electrodes. These electrodes showed a high capacitance in both aqueous and room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolytes, achieving between 60 and100 F/g, respectively, with the performance stable over hundreds of charge/discharge cycles and at high rates exceeding 1 V/s. This performance was retained fully under 90% compression of the systems, allowing us to construct cells with high volumetric capacitances of ∼5–18 F/cm³ in aqueous and RTIL electrolytes, respectively, which are 50–100 times higher than comparable compressible EDLCs (∼0.1 F/cm³). Further, the volumetric capacitances approach values reported for compressible pseudocapacitors (∼15–30 F/cm³) but without the degraded lifetime and reversibility that typically plague compressible pseudocapacitors. The electrodes demonstrated largely strain-invariant ion transport with no change in capacitance and high-rate performance even at 90% compressive strain. This material serves as an excellent platform for exploring the possibility for use of extremely compressible EDLCs with negligible degradation in capacitance in applications such as electric vehicles and wearable electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acapacitance 3acarbon nanotubes 3adeformation 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3aionic liquids 3avehicles (equipment) 0asupercapacitors 0aultracompressible 0acarbon nanotubes 0agraphene 0aaerogels1 aIslam, Mohammad F.0 tACS applied materials .g2015 Mar. 11, v. 7, no. 9 p.5612-5618dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b013843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245005100165300001600216520132100232592002801553650005801581650001101639650001901650650001901669650001901688650002201707650002901729650002101758650001101779650001101790650002901801650001701830650002101847651002101868653000801889653000801897653000801905653000901913653000701922653000901929653000901938653000701947653000801954653000801962653000901970653001101979653000801990653001901998653003102017653001102048773007802059856008302137852000902220655001202229IND60096975520221120232007.0160903e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009697552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2013.07.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAri, İzzet10aVoluntary emission trading potential of Turkey  ap. 910-919.  aClimate change is likely to cause serious market failures, and carbon trading as a market instrument can help correct its negative impacts. The global carbon markets established to combat climate change include regulatory and voluntary markets. Turkey cannot utilise regulatory carbon markets under the Kyoto Protocol. As a result of her unique position in the UNFCCC, some offsetting projects in Turkey have benefitted only voluntary emission trading for the reduction of GHG emissions. Due to on-going climate change negotiation under the UNFCCC, it seems that Turkey will not use the current regulatory carbon markets. Thus, Turkey should promote the use of and participation in voluntary carbon markets. In this article, emission reduction potential via energy efficiency, renewable energy and solid waste management, and corresponding offsetting of credits with their estimated prices is investigated for the period between 2013 and 2020. The emission reduction potential for energy efficiency, renewable energy and solid waste management projects are estimated at 403, 312 and 356milliontons of CO2 equivalent emissions respectively, totalling 1,071milliontons of CO2 equivalent. The total revenue of the carbon certificates are estimated in the range of 19,775–33,386 million US Dollars for the same period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3aclimate change 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aincome 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3asolid wastes 3awaste management 3aTurkey (country) 0aGDP 0aGHG 0aGWh 0aIPCC 0aKP 0aMENR 0aMOEF 0aMW 0aMWG 0aMWh 0aTETC 0aUNFCCC 0aVER 0aClimate change 0aVoluntary emission trading 0aTurkey0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Nov., v. 62 p.910-919dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.07.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015100164300001800315500001900333520124500352592002801597650001801625650002101643650001301664650001501677650001701692650001301709650001901722650001201741650001101753650001001764651002101774653001501795653001801810700002301828700002401851773012801875856007802003852000902081655001202090IND60717743720221118024340.0201116s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071774372DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2020-01762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamey, Tonya L.10aInfluence of moisture, nutrients, and distance from stream on early-stage mass loss of western red cedar leaf litter in headwater riparian forests  ap. 1391-1398.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWestern red cedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D.Don) is a dominant species in forests of the Pacific Northwest in North America, but little is known about its decomposition in riparian habitat. We experimentally tested how early-stage mass loss of cedar leaf litter varied with distance from the stream (five distances from 1 to 40 m away) and responded to nutrient and water additions near four headwater streams in southwestern British Columbia. We ran three coarse-mesh litterbag trials in durations between five months to one year from January 2013 and January 2014. Litterbags were either untreated or given the following treatments: water additions during dry summer months, nitrogen and phosphorus additions, or additions of both. Control litterbags lost 21% initial mass over 12 months (January 2013 – January 2014), 20% over five months (January 2013 – June 2013), and 15% over eight months (June 2013 – January 2014). Rates of mass loss did not increase with water in any trial but did increase with nutrients in the 12-month trial. Litter located 40 m from the stream lost 7% more mass than that located 1 m away in this same trial. Our study indicates that cedar leaf litter mass loss responded primarily to nutrient additions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThuja plicata 3adominant species 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant litter 3aresearch 3ariparian areas 3astreams 3asummer 3awater 3aBritish Columbia 0aconiferous 0adecomposition1 aPrescott, Cindy E.1 aRichardson, John S.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2020, v. 50, no. 12 p.1391-1398dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2020-01763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245011800209300001800327506007600345520047200421592002800893506003700921650001400958650001800972650001400990650002301004650002301027653001501050653001401065653002201079653001401101653002301115700001401138700005801152773011201210856008501322852000901407655001201416IND60592580320221207074541.0190131e20180418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059258032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2018.02.0712doi7 aPMC61864562pmcid7 a303336702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Yuan-Xi10a[Ir(COD)Cl]2/tris(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphite-catalyzed addition reactions of arylboronic acids with aldehydes  ap. 1548-1550.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a[Ir(COD)Cl]2/tris(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphite-catalyzed addition reactions of arylboronic acids with aldehydes were described.

In this work, the efficacy of five commercial proteases (Alcalase, Protamex, Pancreatic trypsin, Neutrase, and Flavourzyme) was evaluated in enzymatic recovery of fat and protein hydrolyzates from chicken skin. The highest (49.19%) and lowest (8.92%) degrees of hydrolysis (DH) of protein were obtained using Alcalase and Flavourzyme, respectively. Protein hydrolyzates obtained using Flavourzyme showed the highest water‐holding capacity (WHC), oil‐holding capacity (OHC), and emulsifying activity index (EAI). The highest foaming capacity was observed in the hydrolyzate produced using Alcalase, Protamex, or Trypsin treatments. Hydrolysis using Protamex or Trypsin resulted in the highest fat yield (34.48–35.85%). Fatty‐acid composition, iodine value, unsaponifiable matter, and the amount of iron in chicken‐skin fats were not affected by the enzyme's type. The phosphorus content of chicken‐skin fat was in the range of 5.6–10.8 ppm, the lowest obtained by Flavourzyme. The oxidative stability index of the enzymatically extracted fat was in the range of 0.98–1.51 h at 110 °C. In conclusion, the enzyme type had a significant effect on some physicochemical properties of fat and protein hydrolyzates.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicken skin 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3aiodine value 3airon 3aoils 3aoxidative stability 3aphosphorus content 3asubtilisin 3atrypsin 3awater holding capacity1 aFarmani, Jamshid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2963-30900 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2018 Sept., v. 95, no. 9 p.1151-1161dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.121313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006200171300001400233500001400247520196200261592002802223650002502251650002602276650001402302650001602316650003302332650001102365650001102376650002202387650001202409773008602421856008502507852000902592655001202601IND60084381920221116162406.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008438192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Clive G.10aGrand challenges for the future of ecological engineering  ap. 80-84.  aEDITORIAL  aEcological engineering is an idea and field whose time has already come, but what will it be in the future? It can be a leader in environmental sustainability, but this will not be easy to achieve. Three grand challenges need to be met and integrated into practice to accomplish this ambitious goal; they are the ethical, the relational, and the intellectual. The ethical challenge requires clearly articulating what is meant by the statement that ecological engineering integrates human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both, and what this then implies for codes of practice. The statement is open to ethical interpretation and invokes the key issue of balance amidst inevitable tradeoffs. The relational challenge is strategic. If ecological engineering seeks wide adoption it must develop and strengthen its relationships with other scientific disciplines and other segments of society. Key scientific partners are social science, management science, domain-specific science and technology, conservation and restoration science, engineering science and technology, and many areas of ‘green’ science and technology. Key social partners are business, policy, education and practitioners. The intellectual challenge requires those coming from ecological and engineering perspectives to respectively identify and fuse their key principles into a coherent, useful set that is comprehensible and accessible to all. All three challenges have to be met and integrated if ecological engineering is to significantly contribute to environmental sustainability. Given rapid environmental change, time to accomplish these tasks is limited. I call for a substantive open discourse and progress on these challenges and their integration into ecological engineering practice. If ecological engineering does not do this it risks misinterpretation, misapplication and non-acceptance, and may get lost in a sea of rapidly growing green endeavors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aecosystem engineering 3aeducation 3aengineering 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aethics 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3asociety0 tEcological engineering.g2012 Aug., v. 45 p.80-84dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245015100178300001400329520157300343592002801916650001201944650001801956650001501974650001701989650002302006650001002029650001902039650001302058650001302071650001202084650001402096650002402110650001502134650002202149650002302171650001502194651000902209700002402218773008702242856008502329852000902414655001202423IND60084382120221116162507.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008438212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.04.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashemimanesh, Mirmusa10aEvaluation of desert management and rehabilitation by petroleum mulch base on temporal spectral analysis and field study (case study: Ahvaz, Iran)  ap. 68-74.  aIn past decades, Iranian desert areas have undergone widespread land use transformation. Sand dune stabilizing projects and anti-desertification programs were initiated in 1965 and now cover about one million hectares of degraded land in Iran. This project aimed to stabilize sand dunes, to induce afforestation, to establish windbreaks and to apply mulch. Currently, more than three million hectares of arid land has been reclaimed across the country. In this study, maximum likelihood supervised classification and post-classification change detection techniques were applied to Landsat and TM/ETM images acquired in 1991 and 2002, respectively to map the anti-desertification process in southwestern Iran. A supervised classification was carried out for each of the two images. The results of this classification were refined using auxiliary data, visual interpretation and expert knowledge of the area. A post-classification change detection technique was used to produce change image through a cross module. Changes were assessed according to different classes. Observations made during the course of this study demonstrate that an obvious, positive change has taken place as a result of the petroleum mulch project. Results show that sand dune areas decreased from 66.4% to 56%, and in this case afforestation areas increased from 2.1% to 7.3%. However afforestation increased soil organic matter and recuperation of soil moisture storage conditions and chemical reactions such as dissolution of minerals and established more suitable conditions for crop growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aafforestation 3aarid lands 3acase studies 3achemical reactions 3adunes 3aexpert opinion 3aland use 3aminerals 3amulches 3apetroleum 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water 3aspectral analysis 3astorage conditions 3awindbreaks 3aIran1 aMatinfar, Hamidreza0 tEcological engineering.g2012 Sept., v. 46 p.68-74dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.04.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010700167300001600274500001500290520144400305592002801749650002401777650001901801650001601820650003701836650001701873650000901890650001901899650002301918650002501941650002001966650002001986650001402006650001402020650001402034650002602048653001102074653002202085653001102107653000902118653001102127653001402138653001902152653000902171653000902180653001402189653001702203653000802220653001302228700001902241700001502260700001402275700001802289700001202307773012102319856008202440852000902522655001202531IND60532929020221118141138.0160728e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053292902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, Hai-zhong10aDramatic suppression of colorectal cancer cell growth by the dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor AZD-2014  ap. 406-412.  a2019-12-06  aColorectal cancer is a major contributor of cancer-related mortality. The mammalian target or rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is frequently hyper-activated in colorectal cancers, promoting cancer progression and chemo-resistance. In the current study, we investigated the anti-colorectal cancer effect of a novel mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 dual inhibitor: AZD-2014. In cultured colorectal cancer cell lines, AZD-2014 significantly inhibited cancer cell growth without inducing significant cell apoptosis. AZD-2014 blocked activation of both mTORC1 (S6K and S6 phosphorylation) and mTORC2 (Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation), and activated autophagy in colorectal cancer cells. Meanwhile, autophagy inhibition by 3-methyaldenine (3-MA) and hydroxychloroquine, as well as by siRNA knocking down of Beclin-1 or ATG-7, inhibited AZD-2014-induced cytotoxicity, while the apoptosis inhibitor had no rescue effect. In vivo, AZD-2014 oral administration significantly inhibited the growth of HT-29 cell xenograft in SCID mice, and the mice survival was dramatically improved. At the same time, in xenografted tumors administrated with AZD-2014, the activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 were largely inhibited, and autophagic markers were significantly increased. Thus, AZD-2014 inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest that AZD-2014 may be further investigated for colorectal cancer therapy in clinical trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoral administration 3adisease course 3acell growth 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3acytotoxicity 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3agrowth retardation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3aclinical trials 3aapoptosis 3amortality 3aautophagy 3asmall interfering RNA 0a4E-BP1 0aColorectal cancer 0amTORC2 0aLC3B 0amTORC1 0aSignaling 0amTOR complexes 0amTOR 0a3-MA 0aAutophagy 0atherapeutics 0aS6K 0aAZD-20141 aZhou, Zhi-yuan1 aWang, Bing1 aQin, Jian1 aLiu, Wen-yong1 aGu, Yan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 443 p.406-412dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010100155300001800256520158500274592002801859650002201887650001701909650001301926650002601939650003701965650001702002650002802019650001702047650001502064650001902079650001602098650001902114650001802133650001902151650001502170650002202185650003302207650001402240653002502254653002802279653004202307653002502349700001802374700002102392700001402413700001802427700001802445700001702463700001302480700001702493700001602510773012302526856007502649852000902724655001202733IND60528838520221118180741.0160717e20150311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052883852DNAL7 a10.1021/am507345j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Shiyong10aInorganic Nanovehicle for Potential Targeted Drug Delivery to Tumor Cells, Tumor Optical Imaging  ap. 5089-5096.  aIn this work, an inorganic multifunctional nanovehicle was tailored as a carrier to deliver anticancer drug for tumor optical imaging and therapy. The nanovehicle could be used as a dually targeted drug nanovehicle by bonded magnetical (passive) and folic acid (active) targeting capabilities. In addition, it was developed using rhodamine 6G (R6G) as a fluorescence reagent, and an α-zirconium phosphate nanoplatform (Zr(HPO₄)₂·H₂O, abbreviated as α-ZrP) as the anticancer drug nanovehicle. The novel drug-release system was designed and fabricated by intercalation of α-ZrP with magnetic Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles and anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by reacting with a folate acid–chitosan–rhodamine6G (FA-CHI-R6G) complex, and then α-ZrP intercalated with Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was successfully encapsulated into chitosan (CHI). The resultant multifunctional drug delivery system was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, photoluminescence spectra, magnetometry, fluorescence microscopy imaging studies and other characterization methods. Simultaneously, the drug release in vitro on the obtained nanocomposites that exhibited a sustained release behavior was carried out in buffer solution at 37 °C, which demonstrated clearly that the nanocomposites shown a sustained release behavior. Meanwhile, cell culture experiments also indicated that the drug-release system had the potential to be used as an dually targeted drug nanovehicle into the tumor cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acell culture 3achitosan 3adrug delivery systems 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorouracil 3afolic acid 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphates 3aphotoluminescence 3ascanning electron microscopy 3azirconium 0afluorescence imaging 0acontrolled drug release 0amultifunctional drug-delivery systems 0aα-ZrP nanoparticles1 aGao, Xuechuan1 aBaigude, Huricha1 aHai, Xiao1 aZhang, Renfei1 aGao, Xiaolong1 aShen, Beibei1 aLi, Zhao1 aTan, Zhibing1 aSu, Haiquan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Mar. 11, v. 7, no. 9 p.5089-5096dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam507345j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008200177300001400259520170200273592002801975650001802003650001102021650001602032650001402048650001202062650001302074650001602087650002202103650002302125650001402148650001102162650001202173650001902185650001902204650001202223650001602235650001002251650003002261650001102291650001102302650001302313650002202326650001702348650001702365651001002382653001802392653001102410653002602421653003102447653002502478653002402503653001702527700002202544700003102566700002802597700002302625700002202648773012202670856008402792852000902876655001202885IND60636539620221118232630.0190410e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063653962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoles, Tommaso Michele10aDrought induced changes of leaf-to-root relationships in two tomato genotypes  ap. 24-31.  aWater deficit triggers a dynamic and integrated cross-talk between leaves and roots. Tolerant plants have developed several physiological and molecular mechanisms to establish new cell metabolism homeostasis, avoiding and/or escaping from permanent impairments triggered by drought. Two tomato genotypes (a Southern Italy landrace called Ciettaicale and the well-known commercial cultivar Moneymaker) were investigated at vegetative stage to assess leaf and root metabolic strategies under 20 days of water deficit. Physiological and metabolic changes, in terms of ABA, IAA, proline, soluble sugars and phenols contents, occurred in both tomato genotypes under water stress. Overall, our results pointed out the higher plasticity of Ciettaicale to manage plant water status under drought in order to preserve the source-sink relationships. This aim was achieved by maintaining a more efficient leaf photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry, as suggested by chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, associated with a major investment towards root growth and activity to improve water uptake. On the contrary, the higher accumulation of carbon compounds, resulting from reduced PSII photochemistry and enhanced starch reserve mobilization, in leaves and roots of Moneymaker under drought could play a key role in the osmotic adjustment, although causing a feedback disruption of the source-sink relations. This hypothesis was also supported by the different drought-induced redox unbalance, as suggested by H2O2 and MDA contents. This could affect both PSII photochemistry and root activity, leading to a major involvement of NPQ and antioxidant system in response to drought in Moneymaker than Ciettaicale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscisic acid 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3adrought 3agenotype 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindole acetic acid 3alandraces 3aleaves 3aphenols 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aproline 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asource-sink relationships 3astarch 3asugars 3atomatoes 3avegetative growth 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3aItaly 0aWater deficit 0aTomato 0aSource-sink relations 0aChlorophyll a fluorescence 0aLeaf water potential 0aCarbon partitioning 0aRedox status1 aMariotti, Lorenzo1 aDe Pedro, Leandro Federico1 aGuglielminetti, Lorenzo1 aPicciarelli, Piero1 aScartazza, Andrea0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 July, v. 128 p.24-31dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014700167520174700314592002802061650001802089650000902107650002302116650001702139650002502156650002202181650001402203650001402217650002002231650001702251650003002268650001502298650002302313650001302336650002102349650001402370650001502384650001502399650000902414650002102423650001502444650002902459653001202488653002102500653002002521653003002541653002602571700001602597700001502613700001402628700001702642700001702659700001602676700001402692700005802706700001702764773010302781856008602884852000902970655001202979IND60780362420221118043359.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078036242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1062282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yutian10aIntestinal changes associated with nitrite exposure in Bufo gargarizans larvae: Histological damage, immune response, and microbiota dysbiosis  aNitrite is a ubiquitous toxic compound in aquatic ecosystems and has negative effects on aquatic organisms. The intestine and the trillions of microbes that inhabit it, play an integral role in maintaining digestive and immune functions. However, the effects of nitrite on intestinal health and microflora have been poorly investigated. Therefore, the present study evaluated the response of intestinal histology, immunity, digestive enzyme activities and microbiota to nitrite exposure in Bufo gargarizans tadpoles. The results showed that nitrite caused damage to the intestine and impaired digestive performance. Significant changes in the transcriptional profiles of genes involved in oxidative stress (sod, gpx and hsp), inflammation, and immunity (socs3, il-27, il-1β and il-17d) were observed in the NO₂-N treatment groups. In addition, exposure to nitrite induced alterations of intestinal microbial diversity, structure and composition, suggesting that nitrite may lead to intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. It is noteworthy that probiotics (e.g., Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria) were decreased after exposure to nitrite, whereas potentially opportunistic pathogens such as Proteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae were elevated. Functional prediction and correlation analysis suggested that the above changes may interfere with metabolic function and trigger various diseases. Taken together, we concluded that nitrite exposure induced intestinal microbial dysbiosis, which may lead to immune dysfunction and metabolic disorder, and ultimately to histological damages in B. gargarizans. Further, this study will provide a scientific basis for further understanding the risk of nitrite pollution on the intestinal health of amphibians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aBufo 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aFusobacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3adigestive enzymes 3adysbiosis 3ahistology 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3ametabolic diseases 3anitrites 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aprediction 3aprobiotics 3arisk 3atoxic substances 3atoxicology 3atranscription (genetics) 0aNitrite 0aBufo gargarizans 0aImmune response 0aDigestive enzyme activity 0aIntestinal microbiota1 aWang, Hemei1 aWu, Lifeng1 aHan, Jian1 aSui, Baoying1 aMeng, Lingna1 aXu, Yunxuan1 aLu, Siwen1 aWang, Hongyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6144-64311 aPeng, Jufang0 tAquatic toxicology.g2022 Aug., v. 249 p.106228-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1062283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009600168300001600264520155200280592002801832650001501860650003001875650002201905650002601927650001501953650001201968650001201980650001501992650002402007650001402031650001602045650002802061650001402089700002402103700003102127700002302158700003502181700002302216700002002239700002002259773009602279856008102375852000902456655001202465IND60514877820221119204818.0160303e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051487782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-015-3508-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBálint, János,10aIntraspecific differences in plant chemotype determine the structure of arthropod food webs  ap. 797-807.  aIt is becoming increasingly appreciated that the structure and functioning of ecological food webs are controlled by the nature and level of plant chemicals. It is hypothesized that intraspecific variation in plant chemical resistance, in which individuals of a host-plant population exhibit genetic differences in their chemical contents (called ‘plant chemotypes’), may be an important determinant of variation in food web structure and functioning. We evaluated this hypothesis using field assessments and plant chemical assays in the tansy plant Tanacetum vulgare L. (Asteraceae). We examined food webs in which chemotypes of tansy plants are the resource for two specialized aphids, their predators and mutualistic ants. The density of the ant-tended aphid Metopeurum fuscoviride was significantly higher on particular chemotypes (borneol) than others. Clear chemotype preferences between predators were also detected. Aphid specialist seven-spotted ladybird beetles (Coccinella septempunctata) were more often found on camphor plants, while significantly higher numbers of the polyphagous nursery web spider (Pisaura mirabilis) were observed on borneol plants. The analysis of plant chemotype effects on the arthropod community clearly demonstrates a range of possible outcomes between plant-aphid-predator networks. The findings help to offer a deeper insight into how one important factor—plant chemical content—influences which species coexist within a food web on a particular host plant and the nature of their trophic linkages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aCoccinella septempunctata 3aTanacetum vulgare 3aarthropod communities 3aarthropods 3aborneol 3acamphor 3achemotypes 3aecological function 3afood webs 3ahost plants 3aintraspecific variation 3apredators1 aZytynska, Sharon E.1 aSalamon, Rozália Veronika1 aMehrparvar, Mohsen1 aWeisser, W.

Female rats were fed various purified diets for 28 days. There was a control diet (0·5% Ca, 0·04% Mg, 0·4% P, 15·1% protein, wt/wt), a low Mg (0·01% Mg), a high protein (30·2% protein) and a high P diet (0·6% P). The low Mg and high P diet induced nephrocalcinosis as demonstrated histologically and by markedly increased concentrations of kidney Ca. In rats fed the high protein diet, nephrocalcinosis was essentially absent. Group mean values of urinary excretion of albumin and plasma concentrations of urea were increased in rats fed either the low Mg or high P diet. The high protein diet did not affect urinary albumin but caused lysozymuria which was not seen in the other groups. Plasma urea was increased in rats fed the high protein diet. In individual rats, the concentration of Ca in kidney and urinary albumin excretion were positively correlated.

The present study was conducted to investigate the sub-acute toxicity of the saline extract from the stem of P. gounellei.To evaluate the 28-day oral toxicity (through behavioral, biochemical, hematological, and morphological analysis) and the antipyretic activity of the extract in mice.A single oral dose (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) was administered daily over 28 consecutive days to male and female mice. Body weight, food and water intake, blood biochemical and hematological parameters, and urine composition were recorded. Histopathological examinations of the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and heart were performed and oxidative stress in the organs was evaluated by lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and nitrite analysis. The antipyretic effect of the 500 mg/kg dose was assessed using a yeast-induced pyrexia model.Oral administration of the extract over 28 days did not affect body weight gain, food and water consumption, body temperature, and hematological parameters in male and female mice. Blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in male and female mice were reduced. Protein in the urine and histological alterations in both the liver and lungs were detected in male and female mice treated with the highest dose of the extract. SOD levels in the liver and the spleen increased significantly in both sexes, whereas lipid peroxidation decreased in the spleen of male mice. The extract also exerted an antipyretic effect after the first 60 min of the evaluation until the end of the observation duration (180 min).The saline extract from the stem of P. gounellei did not present significant toxic effects over 28 consecutive days and demonstrated antipyretic activity when administered orally. Moreover, the results suggest that the extract has potential hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. Future studies are needed to investigate its pharmacological potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPilosocereus 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3abody weight changes 3acaatinga 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3afemales 3afever 3aheart 3ahematologic tests 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3alipemic effect 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3alungs 3amales 3amice 3anitrites 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aspleen 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3atriacylglycerols 3aurine 0aXique-xique 0aRepeated-dose toxicity 0aOxidative stress 0aHyperpyrexia 0aCactus1 ada Silva, Wliana Alves Viturino1 aFerreira, Magda Rhayanny Assunção1 aPaiva, Patrícia Maria Guedes1 ade Medeiros, Paloma Lys1 aSoares, Luiz Alberto Lira1 aCarvalho, Bruno Melo1 aNapoleão, Thiago Henrique0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 Apr. 24, v. 234 p.96-105dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012800164300001600292520093000308592002801238650002201266650001101288650002701299650002501326650002001351650002101371650001601392650001801408650001301426650002001439650001501459700001801474700001601492700001701508773008901525856008501614852000901699655001201708IND60084382520221116162455.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008438252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yi10aEffects of dissolved oxygen and influent COD/N ratios on nitrogen removal in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland  ap. 107-111.  aHorizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (SSF CW) provides good conditions to denitrification but the ability of this system to nitrify NH₄ ⁺–N is limited. The performance response of SSF CW to simulated wastewater with different COD/N (chemical oxygen demand: TN in influent) ratios was studied during an 8-month period in greenhouse conditions to improve the removal of NH₄ ⁺–N. In this study, several wetland litters were hydrolyzed to get relevant carbon extracting solution, which was applied to the wetland systems. During the nitrification process, the variation of dissolved oxygen (DO) with COD/N ratios had a significant effect on the removal of NH₄ ⁺–N. It was found that the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency increased with COD/N ratios. Appropriate control of the carbon or nitrogen source concentration and the COD/N ratio in the influent could achieve the optimal nitrogen removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3agreenhouses 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3asubsurface flow 3awastewater1 aSong, Xinshan1 aWang, Yuhui1 aYan, Denghua0 tEcological engineering.g2012 Sept., v. 46 p.107-111dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245014100161300001800302500001900320520139400339592002801733650001701761650001901778650001101797650001601808650002301824650002601847650002001873650002601893650001301919650001801932700001701950700001801967700001801985700006402003700006102067700001302128700002602141773014002167856007902307852000902386655001202395IND60655815820221120181558.0190807e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065581582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b012332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yaqing10aEnantiomer and Carbon Isotope Fractionation of α-Hexachlorocyclohexane by Sphingobium indicum Strain B90A and the Corresponding Enzymes  ap. 8715-8724.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChiral organic contaminants, like α-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH), showed isotope fractionation and enantiomer fractionation during biodegradation. This study aims to understand the correlation between these two processes. Initial tests of α-HCH degradation by six Sphingobium strains (with different LinA variants) were conducted. Results showed variable enantiomer selectivity over the time course. In contrast, constant enantiomer selectivity was observed in experiments employing (i) cell suspensions, (ii) crude extracts, or (iii) LinA1 and LinA2 enzymes of strain B90A for α-HCH degradation in enzyme activity assay buffer. The average value of enantioselectivity (ES) were −0.45 ± 0.03 (cell suspensions), −0.60 ± 0.05 (crude extracts), and 1 (LinA1) or −1 (LinA2). The average carbon isotope enrichment factors (εc) of (+)α- and (−)α-HCH were increased from cells suspensions (−6.3 ± 0.1‰ and −2.3 ± 0.03‰) over crude extracts (−7.7 ± 0.4‰ and −3.4 ± 0.02‰) to purified enzymes (−11.1 ± 0.3‰ and −3.8 ± 0.2‰). The variability of ES and the εc were discussed based on the effect of mass transport and degradation rates. Our study demonstrates that enantiomer and isotope fractionation of α-HCH are two independent processes and both are affected by underlying reactions of individual enzymes and mass transport to a different extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphingomonas 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3aenvironmental science 3aenzyme activity 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3amass transfer1 aWu, Langping1 aKohli, Puneet1 aKumar, Roshan1 aStryhanyuk, Hryhoriy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0843-65331 aNijenhuis, Ivonne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9737-95011 aLal, Rup1 aRichnow, Hans-Hermann0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 July 03, v. 53, no. 15 p.8715-8724dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b012333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015500172506010400327506007600431520189100507592002802398506003702426650001102463650003102474650001702505650001502522650001302537650002102550650001002571650001202581650001002593653003102603653003302634653002002667653001502687653002502702700002002727700002202747700003402769700002902803700001902832700002402851773010902875856008402984852000903068655001203077IND60780362620221207102711.0220816e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078036262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2022.1054652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodwin, Richard J.14aThe effects of traffic management systems on the yield and economics of crops grown in deep, shallow and zero tilled sandy loam soil over eight years.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper reports on a 3 × 3 factorial study to consider the effects of controlled traffic (CTF), low tyre inflation pressure (high flexion) tyres (LTP) and standard tyre inflation pressure (STP) farming systems for deep, shallow and zero tillage practices on the yield of wheat, barley, oats and field beans grown in a sandy loam soil in the UK. The main effect of tillage showed that the zero tillage option significantly (***P < 0.001) reduced crop yields in four out of the five of the first crop years, with no significant effect in years two, six and eight and exceeded the yield of the other tillage treatments in year seven. The specific costs of the alternative tillage systems were estimated, from which the cost saving for zero tillage compared to deep tillage was c. £ 60 ha⁻¹ (US$ 80 ha⁻¹), which compensated for the overall loss in yield. There were no significant differences between the crop yields from the deep and shallow tillage treatments, with shallow tillage offering savings in operational costs of c. £ 30 ha⁻¹ (US$ 40 ha⁻¹). Overall, the controlled traffic farming system, where 30% of the field was trafficked, produced 4% greater crop yields (*P < 0.05), worth £ 39 ha⁻¹ (US$ 53 ha⁻¹) than standard tyre inflation pressures (STP). The estimated effect of reducing the trafficked area to 15% resulted in a further 3% increase in mean yield with a corresponding total increase in crop value of 7% worth £ 74 ha⁻¹ (US$ 100 ha⁻¹) compared to the STP system. The beneficial effect of low inflation pressure tyres (70 kPa and 80 kPa) on crop yields, for the deep tillage treatment, was significantly greater (*P < 0.05) than those of the standard tyre pressure system (100 kPa to 150 kPa) returning an average 3.9% additional crop yield over the period of the experiment worth £ 39 ha⁻¹ (US$ 53 ha⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abarley 3acontrolled traffic systems 3adeep tillage 3ano-tillage 3aresearch 3asandy loam soils 3atires 3atraffic 3awheat 0aControlled traffic farming 0aLow tyre inflation pressures 0aTillage systems 0aCrop yield 0aProduction economics1 aWhite, David R.1 aDickin, Edward T.1 aKaczorowska-Dolowy, Magdalena1 aMillington, William A.J.1 aPope, Emily K.1 aMisiewicz, Paula A.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2022 Sept., v. 223 p.105465-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.1054653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245008500213300001600298520124000314592002801554596007501582596005901657650002001716650001401736650002901750650002201779650001801801651001101819700003101830700003401861700003601895773013301931856008302064852000902147655001202156IND60680853320221118021628.0200325e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068085332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-019-02941-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRelva, Stefania Gomes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0261-914410aTransmittance index characterization at two solar measurement stations in Brazil  ap. 205-219.  aThis paper constructs probability density distributions of direct normal, diffuse horizontal, and global horizontal irradiance for 1-min clearness indexes kb, kd, and kₜ, respectively. Previous studies on the clearness index, conditioned to the optical air mass, are analyzed and distributions of these three indexes, using data from two solarimetric stations in Brazil, are presented. The pattern found in probability density distributions, in general, matches the patterns found in the literature. The 50th percentile (P50) of kb values from Sao Paulo city (a location with high levels of pollution) is 0.22, and from the countryside region of the state of Sao Paulo (a location with expected low levels of pollution), it is 0.55. Regarding kₜ values, P50 is 0.57 and 0.72 for these two regions, respectively. We conclude that different atmospheric conditions result in a different dependence relation between probability density distribution and air mass increases. These conditions include not only cloud formation, but also pollution levels and the influence of relative humidity. These specific results endorse the need for local radiation measurements to the characterization of few-minute average of transmittance indexes.  aPublisher supplied data  axxxxxcConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aPD-0061-0043/2014cCompanhia Energética de São Paulo 3alight intensity 3apollution 3aprobability distribution 3arelative humidity 3atransmittance 3aBrazil1 aGimenes, André Luiz Veiga1 aMorales Udaeta, Miguel Edgar,1 aGalvão, Luiz Cláudio Ribeiro,0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Jan., v. 139, no. 1-2 p.205-219dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02941-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010900168300001500277520093200292592002801224650001701252650001801269650001701287650001701304650001601321653002301337653002201360653002801382700002801410700002401438700002301462773007701485856008301562852000901645655001201654IND60096976420221121205156.0160903e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009697642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2013.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardos, Eva10aAssessing the potential of hybrid fossil–solar thermal plants for energy policy making: Brayton cycles  ap. 99-106.  aThis paper proposes a first study in-depth of solar–fossil hybridization from a general perspective. It develops a set of useful parameters for analyzing and comparing hybrid plants, it studies the case of hybridizing Brayton cycles with current solar technologies and shows a tentative extrapolation of the results to integrated combined cycle systems (ISCSS). In particular, three points have been analyzed: the technical requirements for solar technologies to be hybridized with Brayton cycles, the temperatures and pressures at which hybridization would produce maximum power per unit of fossil fuel, and their mapping to current solar technologies and Brayton cycles. Major conclusions are that a hybrid plant works in optimum conditions which are not equal to those of the solar or power blocks considered independently, and that hybridizing at the Brayton cycle of a combined cycle could be energetically advantageous.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy policy 3afossil fuels 3asolar energy 3atemperature 0aHybrid power plant 0aEnergy efficiency 0aTools for policy making1 aLópez Moreno, Ignacio,1 aRodríguez, Javier,1 aAbánades, Alberto0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Nov., v. 62 p.99-106dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016300154300001800317520037600335592002800711650001400739650002600753650002100779650001300800650001100813650001700824650001100841650001400852700001600866700001600882700001500898700001800913700001200931700001300943700001700956700001800973700001600991773014101007856007401148852000901222655001201231IND60670624720221118081317.0191002e20140408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067062472DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta15335e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jisen10aMetal–organic framework templated nitrogen and sulfur co-doped porous carbons as highly efficient metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions  ap. 6316-6319.  aA novel MOF-templated nitrogen and sulphur co-doped porous material has been synthesized as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) for the first time.

In the current study the existence of D2L-5-HT2A heteroreceptor complexes was demonstrated also in discrete regions of the ventral and dorsal striatum with in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA). The hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists LSD and DOI but not the standard 5-HT2AR agonist TCB2 and 5-HT significantly increased the density of D2like antagonist 3H-raclopride binding sites and significantly reduced the pKiH values of the high affinity D2R agonist binding sites in 3H-raclopride/DA competition experiments. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells and in ventral striatum. The effects of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists on D2R density and affinity were blocked by the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin. In a forskolin-induced CRE-luciferase reporter gene assay using cotransfected but not D2R singly transfected HEK293 cells DOI and LSD but not TCB2 significantly enhanced the D2LR agonist quinpirole induced inhibition of CRE-luciferase activity. Haloperidol blocked the effects of both quinpirole alone and the enhancing actions of DOI and LSD while ketanserin only blocked the enhancing actions of DOI and LSD. The mechanism for the allosteric enhancement of the D2R protomer recognition and signalling observed is likely mediated by a biased agonist action of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists at the orthosteric site of the 5-HT2AR protomer. This mechanism may contribute to the psychotic actions of LSD and DOI and the D2-5-HT2A heteroreceptor complex may thus be a target for the psychotic actions of hallunicogenic 5-HT2A agonists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3abinding sites 3adopamine 3ahaloperidol 3aprotein subunits 3areceptors 3areporter genes 3aserotonin 0aG-protein-coupled receptors 0aDopamine D2 receptor 0aSerotonin 5-HT2A receptor 0aLysergic acid diethylamide 0a2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine 0aAntipsychotic drugs 0aHeterodimerization 0aHeteroreceptor complexes 0aAllosteric modulation 0aReceptor–receptor interactions1 aRomero-Fernandez, Wilber1 aNarvaez, Manuel1 aOflijan, Julia1 aAgnati, Luigi F.1 aFuxe, Kjell0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Jan. 03, v. 443 p.278-284dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012400168300001800292520133900310592002801649650001201677650001601689650001101705650002401716650002001740650001101760650001201771651001001783653002601793653004601819653003201865700001801897700001901915773008001934856008302014852000902097655001202106IND60096976520221121164432.0160903e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009697652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2013.07.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yixiang10aAntecedents of employee electricity saving behavior in organizations: An empirical study based on norm activation model  ap. 1120-1127.  aChina is one of the major energy-consuming countries, and is under great pressure to promote energy saving and reduce domestic energy consumption. Employees constitute an important target group for energy saving. However, only a few research efforts have been paid to study what drives employee energy saving behavior in organizations. To fill this gap, drawing on norm activation model (NAM), we built a research model to study antecedents of employee electricity saving behavior in organizations. The model was empirically tested using survey data collected from office workers in Beijing, China. Results show that personal norm positively influences employee electricity saving behavior. Organizational electricity saving climate negatively moderates the effect of personal norm on electricity saving behavior. Awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, and organizational electricity saving climate positively influence personal norm. Furthermore, awareness of consequences positively influences ascription of responsibility. This paper contributes to the energy saving behavior literature by building a theoretical model of employee electricity saving behavior which is understudied in the current literature. Based on the empirical results, implications on how to promote employee electricity saving are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3ahuman resources 3amodels 3asurveys 3aChina 0aNorm activation model 0aOrganizational electricity saving climate 0aElectricity saving behavior1 aWang, Zhaohua1 aZhou, Guanghui0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Nov., v. 62 p.1120-1127dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.07.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245004800161300001600209500001900225520157400244592002801818650002101846650002001867650000901887650001801896650001401914650002101928650001701949650001701966650001401983650001801997650002102015650001702036653002602053653002402079700001702103700001502120700001602135773013702151856007902288852000902367655001202376IND60717744720221118024159.0201116e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071774472DNAL7 a10.1139/cjps-2019-02292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yunpeng10aDormancy breakage in Cercis chinensis seeds  ap. 666-673.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe seeds of Cercis chinensis Bunge are important for reproduction and propagation, but strong dormancy controls their germination. To elucidate the causes of seed dormancy in C. chinensis, we investigated the permeability of the hard seed coat and the contribution of the endosperm to physical dormancy, and we examined the effect of extracts from the seed coat and endosperm. In addition, the effectiveness of scarification methods to break seed dormancy was compared. Cercis chinensis seeds exhibited physical and physiological dormancy. The hard seed coat played an important role in limiting water uptake, and the endosperm acted as a physical barrier that restricted embryo development in imbibed seeds. Germination percentage of Chinese cabbage [Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis (L.) Hanelt] seeds was reduced from 98% (control) to 28.3% and 56.7% with a seed-coat extract and an endosperm extract, respectively. This demonstrated that both the seed coat and endosperm contained endogenous inhibitors, but the seed-coat extract resulted in stronger inhibition. Mechanical scarification, thermal scarification, and chemical scarification had positive effects on C. chinensis seed germination. Soaking non-scarified seeds in gibberellic acid (GA₃) solution did not promote germination; however, treatment with exogenous GA₃ following scarification significantly improved germination. The optimal method for promoting C. chinensis seed germination was soaking scarified seeds in 500 mg·L⁻¹ GA₃ for 24 h followed by cold stratification at 5 °C for 2 mo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercis chinensis 3aChinese cabbage 3acold 3aembryogenesis 3aendosperm 3agibberellic acid 3apermeability 3areproduction 3aseed coat 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3awater uptake 0aendogenous inhibitors 0acold stratification1 aZhu, Mingwei1 aMa, Qiuyue1 aLi, Shuxian0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2020 May 27, v. 100, no. 6 p.666-673dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1933x1918-18337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2019-02293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100001900200245008800219300001600307520025200323592002800575650000900603650002400612650001400636650001500650650001200665650001800677650001200695650001100707650003100718650000900749650000900758650002400767650005700791650006300848653002400911653001400935653001600949653000900965653001800974700002500992700001801017773011601035852000901151856008301160655001201243IND9103136720221118010506.0190611e19900401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910313672DNAL7 a21145042pmid7 a10.1258/0023677907808901302doi4 a0023-6772(19900401)24:2L.156;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDettman, C.

However, the limited solubility and poor bioavailability of PTs hinder their clinical use. Crude plant extracts may have a greater activity than isolated constituents of the equivalent dosage. In this study, an Eriobotrya japonica (loquat leaves) extract (triterpenoid composition of loquat leaves, TCLL) with enriched PTs such as UA was prepared. The study aims to compare the HNE inhibitory (HNEI) effect in vitro and the therapeutic effect on acute lung injury (ALI) in vivo between TCLL and UA.An HNEI activity bioassay was performed with Sivelestat sodium hydrate as a positive control. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammatory model was established to evaluate TCLL's therapeutic effect on ALI in vivo. The absorption of UA in TCLL and in UA alone was determined using a Caco-2 cell uptake model and LC-MS.The IC50 values of TCLL and UA for the HNEI effect were 3.26 ± 0.56 μg/mL and 8.49 ± 0.42 μg/mL (P < 0.01), respectively. TCLL significantly improved the inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokine production in mice compared with the LPS group (P < 0.05). Additionally, it performed better than the UA alone group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the uptake by Caco-2 cells of UA in TCLL was higher than that in UA alone (P < 0.05).TCLL has a significant HNEI effect in vitro and a therapeutic effect on LPS-induced inflammation in a mouse model. Both the effects are more efficient than UA. Improved absorption of PTs in TCLL may be one explanation for these results.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEriobotrya japonica 3aabsorption 3aanimal models 3abioassays 3abioavailability 3abronchitis 3acytokines 3aelastase 3aenzyme inhibition 3aherbal medicines 3ahuman cell lines 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3alipopolysaccharides 3aloquats 3alungs 3amice 3aneutrophils 3aplant extracts 3asodium 3asolubility 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3aursolic acid 3aChina 3aJapan 0aPTs 0aUA 0aHNE 0aTCLL 0aLLs 0aLPS 0aALI 0a1H NMR 0aHPLC 0aDEX 0aLC-MS 0aBALF 0aDMSO 0aLoquat leaves 0aPentacyclic triterpenoids 0aHuman neutrophil elastase 0aAcute lung injury 0aCaco-2 cells1 aXu, Hao-Yang1 aWu, Yu-Juan1 aZhang, Xing1 aZhang, Liu-Qiang1 aLi, Yi-Ming0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 Oct. 05, v. 242 p.111713-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245018600206300001800392500001900410520153100429592002801960650000901988650001301997650002102010650003402031650002702065650001802092650001502110650001902125650001502144650001902159651001102178651001702189700002102206700001702227700001602244700002202260700005602282700002702338773014002365856007902505852000902584655001202593IND60655816220221120145616.0190807e20190624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065581622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b013372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGewurtz, Sarah B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1997-133610aPerfluoroalkyl Acids in Great Lakes Precipitation and Surface Water (2006–2018) Indicate Response to Phase-outs, Regulatory Action, and Variability in Fate and Transport Processes  ap. 8543-8552.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were determined in precipitation from three locations across the Great Lakes between 2006 and 2018 and compared to those in surface water. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) concentrations generally decreased in precipitation, likely in response to phase-outs/regulatory actions. In comparison, concentrations of shorter-chained PFAA, which are not regulated in Canada did not decrease and those of perfluorohexanoate and perfluorobutanoate (PFBA) recently increased, which could be due to their use as replacements, as the longer-chained PFAAs are being phased-out by industry. PFOS and PFOA concentrations were greater in Lake Ontario precipitation than in precipitation from more remote locations. In comparison, PFBA concentrations were comparable across locations, suggesting greater atmospheric transport either through its more volatile precursors and/or directly in association with particles/aerosols. In Lake Ontario, the comparison of PFAAs in precipitation to those in surface water provides evidence of sources (e.g., street dust and wastewater effluent) in addition to wet deposition to surface water, whereas wet deposition appears to be dominant in Lakes Huron and Superior. Our results suggest that source control of shorter-chained PFAAs may be slow to be reflected in environmental concentrations due to emissions far from the location of detection and continued volatilization from existing in-use products and waste streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3adust 3aindustry 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asurface water 3atechnology 3avolatilization 3awastewater 3awet deposition 3aCanada 3aLake Ontario1 aBradley, Lisa E.1 aBackus, Sean1 aDove, Alice1 aMcGoldrick, Daryl1 aHung, Hayley1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0719-89481 aDryfhout-Clark, Helena0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 June 24, v. 53, no. 15 p.8543-8552dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b013373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245008700193300001800280520096600298592002801264650001001292650001601302650001401318650001201332650001501344650001301359650002201372650001201394650001101406650001401417650002701431650002101458650001201479650001401491650002701505650001501532650003001547650002201577650003401599650004901633651001301682651001301695700002001708700002101728700002001749700001701769700002401786700002201810700002101832700002301853773009901876856008401975852000902059655001202068IND60086653120221118220806.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008665312DNAL7 a219033112pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2011.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Allyson K.10aMercury exposure in terrestrial birds far downstream of an historical point source  ap. 3302-3308.  aMercury (Hg) is a persistent environmental contaminant found in many freshwater and marine ecosystems. Historical Hg contamination in rivers can impact the surrounding terrestrial ecosystem, but there is little known about how far downstream this contamination persists. In 2009, we sampled terrestrial forest songbirds at five floodplain sites up to 137 km downstream of an historical source of Hg along the South and South Fork Shenandoah Rivers (Virginia, USA). We found that blood total Hg concentrations remained elevated over the entire sampling area and there was little evidence of decline with distance. While it is well known that Hg is a pervasive and long-lasting aquatic contaminant, it has only been recently recognized that it also biomagnifies effectively in floodplain forest food webs. This study extends the area of concern for terrestrial habitats near contaminated rivers for more than 100 km downstream from a waterborne Hg point source.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3afloodplains 3afood webs 3aforests 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3amarine ecosystems 3amercury 3arivers 3asongbirds 3aterrestrial ecosystems 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aFood Chain 2aMercuryxbloodxtoxicity. 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSongbirdsxbloodxphysiology. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxbloodxtoxicity. 3aVirginia 0aVirginia1 aEvers, David C.1 aFolsom, Sarah B.1 aCondon, Anne M.1 aDiener, John1 aGoodrick, Lizzie F.1 aMcGann, Andrew J.1 aSchmerfeld, John1 aCristol, Daniel A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2011 Dec., v. 159, no. 12 p.3302-3308dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2011.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015300163300001400316520132200330592002801652650001501680650001301695650002101708650001501729650001301744650002601757650001801783650001301801650001701814650001101831650001501842653003201857653001201889653001301901653000801914653002301922700001701945700002301962700001901985700001602004700001502020700001602035700001302051773010902064856008302173852000902256655001202265IND60628581920221119172154.0200712e20180530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062858192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.01.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Dawei12aA novel label-free photoelectrochemical sensor based on N,S-GQDs and CdS co-sensitized hierarchical Zn2SnO4 cube for detection of cardiac troponin I  ap. 14-20.  aA novel label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor based on graphene quantum dots doped with nitrogen and sulfur (N,S-GQDs) and CdS co-sensitized hierarchical Zn₂SnO₄ cube was fabricated to detect cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The unique hierarchical Zn₂SnO₄ cube was synthesized successfully by the solvothermal method, which has a large specific surface to load functional materials. N,S-GQDs nanoparticles were assembled to the surface of cubic Zn₂SnO₄ coated ITO electrode, which efficiently accelerated the electronic transition and improved photo-to-current conversion efficiency. Then, CdS nanoparticles further were modified by in-situ growth method to form Zn₂SnO₄/N,S-GQDs/CdS composite with prominent photocurrent, which was 30 times that of the Zn₂SnO₄ cube alone. In this work, the specific immune recognition between cTnI antigens and cTnI antibodies (anti-cTnI) reduced the intensity of the photoelectric signal. And the intensity decreased linearly with the logarithm of cTnI concentration range from 0.001 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.3 pg/mL. With high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, good stability and reproducibility, the fabricated PEC sensor showed promising applications in the sensor, clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction and PEC analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aelectric current 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3amyocardial infarction 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aquantum dots 3asulfur 3atroponin I 0aPhotoelectrochemical sensor 0aZn2SnO4 0aN,S-GQDs 0aCdS 0aCardiac troponin I1 aBao, Chunzhu1 aKhan, Malik Saddam1 aWang, Chuanlei1 aZhang, Yong1 aLiu, Qinze1 aZhang, Xian1 aWei, Qin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 May 30, v. 106 p.14-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.01.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245007500183520216200258592002802420650002002448650004102468650002302509650001802532650001402550650002502564650002702589650002402616650001102640650001502651650001602666650002402682651001102706653002002717653002102737653002702758653001702785700003202802700002302834700003302857700002802890700002702918773011502945856008803060852000903148655001203157IND60780363120221118043510.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078036312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.1056952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrer-Miranda, Edyniesky10aAssessment of the foot-and-mouth disease surveillance system in Brazil  aIn 2021, the 88th General Session of the World Assembly of National Delegates to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) recognized the estates of Acre, Paraná, the Rio Grande do Sul, and Rondônia as being free of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) without vaccination. The certification was also extended to some cities in Amazonas and Mato Grosso. The new national strategic plan for 2026, which focuses on creating and maintaining sustainable conditions to expand FMD-free zones without vaccination, imposes new challenges and requires continuous evaluation of the FMD surveillance system. The objective of this research was to evaluate the FMD surveillance system in Brazil using quantitative models through Bayesian network approaches. The research was conducted using the Continental Surveillance and Information System (SivCont) database for Official Veterinary Services in Brazil, which refers to notified vesicular syndromes. The data on states, reported diseases, source of notification, disease confirmation, and timeliness (TL in days) of the delay by owners in notifying (TL.1) after a suspected case of the disease, and the response of Brazilian Veterinary Services after being notified (TL.2), were analysed. The collected data were analysed using Bayesian networks. It was observed that diseases with symptoms identical to FMD are the most notified events. TL.1 was long (mean of 18.96, CI: 18.33–19.59), and a low number of notifications was observed throughout the study period, which increases the chances of disseminating FMD in the population. Meanwhile, TL.2 suggests appropriate effectiveness of the Veterinary Services responding to suspected cases of FMD with interventions in less than 24 h (mean of 1, CI: 0.68–1.31). This study evaluated the performance of Brazilian Veterinary Services facing the report of vesicular diseases in the period 2004–2018. The results can help the states improve the surveillance system and the transition to the vaccination stop. Furthermore, the analytical method presented in the paper could serve as a model for other countries to evaluate the effectiveness of FMD surveillance systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aWorld Organization for Animal Health 3aanalytical methods 3acertification 3adatabases 3adisease surveillance 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3ainformation systems 3amodels 3amonitoring 3avaccination 3aveterinary medicine 3aBrazil 0aRisk assessment 0aBayesian network 0aFoot-and-mouth disease 0aSurveillance1 aFonseca-Rodríguez, Osvaldo1 aAlbuquerque, Jones1 aAlmeida, Erivânia Camelo de1 aTadeu Cristino, Claudio1 aSantoro, Kleber Régis0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2022 Aug., v. 205 p.105695-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.1056953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012300166300001400289520110600303592002801409650001501437650001501452650002501467700002101492773009501513856008101608990002301689852000901712655001201721IND60093445320221120091636.0141103e20120912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009344532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2012.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrzić, Danica10aSome practical aspects of nonlinear frequency response method for investigation of adsorption equilibrium and kinetics  ap. 62-72.  aSome practical aspects regarding application of the nonlinear frequency response (NFR) method for investigation of gas adsorption: choice of the optimal mass of the adsorbent, frequency range and input amplitude, are studied theoretically. For successful application of the NFR method, reliable experimental determination of the second-order frequency response function (FRF) is essential. In order to analyse the influence of the mass of the adsorbent, the frequency range and the input amplitude on the accuracy of the estimated the second-order FRF, frequency responses (FRs) of a batch adsorber with volume modulation are simulated and used for calculation of the second-order FRF. Furthermore, the procedure for estimation of the optimal mass of the adsorbent, required frequency range and input amplitude, based on simple preliminary step responses, is proposed. In order to demonstrate the procedure, responses of the batch adsorber for the step volume change are also simulated. The proposed procedure enables establishment of the efficient experimental plan for application of the NFR method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering1 aPetkovska, Menka0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Sept. 12, v. 82 p.62-72dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.07.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01532naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005400171300001200225520065100237592002800888650002600916650000900942650002000951650002300971650001100994700002101005700002601026773008401052856008501136852000901221655001201230IND60084383220221116162533.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008438322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeurich, Robert10aImprovement of fish passage in culverts using CFD  ap. 1-8.  aUpstream migration of fish through circular culverts is often prevented by velocities in the barrel being higher than that of the natural channel. In this investigation a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model has been used to test the effects of various spoiler baffle geometries in culverts of varying size to reduce water velocity and increase water depth and thus increase the upstream passage of small fish species. Results indicated that standard baffles designed for specific fish species or groups could be successfully retrofitted to culverts of varying dimensions. Subsequent field tests have confirmed the effectiveness of the design.  aPublisher supplied data 3afield experimentation 3afish 3afluid mechanics 3amigratory behavior 3amodels1 aBoubee, Jacques,1 aOlsen, Nils Reidar B.0 tEcological engineering.g2012 Oct., v. 47 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002700169245013200196300001800328520102800346592002801374650001801402650000801420650001801428650001401446650001701460650001201477650001901489650001301508650001501521650001301536650001301549650002101562650000701583650001501590650001101605650001901616650001801635650001601653650002901669650002901698650002401727650002001751650003001771650002201801650002001823651001101843651001101854651001101865700002301876700002001899700002301919773009901942856008402041852000902125655001202134IND60086653220221118221032.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008665322DNAL7 a218621902pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2011.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPihl Karlsson, Gunilla10aReduced European emissions of S and N – Effects on air concentrations, deposition and soil water chemistry in Swedish forests  ap. 3571-3582.  aChanges in sulphur and nitrogen pollution in Swedish forests have been assessed in relation to European emission reductions, based on measurements in the Swedish Throughfall Monitoring Network. Measurements were analysed over 20 years with a focus on the 12-year period 1996 to 2008. Air concentrations of SO₂ and NO₂, have decreased. The SO₄-deposition has decreased in parallel with the European emission reductions. Soil water SO₄-concentrations have decreased at most sites but the pH, ANC and inorganic Al-concentrations indicated acidification recovery only at some of the sites. No changes in the bulk deposition of inorganic nitrogen could be demonstrated. Elevated NO₃-concentrations in the soil water occurred at irregular occasions at some southern sites. Despite considerable air pollution emission reductions in Europe, acidification recovery in Swedish forests soils is slow. Nitrogen deposition to Swedish forests continues at elevated levels that may lead to leaching of nitrate to surface waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aair 3aair pollution 3aemissions 3aforest soils 3aforests 3ahydrochemistry 3aleaching 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3apH 3asoil water 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3asurface water 3athroughfall 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aNitrogenxchemistry 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aSulfurxchemistry 2aWaterxanalysis 3aEurope 0aEurope 0aSweden1 aAkselsson, Cecilia1 aHellsten, Sofie1 aKarlsson, Per Erik0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2011 Dec., v. 159, no. 12 p.3571-3582dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2011.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014600166300001600312520168300328592002802011650002502039650003702064650001802101650001502119650000902134650001602143650001502159650001602174650001202190650001902202650001702221650002302238650001002261700002502271700002402296700002402320773009602344856008102440852000902521655001202530IND60514878520221118035514.0160303e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051487852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-015-3511-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZwolak, Rafał10aAdvantages of masting in European beech: timing of granivore satiation and benefits of seed caching support the predator dispersal hypothesis  ap. 749-758.  aThe predator satiation and predator dispersal hypotheses provide alternative explanations for masting. Both assume satiation of seed-eating vertebrates. They differ in whether satiation occurs before or after seed removal and caching by granivores (predator satiation and predator dispersal, respectively). This difference is largely unrecognized, but it is demographically important because cached seeds are dispersed and often have a microsite advantage over nondispersed seeds. We conducted rodent exclosure experiments in two mast and two nonmast years to test predictions of the predator dispersal hypothesis in our study system of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica). Specifically, we tested whether the fraction of seeds removed from the forest floor is similar during mast and nonmast years (i.e., lack of satiation before seed caching), whether masting decreases the removal of cached seeds (i.e., satiation after seed storage), and whether seed caching increases the probability of seedling emergence. We found that masting did not result in satiation at the seed removal stage. However, masting decreased the removal of cached seeds, and seed caching dramatically increased the probability of seedling emergence relative to noncached seeds. European beech thus benefits from masting through the satiation of scatterhoarders that occurs only after seeds are removed and cached. Although these findings do not exclude other evolutionary advantages of beech masting, they indicate that fitness benefits of masting extend beyond the most commonly considered advantages of predator satiation and increased pollination efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApodemus flavicollis 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aforest litter 3aherbivores 3amice 3apollination 3aprediction 3aprobability 3asatiety 3aseed predation 3aseed storage 3aseedling emergence 3aseeds1 aBogdziewicz, Michał1 aWróbel, Aleksandra1 aCrone, Elizabeth E.0 tOecologia.g2016 Mar., v. 180, no. 3 p.749-758dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3511-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245003900202300001800241506007600259520116500335592002801500506003701528650002401565650000901589650001701598650001801615650001301633653002001646653001701666653003001683653002101713700002101734700001701755700002101772773012301793856007501916852000901991655001202000IND60528839320221207141437.0160717e20150311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052883932DNAL7 a10.1021/am508046g2doi7 aPMC43580742pmcid7 a257101882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorello, Giovanni10aElectrospun Amplified Fiber Optics  ap. 5213-5218.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAll-optical signal processing is the focus of much research aiming to obtain effective alternatives to existing data transmission platforms. Amplification of light in fiber optics, such as in Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, is especially important for efficient signal transmission. However, the complex fabrication methods involving high-temperature processes performed in a highly pure environment slow the fabrication process and make amplified components expensive with respect to an ideal, high-throughput, room temperature production. Here, we report on near-infrared polymer fiber amplifiers working over a band of ∼20 nm. The fibers are cheap, spun with a process entirely carried out at room temperature, and shown to have amplified spontaneous emission with good gain coefficients and low levels of optical losses (a few cm–¹). The amplification process is favored by high fiber quality and low self-absorption. The found performance metrics appear to be suitable for short-distance operations, and the large variety of commercially available doping dyes might allow for effective multiwavelength operations by electrospun amplified fiber optics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aambient temperature 3adyes 3afiber optics 3afiber quality 3apolymers 0aelectrospinning 0aoptical gain 0aplastic optical amplifier 0adye-doped fibers1 aCamposeo, Andrea1 aMoffa, Maria1 aPisignano, Dario0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Mar. 11, v. 7, no. 9 p.5213-5218dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam508046g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100005900183245011300242300001800355506007600373520052500449592002800974506003701002650001201039650001201051650001401063650002501077650001301102650002401115650001301139700006101152700005801213700005901271700005701330700006001387773014701447856007601594852000901670655001201679IND60632395420221207124416.0190314e20190207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063239542DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b133902doi7 aPMC64609262pmcid7 a307310382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawakita, Kento1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1471-159710aBis(imido)vanadium(V)-Catalyzed [2+2+1] Coupling of Alkynes and Azobenzenes Giving Multisubstituted Pyrroles  ap. 4194-4198.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe combination of VCl₃(THF)₃ and N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)aniline (1a) is an efficient catalyst for the [2+2+1] coupling reaction of alkynes and azobenzenes, giving multisubstituted pyrroles.

Polyphenols were quantified using LC-MS/MS technique. Baicalein and amentoflavone were identified in higher amount in relation to other phenols. Intracellular antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity of algae extracts were evaluated on the human prostate cancer cell line PC3. Although presented biomolecules in the extracts have demonstrated in vitro antioxidant activity, they did not show a significant effect on PC3 cells.

Therefore, our objective was to determine the effect of PEDV infection on the protein profile of the jejunum using 2D-differential in gel electrophoresis (DIGE). Sixteen gilts (n = 8/treatment; 16.7 ± 0.98 kg BW) were gastrically inoculated with PEDV (PED) or saline (CON). After 7 d of infection, pigs were euthanized, whole jejunum was collected, and proteins were analyzed using 2D-DIGE. PEDV infection resulted in severe jejunum villus atrophy and attenuated villi to crypt ratios compared to CON pigs. Compared to CON, relative abundance of 141 protein spots was significantly different (P < 0.05) in PEDV infected jejunum. Compared to the CON, the PED pigs exhibited a 21% increase in the apoptosis marker Annexin A5 (P = 0.036), 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (11%, P < 0.01), prolyl 4-hydroxylase β polypeptide (7%, P = 0.040), and the intermediate metabolism enzyme L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain (13%, P < 0.001). PED infection resulted in a 15% decrease of the structural proteins tubulin and α- and β-actin compared to the CON (P < 0.05). The immune signal transducer, TNF-receptor associated factor 6, was also decreased (23%, P < 0.05) in PED pigs.

In addition to many SNPs responsible for the nonsecretor phenotype, five nonfunctional alleles (se) resulting from copy number variations have been reported. One of the five alleles generated by an unequal crossover between FUT2 and a pseudogene (SEC1), is seᶠᵘˢ. This allele may be misidentified as a functional allele if only common inactivating SNPs are genotyped because it contains the 3ʹ region of the functional FUT2. Therefore, accurate detection of seᶠᵘˢ is desirable. For this purpose, a high‐resolution melting (HRM) analysis is developed for detection of seᶠᵘˢ in which a 284bp fragment of SEC1 and seᶠᵘˢ but not FUT2, are amplified. This HRM analysis detected seᶠᵘˢ reliably. Thus, an initial screening or prescreening for seᶠᵘˢ using HRM analysis seems to be useful for association studies of FUT2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aelectrophoresis 3agenotyping 3aphenotype 3apseudogenes1 aKoda, Yoshiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1368-01160 tElectrophoresis.g2021 Feb., v. 42, no. 3 p.315-318dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2020002413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012500156300002000281520109700301592002801398650002301426650002301449650001601472650002001488650002801508650002101536650002401557650002201581650001801603650001501621650001101636650001301647650001401660700001601674700001601690700001801706700001701724773012401741856007401865852000901939655001201948IND60667273120221117182013.0190919e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066727312DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra17119e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Debao10aFacile synthesis of CeO₂ decorated Ni(OH)₂ hierarchical composites for enhanced electrocatalytic sensing of H₂O₂  ap. 24101-24109.  aCeO₂–Ni(OH)₂ composites with hierarchical structures were synthesized via a facile one-pot hydrothermal method, which were constructed with Ni(OH)₂ nanosheets decorated with in situ formed CeO₂ nanoparticles on their surface. The composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. The results of nitrogen adsorption–desorption, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and amperometry demonstrated that CeO₂ and Ni(OH)₂ components of CeO₂–Ni(OH)₂ hierarchical architectures showed a synergistic contribution on the improvement of electrochemical activity toward H₂O₂. The oxidation current was linearly related to the H₂O₂ concentration from 0.5 μM to 1.2 mM. The sensor showed a high sensitivity of 4.5 μA μM⁻¹ cm⁻² with a lower detection limit of 0.035 μM (S/N = 3). Moreover, the sensor showed good selectivity, reproducibility and stability. These results demonstrated the feasibility of the synthetic strategy and the potential of the composites as a promising candidate for H₂O₂ sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aoxidation1 aPang, Limei1 aMou, Hongyu1 aZhou, Yanhong1 aSong, Caixia0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 04, v. 5, no. 31 p.24101-24109dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra17119e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011800180300001600298520186800314592002802182650001902210650001702229650001202246650001902258650001102277650001502288650003002303650000902333650002002342650001502362651001202377651001602389653002302405653005002428653002602478653002502504653002902529700002102558700002102579773009202600856008502692852000902777655001202786IND60566235920221120094103.0170406e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056623592DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2015.10753762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Eerd, Marjolein C.J.10aSolidarity in transboundary flood risk management: A view from the Dutch North Rhine–Westphalian catchment area  ap. 261-279.  aClimate change is putting pressure on water systems, and its effects transcend man-made boundaries, making cooperation across territorial borders essential. The governance of transboundary flood risk management calls for solidarity among riparians, as climate change will make river basins more prone to flooding. ‘Solidarity’ means that individuals act to support members of a particular community to which they belong. Recently, the solidarity principle has become institutionalized due to its formalization in the EU Floods Directive. However, it is not clear what solidarity means in the upstream–downstream practices of transboundary flood risk management. Understanding the meaning of solidarity is important for the development of cross-border climate adaptation governance. This article discusses the conceptualization of the solidarity principle and explores its meaning for international cooperation in the Dutch North Rhine–Westphalian border region. Our critical case study reveals that although all actors understand the importance of solidarity, they interpret it differently, often based on self-interest related to their position in the catchment. The formal inclusion of the solidarity principle in the Floods Directive can best be seen as a step in the continuous development of transboundary flood risk governance, as no striking changes in practice have been identified after its formalization. Policy relevance As climate change increasingly puts pressure on river basins and other shared resources, cross-border cooperation and solidarity are seen as increasingly important. This article discusses the meaning of solidarity in practice and reveals how this normative principle may contribute to transboundary climate adaptation governance. Understanding its meaning is important for future cross-border climate adaptation governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afloods 3agovernance 3ainternational cooperation 3arisk 3arisk management 3awatersheds 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 0aclimate adaptation 0aDutch North Rhine–Westphalian border region 0aflood risk management 0asolidarity principle 0atransboundary governance1 aWiering, Mark A.1 aDieperink, Carel0 tClimate Policy.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 17, no. 3 p.261-279dTaylor & Francisx1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2015.10753763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002200191245008600213300001800299520127000317592002801587650001101615650001101626650001101637650001901648650001001667650001801677650001101695650003501706650004201741700002001783700002101803773009101824856008401915990002301999852000902022655001202031IND60087420520221116144207.0141102e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008742052DNAL7 a230225472pmid7 aPMC37450092pmcid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.09.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYahyazadehfar, M.10aHidden contributions of the enamel rods on the fracture resistance of human teeth  ap. 4806-4814.  aThe enamel of human teeth is generally regarded as a brittle material with low fracture toughness. Consequently, the contributions of this tissue in resisting tooth fracture and the importance of its complex microstructure have been largely overlooked. In this study an experimental evaluation of the crack growth resistance of human enamel was conducted to characterize the role of rod (i.e. prism) orientation and degree of decussation on the fracture behavior of this tissue. Incremental crack growth was achieved in-plane, with the rods in directions longitudinal or transverse to their axes. Results showed that the fracture resistance of enamel is both inhomogeneous and spatially anisotropic. Cracks extending transverse to the rods in the outer enamel undergo a lower rise in toughness with extension, and achieve significantly lower fracture resistance than in the longitudinal direction. Though cracks initiating at the surface of teeth may begin extension towards the dentin–enamel junction, they are deflected by the decussated rods and continue growth about the tooth’s periphery, transverse to the rods in the outer enamel. This process facilitates dissipation of fracture energy and averts cracks from extending towards the dentin and vital pulp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenamel 3aenergy 3ahumans 3amicrostructure 3ateeth 2aDental Enamel 2aHumans 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aTooth Fracturesxprevention & control1 aBajaj, Devendra1 aArola, Dwayne D.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Jan., v. 9, no. 1 p.4806-4814dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.09.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245013100191300001600322520173100338592002802069650001402097650001402111650002802125650001802153650001602171650001602187650001102203650001102214650001402225650001902239650001602258650002002274650003102294650001502325651001902340653003202359653001802391653001902409653002602428653001202454700002202466700001602488773012702504856008102631852000902712655001202721IND60651472720221119152233.0190711e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065147272DNAL7 a274519202pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800160018772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Sullivan, Aifric10aEffects of early intervention on dietary intake and its mediating role on cognitive functioning: a randomised controlled trial  ap. 154-164.  aTo investigate the impact of an early intervention programme, Preparing for Life, on dietary intake between 12 and 36 months of age, and the mediating role played by diet on cognitive functioning. A randomised controlled trial evaluation of a community-based home visiting programme. The intervention involved biweekly visits from mentors from pregnancy until age 5 years and parent training at age 2 years. Dietary intake was assessed at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months using an FFQ to calculate the proportion meeting dietary recommendations. Cognitive functioning was measured at 24 and 36 months. Treatment effects were estimated using conventional χ ² tests, permutation testing, inverse probability weighting and the stepdown procedure. Mediation analysis examined the indirect effect of the intervention on cognitive functioning via its effect on dietary intake. Socio-economically disadvantaged communities in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Pregnant women (n 233) were assigned to the intervention (n 115) or control (n 118) group using an unconditional probability randomisation strategy. Positive treatment effects were observed for meeting dietary recommendations for protein foods at 24 (OR=2·52) and 36 (OR=2·42) months, and all food groups at 24 (OR=3·92) months. There were no effects on grain, dairy, fruit and vegetable, or fatty/sugary food recommendations in most models. The conventional and more novel methods yielded similar results. Mediation analysis indicated that 13 % of the intervention’s effect on cognitive functioning was mediated by 36-month protein food consumption. The study demonstrates some potential to alter early childhood dietary patterns through community-based intervention programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood 3acognition 3adietary recommendations 3aeating habits 3afood groups 3afood intake 3afruits 3amodels 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aprobability 3aprotein sources 3arandomized clinical trials 3avegetables 3aIrish Republic 0aRandomised controlled trial 0aHome visiting 0aDietary intake 0aCognitive functioning 0aIreland1 aFitzpatrick, Nick1 aDoyle, Orla0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.154-164dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800160018773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007500146245007900221300001800300520228900318592002802607650001602635650001002651650003402661650002602695650001702721650001902738650002302757650001902780650002302799650002302822650001702845650002502862700002002887700002302907700002102930773013602951856008103087852000903168655001203177IND60687146020221118061628.0200902e20200304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068714602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c003972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWawrzkiewicz-Jałowiecka, Agata1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6885-395610aMultifractal Properties of BK Channel Currents in Human Glioblastoma Cells  ap. 2382-2391.  aPotassium channels play an important physiological role in glioma cells. In particular, voltage- and Ca²⁺-activated large-conductance BK channels (gBK in gliomas) are involved in the intensive growth and extensive migrating behavior of the mentioned tumor cells; thus, they may be considered as a drug target for the therapeutic treatment of glioblastoma. To enable appropriate drug design, molecular mechanisms of gBK channel activation by diverse stimuli should be unraveled as well as the way that the specific conformational states of the channel relate to its functional properties (conducting/nonconducting). There is an open debate about the actual mechanism of BK channel gating, including the question of how the channel proteins undergo a range of conformational transitions when they flicker between nonconducting (functionally closed) and conducting (open) states. The details of channel conformational diffusion ought to have its representation in the properties of the experimental signal that describes the ion-channel activity. Nonlinear methods of analysis of experimental nonstationary series can be useful for observing the changes in the number of channel substates available from geometrical and energetic points of view at given external conditions. In this work, we analyze whether the multifractal properties of the activity of glioblastoma BK channels depend on membrane potential, and which states, conducting or nonconducting, affect the total signal to a larger extent. With this aim, we carried out patch-clamp experiments at different levels of membrane hyper- and depolarization. The obtained time series of single channel currents were analyzed using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) method in a standard form and incorporating focus-based multifractal (FMF) formalism. Thus, we show the applicability of a modified MFDFA technique in the analysis of an experimental patch-clamp time series. The obtained results suggest that membrane potential strongly affects the conformational space of the gBK channel proteins and the considered process has nonlinear multifractal characteristics. These properties are the inherent features of the analyzed signals due to the fact that the main tendencies vanish after shuffling the data.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug design 3adrugs 3aelectric potential difference 3afunctional properties 3aglioblastoma 3ahuman diseases 3amembrane potential 3aneoplasm cells 3aphysical chemistry 3apotassium channels 3atherapeutics 3atime series analysis1 aTrybek, Paulina1 aDworakowska, Beata1 aMachura, Łukasz0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Mar. 04, v. 124, no. 12 p.2382-2391dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c003973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245005000209300001200259500001100271506007600282520078800358592002801146506003701174650001501211650002001226650001801246650002501264650001601289700002401305700002601329700001901355700002401374773011301398856008201511852000901593655001201602IND60593469520221207083749.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059346952DNAL7 a296909002pmid7 aPMC59378412pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-018-2856-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomassone, Laura10aNeglected aspects of tick-borne rickettsioses  ap. 263.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRickettsioses are among the oldest known infectious diseases. In spite of this, and of the extensive research carried out, many aspects of the biology and epidemiology of tick-borne rickettsiae are far from being completely understood. Their association with arthropod vectors, the importance of vertebrates as reservoirs, the rarity of clinical signs in animals, or the interactions of pathogenic species with rickettsial endosymbionts and with the host intracellular environment, are only some examples. Moreover, new rickettsiae are continuously being discovered. In this review, we focus on the ‘neglected’ aspects of tick-borne rickettsioses and on the gaps in knowledge, which could help to explain why these infections are still emerging and re-emerging threats worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarthropods 3adisease vectors 3aendosymbionts 3arickettsial diseases 3avertebrates1 aPortillo, Aránzazu1 aNováková, Markéta,1 ade Sousa, Rita1 aOteo, José Antonio0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.263-263dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2856-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245012800159300001800287520123300305592002801538596005901566596009401625650002801719650001401747650002501761650001101786650001401797650001301811650001901824650001901843650001901862650002501881650002001906700005701926700001701983700001602000700001802016700001602034700001802050700001702068700002102085700001902106773011102125856008302236852000902319655001202328IND60728885020221120073640.0220305e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072888502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-020-03606-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Ya10aTEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers/polyacrylamide hybrid hydrogel with intrinsic self-recovery and shape memory properties  ap. 1469-1488.  aShape memory hydrogels attract increasing attention due to their promising applications as intelligent biomaterials for actuators, biomedicine and sensory applications. Nonetheless, the integration of synergistic characteristics providing good mechanical properties and ideal self-recovery rate still remains a challenge. To tackle this, we develop a novel nanocomposite hydrogel by radical polymerization. TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNs) with high strength and ultra-high aspect ratio were introduced to improve the energy dissipation mechanism and enhance the fatigue resistance of polyacrylamide (PAAM) hydrogel. Interestingly, the nanocomposite hydrogel displays unprecedented shape memory properties through coordination with Fe³⁺. The resulting TOCN/PAAM hydrogel achieves excellent energy dissipation capability (9.68 MJ m⁻³ at 60% strain), satisfactory viscoelasticity (51.1 kPa) and good self-recovery rate (about 93.2% after 30 min recovery). In particular, the 3% TOCN/PAAM-Fe³⁺ hydrogel exhibits better tensile performance. This nanocomposite hydrogel with good shape memory properties and excellent mechanical strength has broad application prospects in soft actuators and sensory research.  aPublisher supplied data  a31770609cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK20180090cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province for Outstanding Young Scholars 3abiocompatible materials 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3aenergy 3ahydrogels 3amedicine 3ananocomposites 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization 3astrength (mechanics) 3aviscoelasticity1 aHan, Jingquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1306-54311 aDing, Qinqin1 aYue, Yiying1 aXia, Changlei1 aGe, Shengbo1 aVan Le, Quyet1 aDou, Xiaomin1 aSonne, Christian1 aLam, Su Shiung0 tCellulose.g2021 Feb., v. 28, no. 3 p.1469-1488dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-020-03606-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245010000212300001800312520090700330592002801237650002701265650001101292650001601303650002101319650001701340650003001357650001101387650001101398700002901409700001701438773010601455856008301561990002301644852000901667655001201676IND60098167820221117062602.0141104e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009816782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.04.0062doi7 aPMC33727692pmcid7 a225428562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkus, Steven M.10aAstral microtubule asymmetry provides directional cues for spindle positioning in budding yeast  ap. 1400-1406.  aCortical force generators play a central role in the orientation and positioning of the mitotic spindle. In higher eukaryotes, asymmetrically localized cortical polarity determinants recruit or activate such force generators, which, through interactions with astral microtubules, position the mitotic spindle at the future site of cytokinesis. Recent studies in budding yeast have shown that, rather than the cell cortex, the astral microtubules themselves may provide polarity cues that are needed for asymmetric pulling on the mitotic spindle. Such asymmetry has been shown to be required for proper spindle positioning, and consequently faithful and accurate chromosome segregation. In this review, we highlight results that have shed light on spindle orientation in this classical model of asymmetric cell division, and review findings that may shed light on similar processes in higher eukaryotes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosome segregation 3acortex 3acytokinesis 3aeukaryotic cells 3amicrotubules 3amitotic spindle apparatus 3amodels 3ayeasts1 aKalutkiewicz, Katelyn A.1 aLee, Wei-Lih0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 July 15, v. 318, no. 12 p.1400-1406dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.04.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008200166300001600248520110300264592002801367650003101395650002201426650002801448650002001476650001801496650000701514650001401521650001001535700001501545700001601560700001701576700001401593700001701607773009101624856008101715852000901796655001201805IND60572438520221120043052.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057243852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-017-1204-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Chun-jie10aBiotransformation of Rutin Using Crude Enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris  ap. 431-436.  aRhodopseudomonas palustris was selected for the ability to grow in diglycosylated flavonoids-based media, exhibited deglycosylation activity. The present study aimed to investigate the ability of a crude enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris to transform rutin. Our results showed the crude enzyme was found to transform rutin to quercetin via isoquercitrin. The maximum enzyme activities were observed at pH 7.0, 25 °C, and rutin concentration of 1.0 mg mL⁻ ¹. Under optimal conditions, 13.11 μM rutin was biotransformed into 6.86 μM isoquercitrin and 11.64 μM quercetin after 11 and 21 h, respectively. The study demonstrates an eco-friendly and potential economically viable ‘green’ conversion route to convert rutin to isoquercitrin and quercetin, which is of great interest, considering the therapeutic applications of isoquercitrin and quercetin. The specific biotransformation of rutin to isoquercitrin and quercetin, using the crude enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, may potentially serve as a new method for industrial production of isoquercitrin and quercetin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodopseudomonas palustris 3abiotransformation 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenzyme activity 3aisoquercitrin 3apH 3aquercetin 3arutin1 aJi, Yu-jia1 aHu, Jia-lin1 aHu, Zhaonan,1 aYang, Fei1 aYang, Guan-e0 tCurrent microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.431-436dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-017-1204-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010200155300001800257500001900275520123200294592002801526650002101554650001501575650001701590650001301607650001401620650000701634650003301641650002501674700001401699700001901713700001701732700002001749773012301769856007401892852000901966655001201975IND60728230220221122002556.0210218e20210211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072823022DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra10181h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xuyang10aMechanism of N,N-dimethylformamide electrochemical oxidation using a Ti/RuO₂–IrO₂ electrode  ap. 7205-7213.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe compound N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is a widely used industrial chemical and a common environmental contaminant that has been found to be harmful to human health. In this study, electrochemical oxidation was adopted for the degradation of DMF. The effects of four kinds of electrodes on the removal rates of DMF and total organic carbon were compared, and based on the result, the Ti/RuO₂–IrO₂ electrode was selected as the operating electrode. The effects of three independent factors (current density, pH, and NaCl proportion) on the DMF degradation were investigated through single-factor experiments, and the experimental results were optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal experimental conditions were obtained as follows: current density = 47 mA cm⁻², pH = 5.5, and NaCl proportion = 15%. The electrochemical oxidation of 50 mg L⁻¹ DMF was performed under the optimal conditions; the degradation rate was 97.2% after 7 h, and the reaction followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The degradation products under optimal conditions and chlorine-free conditions were analyzed, and four degradation pathways were proposed. The DMF degradation was more thorough under optimal conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahuman health 3akinetics 3aoxidation 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3atotal organic carbon1 aDong, Hao1 aZhang, Yinghao1 aFang, Baihui1 aJiang, Wenqiang0 tRSC advances.g2021 Feb. 11, v. 11, no. 13 p.7205-7213dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra10181h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007800169300001600247520238600263592002802649650001202677650001202689650001902701650001602720650001102736650001802747650002502765650001202790650001202802650002002814650002902834650000902863650002802872651001902900653003102919653003302950653001902983653001503002653002403017700002103041700001803062773009203080856008503172852000903257655001203266IND60566236020221120111239.0170406e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056623602DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2015.10947312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Stephen10aInvesting in low-carbon transitions: energy finance as an adaptive market  ap. 280-298.  aThe amount of capital required to transition energy systems to low-carbon futures is very large, yet analysis of energy systems change has been curiously quiet on the role of capital markets in financing energy transitions. This is surprising given the huge role finance and investment must play in facilitating transformative change. We argue this has been due to a lack of suitable theory to supplant neoclassical notions of capital markets and innovation finance. This research draws on the notion from Planetary economics: Energy, climate change and the three domains of sustainable development , by Grubb and colleagues, that planetary economics is defined by three ‘domains’, which describe behavioural, neoclassical, and evolutionary aspects of energy and climate policy analysis. We identify first- and second-domain theories of finance that are well established, but argue that third-domain approaches, relating to evolutionary systems change, have lacked a compatible theory of capital markets. Based on an analysis of electricity market reform and renewable energy finance in the UK, the ‘adaptive market hypothesis' is presented as a suitable framework with which to analyse energy systems finance. Armed with an understanding of financial markets as adaptive, scholars and policy makers can ask new questions about the role of capital markets in energy systems transitions. Policy relevance This article explores the role of financial markets in capitalising low-carbon energy systems and long-term change. The authors demonstrate that much energy and climate policy assumes financial markets are efficient, meaning they will reliably capitalise low-carbon transitions if a rational return is created by subsidy regimes or other market mechanisms. The authors show that the market for renewable energy finance does not conform to the efficient markets hypothesis, and is more in line with an ‘adaptive’ markets understanding. Climate and energy policy makers that design policy, strategy, and regulation on the assumption of efficient financial markets will not pay attention to structural and behavioural constraints on investment; they risk falling short of the investment levels needed for long-term systems change. In short, by thinking of financial markets as adaptive, the range of policy responses to enable low-carbon investment can be much broader.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental policy 3afunding 3amarkets 3apolicy analysis 3arenewable energy sources 3arisk 3asustainable development 3aUnited Kingdom 0aadaptive market hypothesis 0aefficient markets hypothesis 0aenergy finance 0ainvestment 0aplanetary economics1 aFoxon, Timothy J1 aBolton, Ronan0 tClimate Policy.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 17, no. 3 p.280-298dTaylor & Francisx1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2015.10947313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100006000187245012800247300001800375506007600393520126200469592002801731506003701759650001101796650002001807650003301827650001501860650001201875650001601887773013601903856008002039852000902119655001202128IND60687146120221207144016.0200326e20200302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068714612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c004022doi7 aPMC71042372pmcid7 a321184332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinton, Allen P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8459-124710aSimple Calculation of Phase Diagrams for Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation in Solutions of Two Macromolecular Solute Species  ap. 2363-2370.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA simple method is described for the calculation of two- and three-dimensional phase diagrams describing stability and coexistence curves or surfaces separating one- and two-phase regions in composition/temperature space of a solution containing solute species 1 and 2. The calculation requires a quantitative description of the intermolecular potentials of mean force acting between like (1–1 and 2–2) and unlike (1–2) species. Example calculations are carried out for solutions of species interacting via spherically symmetric square-well potentials as first-order models for protein–protein interaction. When the interaction between species 1 and 2 is more repulsive than those acting between like species, the two-phase region is characterized by an equilibrium between a phase enriched in 1 and depleted in 2 and a phase enriched in 2 and depleted in 1. When the interaction between species 1 and 2 is more attractive than those acting between like species, the two-phase region is characterized by an equilibrium between a phase enriched in both species and a phase depleted in both species. The latter example provides a first-order description of coacervate formation without postulating specific interactions between the two solute species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amodels 3aphysical phases 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aseparation 3asolutes 3atemperature0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Mar. 02, v. 124, no. 12 p.2363-2370dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c004023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245008700206300001800293500001500311506007600326520118500402592002801587506003701615650002001652650001601672650000801688650001101696650002101707650001601728650001501744650001401759650001801773650002301791650002401814650002101838650001001859650002001869651001801889653001801907700002201925700002401947773015101971856007902122852000902201655001202210IND60114835320221207091717.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011483532DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0712902doi7 aPMC41441122pmcid7 a248714712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavese, Janet M10aGenistein inhibits human prostate cancer cell detachment, invasion, and metastasis  ap. 431S-436S.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProstate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death. Death is not caused by the primary tumor but rather by the formation of distinct metastatic tumors. Therefore, prevention of metastasis is of utmost importance. The natural product genistein, found in high amounts in soy products, has been implicated in preventing PCa formation and metastasis in men who consume high amounts of soy. In vitro studies and in vivo rodent models that used human PCa cells, as well as prospective human clinical trials, provide a mechanistic explanation directly supporting genistein as an antimetastatic agent. Specifically, our group showed that genistein inhibits cell detachment, protease production, cell invasion, and human PCa metastasis at concentrations achieved in humans with dietary intake. Finally, phase I and phase II clinical trials conducted by us and others showed that concentrations of genistein associated with antimetastatic efficacy in preclinical models are achievable in humans, and treatment with genistein inhibits pathways that regulate metastatic transformation in human prostate tissue.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ain vivo studies 3afood intake 3amen 3ahumans 3asoybean products 3aproteinases 3ametastasis 3agenistein 3aanimal models 3aclinical nutrition 3aprostatic neoplasms 3ain vitro studies 3adeath 3aclinical trials 3aUnited States 0acell invasion1 aKrishna, Sankar N1 aBergan, Raymond C.,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 July, v. 100, no.

In mitosis it ensures accurate segregation of the duplicated chromosomes by regulating the mitotic checkpoint, destabilizing incorrectly attached spindle microtubules and by promoting the axial shortening of chromosomal arms in anaphase. During cytokinesis the CPC most likely prevents chromosome damage by imposing an abscission delay when a chromosome bridge connects the two daughter cells. Moreover, by controlling proper cytoplasmic division, the CPC averts tetraploidization. This review describes recent insights on how the CPC is capable of conducting its various functions in the dividing cell to ensure chromosomal stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaphase 3achromosomes 3acytokinesis 3amicrotubules 3amitosis1 aHengeveld, Rutger C.C.1 avan der Horst, Armando1 aLens, Susanne M.A.0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 July 15, v. 318, no. 12 p.1407-1420dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.03.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245013900158300001800297500001500315520159500330592002801925650001301953650002201966650001801988650001302006650002302019653002402042700002502066773010702091856007202198852000902270655001202279IND60132920520221122104035.0150513e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013292052DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.28572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelz, Regina G.10aStatistical modeling of the hormetic dose zone and the toxic potency completes the quantitative description of hormetic dose responses  ap. 1169-1177.  a2019-12-04  aQuantifying the characteristics of hormesis provides valuable insights into this low‐dose phenomenon and helps to display and capture its variability. A prerequisite to do so is a statistical procedure allowing quantification of general hormetic features, namely the maximum stimulatory response, the dose range of hormesis, and the distance from the maximum stimulation to the dose where hormesis disappears. Applying extensions of a hormetic dose‐response model that is well‐established in plant biology provides a direct estimation of several quantities, except the hormetic dose range. Another dose range that is difficult to model directly is the distance between the dose where hormesis disappears and the dose giving 50% inhibition, known as toxic potency. The present study presents 2 further model extensions allowing for a direct quantification of the hormetic dose range and the toxic potency. Based on this, a 4‐step mathematical modeling approach is demonstrated to quantify various dose‐response quantities, to compare these quantities among treatments, and to interrelate hormesis features. Practical challenges are exemplified, and possible remedies are identified. The software code to perform the analysis is provided as Supplemental Data to simplify adoption of the modeling procedure. Because numerous patterns of hormesis are observed in various sciences, it is clear that the proposed approach cannot cope with all patterns; however, it should be possible to analyze a great range of hormesis patterns.

Strikingly, the physicochemical properties of aqueous NiPAM are similarly rich, and their understanding is far from being complete. This stems from the lack of accurate thermodynamic data and quantitative model for atomistic simulations. In this joint study, we have probed the thermodynamic behavior of aqueous NiPAM by experimental methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and Kirkwood–Buff (KB) analysis at ambient conditions. From the partial molar volumes and simultaneously correlated osmotic coefficients, with excess partial molar enthalpies of NiPAM in water, the concentration and temperature dependence of KB integrals was determined. For the purpose of this work, we have developed and employed a novel NiPAM force field, which not only reproduces KB integrals (Gᵢⱼ) and adequately captures macroscopic thermodynamic quantities but also provides more accurate structural insight than the original force fields. We revealed in the vicinity of NiPAM the competing effect of amide hydration with interaction between nonpolar regions. This microscopic picture is reflected in the experimentally observed NiPAM–NiPAM association, which is present from highly dilute conditions up to the solubility limit and is evidenced by G₂₂. From intermediate concentrations, it is accompanied by the existence of apparent dense-water regions, as indicated by positive G₁₁ values. The here-employed KB-based framework provided a mutually consistent thermodynamic and microscopic insight into the NiPAM solution and may be further extended for ion-specific effects. Moreover, our findings contribute to the understanding of thermodynamic grounds behind PNiPAM collapse transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aenthalpy 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3asolubility 3atemperature1 aOndo, Daniel1 aHeyda, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9428-95080 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Mar. 02, v. 124, no. 12 p.2495-2504dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c004133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094024003500119040001800154100001800172245018900190300001600379520178900395592002802184650001602212650002702228650001402255650001202269650002802281650001102309650001202320650001602332650001702348650001102365650001002376650002102386650002102407650001802428650001302446650001702459650002402476650001302500650001102513650002202524651001902546653002602565653002802591653002502619700002102644700001802665700002202683700001802705700002302723773012702746856008102873852000902954655001202963IND60651472920221119152401.0190711e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065147292DNAL7 a27557554 Total2pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800160019442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrowne, Sarah10aSchool lunches in the Republic of Ireland: a comparison of the nutritional quality of adolescents’ lunches sourced from home or purchased at school or ‘out’ at local food outlets  ap. 504-514.  aTo compare the energy, nutrient and food group compositions of three sources of school-day lunches among students in five secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland (ROI). Cross-sectional study conducted between October 2012 and March 2013. Students completed self-report food diaries over two school days. The energy, nutrient, nutrient density and food group composition of school-day lunches from home, school and ‘out’ in local food outlets were compared using ANCOVA and Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference post hoc analysis. Five secondary schools in the ROI. Male and female students aged 15–17 years (n 305). Six hundred and fifteen lunches (376 home lunches, 115 school lunches and 124 lunches sourced ‘out’ in the local environment) were analysed. School and ‘out’ purchased lunches were significantly higher than packed lunches from home in energy (2047 kJ (489 kcal), 2664 kJ (627 kcal), 1671 kJ (399 kcal), respectively), total fat (23·5 g, 30·1 g, 16·6 g, respectively) and free (added) sugars (12·6 g, 19·3 g, 7·4 g, respectively). More home lunches contained more fruit, wholemeal breads, cheese and red meat than lunches from school or ‘out’. Meat products, chips and high-calorie beverages were sourced more frequently at school or ‘out’ than home. Fibre and micronutrient contents of lunches from all sources were low. Home-sourced lunches had the healthiest nutritional profile in terms of energy and macronutrients. Foods high in energy, fat and free sugars associated with school and local food outlets are of concern given the public health focus to reduce their consumption. While school food should be improved, all sources of lunches need to be considered when addressing the dietary behaviours of secondary-school students.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aanalysis of covariance 3abeverages 3acheeses 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy 3afemales 3afood groups 3afood records 3afruits 3amales 3anutrient content 3anutrient density 3apublic health 3ared meat 3aschool lunch 3asecondary education 3astudents 3asugars 3awhole wheat bread 3aIrish Republic 0aSecondary-school food 0aLocal food environments 0aPublic health policy1 aStaines, Anthony1 aBarron, Carol1 aLambert, Veronica1 aSusta, Davide1 aSweeney, Mary Rose0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Feb., v. 20, no. 3 p.504-514dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800160019443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009800163300001400261520109600275592002801371650002001399650001301419650001001432650001301442650001301455650001001468650001001478650001001488650000901498650001501507650001401522650001201536650001401548650003001562650001201592650001801604650002201622653003001644653001101674653001401685653001401699700001301713700001901726700002001745700001801765773011801783856008301901852000901984655001201993IND60534518720221119092647.0190318e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053451872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaupke, A.13aAn outbreak of massive mortality among farm rabbits associated with Cryptosporidium infection  ap. 85-87.  aCryptosporidium in farm rabbits is not often recognised due to a low prevalence and asymptomatic course of infection. Nonetheless, incidences of fatal diarrhoeic diseases are frequently noticed in the rabbitries. In this article, we report an outbreak where there was massive mortality among farm rabbits associated with Cryptosporidium infection. The disease was characterised by profuse diarrhoea resulting in the death of rabbits. A pooled faecal sample was screened for a presence of parasites using microscopy methods. In the tested sample no other parasites other than Cryptosporidium oocysts were found. Further identification of the parasite species was performed at a molecular level, using the 18 SSU rRNA, COWP and LIB13 PCR followed by a subtyping at the GP60 gene locus. Sequence analysis of GP60 gene fragment revealed the presence of a novel subtype VbA24 of Cryptosporidium cuniculus. In this outbreak a Cryptosporidium protozoan parasite played a major role in the etiology of the gastrointestinal disorders in rabbits resulting in massive mortality of the infected animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aProtozoa 3adeath 3adiarrhea 3aetiology 3afarms 3afeces 3agenes 3aloci 3amicroscopy 3amortality 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 0aCryptosporidium cuniculus 0aRabbit 0aDiarrhoea 0aSubtyping1 aKwit, E.1 aChalmers, R.M.1 aMichalski, M.M.1 aRzeżutka, A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2014 Aug., v. 97, no. 1 p.85-87dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010000166300001600266520120100282592002801483650001101511650002201522650002001544650002301564650002001587650001101607650002601618650001101644651001001655700001501665700001801680700001201698700001701710700001501727700001401742700001501756700001501771773011001786856008501896852000901981655001201990IND60090576020221118231437.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009057602DNAL7 a10.3967/0895-3988.2011.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Qian,10aGround-based Observations of Ultraviolet and Total Solar Radiation in Shenyang, Northeast China  ap. 499-505.  aOBJECTIVE: This work explores the diurnal variation of Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and total solar radiation (TSR) in northeast China, using daily observations of UVR and TSR in Shenyang. METHODS: UVR and TSR measurements were carried out from March 1st, 2006 to December 31st, 2009 in Shenyang, Liaoning province, China (41°51′ N, 123°27′ E). RESULTS: Both TSR and UVR showed seasonal variation, reaching the highest levels in summer and the lowest in winter. They showed the greatest fluctuation in summer and autumn. The irradiance of TSR and UVR on clear days around the equinoxes and solstices increased substantially compared with the mean seasonal irradiance, especially in autumn. The whole day accumulated dose of UVR in winter was far less than that during the middle part of a summer day (i.e. between 10:00 and 14:00). It was also less than the accumulated summer dose of morning and afternoon (i.e. between 8:00 and 10:00 and 14:00 and 16:00). CONCLUSION: The instant irradiance and daily accumulated amount of UVR are low in Shenyang, especially in autumn and winter. Thus concern about the health effects arising because shortage of UVR in northeast China is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adiurnal variation 3alight intensity 3aseasonal variation 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3aultraviolet radiation 3awinter 3aChina1 aHu, Liwen,1 aGong, Huizhi,1 aGAO, Na1 aYu, Jiaming,1 aWANG, Yang1 aCHU, Chun1 aYang, Hui,1 aLiu, Yang,0 tBiomedical and environmental sciences.g2011 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.499-505dElsevier B.V.x0895-39887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3967/0895-3988.2011.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01706naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007300165300001800238520065700256592002800913650001700941650001400958650001400972653001200986653001500998653002401013700001501037700001601052700001301068700001601081700001201097700001401109773013101123856008101254852000901335655001201344IND60792787820221122045645.0220909e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079278782DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTSCI16723-222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinpeng10aAdvances on the Coloring Mechanism of Double-color Flowers in Plants  ap. 1120-1127.  aPlants with the flower color phenotype of double-color flowers are very precious and attractive and can usually be regarded as valuable germplasm resources for studying and improving flower color.

Less attention has been paid to the lifelong learner. We conceptualized a tripartite relationship between three measures of learning preference: conceptions of knowledge (construction and use vs. intake), need for cognition (high vs. low), and approach to study (deep vs. surface) and hypothesized that an individual's profile on these three measures—reconceptualized as a preference for complexity versus simplicity—would affect their attitude toward continuing professional development (CPD). A questionnaire was mailed to 2,000 randomly selected, home-practicing UK veterinarians to quantify their learning preferences, motivation to engage in CPD, and perception of barriers to participation and to assess the relationships between these constructs. Analysis of 775 responses (a 38.8% response rate) confirmed our tripartite model of learning and showed that a preference for complexity was negatively correlated with barriers and positively correlated with intrinsic, social, and extrinsic motivating factors, suggesting that all play a role in the continuing education of this group of professionals. A preference for simplicity was negatively correlated with social motivation and positively correlated with barriers. This study demonstrates that approach not only affects the quality of learning but crucially affects motivation to engage in CPD and perception of barriers to lifelong learning. This should emphasize to veterinary educators the importance of fostering a preference for complexity from an early age, both in terms of its immediate benefits (better understanding) and longer-term benefits (continued engagement with learning).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult education 3acognition 3acorrelation 3alearning 3amodels 3amotivation 3aprofessional development 3aprofessionals 3aquestionnaires 3astudents 3ateachers 3aveterinarians 3aUnited Kingdom 0aapproaches to study 0abarriers 0aconceptions of knowledge 0aextrinsic motivation 0aintrinsic motivation 0ainventory 0alifelong learning 0aneed for cognition 0asocial motivation1 aPierce, Stephanie E.1 aMay, Stephen A.0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 37, no. 2 p.165-171dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.37.2.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01780naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245011600168300001400284520054500298592002800843650001400871650004100885650001700926650001000943650002800953650001200981651001100993653001301004653001201017653001101029653002801040653001101068700002301079700002401102700002001126773014801146856007901294852000901373655001201382IND60520917220221120140655.0160526e20140613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052091722DNAL7 a10.2478/vjbsd-2014-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOvcharenko, Marina10aEnsuring Operators-Drivers Transport of Agricultural Machinery Safety in the Context of Sustainable Development  ap. 30-32.  aThe number and severity of road traffic accidents in the Russian Federation is not reduced from year to year.

Pers.) or hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon × C. transvaalensis Burtt Davy) during optimal growing conditions. Understanding how competition‐free growing degree‐days (CFGDD) influence bermudagrass total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC), biomass, and visual green cover may aid in turf‐use scheduling. Twenty‐four weekly treatments of foramsulfuron eliminated perennial ryegrass competition in replicate plots and allowed assessment of competition‐free bermudagrass coverage, biomass, and TNC as related to cumulative heat and light units. Results from this study indicate that bermudagrass coverage is a function of cumulative CFGDD and competition‐free daily light integral (CFDLI) but is dependent on locations or years where cultivars or seasonal legacy are variable. At three locations, ‘Patriot’ and ‘Midiron’ hybrid bermudagrass and ‘Riviera’ bermudagrass required 603, 709, and 959 CFGDD and 2,447, 3,271, and 4,556 mol m–² CFDLI to reach 97% coverage, respectively. Trends of TNC per unit area, however, continued to increase after full coverage was achieved and up to the point at which no more heat or light units were accumulated in fall. Absence of a clear asymptote in the trends suggests that heat or light units that were seasonally accumulated in Blacksburg, VA, were insufficient to achieve maximum bermudagrass carbohydrate reserves before winter dormancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aLolium perenne 3aathletic fields 3abiomass 3acarbohydrates 3acultivars 3adormancy 3aheat 3aheat sums 3ahybrids 3alawns and turf 3asummer1 aMittlesteadt, Tyler L.1 aAskew, Shawn D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9515-95020 tCrop science.g2021 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.3179-3186dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.205543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245008700206300001400293520228200307592002802589650001502617650001602632650001402648650001602662650002102678650002702699650002202726650001102748650002902759650002302788650002502811650001302836650002002849653002002869653001102889653002302900653001602923700001802939700001702957700001602974773010502990856008703095852000903182655001203191IND60526113820221118234815.0190402e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052611382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuciu, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7436-846310aTowards a filtered density function approach for reactive transport in groundwater  ap. 83-98.  aEvolution equations for probability density functions (PDFs) and filtered density functions (FDFs) of random species concentrations weighted by conserved scalars are formulated as Fokker–Planck equations describing stochastically equivalent processes in concentration-position spaces. This approach provides consistent numerical PDF/FDF solutions, given by the density in the concentration-position space of an ensemble of computational particles governed by the associated Itô equations. The solutions are obtained by a global random walk (GRW) algorithm, which is stable, free of numerical diffusion, and practically insensitive to the increase of the number of particles. The general FDF approach and the GRW numerical solution are illustrated for a reduced complexity problem consisting of the transport of a single scalar in groundwater. Randomness is induced by the stochastic parameterization of the hydraulic conductivity, characterized by short range correlations and small variance. The objective is to infer the statistics of the random concentration sampled at the plume center of mass, integrated over the transverse dimension of a two-dimensional spatial domain. The PDF/FDF problem can therefore be formulated in a two-dimensional domain as well, a spatial dimension and one in the concentration space. The upscaled drift and diffusion coefficients describing the PDF transport in the physical space are estimated on single-trajectories of diffusion in velocity fields with short-range correlations, owing to their self-averaging property. The mixing coefficients describing the PDF transport in concentration spaces are parameterized by the trend and the noise inferred from the statistical analysis of an ensemble of simulated concentration time series, as well as by classical mixing models. A Gaussian spatial filter applied to a Kraichnan velocity field generator is used to construct coarse-grained simulations (CGS) for FDF problems. The purposes of the CGS simulations are two-fold: first to understand the significance of the FDF approach from a practical point of view and its relation to the PDF approach; second to investigate the limits of the mixing models considered here and the desirable features of the mixing models for groundwater systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic models 3amixing 3aprobability distribution 3astatistical models 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3awater resources 0aPDF/FDF methods 0aMixing 0aGlobal random walk 0aGroundwater1 aSchüler, L.,1 aAttinger, S.1 aKnabner, P.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2016 Apr., v. 90 p.83-98dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003400138245016800172300001800340520128800358592002801646650002901674650001801703650001501721700002001736700002201756700002501778700002401803700002001827773010701847856007201954852000902026655001202035IND60132920720221122104014.0150513e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013292072DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.29152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrett, T.

When sample sizes are small and reference data are not normally distributed, the mean ± 2 SDs do not enclose 95% of data values. Prediction intervals (PI) calculated using sample statistics are used in the present study to define the normal range for a single observation and the mean of m observations. The PIs provide confidence limits for the next randomly selected observation (or mean of m observations) from a population. The PIs are defined using normally distributed reference data; normality can typically be achieved with transformations of the data. Covariates can be used to explain some of the variability in the reference distribution, increasing the ability to detect change. When assumptions of normality are not met, alternative methods of defining the normal range are provided. The normal range can be used to quantify natural variability and assess change from the reference distribution. It can be used as an early warning indicator of change in environmental monitoring to identify the need for further investigation.

We have detected that Cry1Ac protoxin and toxin were highly active against the larvae of A. lepigone. However, there is no report about the mode of action of Bt Cry1Ac toxin against this pest until now. A 110 kDa APN5 protein from BBMV of A. lepigone was identified as the binding receptor of Cry1Ac toxin using Ligand blotting. The Cry1Ac receptor APN5 was cloned from A. lepigone larval midgut mRNA and named as AlAPN5 (GenBank accession no.: KU950745). AlAPN5 had a GATEN motif and been classified to Class 5 APNs. 79.2% reduction in mortality was observed when A. lepigone larvae were injected with siRNA of the AlAPN5 gene and treated with Cry1Ac toxin. These data demonstrate that AlAPN5 is a putative functional receptor and maybe the only receptor of Cry1Ac in A. lepigone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthetis 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aaminopeptidases 3acorn 3acrops 3agenes 3alarvae 3aligands 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3amidgut 3amortality 3apests 3asmall interfering RNA 3aChina1 aGu, Shao-hua1 aNangong, Zi-yan1 aSong, Ping1 aWang, Qin-ying0 tCurrent microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.455-459dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-017-1215-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01587naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010200172300001200274520039600286592002800682650001600710650001300726650001700739650001800756650002500774650001100799653002900810653003200839653002900871700001700900700001900917700002000936700001500956700001800971700001600989773009001005856008501095852000901180655001201189IND60529733320221117191325.0161020e20160610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052973332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Lian-Cheng10aComplete genome sequence of a novel chlorpyrifos degrading bacterium, Cupriavidus nantongensis X1  ap. 1-2.  aCupriavidus nantongensis X1 is a chlorpyrifos degrading bacterium, which was isolated from sludge collected at the drain outlet of a chlorpyrifos manufacture plant.

In order to develop a water-soluble bio-adhesion resistant material, a series of novel zwitterionic polymers, carboxybetaine functionalized polysiloxanes (PDMS-g-CB), were synthesized via a three-step procedure. FT-IR and NMR were used to characterize the chemical structures of PDMS, and the solution properties (i.e. CMC) and biological characteristics were investigated. The high biocompatibility of PDMS-g-CB was demonstrated by hemolysis assay, skin irritation evaluation and acute oral toxicity testing. To evaluate the anti-fouling and hydrophilic properties of PDMS-g-CB, it was blended with PDMS elastomer to form films (b-PDMS). Water contact angle and ATR-FTIR measurements revealed that the hydrophobic PDMS surfaces were converted to hydrophilic surfaces after the introduction of PDMS-g-CB. The anti-fouling properties of b-PDMS were evaluated by protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion tests. Results showed that the amount of adsorbed protein and bacteria adhesion were significantly reduced compared with the untreated PDMS. These findings suggest that PDMS-g-CB is a biocompatible and promising material for the construction of anti-fouling surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacute oral toxicity 3aadsorption 3aantifouling activities 3abacterial adhesion 3abioadhesion 3abiocompatibility 3achemical structure 3acontact angle 3aengineering 3ahemolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amedical equipment 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3askin irritation 3atoxicity testing 3awater solubility 3azwitterions1 aLiu, Qiongqiong1 aLei, Yufeng1 aLin, Yaling1 aZhang, Anqiang0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 29, v. 4, no. 97 p.54372-54381dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra09171j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003700143245006000180300001600240520099700256592002801253650001501281650001401296650001301310650001301323650001301336650001701349650002501366651000901391653002501400653001501425653002701440653003601467653000901503700003401512700003001546700002601576700003001602773012801632856007901760852000901839655001201848IND60480756820221119071757.0160706e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048075682DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.37.2.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamizo Pestana, Elpidio Gonzalo12aA Century of Veterinary Education in Cuba (1907–2007)  ap. 118-125.  aThe development of veterinary education in Cuba has closely mirrored the political changes the nation has undergone. Veterinary studies in Cuba began in 1907, with an emphasis on clinical (individual-animal) medicine. Over time, the professional curriculum has evolved to meet the needs of the nation. Preventive medicine topics were added to the curriculum in 1959. Food-animal production was taught by a separate college until 1990. In 1991, these topics were incorporated into the professional veterinary medical curriculum, and they continue to be an area of emphasis. All veterinary colleges in Cuba follow a centrally organized, student-centered curriculum. A substantial portion of instruction is delivered at educational units, housed on livestock operations, where students participate in extensive field experiences while receiving didactic instruction. The amount of instructional time devoted to hands-on activities increases as students progress through the five-year curriculum.  aPublisher supplied data 3acurriculum 3alivestock 3amedicine 3apolitics 3astudents 3auniversities 3aveterinary education 3aCuba 0aveterinary education 0acurriculum 0afood-animal production 0acolleges of veterinary medicine 0aCuba1 aAparicio Medina, José Manuel1 aLópez Padrón, Alexander1 aRomero, Francisco Lam1 aSchoenfeld-Tacher, Regina0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 37, no. 2 p.118-125dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.37.2.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016600165300001600331520147600347592002801823650001601851650002401867650002601891650002501917650002301942650001701965650001301982650000901995650001402004650002102018650001002039650001002049650002002059650001302079650002502092650002502117650003002142650001802172650001802190650001302208650001002221700001802231700001602249700001602265700001802281773009102299856008102390852000902471655001202480IND60572438920221120043904.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057243892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-017-1210-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jongbin10aDevelopment of a Rapid Identification Method for the Differentiation of Enterococcus Species Using a Species-Specific Multiplex PCR Based on Comparative Genomics  ap. 476-483.  aEnterococci are lactic acid bacteria that are commonly found in food and in animal gut. Since 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences, genetic markers for bacterial identification, are similar among several Enterococcus species, it is very difficult to determine the correct species based on only 16 S rRNA sequences. Therefore, we developed a rapid method for the identification of different Enterococcus species using comparative genomics. We compared 38 genomes of 13 Enterococcus species retrieved from the National Center of Biotechnology Information database and identified 25,623 orthologs. Among the orthologs, four genes were specific to four Enterococcus species (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, and Enterococcus durans). We designed species-specific primer sets targeting the genes and developed a multiplex PCR using primer sets that could distinguish the four Enterococcus species among the nine strains of Enterococcus species that were available locally. The multiplex PCR method also distinguished the four species isolated from various environments, such as feces of chicken and cow, meat of chicken, cow, and pigs, and fermented soybeans (Cheonggukjang and Doenjang). These results indicated that our novel multiplex PCR using species-specific primers could identify the four Enterococcus species in a rapid and easy way. This method will be useful to distinguish Enterococcus species in food, feed, and clinical settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3aEnterococcus durans 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aEnterococcus hirae 3achicken meat 3achickens 3acows 3adatabases 3adigestive system 3afeces 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3alactic acid bacteria 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3aribosomal RNA 3asoybeans 3aswine1 aJin, Gwi-Deuk1 aPak, Jae In1 aWon, Jihyun1 aKim, Eun-Bae,0 tCurrent microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.476-483dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-017-1210-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04982naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245016100184300001600345520220800361592002802569650001502597650002502612650001302637650002502650650002702675650001602702650002502718650002002743650001302763650002702776650001002803650002002813650003202833650001002865650002002875650001902895650002002914650001802934650002102952650001502973650000902988650002502997650003803022650003203060650001203092650004903104650003903153650002503192650002903217650003903246650002703285650003103312650001903343650003703362650007803399650000903477650001703486650003103503650000903534650002503543650002803568650001503596650003703611650004703648650004803695700001603743700001803759700001803777700001403795700001403809700001203823700001503835700001103850700001503861700001403876773011203890856008104002852000904083655001204092IND4479527020221119062637.0141111e20121011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447952702DNAL7 a229676662pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Quanfang10aEffect and mechanism of methyl helicterate isolated from Helicteres angustifolia (Sterculiaceae) on hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats  ap. 889-895.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Methyl helicterate is a triterpenoid isolated from Helicteres angustifolia (Sterculiaceae), one of the valuable traditional Chinese herbs. Antifibrotic activities of H. angustifolia have been extensively proved. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of methyl helicterate (MH) on liver fibrosis in rats induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) and to explore its underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hepatic fibrosis was induced in male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats by intragastric administration with 2ml/kg CCl₄ (mixed 1:1 in peanut oil) twice a week for 12 weeks. To evaluate the effect of MH (16.72, 33.45, 66.90mg/kg) on hepatic fibrosis, liver function, histological study and hepatic fibrosis evaluation were performed. Liver function was assessed by determining the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (Alb) and total protein (TP). The biomarkers such as hydroxyproline (Hyp), hyaluronic acid (HA), type III precollagen (PCIII) and laminin (LN) were examined for the evaluation of hepatic fibrosis. The underlying mechanism was investigated by measuring oxidative stress level and detecting the expression of TGF-β1 mRNA and Smad3 protein. RESULTS: MH (33.45, 66.90mg/kg) treatment significantly inhibited the loss of body weight and the increase of liver index in rats induced by CCl₄. MH also improved the liver function as indicated by decreasing serum enzymatic activities of ALT, AST, TP and Alb (P<0.05). Histological results indicated that MH alleviated liver damage and reduced the formation of fibrous septa. Moreover, MH significantly decreased liver Hyp, HA, LN and PCIII (P<0.05). Research on mechanism showed that MH could markedly reduce liver malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, increase activities of liver superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and inhibit the expression of TGF-β1 mRNA and Smad3 protein (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that MH can inhibit CCl₄-induced hepatic fibrosis, which may be ascribed to its radical scavenging action, antioxidant activity, and modulation of TGF-β-Smad3 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicteres 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3abody weight 3acarbon tetrachloride 3aenzyme activity 3afibrosis 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aherbs 3ahyaluronic acid 3aintragastric administration 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3aliver function 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3aoxidative stress 3apeanut oil 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aCarbon Tetrachloride 2aCollagen Type IIIxblood 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aHyaluronic Acidxblood 2aHydroxyprolinexmetabolism 2aLamininxblood 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLiver Cirrhosisxchemically inducedxdrug therapyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aPhytotherapy 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSmad3 Proteinxgenetics 2aMalvaceae. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aTransforming Growth Factor beta1xgenetics 2aTriterpenesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use.1 aLi, Yongwen1 aZhang, Shijun1 aHuang, Renbin1 aZheng, Li1 aWei, Ling1 aHe, Min1 aLiao, Ming1 aLi, Li1 aZhuo, Lang1 aLin, Xing0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 Oct. 11, v. 143, no. 3 p.889-895dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01645naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245002700170300001800197520050000215592002800715650001200743650002200755650001900777650001000796650000900806650001500815650001700830653000900847653001600856653004200872653000900914653003300923653001700956700002100973700002200994700001801016773010701034856008501141852000901226655001201235IND60699788420221122231605.0201025e20200618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069978842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2020.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchi, Saverio10aCa2+ Fluxes and Cancer  ap. 1055-1069.  aCa²⁺ ions are key second messengers in both excitable and non-excitable cells.

The paper describes the development of transboundary cooperation in Europe, the peculiarities of the integration processes in the Euroregions, shows the development of Euroregions in Ukraine: „Carpatskyj“, „Bug“, „Nyzhnij Dunaj“, „Dniester“, „Verhnij Prut“, „Dnieper“, „Slobozhanshchyna“, „Yaroslavna“, defines their composition and structure, describes the basic functioning problems, such as low level of social and economic development in comparison with other (central) regions, the peripheral nature of economics, the presence of “a zone of potential political exertion“; the distance from the inner sources of regional security forms their focus on foreign economic cooperation, which makes them fragile to the dynamics of trade and economic relations of Ukraine with the neighbouring countries. The map of attraction of the regions of Ukraine into the European regions is made, in particular the regions that are proposed to be included in the composition of European regions for activation of transboundary cooperation are selected, and the proposed scenarios for the development of relations of Ukraine with the neighbouring countries are created.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomics 3apolitics 3asustainable development 3atrade 3aUkraine 0atransboundary cooperation 0ainter-regional cooperation 0aEuroregions0 tVisegrad journal on bioeconomy and sustainable development.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 3, no. 2 p.58-63dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21371x1339-33677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/vjbsd-2014-00113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001900159245010100178300001600279520093900295592002801234650004401262650001701306650001401323650001301337650001701350650004401367650001401411650002401425650002301449650001501472650002101487650001401508653002701522653002801549653004201577653002501619653002201644653003201666700002401698700002701722700002201749773011401771856009301885852000901978655001201987IND60606618520221118195359.0180726e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060661852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeigl, Sabrina10aSynthesis and oxidative stability of phenolic antioxidants immobilized by cellulose nanocrystals  ap. 253-259.  aAntioxidants are immobilized by attaching them as functional groups to cellulose nanocrystals. The synthesis route includes a carboxymethylation step followed by covalent grafting of di-tert-butylphenol moieties (first product). To improve solubility within non-polar polymeric matrices additional octadecyl groups are added (second product). Both products are fully characterized using FT-IR, solid-state NMR, and thermogravimetric analyses. The degree of substitution in each functionalization step is determined by conductometric titration. The syntheses are successful, with moderate degrees of functionalization due to limited accessibility of the hydroxyl groups, which correlates with the geometric shape of cellulose nanocrystals. The stabilization effect is determined by oxidation induction time measurements in squalane. Further, the influence of additional octadecyl moieties grafted to cellulose nanocrystals is assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantioxidants 3acellulose 3amoieties 3ananocrystals 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3aphenolic compounds 3asolubility 3athermogravimetry 3atitration 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aAdditive immobilization 0aFunctionalized cellulose nanocrystals 0aPhenolic antioxidant 0aCovalent grafting 0aThermal oxidation stability1 aBretterbauer, Klaus1 aSchöfberger, Wolfgang1 aPaulik, Christian0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2016 June, v. 128 p.253-259dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010300167300001600270520117400286592002801460650002201488650003001510650001301540650001201553650001001565650002001575650002101595650001901616650002301635650001501658650000901673650003401682650001501716650003101731650002501762653002601787653002401813653001401837700001601851700002001867700002401887700001501911700001601926700001901942700002101961773014601982856008302128852000902211655001202220IND60590421920221119085643.0201125e20180226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059042192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeki, Tatsuaki10aEstablishment of mouse gingival junctional epithelial cell line using a bioengineered tooth system  ap. 167-172.  aJunctional epithelium (JE), one of the constituents of periodontal tissue, has several unique features to prevent bacterial infection. However, the molecular mechanisms of these cells remain to be completely elucidated because there has been no JE cell line to date. We have succeeded in isolating JE cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) by using a bioengineered tooth technique in mice. The gene expressions of GFP-positive JE cells, isolated from around the erupted bioengineered teeth using flow cytometry, were analyzed by RNA sequencing. GFP-positive cells derived from the bioengineered tooth germs showed similar gene expression patterns to primary JE cells. The isolated GFP-positive JE cells were immortalized by transducing the simian virus 40 large T antigen using lentiviral vectors. The established GFP-positive JE cells maintained proliferative activity for more than 20 passages, and did not show cellular senescence as demonstrated by β-galactosidase assay. These cells also expressed similar gene expression patterns to primary JE cells. The established cell lines may prove useful for future investigation of JE characteristics in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aantigens 3agingiva 3ateeth 3acell senescence 3aepithelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3abeta-galactosidase 3aepithelium 3amice 3aMacaca mulatta polyomavirus 1 3acell lines 3agene expression regulation 3abacterial infections 0aJunctional epithelium 0aBioengineered teeth 0aCell line1 aAizawa, Ryo1 aTanaka, Junichi1 aYajima-Himuro, Sara1 aKato, Mayu1 aTanaka, K.,1 aMishima, Kenji1 aYamamoto, Matsuo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Feb. 26, v. 497, no. 1 p.167-172dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245008500204300001800289500002000307520151200327592002801839650001101867650001601878650001901894650001501913650001201928650001601940700002101956700005801977700001902035700001702054700001802071773011502089856007502204852000902279655001202288IND60786755620221119072725.0220805e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078675562DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.203112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuesenberry, Kenneth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1059-231310aOctoploid zoysiagrass: Origin, stability, characteristics, and breeding behavior  ap. 3035-3043.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAll known species of zoysiagrass are tetraploids (2n = 4x = 40) but octoploids have been reported. This research was conducted to evaluate ploidy variability from a stand of zoysiagrass where an 8x clone (E11) originated, and to characterize progeny from E11 and other ploidy variable clones. Clone ploidy was determined by flow cytometry and clones and progeny were assessed for aboveground and belowground morphological variability. Clone E11 was confirmed as 8x with a G1 peak twice that of ‘SS‐500’ (Empire, Sod Solutions, Inc.). Among 31 clones from the field where E11 originated, 20 were tetraploid, but 11 showed two flow cytometry peaks of similar numbers of events – one at a 4x value like Empire and a second at an 8x value like E11. From the group of 11 clones, three clones (C62, C96, and C107) that initially had double peaks reverted back to the 4x level, two (C92 and C105) stabilized at 8x, and six (C4‐1, B10, C13, I31, C87, and C93) continued to show double peaks. Progeny from C62 and C96 were only 4x. Progeny from the E11, C92, and C105 were all 8x except for one 6x plant among eight progeny of C105. Progeny from two clones with double peaks (C4‐1 and C93) were only 8x. These results show that, with variable ploidy of histogenic layers, a progeny generation is needed to stabilize 8x lines. Morphology studies showed that E11 generally followed the expected trend of increased size of vegetative and floral parts and root morphology found with chromosome doubling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZoysia 3achromosomes 3aflow cytometry 3aoctaploidy 3aprogeny 3atetraploidy1 aKenworthy, Kevin1 aBuhlman, Jamie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4199-094X1 aChase, Kathryn1 aCarter, Zach1 aBenda, Nicole0 tCrop science.g2021 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.3035-3043dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.203113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002100159245010400180300001600284520117400300592002801474650003001502650001101532650001101543650001901554650001401573653002101587653002601608653002201634653001701656700001901673700002901692700006001721773011401781856009301895852000901988655001201997IND60606618620221118194349.0180726e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060661862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPill, Michael F.10aForce dependence of the infrared spectra of polypropylene calculated with density functional theory  ap. 294-299.  aThe force dependence of the infrared spectrum of isotactic 3,5-dimethylheptane, which serves as a model molecule for polypropylene, was investigated with quantum chemical calculations using the External Force is Explicitly Included (EFEI) method. Normal modes were analyzed with respect to the force dependence of their frequencies and intensities. In general, the frequencies exhibit a monotonic increase or decrease with force, depending on the way the external force is modifying the bonds involved in the normal mode vibration. The behavior of the intensities is in many cases non-monotonic. This is attributed to the force-dependent coupling and mixing of modes, which leads to irregular behavior of the intensities. To compare the calculations with experimental results the modes were broadened with a Lorentzian, and superimposed to simulate the infrared spectrum. The experimentally observed force dependence is in qualitative agreement with the calculated values. Due to the occasionally counteracting behavior of normal modes, peaks originating from several normal modes may move, split, coalesce, emerge or disappear under the influence of an external force.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3amixing 3amodels 3apolypropylenes 3avibration 0aMechanochemistry 0aInfrared spectroscopy 0aMechanical strain 0aMechanophore1 aKersch, Alfred1 aClausen-Schaumann, Hauke1 aBeyer, Martin K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9373-92660 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2016 June, v. 128 p.294-299dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013400169300001800303520090400321592002801225650000901253650002501262650001301287650001901300650004401319650003301363650001201396650001001408653001501418653001501433653001801448653002601466700001901492700002101511773010901532856008501641852000901726655001201735IND60573675820221121230902.0170724e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057367582DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.12931632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Huan-Lin10aImproving the properties of geopolymer containing oil-contaminated clay, metakaolin, and blast furnace slag by applying nano-SiO2  ap. 1619-1628.  aIn this study, geopolymer specimens based on calcined oil-contaminated clays (OCCs), metakaolin replacements of OCCs, and blast furnace slag were manufactured by the addition of nano-SiO ₂ to improve their properties. The effects of adding 0, 1, 2, or 3% nano-SiO ₂ on the properties and microstructures of the geopolymer specimens were determined using compressive strength tests, flow tests, setting time tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and silicon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Si-NMR). The results showed that the setting time and flowability of the geopolymer specimens decreased and the compressive strength increased as the amount of nano-SiO ₂ increased. These results were supported by the SEM and Si-NMR assays. This study suggests that the addition of nano-SiO ₂ was beneficial and improved the properties of the geopolymer specimens containing calcined OCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3acompression strength 3afurnaces 3amicrostructure 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3aslags 0aGeopolymer 0ametakaolin 0anano-material 0aoil-contaminated clay1 aLin, Deng-Fong1 aChen, Shih-Chieh0 tEnvironmental technology.g2017 July 18, v. 38, no. 13-14 p.1619-1628dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.12931633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010600156520132300262592002801585650001501613650001201628650002601640650002801666650001601694700001501710700001201725700001701737773012601754856007301880852000901953655001201962IND60651899120221120164233.0190712e20170221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065189912DNAL7 a10.3390/su90203032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuan, Wenfei10aWeight Determination of Sustainable Development Indicators Using a Global Sensitivity Analysis Method  aSustainable development (SD) evaluations have attracted considerable attention from governments and scientific communities around the world. The objective and quantitative calculation of the importance of sustainable assessment indicators is a key problem in the accurate evaluation of SD. Traditional methods fail to quantify the coupling effects among indicators. This paper presents a weight determination approach based on the global sensitivity analysis algorithm known as the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST). This method is efficient and robust and is not only able to quantify the sensitivity of the evaluation indictors to the target, but can also quantitatively describe the uncertainties among the indictors. In this paper, we analyze the sensitivity of 18 indicators in a multi-index comprehensive evaluation model and weigh the indicators in the system according to their importance. To verify the feasibility and advantages of this new method, we compare the evaluation result with the traditional entropy method. The comparison shows that the EFAST algorithm can provide greater detail in an SD evaluation. Additionally, the EFAST algorithm is more specific in terms of quantitative analysis and comprehensive aspects and can more effectively distinguish the importance of indicators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aentropy 3aquantitative analysis 3asustainable development 3auncertainty1 aLü, Ling,1 aLi, Xin1 aMa, Chunfeng0 tSustainability.g2017 Feb. 21, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90203033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006800169300001100237500001900248520172000267592002801987650001802015650001802033650001002051650001502061650002602076650002902102650001102131700006102142773011302203856008302316852000902399655001202408IND60728885820221120073601.0210317e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072888582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-021-02996-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazlioglu, Fatih10aWarming matters: alpine plant responses to experimental warming  ap. 56.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClimate change has pronounced impacts on plants, particularly in environments vulnerable to warming such as alpine zones. Although plant responses in tundra and alpine environments from high latitudes have been well-studied at the community level, the overall effect of warming on global alpine plant populations and species remains unclear. We collated global data from 46 open-top chamber (OTC) studies conducted on alpine plants from mountain belts worldwide and assessed potential effects of warming on plant performance. In addition, we examined warming responses of plants from the tundra zone (Arctic tundra and alpine tundra) in circumpolar regions. In terms of growth and reproductive output, the overall response of 91 plant species was highly positive. Shrubs grew significantly larger and expressed higher reproduction under warming compared to forbs and graminoids. Arctic tundra plants tended to respond more positively to warming compared to alpine tundra plants. We also found that plant responses were greater with increasing precipitation across circumpolar tundra, but not across alpine zones. Phenotypic plasticity in size- and fitness-related traits were similar for both alpine and tundra zones. Our findings support the notion that global warming can cause significant changes to alpine environments. Due to changes in biotic interactions, alpine tundra plants may be more negatively affected by warming compared to Arctic tundra plants which responded more positively to warming. Similarly, if shrubs are most advantaged under warming, their invasion into higher elevations may threaten the ecological functioning of alpine ecosystems, which is another serious challenge from climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine plants 3aalpine tundra 3aforbs 3agraminoids 3aphenotypic plasticity 3areproductive performance 3atundra1 aWan, Justin S.

Here, we review the roots of this controversy in disparities between results derived from studies of chromatin in nuclei, chromatin isolated from nuclei, and chromatin reconstituted from defined components. Thanks to recent advances in imaging, modeling, and other approaches, it is now possible to recognize some unifying principles driving chromatin architecture at the level of the ubiquitous ‘30nm’ chromatin fiber. These suggest that fiber architecture involves both zigzag and bent linker motifs, and that such heteromorphic structures facilitate the observed high packing ratios. Interactions between neighboring fibers in highly compact chromatin lead to extensive interdigitation of nucleosomes and the inability to resolve individual fibers in compact chromatin in situ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3anucleosomes 3aroots1 aWoodcock, Christopher L.0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 July 15, v. 318, no. 12 p.1448-1455dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.02.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100003300162245012900195300001800324520105400342592002801396650001101424650001101435650002501446650002501471650002601496650001401522650002101536650001101557650002001568650001401588650001301602650002101615650001901636650002501655650002301680650003101703650002501734650001901759650002201778650002301800650002501823650003101848650005101879650004401930700002301974773010101997856008302098852000902181655001202190IND4478326420221118025359.0120503e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447832642DNAL7 a216462812pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpr0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcMurtrie, R.

The same leaf traits co-vary consistently with the environmental conditions (light intensity, carbon-dioxide concentration, nitrogen supply) prevailing during leaf development. No existing theory satisfactorily explains all of these trends. Here, using a simple model of the carbon–nitrogen economy of trees, we show that global leaf-trait relationships and leaf responses to environmental conditions can be explained by the optimization hypothesis (MAXX) that plants maximize the total amount of carbon exported from their canopies over the lifespan of leaves. Incorporating MAXX into larger-scale vegetation models may improve their consistency with global leaf-trait relationships, and enhance their ability to predict how global terrestrial productivity and carbon sequestration respond to environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aconvergent evolution 3aenvironmental factors 3aleaf area 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3alongevity 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphotosynthesis 2aBiological Evolution 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCarbon Sequestration 2aClimate Change 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism.1 aDewar, Roderick C.0 tTree physiology.g2011 Sept., v. 31, no. 9 p.1007-1023dOxford University Pressx0829-318X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpr0373Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245018000216300001200396520177600408592002802184650001202212650002902224650001502253650002402268650001902292650000902311650002802320650001702348650002102365700001802386700001802404773015102422856008302573852000902656655001202665IND60728885920221120073705.0210731e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072888592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-08916-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKesikoglu, Mustafa Hayri1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5199-081514aThe impact of impervious surface, vegetation, and soil areas on land surface temperatures in a semi-arid region using Landsat satellite images enriched with Ndaisi method data  ap. 143.  aImpervious surfaces are a significant issue of both urbanization and environmental assessment. However, it is a problem to classify impervious surface (IS) and soil areas as separate classes in land cover classification. The objectives of this study are to obtain impervious surface, vegetation, and soil areas clearly of an urban complex with a semi-arid climate and to better determine the relationships of IS, vegetation, and soil areas with land surface temperatures (LSTs). For this purpose, IS, vegetation, and soil areas in a semi-arid city of Turkey-Kayseri city were identified by using Normalized Difference Anthropogenic Impervious Surface Index (NDAISI) data and support vector machine (SVM) method together in the classification of different areas. Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images of 1987, 2000, and 2013 were used, respectively, in this study. Afterward, the effects of these areas on LSTs were analyzed. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between land cover areas and surface temperatures. To better demonstrate these relationships, besides common pixel-based and classical regional-based approaches, a new density-based regional analysis approach was proposed. This study is an innovative one in terms of detecting IS and indicating relationships between land cover areas and surface temperatures in semi-arid regions. Another innovation of the study is related to the results produced. The results showed that decreasing LST values were observed with increasing IS and vegetation cover values and increasing LST values were observed with increasing soil areas. The present findings may provide significant contributions to the literature and will facilitate the development of urban planning strategies in semi-arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aenvironmental assessment 3aland cover 3aregression analysis 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3asupport vector machines 3aurbanization 3avegetation cover1 aOzkan, Coskun1 aKaynak, Tolga0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Mar., v. 193, no. 3 p.143-143dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-08916-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245005300163300001800216520192200234592002802156650001902184650002002203650001602223650001702239650001702256650001902273650002302292650001502315650000902330650002202339650002002361650001802381650002002399650001602419650001802435650001502453650001002468650002202478650002502500650001902525650001102544651001602555651001102571651001902582773016902601856007902770852000902849655001202858IND60114836120221122043641.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011483612DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0712092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAiking, Harry10aProtein production: planet, profit, plus people?  ap. 483S-489S.  aFood sustainability and food security are increasingly in the spotlight and increasingly intertwined. According to some projections we will need to nearly double food production in the next 4 decades. This article argues that protein production and consumption are pivotal to sustainability, because anthropogenic contributions to the nitrogen cycle are 100–200% compared with a contribution of 1–2% to the carbon cycle by mineral fuel combustion, with biodiversity as the main casualty. Because 1 kg animal protein requires ∼6 kg plant protein, its large-scale production by means of factory farming is a major driver of biodiversity loss, climate change, and freshwater depletion. Furthermore, intensive livestock production is associated with antibiotics resistance and increasing incidence of emerging diseases. Therefore, a “reversed” diet transition back to less animal protein could make a difference. Some European countries, such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, and The Netherlands, have published integrated policy reports addressing food security, sustainability, and health combined. The food industry is focusing on food safety and increasingly on sustainability. An important issue is consumer communication, because consumer “framing” is radically different from that of governmental and industrial policy makers. There is no “one size fits all.” A huge range of differences exists between countries and between distinct groups of consumers within countries; getting consumers to change their diets in a more sustainable direction is likely to require much more than gentle nudging. National governments and the United Nations should assume their responsibilities and initiate a global strategy integrating sustainability, food security, nutrition, and equity. To date, the profit pillar of sustainability has taken precedence over planet and people. It is time to redress the balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3aanimal proteins 3aantibiotics 3abiodiversity 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate change 3aclinical nutrition 3acombustion 3adiet 3aemerging diseases 3afarming systems 3afood industry 3afood production 3afood safety 3afood security 3afreshwater 3afuels 3aissues and policy 3alivestock production 3anitrogen cycle 3apeople 3aNetherlands 3aSweden 3aUnited Kingdom0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 July, v. 100, no.

However, there were no systematic standards for data recording nor long‐term data preservation and reuse strategies. With the new aim of making data reuse practical, we recovered all data available and structured it into the Embrapa Rice Breeding Dataset (ERBD). In its current version, the ERBD includes 20,504 crosses involving 9,974 parents, the pedigrees of most of the 4,532 inbred lines that took part in advanced field trials, and phenotypic data from 2,711 field trials (1,118 irrigated, 1,593 upland trials), representing 226,458 field plots. Those trials were conducted over 38 years (1982–2019), in 247 locations, in latitudes ranging from 3°N to 33°S. Phenotypic traits included grain yield, days to flowering, plant height, canopy lodging, and five important fungal diseases: leaf blast, panicle blast, brown spot, leaf scald, and grain discoloration. The total number of data points surpasses 1.27 million. Descriptive statistics were computed over the dataset, split by cropping systems (irrigated or upland). The mean heritability of grain yield was high for both systems, at around .7, whereas the mean coefficient of variation was 13.9% for irrigated trials and 18.7% for upland trials. The ERBD offers the possibility of conducting studies on different aspects of rice breeding and genetics, including genetic gain, G×E analysis, genome‐wide association studies and genomic prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acanopy 3adata collection 3adescriptive statistics 3adiscoloration 3afungi 3agenetic improvement 3agenomics 3agrain yield 3aheritability 3ahighlands 3airrigation 3aleaves 3apanicles 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3aprediction 3arice 3ascald diseases1 ade Mello, Raquel Neves1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3647-49671 aPinheiro, Patrícia Valle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0461-18211 aSoares, Dino Magalhães1 aLopes Júnior, Sergio1 aNakano Rangel, Paulo Hideo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5741-34261 aGuimarães, Elcio Perpétuo1 ade Castro, Adriano Pereira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6202-47671 aColombari Filho, José Manoel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3143-89241 ade Magalhães Júnior, Ariano Martins1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0756-46481 aFagundes, Paulo Ricardo Reis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5294-23801 ade Carvalho Ferreira Neves, Péricles1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4794-89531 aFurtini, Isabela Volpi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4932-99371 aUtumi, Marley Marico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4940-93631 aPereira, José Almeida,1 aCordeiro, Antônio Carlos Centeno1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8197-24391 aFilho, Austrelino Silveira1 aAbreu, Guilherme Barbosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3536-05271 ade Moura Neto, Francisco Pereira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1056-44381 aPietragalla, J.q(Julian),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9911-09601 aHernández, Mateo Vargas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0735-32421 aCrossa, José,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9429-58550 tCrop science.g2021 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.3445-3457dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.205503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013500170300001800305520144900323592002801772650002001800650001401820650002701834650003501861650001501896650001301911650001101924650001601935650001701951651001601968700002501984700002302009773010702032856008102139852000902220655001202229IND60572439220221120224219.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057243922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-017-1635-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhavidelfar, Saeed12aA Multi-Scale Analysis of Single-Unit Housing Water Demand Through Integration of Water Consumption, Land Use and Demographic Data  ap. 2173-2186.  aStudies evaluating the determinants of water demand typically use household-scale data or aggregated data. The household-scale data basically is preferred since it can reveal the heterogeneity in responses to the demand drivers across different consumer groups. However, the scarcity of household-scale data and its high data collection cost generally have limited the studies to rely on small samples of household data. Thus, they failed to show the spatial variation of water demand. In contrast, the aggregated studies have assessed the spatial variation of water use however they overlooked the variations across households. Using a rich source of GIS-based urban databases in Auckland, New Zealand, this study overcame this challenge by developing a large sample of 31000 single-unit housing through integration of household-level water consumption and property data with micro-scale household demographics information. This large dataset enabled this study to evaluate the water consumption both at the household scale and the census area unit scale. Panel data models were used for the water demand analysis in both scales. The proposed multi-scale analysis approach provided detailed knowledge about water consumption and its major determinants across different consumer groups and urban areas. This information may help water planners to more reliably plan water supply systems and manage consumption in the complex urban environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adatabases 3ademographic statistics 3ageographic information systems 3ahouseholds 3aland use 3amodels 3aurban areas 3awater supply 3aNew Zealand1 aShamseldin, Asaad Y.1 aMelville, Bruce W.0 tWater resources management.g2017 May, v. 31, no. 7 p.2173-2186dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1635-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04264naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245008300210300001200293506007600305520232200381592002802703596032202731506003703053650003303090650002303123650001103146650001103157650001903168650001703187650002503204650001303229650002903242650001703271650002003288651001703308700001503325700002803340700002203368700002503390700002303415700002903438700002103467700002403488700001803512773011303530856008203643852000903725655001203734IND60593470220221207112152.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059347022DNAL7 a297032292pmid7 aPMC59230302pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2609-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPercoma, Lassané10aImpact of an integrated control campaign on tsetse populations in Burkina Faso  ap. 270.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Tsetse flies are the sole vectors of human and animal trypanosomosis. In Burkina Faso, a project aiming to create zones free of tsetse flies and trypanosomosis was executed from June 2006 to December 2013. After the determination of tsetse distribution in the intervention area from December 2007 to November 2008, the control campaign was launched in November 2009 and ended in December 2013. The goal was to eliminate tsetse flies from 40,000 km² of area, through an integrated control campaign including insecticide targets, traps and cattle, sequential aerial treatment (SAT) and the mass treatment of livestock using trypanocides. The campaign involved assistance of the beneficiary communities at all the steps of the control strategy with insecticide impregnated targets. METHODS: This study was carried out to assess the impact of the control project on tsetse apparent density per trap per day (ADT). To evaluate the effectiveness of tsetse control, 201 sites were selected based on the baseline survey results carried out from December 2007 to November 2008. These sites were monitored bi-monthly from January 2010 to November 2012. At the end-of-study in 2013 a generalized entomological survey was carried out in 401 infested sites found during the longitudinal survey done before the control. Barrier and tsetse persistence areas were treated by ground spraying and evaluated. Controls were also done before and after aerial spraying. RESULTS: In the insecticide-impregnated target area, the control showed that ADT of tsetse flies declined from 10.73 (SD 13.27) to 0.43 (SD 2.51) fly/trap/day from the third month of campaign onwards (P < 0.0001) and remained low thereafter. At the end of the campaign in 2013, an 83% reduction of ADT was observed for Glossina palpalis gambiensis and a 92% reduction for G. tachinoides. Tsetse flies were captured only in 29% of the sites found infested in 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Tsetse flies could be suppressed efficiently but their elimination from the targeted area may require the use integrated methods including the Sterile Insect Technique, which is programmed through the development of the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC Burkina) insectarium. The challenge will remain the sustainability of the achievement.  aPublisher supplied data  aDecree N ° 2005-387 / PRES of July 19th, 2005 promulgating Law N° 030-2005 authorizing ratification of loan agreement and Decree N° 2005-402/PRES /PM/MAECR/MS/MFB of July19th, 2005 ratifying loan agreementcLoan N°2100150009193 - SAP n° P-Z1-AZ0-009, contracted by State of Burkina to African Bank of Development0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlossina palpalis gambiensis 3aaerial application 3acattle 3ahumans 3ainsect surveys 3ainsecticides 3alongitudinal studies 3aspraying 3asterile insect technique 3atrypanocides 3atrypanosomiasis 3aBurkina Faso1 aSow, Adama1 aPagabeleguem, Soumaïla1 aDicko, Ahmadou H.1 aSerdebéogo, Oumarou1 aOuédraogo, Mariam1 aRayaissé, Jean-Baptiste1 aBouyer, Jérémy1 aBelem, Adrien M.

RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) profiling of two different clones of wild potato (S. commersonii Dun.) contrasting in their capacity to withstand low temperatures revealed a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under nonacclimated conditions (NAC) in tolerant clone cmm1T vs. the susceptible cmm6‐6 (1,002 and 8,055 DEGs, respectively). By contrast, the number of DEGs was much more comparable when both genotypes were under acclimated conditions (AC). Indeed, a total of 5,650 and 8,936 DEGs were detected in the tolerant genotype vs. the susceptible. Gene ontology (GO) classification under NAC showed a significant role for transcription regulation, lignin catabolic genes, and regulation of plant type secondary cell wall in the cold‐tolerant genotypes, suggesting an important role in conferring tolerance response. By contrast, response to stress and response to stimuli were enriched GO categories in both clones under AC. Unsigned weighted correlation networks analysis (WGCNA) allowed identification of coexpressed hub genes with possible main regulatory functions and major impacts on the phenotype. Among those identified, we clarified the role of CBF4. This gene showed contrasting expression profiles in the two clones under NAC, being induced in cold‐tolerant cmm1T but suppressed in susceptible cmm6‐6. By contrast, under AC, CBF4 was upregulated in both clones. Our study provides a global understanding of mechanisms involved following exposure to NAC and AC in S. commersonii. The mechanisms described here will inform future investigations for detailed validation in studies regarding cold tolerance in plants.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Naples Federico II 3aRNA 3aSolanum commersonii 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aabiotic stress 3acell walls 3acold 3acold tolerance 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agenotype 3alignin 3aphenotype 3apotatoes 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics)1 aAversano, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4041-37021 aBradeen, James1 aD'Amelia, Vincenzo1 aVillano, Clizia1 aCarputo, Domenico1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1735-93380 tCrop science.g2021 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.3538-3550dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.204733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012400168300001400292520103100306592002801337650002201365650001701387650001701404650001701421650001901438650002001457650003101477650001001508650001501518650001501533650001301548653003101561653002801592653003601620653002301656700001601679700001901695700001801714700001701732700001101749700001601760773009201776856008501868852000901953655001201962IND60529733820221117191810.0161020e20160610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052973382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huan-Jun10aEnhancement of ganoderic acid production by constitutively expressing Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene in Ganoderma lucidum  ap. 35-40.  aThe Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) gene was expressed in Ganoderma lucidum to enhance antitumor ganoderic acid (GA) production. The effects of VHb expression on the accumulation of GAs and lanosterol (intermediate) and the transcription of GA biosynthesis genes were also investigated. In VHb-expressing G. lucidum, the maximum concentrations of four individual GAs (GA-S, GA-T, GA-Mk and GA-Me) were 19.1±1.8, 34.6±2.1, 191.5±13.1 and 45.2±2.8μg/100mg dry weight, respectively, which were 1.4-, 2.2, 1.9- and 2.0-fold higher than those obtained in the wild-type strain. Moreover, the maximum lanosterol concentration in the strain expressing VHb was 1.28-fold lower than that in the wild-type strain. The transcription levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, squalene synthase, and lanosterol synthase genes were up-regulated by 1.6-, 1.5-, and 1.6-fold, respectively, in the strain expressing VHb.

A recent study revealed genetic variation within the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA among P. kappa specimens collected from Macropus giganteus Shaw and Osphranter robustus (Gould). This study aimed to characterise the genetic and morphological diversity within P. kappa from four macropodid host species, including M. giganteus, O. robustus, O. antilopinus (Gould) and O. bernardus (Rothschild). METHODS: Specimens of P. kappa from M. giganteus and Osphranter spp. from various localities across Australia were examined. The first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2, respectively) were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Phylogenetic methods were used to determine the interspecific diversification within P. kappa and its evolutionary relationship with other congeners. RESULTS: Morphological examination revealed that P. kappa from M. giganteus, the type-host, can be distinguished from those in Osphranter spp. by the greater length and number of striations on the buccal capsules. DNA sequences showed that P. kappa from M. giganteus was genetically distinct from that in Osphranter spp., thereby supporting the morphological findings. Based on these finding, a new species from Osphranter spp., Pharyngostrongylus patriciae n. sp., is described. CONCLUSION: Pharyngostrongylus patriciae n. sp. from Osphranter spp. is distinguished from P. kappa based on molecular and morphological evidence. The study highlights the importance of combining molecular and morphological techniques for advancing the nematode taxonomy. Although ITS genetic markers have proven to be effective for molecular prospecting as claimed in previous studies, future utilisation of mitochondrial DNA to validate ITS data could further elucidate the extent of speciation among macropodid nematodes.  aPublisher supplied data  aRF217-06cAustralian Biological Resources Study0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMacropus giganteus 3aStrongylida 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amitochondrial DNA 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3aAustralia1 aBeveridge, Ian1 aJabbar, Abdul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8888-00460 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.271-271dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2816-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013200161300001800293500001900311520185200330592002802182650002202210650001102232650001302243650002102256650001602277700002702293700002602320700002402346700002202370700002402392700002202416773012302438856007402561852000902635655001202644IND60728231220221122050712.0210218e20210217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072823122DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra10609g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReviglio, Ana L.10aAccurate location of hydrogen atoms in hydrogen bonds of tizoxanide from the combination of experimental and theoretical models  ap. 7644-7652.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo obtain detailed information about the position of hydrogen atoms in hydrogen bonds, HBs, of crystalline organic molecular compounds is not an easy task. In this work we propose a combination of ssNMR experimental data with theoretical procedures to get such information. Furthermore, the combination of experimental and theoretical models provides us with well-defined grounds to analyse the strength of π-stacking interactions between layers of hydrogen bonded molecules. Two different theoretical models were considered, both approaches being quite different. The first one is a solid-state model, so that the periodicity of a crystalline system underlies calculations of the electronic energy, the electronic density and NMR parameters. The other one is a molecular model in which molecules are taken as isolated monomers, dimers and tetramers. These two models were applied to the tizoxanide, TIZ, molecular crystal though it can widely be applied to any other molecular crystal. By the application of the quantum molecular model it was possible to learn about the way the intermolecular HBs affect the position of hydrogen atoms that belong to HBs in TIZ. This molecule has two intermolecular HBs that stabilize the structure of a basic dimer, but it also has an intramolecular HB in each monomer whose position should be optimized together with the other ones. We found that by doing this it is possible to obtain reliable results of calculations of NMR spectroscopic parameters. Working with the solid-state model we found that any local variation of the TIZ crystalline structure is correlated with the variation of the values of the NMR parameters of each nucleus. The excellent agreement between experimental and calculated chemical shifts leads to the conclusion that the N₁₀–H₁₀ bond distance should be (1.00 ± 0.02) Å.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3amolecular models 3aperiodicity1 aMartínez, Fernando A.1 aMontero, Marcos D.

To further confirm the ripening-related genes in apricot, we combined quantitative proteomic tools with bioinformatics to investigate the expression profiles of ripening genes involved in significant biochemical and metabolic changes during ripening stages. The results showed that physiological traits of apricot fruits varied significantly at three different ripening stages, with remarkable correlation with fruit quality changes. Furthermore, 128 stage-specific proteins that are differently expressed in a stage-responsive manner in ripening apricot fruits were identified. Hierarchical clustering of stage-responsive proteins also revealed the metabolic changes in accordance with fruit ripening. Hence, a link has been established between protein profiles and ripening phenotypes which will help to improve our understanding of apricot fruit ripening at the proteomic level.  aThis work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2015BAD16B00]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31401547; 31501449]; and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY17C200014; LY17C200008].  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. LY17C200014 and No. LY17C200008cthe Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang  aNo. 31401547 and No. 31501449cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo.2015BAD16B00cthe National Science-technology Support Plan Projects 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aapricots 3abioinformatics 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agenes 3aphenotype 3aprotein composition 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aripening 0aApricot 0afruit 0aripening 0aquality 0aproteomics1 aLi, Xihong1 aLi, Li1 aThong, Chan Kei,1 aQi, Wei1 aLiu, Xia1 aQiao, Liping1 aWang, Wei1 aJia, Xiaoyu0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2017 May 4, v. 92, no. 3 p.261-269dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2016.12654693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013500167300001600302500001900318520120000337592002801537650001501565650002501580650001201605650001101617650004601628650001201674650001801686650001001704650001801714650001701732650001801749650001901767650002901786650001501815653002801830653001501858700002501873700001801898700002601916700002401942773013901966856008502105852000902190655001202199IND60733714220221119202400.0210410e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073371422DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2021.18953922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKord, Affaf10aPhlorotannins Composition, Radical Scavenging Capacity and Reducing Power of Phenolics from the Brown Alga Cystoseira sauvageauana  ap. 426-438.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to assess the phenolic composition extracted from the brown alga Cystoseira sauvageauana collected from the Algerian coast through high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis and their antioxidant activity based on free radical scavenging and reducing power. The crude extract was obtained from dried biomass using ethanol/water and then fractionated (liquid-liquid) using solvents of increasing polarity. The ethyl acetate fraction contained the largest amount of phenolic compounds (59.27 ± 0.20 g of phloroglucinol equivalents per 100 g of fraction dry weight) and showed strong radical scavenging and reducing capacity. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis using the multiple reactions monitoring scan mode showed that this fraction was mostly composed of phlorotannins (41 compounds) with a degree of polymerization ranging from 3 to 12. The most abundant compounds were two phloroglucinol nonamer isomers (deprotonated molecular ion [M-H]⁻ at m/z 1117). The results suggest that Cystoseira sauvageauana represents an important natural source of antioxidants that could be valorized for human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCystoseira 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass 3acoasts 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afoods 3afree radicals 3ahuman health 3aphlorotannins 3apolymerization 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atechnology 0aCystoseira sauvageauana 0abrown alga1 aFoudil-Cherif, Yazid1 aAmiali, Malek1 aBoumechhour, Abdenour1 aBenfares, Redhouane0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2021 Apr. 21, v. 30, no. 4 p.426-438dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2021.18953923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01566naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010700159300001800266520073300284592002801017650001801045650001301063700001901076773013401095856007401229852000901303655001201312IND60661318320221120150520.0190829e20100818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066131832DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cs00035c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZelzer, Mischa10aNext-generation peptide nanomaterials: molecular networks, interfaces and supramolecular functionality  ap. 3351-3357.  aWith improved understanding of the design rules for self-assembling peptides, new challenges will be faced to incorporate these materials into dynamic systems of higher complexity and functionality.

One of the plant mechanisms to survive from the drought stress is through producing some biochemical compounds. The objective of this research was to know biochemical changes in three cocoa clones during drought stress. The research was conducted at the green house of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute from January – December 2017. The experiment was designed by using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 2 factors and with 3 replications. The first factor was clones of scion that consisting KW 641, Sulawesi 1 and ICS 60 which each of its grafted to Scavina 6 clone as rootstock. The second factor was watering intervals which consisting; every 2 days / regularly watering (adequate of water), every 5 days (moderate drought), and every 8 days (severe drought). The result of this research showed that drought stress decreased chlorophyll content, increased hydrogen peroxide content (ROS), increased the activity of superoxide dismutation (SOD), increased ascorbic acid content, increased total phenolic content, and increased proline content. Sulawesi 1 and KW 641 clones showed lower hydrogen peroxide (ROS) content, while chlorophyll content, SOD activity, total phenolic content, ascorbic acid content, and proline content were higher compared with ICS 60 clone. It showed that Sulawesi 1 and KW 641 clones had more drought-resistance compared with ICS 60 clone.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTheobroma cacao 3aascorbic acid 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aproline 3aresearch institutions 3arootstocks 3ascions 3awater stress 3aIndonesia 0aAntioxidant 0aClone 0aDrought Stress 0aROS1 aIndradewa, Didik0 tIlmu pertanian.g2019 Apr., v. 3, no. 2 p.82-89dUniversitas Gadjah MadawJournal:22161x2527-71627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22146/ipas.374953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01323naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014400156300002000300520035700320592002800677650001200705650001700717650002100734700001500755700001400770700001700784700001300801773012400814856007400938852000901012655001201021IND60667270620221120064332.0190919e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066727062DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra17072e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xinbo10aTerminal alkyne substituted O⁶-benzylguanine for versatile and effective syntheses of fluorescent labels to genetically encoded SNAP-tags  ap. 23646-23649.  aWe have developed a terminal alkyne substituted O⁶-benzylguanine, named PYBG, as a versatile precursor to be facilely conjugated with various fluorescent dyes through ‘Click chemistry’ and Sonogashira coupling reactions.

With a high microbial load on the peat moss substrate, there is a risk of microbial transfer onto the edible portion during packaging and throughout the product's shelf life. Since the produce is believed to have no contact with the substrate, no sanitizer wash is performed before packaging and storage. RESULTS: Aerobic plate count (APC) results suggested that reduction in count was influenced by both sanitizer application and storage time. Peroxyacetic acid significantly reduced APC count on leaves, roots, and substrate, with a 1.8 log CFU g⁻¹ initial reduction on the leaf. Fungi and APC levels increased with storage time, with the greatest APC increase in the roots. Leaves had the lowest coliform bacteria (CB), with chlorine slightly reducing CB count. Unlike APC, CB levels decreased during storage on the substrate and root samples. No Listeria positive was confirmed by agglutination test. Further evaluation of different commercial substrates reveals that Com4, a drier‐compacted plug, had the least ability to support growth/survival of all microbial populations enumerated relative to the spongy, wet black plugs. CONCLUSION: The ability of peat moss substrates to host microorganisms is influenced by the physical properties of the product. Sanitizer wash efficacy is dependent on the initial microbial load and the length of storage. Chlorine and peroxyacetic acid are effective in reducing microbial populations on the leaves of hydroponically grown lettuce without affecting visual quality during shelf life. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aME0‐31916cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aSphagnum 3aagglutination tests 3aagriculture 3achlorine 3acoliform bacteria 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3alettuce 3amicrobial load 3aperacetic acid 3aplate count 3arisk 3asanitizers 3ashelf life 3astorage time1 aMachado, Robson M1 aPerry, Jennifer J.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8171-66810 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 101, no. 4 p.1403-1410dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.107533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245009100212300001600303506007600319520086100395592002801256506003701284650002101321650002501342650002201367650001601389650000901405650002001414650001901434650002701453653002801480653001401508653001901522653002701541653001901568653002101587653003501608653001901643653001601662653001401678700001801692700002101710700002101731700002601752700002201778700002401800773011701824856008501941852000902026655001202035IND60532173120221207123637.0190215e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053217312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.12.0022doi7 aPMC48465322pmcid7 a266728962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoparaju, Geetha10aFirst principles design of a core bioenergetic transmembrane electron-transfer protein  ap. 503-512.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHere we describe the design, Escherichia coli expression and characterization of a simplified, adaptable and functionally transparent single chain 4-α-helix transmembrane protein frame that binds multiple heme and light activatable porphyrins.

We present here designs for disc permeameters for both positive and negative water supply heads. The effects of the water supply membrane and soil contact material on permeameter performance are examined using approximate quasi-analytic solutions to the flow equation. This analysis provides approximate criteria for the selection of membrane and soil contact materials. Limitations to performance caused by restricted air entry are considered and design criteria are given also. We present in situ tests of the disc permeameter for the early stages of one-dimensional infiltration and an example of the deterministic variation of sorptivity of a field soil with supply potential. Finally, we use ponded and unsaturated sorptivities measured in situ with disc permeameters to find the saturated hydraulic conductivity and flow-weighted mean characteristic pore dimension of a field soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amacropores 3apermeameters 3apreferential flow 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil management 3awater supply1 aWhite, I.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1988 Sept., v. 52, no. 5 p.1205-1215dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200050001x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245009500201300001800296506007600314520044500390592002800835506003700863650001700900650001400917650002300931650002300954650001600977700002300993700002101016773013201037856007501169852000901244655001201253IND60538806920221207114054.0160816e20130403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053880692DNAL7 a10.1021/ja401908m2doi7 aPMC39648132pmcid7 a235065092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutson, Gerri

According to E-tongue and E-nose radar plots and principal component analysis (PCA), baking can effectively change the taste and odor of defatted tiger nut flour, and the odors of samples with a baking time of >8 min were significantly different from the original odor of unbaked flour. Moreover, bitterness and astringency increased with longer baking times, and sweetness decreased. HS-SPME-GC-MS detected a total of 68 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in defatted tiger nut flour at different baking levels, and most VOCs were detected at 8 min of baking. Combined with the relative odor activity value (ROAV) and heat map analysis, the types and contents of key flavor compounds were determined to be most abundant at 8 min of baking; 3-methyl butyraldehyde (fruity and sweet), valeraldehyde (almond), hexanal (grassy and fatty), and 1-dodecanol, were the key flavor compounds. 2,5-dimethyl pyrazine, and pyrazine, 2-ethylalkyl-3,5-dimethyl- added nutty aromas, and 1-nonanal, 2-heptanone, octanoic acid, bicyclo [3.1.1]hept-3-en-2-ol,4,6,6-trimethyl-, and 2-pentylfuran added special floral and fruity aromas.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-heptanone 3aCyperus esculentus 3aalmonds 3aastringency 3abitterness 3aelectronic nose 3aelectronic tongue 3aflour 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aheat 3aoctanoic acid 3aodors 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyrazines 3aradar 3asolid phase microextraction 3asweetness 3ataste 3avolatile organic compounds1 aLiu, Tingting 1 aLi, Quanhong 1 aWang, Dawei 1 aZhang, Yanrong 0 tFoods.g2022 Feb. 02, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110304463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011000168300001800278520141800296592002801714650002501742650001301767650000901780650001101789650001301800650001401813650001401827650001001841650002501851650002501876650001601901650002301917700002501940700003101965700002201996700002002018773012202038856008202160852000902242655001202251IND60627483720221117231230.0220818e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062748372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-011-5490-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernal, Susan A.10aMechanical and thermal characterisation of geopolymers based on silicate-activated metakaolin/slag blends  ap. 5477-5486.  aThis article assesses the effect of mix design parameters on the compressive strength and thermal performance of alkali silicate-activated blends of metakaolin (MK) and granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS). A strong interrelationship between the effects of activator composition and the GBFS/(GBFS + MK) ratio is identified through statistical analysis of compressive strength data. Pastes formulated with higher SiO₂/Al₂O₃ molar ratios show improvements in mechanical strength with increasing GBFS addition, associated with the formation of a structure comprising coexisting aluminosilicate ‘geopolymer’ gel and Ca-rich Al-substituted silicate hydrate (C-(A)-S-H) reaction products. The inclusion of GBFS in MK-based geopolymers seems also to improve their performance when exposed to high temperatures, as higher residual compressive strengths are reported for these mixtures compared to solely MK-based systems. Only slight differences in shrinkage behaviour are observed at temperatures of up to 600 °C with the inclusion of GBFS; however, slag-blended pastes exhibit enhanced stability at temperatures exceeding 800 °C, as no variation in the compressive strength and no additional shrinkage are identified. These results suggest that nanostructural modifications are induced in the gel by the inclusion of GBFS into MK-based geopolymers, improving the overall performance of these materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression strength 3afurnaces 3agels 3apastes 3apolymers 3ashrinkage 3asilicates 3aslags 3astatistical analysis 3astrength (mechanics) 3atemperature 3athermal properties1 aRodríguez, Erich D.1 aMejía de Gutiérrez, Ruby1 aGordillo, Marisol1 aProvis, John L.0 tJournal of materials science.g2011 Aug., v. 46, no. 16 p.5477-5486dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-011-5490-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01943naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003300155245012500188300001200313520067500325592002801000650002101028650002501049650002501074650002601099650001601125650002001141653003201161653001501193653001501208653001501223653003901238700002201277700002401299700001601323773011901339856009001458852000901548655001201557IND60532173320221120200540.0190214e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053217332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrimdahl, Karoline Gangestad10aSynthesis of 5-(S)-HETE, 5-(S)-HEPE and (+)-zooxanthellactone: Three hydroxylated polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites  ap. 1-4.  aShort and stereoselective syntheses of the two hydroxylated polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites, namely 5-(S)-HETE and 5-(S)-HEPE, are reported in 23% and 30% overall yields, respectively.

Understanding consumers’ preferences for fish products is crucial for increasing fish consumption. This article reports the consumer preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for different fish species and attributes on representative samples in five European countries (n = 2509): France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Consumer choices were investigated for fresh fish in a retail market under hypothetical situations arranged by a labelled choice experiment conducted for seven fish species: Cod, herring, seabass, seabream, salmon, trout, and pangasius. The results show the highest premiums for wild-caught fish than farm-raised alternatives. Ready-to-cook products are generally preferred to whole fish, whereas fish fillet preference is more species-specific. The results show positive premiums for a sustainability label and nutrition and health claims, with high heterogeneity across countries and species. With consumers’ preferences and WTP being largely country- and fish-dependent, businesses (fish companies, retailers, and others) should consider the specific market context and adapt their labelling strategies accordingly. Public authorities campaigns should inform consumers about the tangible benefits related with health and environmental labels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparidae 3aecolabeling 3afish consumption 3afish fillets 3aherring 3amarkets 3araw fish 3aready-to-cook foods 3aretail marketing 3asalmon 3atrout 3awillingness to pay 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aItaly 3aSpain1 aNguyen, Thong  Tien1 aSogari, Giovanni 1 aTaskov, Dimitar 1 aLucas, Sterenn 1 aCastro-Rial, José  Luis Santiago1 aMora, Cristina 0 tNutrients.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120926503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01459naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008400165300001800249520029600267592002800563650003600591650001400627650002300641650001100664650000900675650001300684650001300697650002200710650002200732700002000754700001900774700001400793700005600807773013400863856007900997852000901076655001201085IND60608175620221120031043.0180807e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060817562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b010162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chun-Meng10aCu(II)-Catalyzed Ortho-C–H Nitration of Aryl Ureas By C–H Functionalization  ap. 8315-8321.  aA novel protocol for the aromatic ortho C–H nitration of aryl ureas with Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O is developed.

In this study four non-climacteric green vegetables were stored at 0, 5, 10, and 20°C in an atmosphere containing 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 μL L⁻¹ ethylene. The results showed that the postharvest life, as determined by consumer acceptance criteria of yellowing for pak choi and broccoli, leaf abscission for mint, and pod softening and chilling injury for green bean, increased as the temperature and ethylene concentration decreased. Regression equations generated from the storage data allowed for the calculation of the temperature and ethylene levels required for any nominated postharvest life. Using a 14-day postharvest life as an example, storage in ethylene at 0.001 μL L⁻¹ would allow a storage temperature of about 10°C for pak choi, broccoli, and mint and about 18°C for green bean, temperatures well above the current recommendations of 0 to 5°C.  aThis work was supported by the Australian Research Council.  aPublisher supplied data  aIC1 30100021cAustralian Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3abroccoli 3achilling injury 3aconsumer acceptance 3aenergy conservation 3aequations 3aethylene 3agreen beans 3aleaf abscission 3amint 3arefrigeration 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 0aEthylene 0atemperature 0agreen vegetables 0aenergy savings1 aWills, R.

D.10aIncreasing and Stabilizing β-Sheet Structure of Maize Zein Causes Improvement in Its Rheological Properties  ap. 2316-2321.  aWheat gluten proteins are considered to have the unique ability to form viscoelastic matrices that are essential for breadmaking. This study shows that maize seed storage protein (zein), if properly treated, can be made to function similarly to gluten at the protein secondary structure level with concomitant improved viscoelasticity. Here, we propose the concept of a small amount of coprotein (high molecular weight glutenin or casein) acting to stabilize a build-up of β-sheet structure in a zein-based dough, thus creating a viscoelastic matrix that is retained over time. This discovery is relevant to the need for gluten replacement viscoelastic proteins for wheat intolerant individuals and as well opens possibilities of creating wheatlike cereal varieties that could more cheaply substitute for wheat imports in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein 3acorn 3adeveloping countries 3adough 3aglutenins 3aimports 3amolecular weight 3aprotein secondary structure 3aseed storage 3aviscoelasticity 3awheat 3awheat gluten 3azein 2aCaseinsxchemistry 2aDrug Stability 2aElasticity 2aGlutensxchemistry 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aRheology 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aViscosity 2aZea maysxchemistry 2aZeinxchemistry 0amaize 0azein 0aprotein structure 0aviscoelasticity 0aFTIR1 aGonzalez, David C.1 aMauer, Lisa J.1 aCampanella, Osvaldo H.1 aHamaker, Bruce R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Mar. 07, v. 60, no. 9 p.2316-2321dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf203073a3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02598naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010600172520144800278592002801726650001501754650001501769650001501784653003801799653002701837653002501864653002001889653004001909700002501949700002901974700001802003700002502021773010602046856008702152852000902239655001202248IND60749068820221119093638.0211129e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074906882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1274142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinkov, Ivan L.14aThe cause of accelerated desorption of sparingly soluble dodecanol monolayers: Convection or leakage?  aThe dissolution of sparingly soluble surfactants from spread monolayers is a complex multi-staged process. The desorption of dodecanol from the surface of water follows mixed barrier/diffusion kinetics only in the first stages of the dissolution. Significant acceleration of the desorption has been observed experimentally after this initial period, which has been hypothesized to be due to onset of convective diffusion; the source of convection, however, has never been identified. The goal of this work is to investigate the question through desorption experiments under controlled convection and respective modeling of the process under mixed barrier/convective diffusion control. Several hypotheses for the cause of the accelerated desorption have been tested. The analysis has shown that natural convection, Marangoni convection, convection due to the motion of the mechanical barrier of the Langmuir trough, and artificial convection caused by an electromagnetic stirrer cannot produce desorption rates of the observed magnitude. These findings convincingly prove for the first time that the convective diffusion has less of a role in the transport process than previously thought. The most likely reason for the acceleration is identified as leakage through the movable barrier. The rate of this leakage is estimated form the experimental data. Implications for the use of adsorption isobars to study desorption kinetics are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aconvection 3adesorption 0aKinetics of adsorption-desorption 0aBarrier for desorption 0aConvective diffusion 0aLangmuir trough 0aLeakage through the movable barrier1 aDimitrova, Iglika M.1 aArabadzhieva, Dimitrinka1 aMileva, Elena1 aSlavchov, Radomir I.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 629 p.127414-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1274143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009000164500001400254520148800268592002801756650001801784650002401802650000901826650001801835650001701853650001501870650002201885650001901907650000901926650001701935650001801952650001501970650002001985650001002005650000902015650001702024650002102041700002002062700001902082700002002101700002502121700002102146700001702167700002502184700003002209700001802239700002202257700002202279700001902301700002102320773012202341856007402463852000902537655001202546IND60711778820221122030245.0200928e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071177882DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120926542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupont, Christophe 10aHydrolyzed Rice Protein-Based Formulas, a Vegetal Alternative in Cow’s Milk Allergy  aNAL-light  aFormulas adapted to infant feeding, although most of the time made from cow’s milk proteins, can be made from hydrolyzed rice protein but they must be classified as “formulas for specific medical needs”, according to European regulations. The nutritional quality of rice proteins is thus suitable to be used in infant formulas giving that it is supplemented by certain amino acids which can be lacking. Besides, hydrolysis is required to facilitate their water solubility and digestibility. Owing to a low allergenicity of rice and to the absence of the cross-allergy between milk proteins and rice proteins, these formulas are adapted to the diet of children with cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA), which explains their growing use in some countries. However, CMPA, an expanding disorder, has consequences for growth, bone mineralization, and often has an association with allergy to other foods, including cow’s milk extensive hydrolysate, so that a surveillance of the adaption of hydrolyzed rice protein formulas (HRPF) to CMPA, the absence of unexpected side effects, and the appropriate response to its various health hazards seems mandatory. This paper analyses the health problem deriving from CMPA, the industrial development of hydrolyzed rice protein formulas, and the limited number of clinical studies, which confirms, at the moment, a good allergic tolerance and safety. The goal is to better advise heath care professionals on their use of HRPFs during CMPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3abone mineralization 3acows 3adigestibility 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3aindustrialization 3ainfant feeding 3amilk 3amilk allergy 3amilk proteins 3amonitoring 3anutritive value 3apaper 3arice 3arice protein 3awater solubility1 aBocquet, Alain 1 aTomé, Daniel 1 aBernard, Marie 1 aCampeotto, Florence 1 aDumond, Pascale 1 aEssex, Anna 1 aFrelut, Marie-Laure 1 aGuénard-Bilbault, Lydie 1 aLack, Gideon 1 aLinglart, Agnès 1 aPayot, François 1 aTaïeb, Alain,1 aKalach, Nicolas 0 tNutrients.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120926543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03787naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003500139245010900174300001800283500002000301520212200321592002802443650002502471650002102496650001702517650001602534650000902550650001002559650001502569650001902584650002002603650001902623650001202642650002002654650002802674650001702702650001502719650001302734650003902747650002102786650001802807650001402825700003002839700001902869700003102888700001902919700003102938700006602969773012703035856007403162852000903236655001203245IND60793347720221118001324.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079334772DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.136822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThirumalaikumar, Eswaramoorthy10aEfficacy of recombinant subunit OMP and hly vaccines against Aeromonas hydrophila in Rohu (Labeo rohita)  ap. 1581-1592.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe main aim of the current study was to clone and express a new outer membrane protein (OMP) and haemolysin (hly) from a pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila and to investigate their potential as a vaccine candidate against A. hydrophila infection in Rohu (Labeo rohita). The OMP and hly genes were cloned in pET‐30b vector and recombinant plasmids pET‐30b‐OMP and pET‐30b‐hly were constructed, which were then transferred into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) was induced by IPTG, and the OMP and hly proteins were expressed highly. The proteins OMP and hly were estimated in 15% SDS‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE). Their molecular weights were found to be 40 kD and 68 kD. The expressed proteins OMP and hly were purified by Ni‐NTA His‐Bind Resin column, and the immunogenicity was confirmed by Western blotting. The fishes (L. rohita) were divided into IV groups, and the group I fishes were treated with phosphate saline, the II and III group were immunized with the purified OMP and hly recombinant proteins, and the fishes were treated IV group with combined OMP and hly for 10 days. After 10 days of treatment, the fishes of all the four groups were challenged with virulent A. hydrophila. The results revealed that vaccinated fish showed significantly improved haematological profile, phagocytic activity, myeloperoxidase activity and total immunoglobulin levels on the 5th and 10th days. The non‐vaccinated group (Group I) showed 100% mortality, whereas the mixture of recombinant OMP (r‐OMP) and hly (r‐hly) protein‐treated groups (Group IV) exhibited higher survival rate (80%). Relatively, expression of pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory cytokines (IL‐1β, IL‐10 and TGF‐β), c‐type and g‐type lysozymes were significantly up‐regulated in heart and kidney of vaccinated groups compared with the non‐vaccinated group. Our results revealed that OMP and hly genes were effective vaccine candidates in the aquaculture system and could be used as recombinant subunit vaccine for diseases caused by pathogenic A. hydrophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aEscherichia coli 3aLabeo rohita 3aaquaculture 3afish 3aheart 3ahemolysins 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainterleukin-10 3akidneys 3amyeloperoxidase 3aouter membrane proteins 3aphagocytosis 3aphosphates 3aplasmids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asubunit vaccines 3asurvival rate 3avirulence1 aSathishkumar, Ramamoorthy1 aVimal, Sugumar1 aBabu, Mariavincent Michael1 aUma, Ganapathi1 aLusiastuti, Angela Mariana1 aCitarasu, Thavasimuthu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6166-620X0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2022 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.1581-1592dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.136823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100002300157245009200180300001600272520116900288592002801457650002301485650001401508650002001522650002701542650001201569650002201581650001501603650002001618650001401638650001401652650000901666650001101675650001401686650001301700650002101713650001201734650002101746650002801767650002301795650002701818650003901845650001901884650003301903650002501936650001901961650004101980700002302021700002102044773009602065856003902161852000902200655001202209IND50074423320221120030735.0140402e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007442332DNAL7 a243756362pmid7 a10.1002/etc.25102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarwood, Amanda D.10aUsing Hexagenia in sediment bioassays: Methods, applicability, and relative sensitivity  ap. 868-874.  aThe majority of sediment toxicity and aquatic bioaccumulation assessments are conducted using standardized species, such as Hyalella azteca, Chironomus dilutus, and Lumbriculus variegatus. The burrowing mayfly, Hexagenia sp., may serve as an ideal supplemental organism for both toxicity and bioaccumulation studies for several reasons. Hexagenia are recognized as sensitive species, have a long aquatic life stage (up to 2 yr), and have large bodies, which aid in retrieval from sediments and for residue analysis. The present study outlines the authors' established method for collecting and hatching eggs, raising nymphs, and using these animals for toxicity testing. Furthermore, the relative sensitivity of 3 size classes of Hexagenia to a representative contaminant (bifenthrin) was examined and compared with laboratory‐derived median lethal concentrations for the more traditionally used Hyalella and Chironomus. Finally, sublethal end points, including immobilization and suspended solids, were defined for this species. This provides guidance for the use of this species in toxicological bioassays.

In brassica crops, aphids and diamondback moth are major pest species worldwide. The aphidophagous Coccinellinae Eriopis connexa (Germar) is a common predator in crop ecosystems including brassicas. We hypothesised that the performance of E. connexa would be improved if it were fed a mixed diet of prey available in the brassica ecosystem compared with the standard rearing prey; eggs of Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller). We evaluated diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) larvae, the brassica aphid, Lipaphis pseudobrassicae (Davis) when provided as single species, as mixtures of two species, or as all three species alternated over time. Developmental time and survival of E. connexa larvae fed diets of mixed prey and alternated available prey were superior to individuals that fed only P. xylostella larvae. Only 33% of E. connexa larvae that fed on P. xylostella alone survived and their development was delayed by 6 days. However, mean daily predation of P. xylostella larvae as single, mixed or alternated prey was 9.1 ± 0.2, 3.1 ± 0.1 and 9.4 ± 0.5 individuals, respectively, showing that this species was consumed even in the presence of preferred prey. Adult female E. connexa that consumed only P. xylostella did not lay eggs indicating that this prey could sustain the development and maintenance of E. connexa, but they are not essential prey. Predation of P. xylostella did not enhance or negatively affect E. connexa performance.  aThis research was supported by the ‘Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq)’ under research project [420815/2018-0], and scientific research grant to D.V.N and to J.B.T.; and to ‘Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES)’ under PROEX programme.  aPublisher supplied data  a420815/2018-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  aPROEXcCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322 3aEphestia kuehniella 3aEriopis connexa 3aLipaphis 3aPlutella xylostella 3aadults 3aaphidophagous predators 3abiological control 3adiet 3aecosystems 3afemales 3apests 3apredation 3atechnology 0aCoccinellidae 0aalternative prey 0aprey scarcity1 aLira, Rogério1 aFerreira, Ellen K.S.1 aTorres, Jorge B.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2021 Sept. 02, v. 31, no. 9 p.951-963dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl55514x1360-04787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2021.19012643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01578naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016700159300001800326520039200344592002800736650002600764650002300790650001900813650002200832650001800854650004400872650001600916700002000932700002000952700001900972700002000991773013401011856007401145852000901219655001201228IND60660863720221118223138.0190827e20150224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066086372DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc10400e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArora, Shafali10aSelective functionalization of methylene bridges of calix[6]arenes.

The biosensor was prepared completely from materials of natural origin. The sensor was characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and image processing by CIELab. The biosensor indicated spoilage of fish by exhibiting a visible color change from brownish pink to yellowish green. The results of the biodegradability test indicated that the developed sensors decompose at the rate of 60–70% in 2 weeks. This biosensor can be recycled at least six times. It was also estimated that the cost for one biosensor per package was approximately 2 cents. Thus, the biosensor developed in this study is economical, biodegradable, and efficient in monitoring spoilage of packaged fishes. Hence, this economical biosensor can easily be adopted by retail sellers and exporters. The biosensor developed in this study is promising for monitoring spoilage of packaged fishes in retail markets.  aThis work was supported by the Tamil Nadu Dr. J.

The egg parasitoid, Gryon pennsylvanicum (Ashmead), is the primary parasitoid of the squash bug and has been considered as a biological control agent. In the present study, we conducted both laboratory and greenhouse bioassays to determine the effects of kairomones emitted by A. tristis on the host searching behaviour of G. pennsylvanicum. Chemicals were extracted from A. tristis eggs, unmated females and males, and mated females and males. The percentage of females responding to extracts was significantly higher for egg extracts than the other extracts tested. In greenhouse tests, percent parasitism of egg masses baited with extract-treated lures was significantly higher than for those treated with solvent-treated control lures for all six extracts tested: ethanol and hexane extracts of eggs, mated females and mated males. Further research on kairomones of A. tristis may result in the development of synthetic lures that could be used in squash fields to increase parasitism by G. pennsylvanicum. The promising results from this study highlights the potential application of kairomones in enhancing the efficacy and effectiveness of biological control programmes and should be of interest to growers and pest control professionals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnasa tristis 3aCucurbitaceae 3aGryon 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aeggs 3aethanol 3agreenhouses 3ahexane 3akairomones 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apest control 3asquashes 3atechnology 0aSquash bug 0akairomone1 aZhang, Aijun1 aCornelius, Mary L.1 aVinyard, Bryan T.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2021 Sept. 02, v. 31, no. 9 p.964-975dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl55514x1360-04787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2021.19102033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245010100174300001800275520168100293592002801974650001302002650001802015650001602033650001102049650002102060650001602081650002302097650002302120650001602143650001902159650001302178650001802191650001402209650001102223700002602234700002102260700001702281700002302298773009902321856004802420852000902468655001202477IND4469736720221120053903.0121003e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446973672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-012-3005-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalacios-Fuentes, Pamela14aThe effects of a parasitic copepod on the recent larval growth of a fish inhabiting rocky coasts  ap. 1661-1671.  aParasites can infect larval, juvenile or adult marine fishes; however, the effects of parasites on the growth and condition of fish larvae have seldom been investigated. This study analysed the effects of a parasitic copepod on the larval growth of the Chilean triplefin Helcogrammoides chilensis (Tripterygiidae) based on the microstructure of the sagittal otoliths. Fish larvae were collected during the austral spring of 2010 off central Chile. Their body length ranged from 5.1 to 16.6 mm (2 to 57 days old). They were parasitised by a penellid larval copepod that was always externally attached to the ventral side of the fish’s gut. The prevalence of the copepod ranged from 2.7 % to 20.8 %, with one to four parasites per fish larva. Relationships between otolith size (radius, perimeter) and larval size were equal for parasitised and unparasitised fish larvae (P > 0.05). Larval growth was also similar for unparasitised (0.21 mm/day) and parasitised fish larvae (0.19 mm/day) (P > 0.05). However, a comparison of same-aged larvae showed that the larvae with copepods were smaller in both length and estimated body volume than the larvae without copepods. The Recent Otolith Growth Index, indicated that larval H. chilensis with copepods showed a reduction in recent growth and condition compared with those without evidence of copepods (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, a higher parasite load (two vs. one pennellids) did not decrease the condition of the larval fish. The infestation of pennellids on coastal fish larvae may therefore induce an increase in the pelagic larval duration and potentially affect the settlement rates of this intertidal fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aanimal growth 3abody length 3acoasts 3adigestive system 3afish larvae 3agrowth retardation 3alarval development 3amarine fish 3amicrostructure 3aotoliths 3aparasite load 3aparasites 3aspring1 aLandaeta, Mauricio F.1 aMuñoz, Gabriela1 aPlaza, Guido1 aOjeda, F.

The slide occurred as a veneer displacement along the interface between the geomembrane (GM) and geosynthetic clay liner (GCL). Site observations suggested that elevated gas pressures were a significant contributor to the failure. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the shear strength parameters of the GM–GCL interface and the reduction in normal stress required to cause displacement of the GM–GCL interface. Hydraulic conductivity and gas permeability of the GCL were also determined. Slope stability analyses were conducted to determine the gas pressure required to cause a slide and the factor of safety that would have existed if the gas pressures was at zero gage. Good agreement was obtained between gas pressures measured in the field, measurements of the reduction in normal stress required to cause sliding on the GM–GCL interface in a large-scale direct shear test, and the gas pressures corresponding to FS = 1 (imminent sliding) from the slope stability analysis. The findings from this study, and a similar case history, illustrate the importance of managing gas at an acceptable level beneath the cover at MSW landfills.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aforensic sciences 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alaboratory techniques 3alandfills 3amunicipal solid waste 3apermeability 3asafety factor 3ashear strength1 aEdil, Tuncer B.1 aWang, Xiaodong0 tGeotextiles and Geomembranes.g2012 Dec., v. 35 p.100-106dElsevier Ltdx0266-11447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geotexmem.2012.07.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012400161300002000285520113900305592002801444650004401472650001201516650002801528650001601556650001401572650002501586650001301611650001001624650001901634650002601653650001701679650002101696650002301717700003601740700001601776700002401792700004201816773012401858856007401982852000902056655001202065IND60667271220221120052926.0190919e20150326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066727122DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra17087c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChahal, Sugandha10aElectrospun hydroxyethyl cellulose nanofibers functionalized with calcium phosphate coating for bone tissue engineering  ap. 29497-29504.  aThe aim of this study is to develop a facile and efficient scaffold from electrospun hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) functionalized with bone-like calcium phosphate (CaP). The HEC/PVA nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning and mineralized by incubating in 10× simulated body fluid (SBF) for different period of times. After 24 h of incubation, the nanofibers were uniformly coated by a thin layer of mineral deposit. SEM, FTIR, and FESEM-EDS analyses confirm the deposition of CaP on the nanofibers. The nanostructured biomaterial maintained its fibrous and porous structure after mineralization. The XRD results suggest that the deposited mineral phase is a mixture of calcium phosphate hydrate and apatite. The mechanical properties of CaP coated scaffolds show similar tensile strength and elastic modulus with that of trabecular and proximal femoral bones. The cytocompatibility of the CaP coated HEC/PVA scaffolds were evaluated using human osteosarcoma cells. The CaP coated HEC/PVA scaffolds support cellular attachment and proliferation of osteosarcoma cells and will be a promising candidate for bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aapatite 3abiocompatible materials 3abody fluids 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acoatings 3afemur 3amineralization 3amodulus of elasticity 3aosteosarcoma 3atensile strength 3atissue engineering1 aJahir Hussain, Fathima Shahitha1 aKumar, Anuj1 aYusoff, Mashitah M.1 aBahari Abdull Rasad, Mohammad Syaiful0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 26, v. 5, no. 37 p.29497-29504dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra17087c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002500156245014000181300001800321520070900339592002801048650002301076650002001099650002001119650001701139650001401156650001701170650001201187650002301199650002601222650002001248650003001268650002001298650004301318650002401361650004501385653001401430653002101444653001401465653002901479653002001508700001601528700002101544700002001565700002401585773014701609852000901756856007501765655001201840IND4463483320221122155202.0160905e20120307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446348332DNAL7 a222960362pmid7 a10.1021/jf205297p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Nguyen

R. E. Fries) is an ideal crop for industrial oil production because of its high erucic acid content (C22:1, approx. 60 %) in its seed oil. The value of crambe oil can be improved by increasing C22:1 content or reducing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The FAD2 gene plays a critical role in PUFA biosynthesis. To identify targets for breeding, we characterized FAD2 in crambe for copy number and expression profile. Seven copies of FAD2 were detected in allohexaploid crambe. Three genes (CaFAD2-C1, -C2 and -C3) were expressed in multiple tissues, including root, seedling, leaf, flower, bud and developing seeds. In developing seeds, the expression of these genes was upregulated with CaFAD2-C3, being expressed predominantly with a peak at 20 days after pollination. This gene is therefore a promising candidate gene for determining PUFA levels in seed oil. Four other FAD2 genes were considered to be “pseudo-genes” as they harbour internal stop codons and were not expressed. Among the six crambe varieties with consistent variation in oil composition, no nucleotide polymorphisms were found in the CaFAD2-C1, -C2 and -C3 genes. In seeds at 30 days after pollination, statistically significant expression level polymorphisms for only one gene, CaFAD2-C2, was found among the varieties. However, although significantly different, the difference in expression was small and did not explain the variation in oil composition. Given the absence of genetic variation in CaFAD2 genes in crambe breeding lines, breeding for high erucic acid content calls for a molecular breeding approach whereby mutations are chemically induced to increase the genetic variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3astop codon 3apollination 3abiosynthesis 3aseeds 3aCrambe abyssinica 3aseedlings 3agenetic variation 3abreeding 3amutation 3aflowers 3acrambe seed oil 3aoilseed crops 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3aerucic acid 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3abreeding lines 3aleaves 0agenes1 aSalentijn, E.

Sediment deposition is an important pressure that can affect benthic species and benthic ontogenetic stages (eggs and larvae) habitat quality. However, knowledge on the effects of sediment in a warming context is lacking. We used a common garden approach to examine the effects of combined exposure to elevated temperature and deposited sediment on early life history traits in offspring of four wild Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) populations, originating from geographically isolated lakes at the southern edge of the species range. We report interactive effects of temperature and sediment, with higher temperature exacerbating the negative effects of sediments on the duration of the incubation period and on the body size – yolk expenditure trade-off during development. Our results highlight that reevaluating the impacts of sediment on organisms under the lens of global warming and at the scale of several wild populations is needed to improve our understanding of how vulnerable species can respond to environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvelinus alpinus 3abenthic organisms 3abody size 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3alife history 3aontogeny 3aprogeny 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3atemperature 3avulnerable species1 aDaufresne, Martin1 aGuillard, Jean1 aEvanno, Guillaume1 aLasne, Emilien0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2021, v. 78, no. 6 p.744-751dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-02563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245021300161300001800374500002000392520082800412592002801240596005701268596006101325596004901386650002501435650002201460650001401482650002501496650002001521650002001541650002001561650001201581650001701593650003701610650001301647650003001660650001401690650002001704700002101724700002001745700001201765700001801777700002001795700002201815700001701837700001401854700005801868700002101926700002001947773012701967856007402094852000902168655001202177IND60793348020221118001313.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079334802DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.136772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Ning‐Xia10aTranscriptome analysis and co‐expression network reveal the mechanism linking mitochondrial function to immune regulation in red crucian carp (Carassius auratus red var) after Aeromonas hydrophila challenge  ap. 1491-1509.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAeromonas hydrophila is a common pathogen of freshwater fish. In this study, A. hydrophila infection was shown to cause tissue damage, trigger physiological changes as well as alter the expression profiles of immune‐ and metabolic‐related genes in immune tissues of red crucian carp (RCC). Transcriptome analysis revealed that acute A. hydrophila infection exerted a profound effect on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation linking metabolic regulation to immune response. In addition, we further identified cellular senescence, apoptosis, necrosis and mitogen‐activated protein kinase signal pathways as crucial signal pathways in the kidney of RCC subjected to A. hydrophila infection.

Because the mass mortality of oak trees caused by Japanese oak wilt is spreading northward in northern Honshu, we sampled P. quercivorus in 20 forest sites in the southernmost part of Hokkaido by using pheromone traps. Five P. quercivorus (two males and three females) were collected from four sites. Because oak species distributed in Hokkaido are all susceptible to Japanese oak wilt, monitoring and control measures will be needed to prevent the spread of Japanese oak wilt in Hokkaido.  aThis study was funded by JSPS KAKENHI JP18K05735.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP18K05735 3aJapan 3aPlatypus quercivorus 3aambrosia beetles 3aforests 3amortality 3aoak wilt 3apheromones 3aresearch 0aAmbrosia beetle 0aforest pest 0aJapanese oak wilt 0apheromone trap 0aQuercus crispula1 aUeda, Akira1 aTokuda, Sawako1 aWada, Hisayuki1 aKitajima, Hiroshi0 tJournal of forest research.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 26, no. 2 p.152-154dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13416979.2020.18604533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016200164500001900326520139700345592002801742650001301770650001801783650001401801650001701815650001301832650002601845650001501871650001101886650001201897650001101909650001601920650001501936650001001951650001101961650001601972653002201988653002102010653002402031653002802055653003802083700001702121700001802138700001702156700001702173700001902190700001802209700005902227773012202286856008102408852000902489655001202498IND60696871720221122054621.0200804e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069687172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1095472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Zhi-Wei10aEffects of dynamic and static withering technology on volatile and nonvolatile components of Keemun black tea using GC-MS and HPLC combined with chemometrics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWithering process is one of the most crucial steps in Keemun black tea (KBT) manufacturing, which is the foundation of quality formation. This study investigated the effects of conventional static withering and innovative dynamic withering on the volatile and nonvolatile compounds of KBT. Overall, 79 volatile compounds were identified in five tea samples (FL: fresh leaf for control; SW7h, SW15h: leaves of static withering 7 h and 15 h; and DW7h, DW15h: leaves of dynamic withering 7 h and 15 h) by using HS-SPME/GC-MS. Orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to classify samples, and 36 key markers in volatile compounds were selected. Quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) of KBT aroma showed that in dynamic withering, dense, floral and fruity aroma were significantly improved. The 14 odor-active compounds were speculated as the cause of QDA differences in aroma between dynamic and static withering. Meanwhile, theaflavins were generated and accumulated earlier in dynamic withering. Notably, the contents of aspartic acid, serine, glycine, arginine, cysteine, methionine, lysine, isoleucine, and leucine significantly increased after dynamic withering. Our study provides a comparative investigation metabolite of dynamic and static withering processes, offering innovative dynamic withering methods to improve the quality of KBT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3ablack tea 3achemometrics 3acysteine 3adiscriminant analysis 3aisoleucine 3aleaves 3aleucine 3alysine 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3aodors 3aserine 3atheaflavins 0aDynamic withering 0aStatic withering 0aVolatile components 0aNon-volatile components 0aQuantitative descriptive analyses1 aWang, Yu-Jie1 aXu, Shan-Shan1 aWei, Yuming,1 aBao, Guan-Hu1 aDai, Qian-Ying1 aDeng, Wei-Wei1 aNing, Jing-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1305-37960 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Aug., v. 130 p.109547-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1095473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009700162300002000259520136300279592002801642650002101670650001301691773012401704856007401828852000901902655001201911IND60667271320221120053117.0190919e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066727132DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra17088a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Cheng-Peng10aDynamical conductivity of gated AA-stacking multilayer graphene with spin–orbital coupling  ap. 32511-32519.  aAn efficient method, without the numerical diagonalization of a huge Hamiltonian matrix and calculation of a tedious Green’s function, is proposed to calculate the exact energy spectrum and dynamical conductivity in gated AA-stacking N-layer graphene (AANLG) with intrinsic spin–orbital coupling (SOC). The 2N × 2N tight-binding Hamiltonian matrix, velocity operator and Green’s function representation of AANLG are simultaneously reduced to N 2 × 2 diagonal block matrices through a proper transformation matrix. Gated AANLG with intrinsic SOC is reduced to N graphene-like layers. The energy spectrum of a graphene-like layer is E = ε⊥ ± ε∥, and ε⊥ depends on the interlayer interaction, gated voltage and layer number. , where EMG is the energy spectrum of a graphene monolayer and Δ is the magnitude of the intrinsic SOC. More importantly, by inserting the diagonal block velocity operator and Green’s function representation in the Kubo formula, the exact dynamical conductivity of AANLG is shown to be , the sum of the dynamical conductivity of N graphene-like layers. The analytical form of σⱼ is presented and the dependence of σⱼ on ε⊥, Δ, and chemical potential is clearly demonstrated. Moreover, the effect of the Rashba SOC on the electronic properties of AANLG is explored with the exact energy spectrum presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectromyography 3agraphene0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 07, v. 5, no. 41 p.32511-32519dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra17088a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03988naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012500153300001800278500001900296500002000315520176300335592002802098596005902126596005902185596005902244596015502303650002802458650003002486650001602516650001302532650001602545650001602561650001502577650001202592650002302604650001702627650001302644650004102657650001202698650002402710650001602734650001302750650001302763650001602776650001702792650001002809650002702819650001202846650001402858650001302872650001002885651001002895700005702905700001602962700001402978700001502992700005703007700001403064773015303078856007403231852000903305655001203314IND60726225620221119132201.0210202e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072622562DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.107572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Lin10aGas chromatography–mass spectrometry‐based metabolomics analysis of metabolites in commercial and inoculated pickles  ap. 1436-1446.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Starter cultures are nowadays more and more used to make inoculated pickles (IPs), but it remains unclear whether there are differences in flavors between IPs and naturally fermented pickles. In this study 16 commercial pickles (CPs) produced by spontaneous fermentation method were purchased from markets in Sichuan province and Chongqing. Ten strains of three lactic acid bacteria species – Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Pediococcus ethanolidurans – were selected as single starter cultures to produce IPs. RESULTS: Differences in flavor components between the CPs and IPs were monitored using a combination of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical methods. Higher levels of nonvolatile substances such as glucose, fructose, tagatose, sucrose, lactic acid and mannitol were detected in most IPs than in the CPs. The values of flavor characteristics such as sweetness, umami and astringency, which were correlated positively with consumers' overall preferences for pickles, were higher in the IPs than in the CPs. Volatile compounds such as geranyl acetate, dimethyl trisulfide, eucalyptol and linalool were distinguished as the main compounds that contributed to the flavor characteristics of the CPs. In addition to dimethyl trisulfide, dimethyl disulfide was also an odor contributor to the IPs. CONCLUSIONS: The CPs and IPs had different flavor characteristics, especially in the composition and content of volatile components, and the inoculation method reflected some fermentation advantages, which could reduce the bitterness and increase umami and lead to a higher score of sensory preference.

Fish are thought to deplete lipids until they reach a critical minimum below which starvation mortality occurs, meaning that lipid-dependent selective overwinter mortality may be a strong selective pressure leading to life-history evolution favouring lipid accumulation and storage. Much of our current knowledge comes from either laboratory studies or field studies that are not well controlled, but rarely is overwinter survival directly estimated to evaluate selective mortality. Here, we studied patterns of lipid storage, overwinter lipid depletion, and subsequent survival of a single strain of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) stocked into experimental lakes that differed in productivity but experienced the same local winter conditions. Productive lakes produced trout with higher lipid content and steeper allometric slopes in contrast with trout in low food lakes; however, these field-based values were all substantially lower than those determined in the lab. Surviving trout from low productivity lakes emerged from winter in poor condition, close to the expected critical minimum needed for survival, in comparison with survivors from higher-productivity lakes. As expected, overwinter mortality was lipid-dependent, with fish in low food lakes nearing 90% mortality and about 60% mortality in high food lakes. Importantly, these estimates are higher than from laboratory (∼70%) and modelling studies (0% to 14%) for this species. These results, though from stocked populations, suggest winter mortality is an even stronger selective pressure than previously thought, creating a tight population bottleneck in young fish cohorts and likely promoting life-history strategies that favour energy storage at the expense of somatic growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aallometry 3aenergy 3aevolution 3alife history 3alipid content 3alipids 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3astarvation 3atrout 3awinter1 aPost, John R.1 aBeckmann, Christa0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2021, v. 78, no. 6 p.738-743dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-02763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245017000173300001800343520106300361592002801424650001701452650002201469650002501491650001101516650001701527650001101544650001501555650001001570650002801580650001601608650002101624650002501645650001401670650000701684650003901691650001601730650002401746650001801770650002301788650003401811650007401845650003101919650001301950650002801963650002701991650002602018653002102044653001702065653001702082653002702099653002202126700001902148700001802167700001502185700001402200700002202214773013202236852000902368856007502377655001202452IND4463483520221122155157.0160905e20120307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446348352DNAL7 a223097612pmid7 a10.1021/jf20497992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yanbin10aPurification and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3–1,4-Glucanase (Lichenase) from Thermophilic Rhizomucor miehei with High Specific Activity and Its Gene Sequence  ap. 2354-2361.  aProduction, purification, and characterization of a novel β-1,3–1,4-glucanase (lichenase) from thermophilic Rhizomucor miehei CAU432 were investigated. High-level extracellular β-1,3–1,4-glucanase production of 6230 U/mL was obtained when oat flour (3%, w/v) was used as a carbon source at 50 °C. The crude enzyme was purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 28818 U/mg. The molecular weight of purified enzyme was estimated to be 35.4 kDa and 33.7 kDa by SDS–PAGE and gel filtration, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature of the enzyme were pH 5.5 and 60 °C, respectively. The Kₘ values of purified β-1,3–1,4-glucanase for barley β-glucan and lichenan were 2.0 mM and 1.4 mM, respectively. Furthermore, the gene (RmLic16A) encoding the β-1,3–1,4-glucanase was cloned and its deduced amino acid sequence showed the highest identity (50%) to characterized β-1,3–1,4-glucanase from Paecilomyces thermophila. The high-level production and biochemical properties of the enzyme enable its potential industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaecilomyces 3aRhizomucor miehei 3aamino acid sequences 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3acarbon 3afiltration 3agenes 3aindustrial applications 3alicheninase 3amolecular weight 3anucleotide sequences 3aoat flour 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3atemperature 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistry 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRhizomucorxenzymology 2aSubstrate Specificity 0acharacterization 0agene cloning 0apurification 0aβ-1,3−1,4-glucanase 0aRhizomucor miehei1 aYang, Shaoqing1 aYan, Qiaojuan1 aZhou, Peng1 aCui, Jian1 aJiang, Zhengqiang0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Mar. 07, v. 60, no. 9 p.2354-2361dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf20497993Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02571naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014000159300002000299520128500319592002801604650001201632650002601644650001601670650000901686650001701695650001701712650000901729650000701738650002201745650001701767650002701784650002601811700001601837700002301853700002701876700001601903700002301919773012401942856007402066852000902140655001202149IND60667271520221120053114.0190919e20150223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066727152DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra17093h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabbani, Gulam10aImpact of structural stability of cold adapted Candida antarctica lipase B (CaLB): in relation to pH, chemical and thermal denaturation  ap. 20115-20131.  aThe effect of pH on the conformational behavior of Candida antartica lipase B (CaLB) has been monitored by spectroscopic and calorimetric studies. The results obtained from far and near-UV CD, intrinsic fluorescence and ANS binding studies indicate that CaLB exhibits the characteristic properties of a molten globule in acidic (protonated) conditions at pH 1.4. The molten globule state retained about 67% of its secondary structure with a substantial loss of tertiary structure at pH 1.4. Moreover, equilibrium unfolding studies indicated that the ‘molten-globule-like’ state unfolds in a non-cooperative manner and is thermodynamically less stable than that of the native state. The molten globule possessed a slightly higher Rₕ than its native state. The DSC thermogram shows a high heat signal at pH 7.4, and a low heat signal at pH 2.6, and suggests that CaLB is likely to have undergone structural changes during the thermal unfolding. However partially unfolded CaLB at pH 1.4 does not produce a DSC peak which proves the existence of the molten globule state at pH 1.4 as supported by spectroscopic data. The Stokes radius of the MG state obtained by SEC experiments is found to be 33% larger than the native state, but essentially smaller than the denatured state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3acalorimetry 3acold 3adenaturation 3afluorescence 3aheat 3apH 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aultraviolet radiation1 aAhmad, Ejaz1 aKhan, Mohsin Vahid1 aAshraf, Mohd.

Minimal variation was observed in amino acid composition of the bean protein isolates except for the hydrophobic amino acids. The isolates were found to be rich in essential amino acids leucine, lysine and phenylalanine while their methionine content was limiting. Denaturation temperature of isolates ranged between 90 and 152 °C and β-layer structure was found to be the dominant secondary structure. Maximum solubility (~97%) and net surface charge (~−23 mV) were observed at pH 9.0. Emulsion capacity and emulsifying activity index of bean protein isolates were found to be 402.7–468.5 g oil/g protein and 15.6–22.0 m²/g, respectively. The isolates with significantly higher net surface charge and solubility were observed to show better emulsifying and foaming properties compared to the other isolates studied. No significant correlation was observed between the thermal characteristics and gelation properties of isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3abeans 3adenaturation 3aemulsions 3agelation 3ahydrophobicity 3aleucine 3alysine 3amethionine 3aoils 3apH 3aphenylalanine 3asolubility 3atemperature 0aPhaseolus vulgaris 0aPhaseolus coccineus 0aProtein functionality 0aAmino acid1 aCan Karaca, Asli0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Aug., v. 130 p.109609-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1096093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245014100174300001400315520111400329592002801443650002301471650002201494650003801516650001401554650002801568650001101596650001501607650001301622650001901635653003401654653003101688653002501719653001401744653003001758700002301788700001601811773012101827856009001948852000902038655001202047IND60532174120221121033600.0190214e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053217412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2016.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanwar, Rohini10aRevealing the potential of Didodecyldimethylammonium bromide as efficient scaffold for fabrication of nano liquid crystalline structures  ap. 61-68.  aTo exploit the potential of Didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (D12DAB) as a core lipidic constituent, an attempt was made to fabricate and optimize cationic nanostructured lipid carriers (cNLCs) using a cost-effective microemulsification methodology. Designed composition was optimized by studying the effect of different microemulsion components on D12DAB cNLCs characteristics. ​Spherical shaped D12DAB cNLCs were obtained with an average size of ∼160nm and zeta potential of +30.2mV. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) depicted the presence of thermotropic character, whereas polarized optical microscopy confirmed the mesophase like behavior of D12DAB based cNLCs. In addition, hemolysis analysis revealed that the toxicity was concentration dependent as LC50 was reached at a concentration of 50μg/mL of cNLCs. This class of cNLCs is expected to become a potent candidate for a broad spectrum of medicaments as carriers, targeting for pharmaceutical and medicinal purposes, due to the combination of a hard lipid with a soft lipid, where the liquid crystalline structure of the lipid co-exists.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3ahemolysis 3alethal concentration 50 3alipids 3amicroscopy 3atoxicity 3azeta potential 0aNanostructured lipid carriers 0aMicroemulsification method 0aD12DAB nanoparticles 0aHemolysis 0aLyotropic liquid crystals1 aKaura, Guraprīta,1 aMehta, S.K.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2016 Mar., v. 196 p.61-68dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2016.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01733naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245007400154300001800228520065900246592002800905650001200933650002200945650001100967650004400978650002101022700001701043700001701060700002001077700001701097700001901114700001901133773014701152856007501299852000901374655001201383IND60538807720221120154843.0160815e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053880772DNAL7 a10.1021/ja31103352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wen10aTunable and Switchable Dielectric Constant in an Amphidynamic Crystal  ap. 5230-5233.  aThe inclusion compound [(CH₃)₂NH₂]₂[KCo(CN)₆] exhibits a marked temperature-dependent dielectric constant and can be considered as a model of tunable and switchable dielectric materials. Crystal structure and solid-state NMR studies reveal a switchable property between low and high dielectric states around 245 K. This originates from an order–disorder phase transition of the system, changing the dynamics of the polar dimethylammonium (DMA) cation. Furthermore, the tuning of the dielectric constant at temperatures below the phase transition point is related to increasing angular pretransitional fluctuations of the dipole moment of DMA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3acrystal structure 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphase transition1 aYe, Heng-Yun1 aGraf, Robert1 aSpiess, Hans W.1 aYao, Ye-Feng1 aZhu, Run-Qiang1 aXiong, Ren-Gen0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 135, no. 14 p.5230-5233dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja31103353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245013300195300001800328500001900346500002000365520111400385592002801499596008501527650001601612650000901628650002101637650001801658650001301676650001701689650000901706650002101715700001701736700001401753700001301767700001701780700001501797700001801812700001601830773015301846856007401999852000902073655001202082IND60726225920221119132416.0210202e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072622592DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.107452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhipeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9019-549410aXanthine oxidase inhibitory peptides derived from tuna protein: virtual screening, inhibitory activity, and molecular mechanisms  ap. 1349-1354.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: There has been growing interest in the use of xanthine oxidase (XO) as a therapeutic agent to prevent gout and hyperuricemia. In the present study, XO inhibitory peptides were identified from tuna protein by virtual screening, and molecular docking was used to elicit the interaction mechanism between XO and peptides. RESULTS: A novel tetrapeptide, EEAK, exhibited high XO inhibitory activity with an IC₅₀ of 173.00 ± 0.06 μM. Molecular docking analysis revealed that EEAK bound with the pivotal residues of XO's active sites (i.e., Glu802, Arg880, Glu1261) through two conventional hydrogen bond interactions, two attractive charge interactions, and one salt bridge. EEAK could also bind with the residues Phe649, Leu648, Lys771, Ser876, Phe914, and Thr1010 of XO. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that conventional hydrogen bond interactions and electrostatic interactions play an important role in XO inhibition. The novel XO inhibitory peptide EEAK from tuna protein could be used as potential candidate for controlling gout and hyperuricemia. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a20181036cBeijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health 3aagriculture 3agout 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahyperuricemia 3apeptides 3atherapeutics 3atuna 3axanthine oxidase1 aKan, Ruotong1 aWu, Sijia1 aGuo, Hui1 aZhao, Wenzhu1 aDing, Long1 aZheng, Fuping1 aLiu, Jingbo0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 101, no. 4 p.1349-1354dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.107453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01663naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001500161245006800176300001400244500000900258520068600267592002800953650001000981650001800991650003101009650003701040650001601077650001701093773014601110856009601256852000901352655001201361IND60668645320221118154208.0191125e197701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066864532DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1977.03615995004100010010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChow, T.L.10aFritted Glass Bead Materials as Tensiometers and Tension Plates  ap. 19-22.  aepub  aA maximum temperature of 655°C which was reached in six steps with approximately 100°C/step/hour for 90 min was used to frit glass beads.

From the data collected it was possible to conclude that most diners classify the unit with a regular quality standard.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abusiness management 3acafeterias 3aconsumer satisfaction 3anutrition 3aquestionnaires 3arestaurants 0acomensais 0asatisfação 0apesquisa de satisfação 0aunidade de alimentação e nutrição1 aSilva, karen Layane da1 aBaratto, Indiomara0 tRevista brasileira de obesidade, nutrição e emagrecimento.g2018 Feb., v. 11, no. 68 p.661-666dInstituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Ensino em Fisiologia do ExercíciowJournal:27930x1981-99197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245012000160300001600280520198100296592002802277650002602305650000902331650001902340650001502359650001702374650001202391650002202403653002202425653001602447653002602463653001602489700002102505700002002526700002002546700002002566773013502586856007602721852000902797655001202806IND60681679720221119172320.0200117e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068167972DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2018.24042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKochiieru, Y.14aThe influence of milling and sifting processes on deoxynivalenol distribution in whole-wheat flour and its products  ap. 133-140.  aMilling and sifting of grain are important processes that affect mycotoxin distribution in the chain of grain products. The level of deoxynivalenol (DON) in white flour cannot be reduced by sifting because it is concentrated within a specific white flour fraction. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of milling and sifting processes on the reduction of DON contamination in whole-wheat flour and in the chain of spring wheat products (grain – bran – white flour – white flour fractions) from artificially and naturally (2016) and naturally (2017) infected grain samples. The current study showed that the distribution of DON in the grain products (whole-wheat flour – bran – white flour) depends on the weather conditions of the season and grain contamination level. This was particularly evident in the naturally contaminated grain in 2017. The highest DON concentrations were determined in bran. Higher DON concentrations in the bran from the naturally infected grain indicate the protective function of the grain hull, which provides partial protection for grain embryo against higher contamination. With a delay in harvesting, which resulted in increased DON concentrations, bran remained the most contaminated product; however, this was not true for the products from artificially infected grain. The DON level in bran was not significantly different at P<0.05 from that in whole-wheat flour from artificially infected grain, it indicates that after inoculation, bran had biochemical compounds capable of significantly diminishing trichothecene production. It was investigated that DON levels were concentrated in white flour fractions 160 and 112 μm from naturally infected grains and in white flour fraction (residues) from artificially and naturally infected grains harvested later. The results obtained in this study could be further used for developing novel strategies aimed at limiting mycotoxin contamination in food and feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3abran 3adeoxynivalenol 3aharvesting 3aspring wheat 3aweather 3awhole wheat flour 0awhole-wheat flour 0awhite flour 0awhite flour fractions 0afood safety1 aMankeviciene, A.1 aJanaviciene, S.1 aJonaviciene, A.1 aCeseviciene, J.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 12, no. 2 p.133-140dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2018.24043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014700169300001600316520117200332592002801504650002001532650001901552650001501571650001801586650001301604650001801617650002001635650001601655650001201671650001701683650001401700650001601714650002501730650001901755650001401774650001801788650001301806700002001819700002001839700002001859773009101879856008101970852000902051655001202060IND60572437520221120050714.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057243752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-016-1186-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Neal, Lindsey10aLuethyella okanaganae gen. nov., sp. nov., a Novel Genus and Species of the Family Microbacteriaceae Isolated from the Insect Okanagana rimosa  ap. 419-424.  aThe entomopathogen “Corynebacterium okanaganae” was described by Lüthy in 1974 but the name was never validly published. Phylogenetic analysis employing 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrate that “Corynebacterium okanaganae” is not a member of the genus Corynebacterium but related to members of the Microbacteriaceae being most closely related to, but distinct from, members of the genera Rathayibacter, Mycetocola and Curtobacterium. The bacterium is an aerobic, Gram-positive staining, rod-shaped actinobacterium with the cell-wall peptidoglycan based on 2,4, diaminobutyric acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The predominant menaquinones are MK-10, MK-11 and MK-12, and the principle polar lipids are phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty acids consist of anteiso-C₁₅:₀ and anteiso-C₁₇:₀. Therefore, based upon the phylogenetic, biochemical, and chemotaxonomic information, the organism merits recognition as a novel species and genus in the family Microbacteriaceae, for which the name Luethyella okanaganae gen. nov. sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LBG B4405ᵀ = CCUG 43304ᵀ = NCIMB 702272ᵀ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium 3aCurtobacterium 3aMycetocola 3aRathayibacter 3abacteria 3achemotaxonomy 3aentomopathogens 3afatty acids 3ainsects 3amenaquinones 3anew genus 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptidoglycans 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3astaining1 aSchumann, Peter1 aFalsen, Enevold1 aLawson, Paul A.0 tCurrent microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.419-424dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-016-1186-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014900168300001800317520098400335592002801319650001701347650002201364650001601386650001701402650001401419650000901433700001901442700001901461700002001480700001801500700001701518700001701535700001501552700002101567700002301588700002101611700001601632700002701648700002101675700001801696700002001714773011801734856008201852990002301934852000901957655001201966IND60091130120221119005712.0141103e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009113012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, Cynthia10aStructural modifications of a 3-methoxy-2-aminopyridine compound to reduce potential for mutagenicity and time-dependent drug–drug interaction  ap. 7605-7609.  a(S)-1-((4-(3-(6-Amino-5-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-1-isopropyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl)amino)propan-2-ol, 1, was recently identified as a potent inhibitor of the oncogenic kinase bRAF. Compounds containing 3-methoxy-2-aminopyridine, as in 1, comprised a promising lead series because of their high ligand efficiency and excellent ADME profile. However, following metabolic oxidation, compounds in this series also demonstrated two significant safety risks: mutagenic potential and time-dependent drug–drug interaction (TDI). Metabolite identification studies revealed formation of a reactive metabolite. We hypothesized that minimizing or blocking the formation of such a metabolite would mitigate the safety liabilities. Our investigation demonstrated that structural modifications which either reduced the electron density of the 3-methoxy-2-aminopyridine ring or blocked the reactive site following metabolic oxidation were successful in reducing TDI and AMES mutagenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3adrug interactions 3ametabolites 3amutagenicity 3aoxidation 3arisk1 aPairish, Mason1 aKephart, Susan1 aBouzida, Djamal1 aCui, Jingrong1 aDeal, Judith1 aDong, Liming1 aGu, Danlin1 aLinton, Angelica1 aMcAlpine, Indrawan1 aYamazaki, Shinji1 aSmith, Evan1 aJohn-Baptiste, Annette1 aBagrodia, Shubha1 aKania, Robert1 aGuo, Chuangxing0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 22, no. 24 p.7605-7609dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.10.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009300162300001600255520131700271592002801588650001101616650001601627650002501643650001701668650001201685650002001697650002001717651001001737700001401747700001501761700001801776773010301794856008101897852000901978655001201987IND60119721620221123022847.0141227e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011972162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-008-9340-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dunhai10aCytochemical changes in the developmental process of Nostoc sphaeroides (cyanobacterium)  ap. 119-125.  aThere are several apparent developmental stages in the life cycle of Nostoc sphaeroides Kützing, an edible cyanobacterium found mainly in paddy fields in central China. The cytochemical changes in developmental stages such as hormogonia, aseriate stage, filamentous stage and colony in N. sphaeroides were examined using fluorescent staining and colorimetric methods. The staining of acidic and sulfated polysaccharides increased with development when hormogonia were used as the starting point. Acidic polysaccharides (AP) were most abundant at the aseriate stage and then decreased, while the sulfated polysaccharides (SP) were highest at the colony stage. Quantitatively, along the developmental process from hormogonia to colony, total carbohydrates first increased, then became stable, and then reached their highest level at the colony stage, while reducing sugars were highest at the hormogonia stage and then decreased sharply once development began. SP were not detectable in the hot water soluble polysaccharides (HWSP), and hormogonia had the lowest content of AP, while old colonies had the highest. The AP content of the aseriate stage, filamentous stage and young colony stage were very similar. The evolutionary relationships reflected in the developmental stages of N. sphaeroides are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc 3acolorimetry 3adevelopmental stages 3afluorescence 3apaddies 3apolysaccharides 3areducing sugars 3aChina1 aXing, Wei1 aLi, Genbao1 aLiu, Yongding0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2009 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.119-125dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-008-9340-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03908naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245007500211300001100286506007600297520202900373592002802402506003702430650002002467650001302487650001102500650001902511650002802530650002202558650001302580650002002593650002402613650001002637650001002647650001002657650001002667650001102677650001402688650002602702650001302728650001202741650001402753650001802767650001702785650001002802650001302812650001002825650001302835651001102848700002902859700002402888700003102912700002502943700002902968700003402997700003003031773009503061856008103156852000903237655001203246IND60548517520221207143615.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054851752DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-016-0638-32doi7 aPMC47176302pmcid7 a267857442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Salas, Dora10aPrevalence of Cryptosporidium in small ruminants from Veracruz, Mexico  ap. 14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cryptosporidiosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium spp. that can affect domestic animal and human populations. In newborn ruminants, cryptosporidiosis is characterized by outbreaks of diarrhea, which can result in high morbidity and economic impact. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in small ruminants from the Perote municipality in Veracruz State, Mexico. One hundred and sixty small ruminants (80 sheep and 80 goats) from eight farms located in four towns of the Perote municipality were examined following a cross-sectional study design. Stool samples were analyzed by a modification of the Faust centrifugation method, and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts was examined using a modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen staining procedure. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association of Cryptosporidium infection and the general characteristics of the animals studied. RESULTS: Overall, 112 (70 %, 95 % CI: 62.3–76.9) of the 160 small ruminants sampled were infected with Cryptosporidium spp. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infection in goats was 72.5 % (95 % CI: 61.4–81.9) and in sheep 67.5 % (95 % CI: 56.1–77.6). Small ruminants aged 1 month old had the highest (88.2 %; 95 % CI: 63.6–98.5) prevalence of infection. Prevalence varied from 60 % to 85 % among herds. Animal species, age, sex, breed, farm, town or cohabitation with cattle did not influence the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of infection with Cryptosporidium spp. was observed in small ruminants from the Perote municipality in Veracruz, Mexico. Infection was widely distributed among sheep and goats regardless of their age, breed or farm location. Further research is required to identify risk factors for, and to assess the veterinary public health significance of Cryptosporidium infection among sheep and goats in the Mexican state of Veracruz.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCryptosporidium 3aProtozoa 3acattle 3acentrifugation 3across-sectional studies 3acryptosporidiosis 3adiarrhea 3aeconomic impact 3aexperimental design 3afarms 3afeces 3agoats 3aherds 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3amultivariate analysis 3aneonates 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3apublic health 3arisk factors 3asheep 3astaining 3atowns 3azoonoses 3aMexico1 aAlvarado-Esquivel, Cosme1 aCruz-Romero, Anabel1 aAguilar-Domínguez, Mariel1 aIbarra-Priego, Nelly1 aMerino-Charrez, José O.1 aPérez de León, Adalberto A.1 aHernández-Tinoco, Jesús0 tBMC veterinary research.g2016 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.14-14dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0638-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006900168300001800237520098000255592002801235596004601263650002301309650001401332650001701346650001801363650002201381650002601403650002001429650001301449650001801462650002101480650004401501650000901545650001701554653001901571653001501590653001801605653002201623653001201645653001901657700001601676700002001692700001801712700002601730773012501756856008501881852000901966655001201975IND60595389120221117225935.0180602e20180603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059538912DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2017.13312292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatt, U.

The interplay of PRMT3-RPS2 homologs in yeast is important for regulating the ribosomal subunit ratio and assembly. Prmt3–null mice display slower embryonic growth and development, although this phenotype is milder than in mouse RP gene knockouts. Defects in ribosome maturation are the hallmark of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). Sequencing of the PRMT3 gene in patients from the Czech DBA registry revealed a heterozygous mutation encoding the Tyr87Cys substitution. Although later analysis excluded this mutation as the cause of disease, we anticipated that this substitution might be important for PRMT3 function and decided to study it in detail. Tyr87 resides in a highly conserved substrate binding domain and has been predicted to be phosphorylated. To address the impact of putative Tyr87 phosphorylation on PRMT3 properties, we constructed two additional PRMT3 variants, Tyr87Phe and Tyr87Glu PRMT3, mimicking non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Tyr87, respectively. The Tyr87Cys and Tyr87Glu-PRMT3 variants had markedly decreased affinity to RPS2 and, consequently, reduced enzymatic activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. The activity of the Tyr87Phe-PRMT3 mutant remained unaffected. No evidence of Tyr87 phosphorylation was found using mass spectrometric analysis of purified PRMT3, although phosphorylation of serines 25 and 27 was observed. In conclusion, Tyr87 is important for the interaction between PRMT3 and RPS2 and for its full enzymatic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3aarginine 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amethyltransferases 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3aribosomes 3atyrosine 3ayeasts1 aPetrak, Jiri1 aHalada, Petr1 aPospíšilová, Dagmar,1 aCmejla, Radek0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Feb., v. 1814, no. 2 p.277-282dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245013200207300001200339506007600351520210400427592002802531506003702559650003602596650002002632650002602652650001102678650000902689650001402698650002102712650002202733650001602755650002902771650001402800650001302814650000902827651001202836700002102848700001802869700002502887700002902912700002202941773009702963856008103060852000903141655001203150IND60548517720221207143612.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054851772DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-016-0756-y2doi7 aPMC49282972pmcid7 a273575022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamborg, Peter10aHigh genotypic diversity among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from canine infections in Denmark  ap. 131.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) has emerged globally in companion animals in the last decade. In Europe, the multidrug-resistant sequence type (ST)71 is widespread, but recently other clones have appeared. The objective of this study was to examine genotypic diversity and antimicrobial resistance of clinical MRSP isolates obtained from dogs, including dogs sampled on multiple occasions, in Denmark over a six-year period. For that purpose a total of 46 clinical MRSP isolates obtained from 36 dogs between 2009 and 2014 were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus-sequence typing (MLST) and SCCmec typing. RESULTS: Twenty-three sequence types were identified with ST71, mostly associated with SCCmec II-III, as the most common occurring in 13 dogs. Among the remaining 33 isolates, 19 belonged to clonal complex (CC)258 comprising ST258-SCCmec IV and its single- and double-locus variants. These were susceptible to 4–7 of the 22 antibiotics tested, whereas CC71 isolates were susceptible to only 2–5 antibiotics. Clone-specific differences were especially pronounced for fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides with most CC71 isolates being resistant and almost all CC258 isolates being susceptible. Sixteen of the 19 CC258 isolates had oxacillin MICs of 0.5 g/L, whereas MICs for CC71 isolates were consistently above 4 g/L. Four of five dogs representing multiple isolates had distinct STs on different sampling events. CONCLUSIONS: The overall genotypic diversity of MRSP is high in Denmark indicating multiple acquisitions of SCCmec into distinct clones, and mutational evolution, which appears to be particularly rapid for certain ancestral clones such as ST258. ST71-SCCmec II-III is the most common MRSP lineage and is typically multidrug-resistant. CC258-SCCmec IV isolates, which emerged in Denmark since 2012, display susceptibility to a wider range of antimicrobials. The isolation of distinct STs in individual dogs over time suggests repeated exposure or short-term genetic evolution of MRSP clones within patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus pseudintermedius 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibiotic resistance 3aclones 3adogs 3aevolution 3afluoroquinolones 3agenetic variation 3amethicillin 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoxacillin 3apatients 3apets 3aDenmark1 aMoodley, Arshnee1 aAalbæk, Bent1 aVentrella, Gianpiero1 ados Santos, Teresa Pires1 aGuardabassi, Luca0 tBMC veterinary research.g2016 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.131-131dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0756-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002900169245008500198300001400283520164600297592002801943653002301971653001601994653002002010653001902030653001902049653001902068700002302087773010102110856011702211852000902328655001202337IND60127027820221117190814.0151110e200001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012702782DNAL7 a10.1554/0014-3820(2000)054[0030:ESSASI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoláán-Alvarez, Emilio10aEstimating sexual selection and sexual isolation effects from mating frequencies  ap. 30-36.  aSexual selection (defined as the change in genotypic or phenotypic frequencies of mated versus total population frequencies) and sexual isolation (defined as the deviation from random mating in mated individuals) show different evolutionary consequences and partially confounded causes. Traditionally, the cross-product estimator has been used to quantify sexual selection, whereas a variety of indexes, such as Yule V, Yule Q, YA, joint I, and others have been used to quantify sexual isolation. Because the two types of estimators use different scales, the effects of both processes cannot be monitored simultaneously. We describe three new related statistics that quantify both sexual selection (PSS) and sexual isolation (PSI) effects for every mating pair combination in polymorphic traits, as well as measure their combined effects (PTI == PSI ×× PSS). The new statistics have the advantage of providing information on every mating pair combination, quantifying the effects of sexual selection and isolation in the same units, and detecting asymmetry in sexual isolation. The ability of the new statistics to ascertain the biological causes of sexual selection and sexual isolation are investigated under different models involving distinct marginal frequencies, mate propensity, and mate choice coefficients. We also studied the use of classical isolation indexes applied on PSI coefficients, instead of on raw data. The use of the classical indexes applied to PSI coefficients considerably reduces the statistical bias of the estimates, revealing the good estimation properties of the new statistics.Corresponding Editor: E.

The effectiveness of the downstream FIT policy has attracted the attention of academia and government. Using the quarterly data of listed solar PV companies between 2009 and 2015, this paper provides an empirical analysis regarding the effects of the downstream FIT policy. We find that (1) the FIT policy has significantly enhanced the inventory turnover of listed PV firms and improved their profitability; (2) the FIT policy has significant effects on the inventory turnover of midstream companies and mixed industry-chain companies mainly engaged in downstream operations; (3) FIT policy is more favorable towards increasing the inventory turnover of private enterprises. Our results indicate that the FIT policy can have substantial effects on the sustainable development of China's solar photovoltaic industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aindustry 3ainventories 3apolicy analysis 3apower generation 3aprivate enterprises 3aprofitability 3asustainable development 3atariffs 3aChina 0aQ20 0aL50 0aSolar PV industry 0aFeed-In Tariff policy 0aPolicy effect1 aZheng, Shilin1 aZhang, Yanhua1 aZhang, Kai0 tEnergy Policy.g2016 Aug., v. 95 p.479-488dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008500169300001800254520123100272592002801503596011001531650001301641650001701654650001201671650002501683650001701708650001701725650001401742650002101756650001101777650002101788650002101809650002201830650001801852650001901870650001401889650004401903650001301947650001401960650001801974653002001992653003402012653002502046653002302071653002402094653003002118700002602148700002102174700002402195773012502219856008502344852000902429655001202438IND60595389320221117225959.0180602e20180603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059538932DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2017.13339882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutlu, Kiymet10aChemical constituents and biological activities of Dianthus elegans var. elegans  ap. 1245-1253.  aChemical investigation of the aerial parts of Dianthus elegans var. elegans afforded two previously undescribed saponins, named dianosides M-N (1–2), together with four oleanane-type triterpenoid glycosides (3–6). Their structures were elucidated as 3-O-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-16α-hydroxyolean-12-ene-23α, 28β-dioic acid (1) and 3-O-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1 → 3)-β-D-glucopyranosyl 16α-hydroxyolean-12-ene-23α-oic acid, 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 6)-β-D-glycosyl ester (2) by chemical and extensive spectroscopic methods including IR, 1D, 2D NMR and HRESIMS. Both of the saponins were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against HEK-293, A-549 and HeLa human cancer cells using the MTT method. All compounds showed no substantial cytotoxic activity against tested cell lines. However, dianosides M-N and the n-butanol fraction exhibited considerable haemolysis in human erythrocyte cells. The immunomodulatory properties of dianosides M-N were also evaluated in activated whole blood cells by PMA plus ionomycin. Dianosides M-N increased IL-1β concentration significantly whereas the n-butanol fraction slightly augmented IL-1β secretion. All compounds did not change IL-2 and IFN-γ levels considerably.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012 FEN 042cResearch Grant Office of Ege University Izmir-Turkeydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003010 3aDianthus 3aaerial parts 3abutanol 3achemical composition 3acytotoxicity 3aerythrocytes 3ahemolysis 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimmunomodulators 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-2 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asaponins 3asecretion 3atriterpenoids 0aCaryophyllaceae 0aDianthus elegans var. elegans 0atriterpenoid saponin 0acytotoxic activity 0ahaemolytic activity 0aimmunomodulatory activity1 aSarikahya, Nazli Boke1 aNalbantsoy, Ayse1 aKirmizigul, Suheyla0 tNatural product research.g2018 June 3, v. 32, no. 11 p.1245-1253dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2017.13339883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008700171300001600258520096400274592002801238650001201266650001701278650001101295650001101306650002401317650001201341650002601353650002401379650001701403650001901420653001701439653001701456653000901473653002001482700002201502700001901524773009801543856008601641852000901727655001201736IND60604460820221118031936.0180717e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060446082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJokinen, Raine13aAn MILP model for optimization of a small-scale LNG supply chain along a coastline  ap. 423-431.  aThe world energy demand is continuously increasing and natural gas is one of the strongest candidates to cover the growth. However, natural gas is unavailable in many energy intensive areas and the best way to introduce natural gas to new, scattered, areas is by transporting it as liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG can be shipped from a large LNG import terminal to consumers through a network of smaller satellite terminals with a combination of sea- and land-based transports. Building up a small-scale supply chain network is expensive and capital intensive. This paper presents a mathematical model to aid in the supply chain design decisions by minimizing the total costs associated with fuel procurement. The use of the model is illustrated by a case study, where the optimal supply chain of LNG for covering certain parts of the energy requirements of a country is designed under different cost structures for LNG and for its land-based transportation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3aimports 3aliquefied natural gas 3amathematical models 3asupply chain 3atransportation 0aSupply chain 0aOptimization 0aMILP 0aSmall-scale LNG1 aPettersson, Frank1 aSaxén, Henrik0 tApplied energy.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 138 p.423-431dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010700165300001600272520155500288592002801843650001601871650001801887650001501905650002201920650001401942650002801956650001901984650001502003650001602018650001402034650001902048650001702067650001202084650001202096700002302108700001902131700002102150773010302171856008102274852000902355655001202364IND60119722020221123033641.0141227e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011972202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-008-9344-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenis, Claire13aAn evaluation of methods for quantifying the enzymatic degradation of red seaweed Grateloupia turuturu  ap. 153-159.  aFor better exploitation of the red seaweed Grateloupia, enzymatic digestion of the thallus may be a way to increase access to metabolites of industrial interest. With this aim, we have tried to find a method to quantify the efficiency of enzymatic digestion. Vegetative algal material was treated with polysaccharidases (Onozuka R-10 cellulase, agarase, and Ultraflo L mixture). The proportion of degraded surface area was determined by microscopic measurement of the residue surface using imaging software and compared with the analysis of carbohydrates and R-phycoerythrin released in the incubation solution. Both the reducing carbohydrate concentration and percentage of degraded surface area appeared the most reliable methods to study enzymatic efficiency. The amount of solubilized total carbohydrates, and particularly that of R-phycoerythrin, showed non-specific variations, so no conclusions could be drawn. The application of this procedure to the screening of the efficient digestion of Grateloupia material demonstrated that cell walls were only partially digested by polysaccharidase enzymes alone. The Ultraflo L mixture and Onozuka R-10 cellulase produced a greater degradation of Grateloupia tissues and a higher release of reducing carbohydrates, whereas agarase did not display any specific action. Thus, the proposed procedure based on the quantification of residue surface area seems to be an accurate method to analyze enzymatic digestion. Other tests using different concentrations and combinations of enzymes are now required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrateloupia 3acarbohydrates 3acell walls 3acomputer software 3adigestion 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aimage analysis 3amacroalgae 3ametabolites 3ascreening 3asolubilization 3asurface area 3athallus 3atissues1 aLe Jeune, Hélène1 aGaudin, Pierre1 aFleurence, Joël0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2009 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.153-159dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-008-9344-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245006500170300001400235520100000249592002801249650002201277650001201299650002801311650001401339650001701353650002101370650002101391650002001412650001701432650001601449650002401465650001301489650001901502650001401521650002001535650002201555650001401577650001301591653002201604653001001626653002301636653003001659700002301689700002001712773010401732856007801836852000901914655001201923IND60573143020221116143439.0180620e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057314302DNAL7 a10.1515/hepo-2017-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaniszewska, Justyna10aAntitumor and immunomodulatory activity of Inonotus obliquus  ap. 48-58.  aThe article presents the antitumor and immunomodulatory activity of compounds and extracts from Inonotus obliquus. Polysaccharides isolated from sclerotium have a direct antitumor effect due to protein synthesis inhibition in tumor cells. Polysaccharides derived from the mycelium function by activating the immune system. Due to the limited toxicity of these substances, both extracts as well as isolated and purified chemicals may be a good alternative to current chemotherapy and play a role in cancer prevention. In vitro experiments have shown the inhibition of inflammation with the influence of action of I. obliquus extracts; however, in vivo experiments on animals implanted with tumor cells of different types have shown the activation of the host immune system. This led to decrease in tumor mass and prolonged survival. The immunomodulatory mechanism of action is complex and it seems that stimulation of macrophages and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells is of great importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInonotus obliquus 3aanimals 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3adrug therapy 3aimmunomodulators 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amechanism of action 3amycelium 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein synthesis 3asclerotia 3atoxicity 0aInonotus obliquus 0achaga 0aantitumor activity 0aimmunomodulatory activity1 aSzymański, Marcin1 aIgnatowicz, Ewa0 tHerba Polonica.g2017 June 1, v. 63, no. 2 p.48-58dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:17307x0018-05997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hepo-2017-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016500172300001600337520172000353592002802073650001602101650001602117650001402133650001602147650002002163650000902183650003502192650001002227650001602237650002602253650001302279650001502292700001602307700002602323700002202349700002002371700001702391773011902408856008402527852000902611655001202620IND60090109220221118001802.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009010922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Richard W.10aProteomic changes in the gills of wild-type and transgenic radiosensitive medaka following exposure to direct irradiation and to X-ray induced bystander signals  ap. 290-298.  aThe directly irradiated and bystander gill proteome was examined in wild-type and radiosensitive transgenic medaka. Direct irradiation increased the expression of annexin max 3, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in both strains and reduced annexin A4 in wild-type medaka only. In bystander fish, same strain pairings increased CK and LDH in both strains and increased annexin max 3 and annexin A4 in radiosensitive medaka. Mixed strain pairings revealed that, in bystander fish, annexin max 3 was only increased by a bystander signal originating from a radiosensitive source, annexin A4 was increased in radiosensitive bystanders irrespective of the signal source, and CK and LDH were increased if either the bystander signal origin or the recipient bystander fish was radiosensitive. Warm-temperature acclimation related 65-kDa protein (Wap65) was increased in all bystander medaka, whether they were paired with the same or opposite strain and chromosome 5 SR-like CTD-associated factor (SR=serine–argenine-rich, CTD=C-terminal domain) (SCAF) protein was increased in radiosensitive bystander medaka only. Annexin A4, CK and LDH are associated with apoptosis and mirror the increase in apoptotic bodies previously reported in irradiated and bystander medaka, whereas increased Wap65 and LDH suggest a protective response. Thus the proteomic changes reported here could indicate both immediate protection and longer term adaptation to subsequent radiation exposure. In addition this investigation provides further evidence to show that the bystander signal can override the intrinsic genetically determined response and also that signal production and response can be modulated independently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aacclimation 3aapoptosis 3achromosomes 3acreatine kinase 3afish 3agenetically modified organisms 3agills 3airradiation 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aproteome 3aproteomics1 aWang, Jiaxi1 aMothersill, Carmel E.1 aHinton, Thomas G.1 aAizawa, Kouichi1 aSeymour, C.,0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Feb., v. 1814, no. 2 p.290-298dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245007800159300001600237520087300253592002801126650001101154650001301165650002001178650001301198650001701211650001401228650001101242653001301253653003401266653001601300653001401316653001801330653001301348653004201361653002701403653001901430653003901449700002301488700002701511700002301538700002001561700002101581773008801602856007601690852000901766655001201775IND60573143120221116143421.0170721e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057314312DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2016-01422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrovko, Olga10aMorphological features of aerogels and carbogels based on lignosulfonates  ap. 583-590.  aThe synthesis of new carbogels based on sodium lignosulfonates alone (LSNa) and interpolyelectrolyte complexes (IPEC) made by a combination of lignosulfonate and chitosan (CT) (i.e. IPEC-LSNa-CT) was investigated. The IPECs were converted into carbogels by slow and rapid pyrolysis (Pyₛₗₒw and Pyᵣₐₚᵢd) and the influence of Py conditions on the formation of carbogels was established. It is demonstrated that the obtained carbogels have a high microporous structure with elevated total porosity values. The porosity of synthesised carbogels is on the nanoscale level, while about 80% of the internal surfaces obtained by both Pyₛₗₒw and Pyfₐₛₜ is in the range of 0.7–1.0 nm pore size. It was found that elements of the initial precursor structure (LSNa) are stored in the carbon aerogels, if obtained by the appropriate pyrolysis technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achitosan 3alignosulfonates 3aporosity 3aporous media 3apyrolysis 3asodium 0aaerogels 0aatomic force microscopy (AFM) 0abiopolymers 0acarbogels 0acarbonisation 0achitosan 0ainterpolyelectrolyte complexes (IPEC) 0alignosulfonates (LSNa) 0apore structure 0ascanning electron microscopy (SEM)1 aPalamarchuk, Irina1 aBogolitsyn, Konstantin1 aChukhchin, Dmitriy1 aIvakhnov, Artem1 aValchuk, Natalia0 tHolzforschung.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 71, no. 7-8 p.583-590dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2016-01423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014600163520130900309592002801618650001401646650001001660650001001670650001101680650002601691653002101717653001801738653002101756653001901777700001301796700002001809700001501829700001201844773010901856856008201965852000902047655001202056IND60766064620221121222621.0220404e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076606462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2022.1034272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Shuyun12aA study of vacuum mixing parameters for high-water-added dried noodles using color difference method and gluten network quantitative analysis  aIn this study, the chromatic aberration method was used to optimize the mixing parameters of high water-added dried noodles, and the effects of high water-added and vacuum mixing on eating quality of dried noodles were studied. Furthermore, the improvement mechanism was elaborated through a quantitative analysis of the gluten network structure in dough sheets. It was indicated that the optimal mixing operation for noodles with 38% water addition was mixed for 9min under −0.06 MPa, based on the color difference method. The reliability of the results was verified by the chewiness analysis of cooked noodles. Compared with low water addition, the eating quality of 38% water-added dried noodles was significantly better (P ˂ 0.05). Moreover, the eating quality of high water-added dried noodles was improved considerably at −0.06 MPa, while the chewiness was significantly increased by 19.6% (P ˂ 0.05). The average length and width of the gluten network were the lowest at −0.06 MPa, whereas the branching rate was the highest (P ˂ 0.05). Overall, the color difference method can be used to optimize mixing process parameters. High water-added and vacuum mixing enhanced the uniformity and compactness of the gluten network, significantly improving the eating quality of dried noodles.  aPublisher supplied data 3achewiness 3acolor 3adough 3agluten 3aquantitative analysis 0aHigh water-added 0aVacuum mixing 0aWater uniformity 0aGluten network1 aHe, Zhen1 aObadi, Mohammed1 aQi, Yajing1 aXu, Bin0 tJournal of cereal science.g2022 Mar., v. 104 p.103427-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2022.1034273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245006000206300001200266500001500278506007600293520172400369592002802093506003702121650002802158650001602186650001602202650002502218650001102243650003002254650002202284650001202306650002802318650001902346650001602365650001502381650002002396650001002416651001102426653002302437700001802460700001502478700001502493700002202508773009702530856008102627852000902708655001202717IND60548518020221207141611.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054851802DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-016-0758-92doi7 aPMC49282802pmcid7 a273575972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilicevic, V.10aEvidence of Aujeszky’s disease in wild boar in Serbia  ap. 134.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Aujeszky’s disease is a viral disease of suids caused by Suid Herpesvirus 1. The disease has worldwide distribution with significant economic impact. In Serbia, there is neither an Aujeszky’s disease eradication nor national vaccination programme of domestic pigs. Since clinical symptoms of Aujeszky’s disease are not specific, it is important to establish a link between clinical signs and presence of ADV active infection in wild boars. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of active infection within wild boar showing signs of ADV and also to examine relationship between isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar. Having in mind that virus has not been previously isolated from wild boars in Serbia, we report the first isolation of Suid Herpesvirus 1 from this species in Serbia. RESULTS: Tissue and serum samples from 40 wild boars from eastern Serbia were examined for evidence of Aujeszky’s disease (AD). Suid Herpesvirus 1 (SHV1), the cause of AD was isolated on PK15 cell line from three tissue samples, inducing cytopathic effect (CPE) with syncytia forming, and viral genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in eight samples. Genetic analysis of us4, us9 and ul49.5 partial sequences showed high homology between ADV isolates from wild boars and between isolates from wild boars and domestic animals. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected by virus neutralisation test (VNT) in sera from four out of eight PCR positive wild boars suggesting recent infection in those animals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of Aujeszky’s disease virus (ADV) in the wild boar population in Serbia although seroconversion has been detected previously.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3agiant cells 3ablood serum 3aneutralization tests 3agenome 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acytopathogenicity 3aviruses 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aseroconversion 3avaccination 3awild boars 3aeconomic impact 3aswine 3aSerbia 0aSuid herpesvirus 11 aRadojicic, S.1 aValcic, M.1 aIvovic, V.1 aRadosavljevic, V.0 tBMC veterinary research.g2016 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.134-134dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0758-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245010600200300001800306506007600324520055900400592002800959506003700987650001701024650001701041650002201058650001801080650003401098650002001132650002401152700002401176700002501200773010301225856007501328852000901403655001201412IND60531879420221207072701.0160726e20141028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053187942DNAL7 a10.1021/bi501109s2doi7 aPMC42514972pmcid7 a252991362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shengnan10aPhenylalanine Binding Is Linked to Dimerization of the Regulatory Domain of Phenylalanine Hydroxylase  ap. 6625-6627.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnalytical ultracentrifugation has been used to analyze the oligomeric structure of the isolated regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase. The protein exhibits a monomer–dimer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of ∼46 μM; this value is unaffected by the removal of the 24 N-terminal residues or by phosphorylation of Ser16. In contrast, phenylalanine binding (Kd = 8 μM) stabilizes the dimer. These results suggest that dimerization of the regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase is linked to allosteric activation of the enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adimerization 3adissociation 3aenzyme activation 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylalanine 4-monooxygenase 3aphosphorylation 3aultracentrifugation1 aRoberts, Kenneth

Previous research on the significance of food safety risk factors determined by literature review and expert advice served as the bases for the current study, to further refine, discriminate and select the most important criteria to be included in the model. This process considered the availability of data sources, the clarity and measurability of the selected factors, undertook the elimination of lower-rated risk factors and grouped those with similar focus of attention, enabling the selection of a final list of risk factors for the model. A method of assessment for the remaining factors was then proposed to allow the quantification of individual risk factors within the model. From the 155 risk factors initially identified, 17 consolidated factors were kept and will be considered for the development of the risk assessment model.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood inspection 3afood service 3amodels 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 0aRisk assessment model 0aRisk factors 0aFactor refinement 0aCFIA 0aCVS 0aDALYs 0aERA 0aGFSI 0aHACCP 0aPCP 0aQALYs 0aRF 0aSAC1 aRacicot, Manon1 aCormier, Mathieu1 aArsenault, Julie1 aFerrouillet, Cécile1 aLetellier, Ann1 aTiwari, Ashwani1 aMackay, Anna1 aGriffiths, Mansel1 aHolley, Rick1 aGill, Tom1 aCharlebois, Sylvain1 aQuessy, Sylvain0 tFood microbiology.g2018 Oct., v. 75 p.72-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2017.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01747naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245007300152300001600225500002000241520062200261592002800883650001700911650001000928650002200938650001400960650001300974650001000987650002300997650001601020650001401036700001401050700001301064700001301077700005301090773013501143856007401278852000901352655001201361IND60602091720221122064020.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060209172DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.128732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, N.10aGenetic characterization of a novel group of avastroviruses in geese  ap. 927-932.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs part of aetiological studies, we tested 28 samples collected from domestic geese showing enteritis and sporadic death.

Here, we present first time yearlong measurements of BC and carbon monoxide (CO) from an urban location of Guwahati located in the Brahmaputra River valley (BRV) in the northeast region of India from 1st July 2013 to 30th June 2014. Daily BC concentrations varied within the range of 2.86 to 11.56μgm−3 with an annual average of 7.17±1.89μgm−3, while, CO varied from 0.19 to 1.20ppm with a mean value of 0.51±0.19ppm during the study period. The concentrations of BC (8.37μgm−3) and CO (0.67ppm) were ~39% and ~55% higher during the dry months (October to March) than the wet months (April to September) suggesting that seasonal changes in meteorology and emission sources play an important role in controlling these species. The seasonal ΔBC/ΔCO ratios were highest (lowest) in the pre-monsoon (winter) 18.1±1.4μgm−3ppmv−1 (12.6±2.2μgm−3ppmv−1) which indicate the combustion of biofuel/biomass as well as direct emissions from fossil fuel during the pre-monsoon season. The annual BC emission was estimated to be 2.72Gg in and around Guwahati which is about 44% lower than the mega city ‘Delhi’ (4.86Gg). During the study period, the annual mean radiative forcing (RF) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) for clear skies of BC was +9.5Wm−2, however, the RF value at the surface (SFC) was −21.1Wm−2 which indicates the net warming and cooling effects, respectively. The highest RF at SFC was in the month of April (−30Wm−2) which is coincident with the highest BC mass level. The BC atmospheric radiative forcing (ARF) was +30.16 (annual mean) Wm−2 varying from +23.1 to +43.8Wm−2. The annual mean atmospheric heating rate (AHR) due to the BC aerosols was 0.86Kday−1 indicates the enhancement in radiation effect over the study region. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) captured the seasonal cycle of observed BC fairly well but underestimated the observed BC during the month of May–August. Model results show that BC at Guwahati is controlled mainly by anthropogenic emissions except during the pre-monsoon season when open biomass burning also makes a similar contribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon 3acarbon monoxide 3aclimate 3acombustion 3acooling 3aemissions 3afossil fuels 3aheat 3ameteorology 3amodels 3aradiative forcing 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3asolar radiation 3awinter 3aIndia 0aBlack carbon 0aCarbon monoxide 0aRadiative impact 0aWRF-chem1 aKumar, R.1 aTunved, P.1 aSingh, S.1 aPanicker, A.S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 562 p.504-516dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002300169245009100192300001800283520069300301592002800994650001501022650001301037650001201050650000801062650001201070650001201082650001401094650002001108650001101128650001301139650001101152650002301163650002501186650002201211650002201233700002801255700001901283700002201302773009901324856008601423852000901509655001201518IND4460741220221120131257.0141110e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446074122DNAL7 a216841562pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, Hector,10aAddition of ammonia and/or oxygen to an ionic liquid for delignification of miscanthus  ap. 7946-7952.  aAmmonia and/or oxygen were used to enhance the delignification of miscanthus dissolved in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate at 140°C.

In-depth sequencing and metabarcoding can reveal microbial diversity, and identify novel diversity. However, there has been little comparison of metabarcoding and morphological datasets derived from the same samples, and metabarcoding studies covering total eukaryotic phytoplankton diversity are rare. In this study, the variable V7 region of the 18S rDNA gene was employed to explore eukaryotic phytoplankton diversity in 11 Chinese freshwater environments, and further compared with the dataset obtained through morphological identification. RESULTS: Annotation by the evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) rather than alignment with the SILVA database improved the taxonomic resolution, with 346 of 524 phytoplankton operational taxonomic units (OTUs) being assigned to the genus or species level. The number of unassigned OTUs was greatly reduced from 259 to 178 OTUs by using the EPA in place of the SILVA database. Metabarcoding detected 3.5 times more OTUs than the number of morphospecies revealed by morphological identification; furthermore, the number of species and the Shannon–Wiener index inferred from the two methods were correlated. A total of 34 genera were identified via both methods, while 31 and 123 genera were detected solely in the morphological or metabarcoding dataset, respectively. CONCLUSION: The dbRDA plot showed distinct separation of the phytoplankton communities between lakes and reservoirs according to the metabarcoding dataset. The same pattern was obtained on the basis of 10 environmental variables in the PCO ordination plot, while the separation of the populations based on morphological data was poor. However, 30 morphospecies contributed 70% of the community difference between lakes and reservoirs in the morphological dataset, while 11 morphospecies were not found by metabarcoding. Considering the limitations of each of the two methods, their combination could substantially improve phytoplankton community assessment.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFA0605003cNational Key Research and Development program of China 3aDNA barcoding 3aOtus 3aalgorithms 3acryptic species 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental science 3afreshwater 3agenes 3alakes 3amorphospecies 3aphytoplankton 3apopulation 3asampling 3aseparation 3aEurope1 aLi, Xiaochuang1 aXi, Beidou1 aZhang, Hanxiao1 aMa, Chunzi1 aHe, Zhuoshi0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2020 Dec., v. 32, no. 1 p.37-37dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00321-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010500183300001600288500001500304520145700319592002801776650001601804650002301820650002001843650001501863650002701878650002201905650001901927650002001946650001601966650001001982650001201992650002502004650002002029650000802049650001202057650002002069650002402089650001102113650002502124650001102149650004702160650002002207650004602227650003202273653000902305700001702314700001302331700001502344700001902359700001602378700001702394773010702411856008102518852000902599655001202608IND4473645120221120131321.0141111e20120320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447364512DNAL7 a224644702pmid7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2012.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Zengxiang10aCurrent Advances in Epigenetic Modification and Alteration during Mammalian Ovarian Folliculogenesis  ap. 111-123.  a2019-12-06  aDuring the growth and development of mammalian ovarian follicles, the activation and deactivation of mass genes are under the synergistic control of diverse modifiers through genetic and epigenetic events. Many factors regulate gene activity and functions through epigenetic modification without altering the DNA sequence, and the common mechanisms may include but are not limited to: DNA methylation, histone modifications (e.g., acetylation, deacetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination), and RNA-associated silencing of gene expression by noncoding RNA. Over the past decade, substantial progress has been achieved in studies involving the epigenetic alterations during mammalian germ cell development. A number of candidate regulatory factors have been identified. This review focuses on the current available information of epigenetic alterations (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modification, noncoding-RNA-mediated regulation) during mammalian folliculogenesis and recounts when and how epigenetic patterns are differentially established, maintained, or altered in this process. Based on different types of epigenetic regulation, our review follows the temporal progression of events during ovarian folliculogenesis and describes the epigenetic changes and their contributions to germ cell–specific functions at each stage (i.e., primordial folliculogenesis (follicle formation), follicle maturation, and follicular atresia).  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3afollicular atresia 3aDNA methylation 3agerm cells 3agrowth and development 3aovarian follicles 3agene silencing 3agene expression 3aacetylation 3agenes 3amammals 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphorylation 3aRNA 2aAnimals 2aDNA Methylation 2aEpigenesis, Genetic 2aFemale 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMammalsxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Genetic 2aOvarian Folliclexembryologyxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Untranslatedxgenetics 0agerm1 aZhang, Jinbi1 aLi, Qifa1 aLi, Yinxia1 aShi, Fangxiong1 aXie, Zhuang1 aLiu, Honglin0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2012 Mar. 20, v. 39, no. 3 p.111-123dElsevier Ltdx1673-85277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2012.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002500170245013400195300001600329520164700345592002801992650001702020650001702037650001802054650002302072650001202095650001502107650002502122650001202147650001302159650001702172650000902189650004702198650002202245650001102267650001902278650002602297651001602323651001002339651001602349651001002365653001602375653003002391653001402421653001702435653002202452700001802474773010402492856008502596852000902681655001202690IND60113345520221119094459.0160903e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011334552DNAL7 a240360942pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulson Priebe, M.E.10aExtant forest plantations as a potential bridge between social needs and ecological management: A comparative case study analysis  ap. 608-614.  aIn the face of global deforestation, there is a challenge to balance the management of areas of high conservation concern and social interests. As a response to the growing human–environment interface and the use of forests for subsistence, plantations became a management tool to provide for wood harvesting during the 1970s. Some plantations were subsequently protected from harvest as conservation of all forests increased. Plantations that are now illegal to harvest can cause local animosities toward forest protection to increase and may also result in concentrated harvesting impacts on surrounding natural forests. In this article, we analyzed case studies of plantations from El Salvador and Niger. By utilizing distinctly disparate case studies, commonalities between the two can illuminate possible management lessons. In the comparison of El Salvador and Niger forest plantations we found the following commonalities: utilizing plantations for sustainable harvest has the to potential to reduce animosity between managers and stakeholders; plantations can serve as a risk-averse testing ground for novel managerial practices; and the sustainable harvest of plantations can reduce deforestation and impacts on biodiversity in natural remnant forests. We argue that extant plantations currently under illegal harvesting legislation could become the epicenters of social and ecological conservation through a management shift to sustainable harvesting. By focusing on these relics, managers could work with stakeholders to change unduly burdening restrictions and promote cooperation between conservationists and local populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3adeforestation 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3aharvesting 3alaws and regulations 3alogging 3amanagers 3astakeholders 3awood 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aForestryxmethods 2aHumans 2aPublic Opinion 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aEl Salvador 3aNiger 0aEl Salvador 0aNiger 0aPlantations 0aSocial-ecological systems 0aAnimosity 0aConservation 0aForest management1 aMüller, J.G.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 129 p.608-614dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.08.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013100161300001600292520117000308592002801478650002701506650001301533650001301546650001401559650001001573650001101583650001601594650001601610650001401626650002801640650002701668650002901695650001301724653001501737653002901752653001401781653003401795700002201829700002001851700001701871700002501888773011101913856007702024852000902101655001202110IND60516461920221117031715.0160325e20150506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051646192DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2015-01662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSo, Ernest C.10aCreating a customized intracellular niche: subversion of host cell signaling by Legionella type IV secretion system effectors1  ap. 617-635.  aThe Gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila infects a wide range of different protozoa in the environment and also human alveolar macrophages upon inhalation of contaminated aerosols. Inside its hosts, it creates a defined and unique compartment, termed the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), for survival and replication. To establish the LCV, L. pneumophila uses its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to translocate more than 300 effector proteins into the host cell. Although it has become apparent in the past years that these effectors subvert a multitude of cellular processes and allow Legionella to take control of host cell vesicle trafficking, transcription, and translation, the exact function of the vast majority of effectors still remains unknown. This is partly due to high functional redundancy among the effectors, which renders conventional genetic approaches to elucidate their role ineffective. Here, we review the current knowledge about Legionella T4SS effectors, highlight open questions, and discuss new methods that promise to facilitate the characterization of T4SS effector functions in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aProtozoa 3aaerosols 3abreathing 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amacrophages 3amethodology 3apathogens 3aphysiological transport 3atranslation (genetics) 3atype IV secretion system 3avacuoles 0aLegionella 0atype IV secretion system 0aeffectors 0aLegionella-containing vacuole1 aMattheis, Corinna1 aTate, Edward W.1 aFrankel, Gad1 aSchroeder, Gunnar N.0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2015 May 6, v. 61, no. 9 p.617-635dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2015-01663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245006500153300001600218500002000234520056400254592002800818650002700846650002000873650002200893650001500915651001100930700002100941700001800962700001800980700002000998700001901018700001201037700001701049700002401066700001201090700001501102700001701117700001501134700005201149773013501201856007401336852000901410655001201419IND60602092020221122233148.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060209202DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.128882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrba, Y.10aFirst isolation of West Nile virus in Zambia from mosquitoes  ap. 933-938.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMosquito surveillance studies to identify mosquito‐borne flaviviruses have identified West Nile Virus (WNV) for the first time in Zambia.

However, the response of plant communities to disturbance may be fundamentally altered as a consequence of invasive plants, climate change, or prior disturbances. The appropriateness of historical disturbance patterns under modern conditions and the interactions among disturbances are issues that ecologists must address to protect and restore native plant communities. We evaluated the response of Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis (Beetle & A. Young) S.L. Welsh plant communities to their historical disturbance regime compared to other disturbance regimes. The historical disturbance regime of these plant communities was periodic fires with minimal grazing by large herbivores. We also investigated the influence of prior disturbance (grazing) on the response of these communities to subsequent disturbance (burning). Treatments were: (1) ungrazed (livestock grazing excluded since 1936) and unburned, (2) grazed and unburned, (3) ungrazed and burned (burned in 1993), and (4) grazed and burned. The ungrazed–burned treatment emulated the historical disturbance regime. Vegetation cover, density, and biomass production were measured the 12th, 13th, and 14th year post‐burning. Prior to burning the presence of Bromus tectorum L., an exotic annual grass, was minimal (<0.5% cover), and vegetation characteristics were similar between grazed and ungrazed treatments. However, litter accumulation was almost twofold greater in ungrazed than in grazed treatments. Long‐term grazing exclusion followed by burning resulted in a substantial B. tectorum invasion, but burning the grazed areas did not produce an invasion. The ungrazed–burned treatment also had less perennial vegetation than other treatments. The accumulation of litter (fuel) in ungrazed treatments may have resulted in greater fire‐induced mortality of perennial vegetation in ungrazed compared to grazed treatments. Our results demonstrate that prior disturbances exert a strong influence on the response of plant communities to subsequent disturbances and suggest that low‐severity disturbances may be needed in some plant communities to increase their resilience to more severe disturbances. Modern deviations from historical conditions can alter ecosystem response to disturbances, thus restoring the historical disturbance regime may not be an appropriate strategy for all ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainvasive species 3aenvironmental impact 3aBromus tectorum 3aplant communities 3aplant litter 3agrazing 3aecosystem management 3awildfires 3avegetation cover 3aplant density 3aArtemisia tridentata 3aecological invasion 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aArtemisia 2aBromus 2aEcosystem 2aFires 2aPopulation Density 3aOregon 0aOregon 0acommunity ecology1 aSvejcar, T.

Most loci were genotyped on three different prickly sculpin populations and three closely related sympatric Cottus species allowing for future comparative studies between and within species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCottus 3afreshwater fish 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arivers 3aNorth America1 aAguilar, Andres0 tConservation genetics resources.g2013 Mar., v. 5, no. 1 p.279-282dSpringer-Verlagx1877-72527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-012-9787-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012900169300001600298520094200314592002801256650002401284650002201308650002101330650001201351650001101363650001601374650001301390650000901403650001001412650000901422650001701431650001301448650001501461650001301476650002101489650001301510650002301523650001201546650001001558651001901568653001301587653001601600653001401616653000901630653000901639700002101648700002201669773010201691856008701793852000901880655001201889IND60531550020221122063210.0170626e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053155002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEva, Janova10aRodent food quality and its relation to crops and other environmental and population parameters in an agricultural landscape  ap. 164-169.  aThe diet, its quality and quantity considerably influence population parameters of rodents. In this study, we used NIRS methods for estimation of nitrogen content in stomachs of rodent populations. The study was carried out in diverse arable landscape in South Moravia, Czech Republic. Rodents were sampled in cultural crops (alfalfa, barley, wheat, sunflower, maize and rape) as well as in fallow habitats (herbal set-aside and old orchard). Influence of habitat, date, year, individual parameters (body length, sex, breeding and age), and relative abundance on quality of consumed food was studied. Under conditions of higher population density, dominant species [wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and common vole (Microtus arvalis)] consumed food richer in nitrogen. Also the strong effect of crop and date (season) was found in both species. There was no significant effect of the other parameters studied on food quality (N-content).  aPublisher supplied data 3aApodemus sylvaticus 3aHelianthus annuus 3aMicrotus arvalis 3aalfalfa 3abarley 3abody length 3abreeding 3acorn 3acrops 3adiet 3afood quality 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aorchards 3apopulation density 3arodents 3awheat 3aCzech Republic 0aNitrogen 0aCommon vole 0aWood mice 0aCrop 0aNIRS1 aMarta, Heroldova1 aLadislav, Cepelka0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 562 p.164-169dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100003200170245011800202300001600320520134200336592002801678650002701706650001701733650001701750650002101767650002001788650002001808650002201828650001501850650002201865650002001887650001401907650001301921650001901934650001501953650001501968650002201983650001702005650001402022650001602036650003802052650001102090650001902101650003202120650002002152651001102172651001102183653002702194653002202221653003002243653002202273653001602295700002602311700002202337700002002359773010402379856008502483852000902568655001202577IND60113345620221119094159.0160903e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011334562DNAL7 a240360952pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.08.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyriazopoulos, Apostolos P.10aThreats to Mediterranean rangelands: A case study based on the views of citizens in the Viotia prefecture, Greece  ap. 615-620.  aRangelands in Greece constitute a very important natural resource as they occupy 40% of the total surface. Not only is their forage production essential for the development of extensive livestock farming, but also they play a key role in outdoor recreational activities, protection from erosion, provision of water supplies and biodiversity conservation. However, land use changes, inappropriate management and wildfires threaten their existence. The research was conducted among the citizens of Viotia prefecture, an area close to Athens, Greece, using personal interviews with a structured questionnaire in 2008. The aim was to record citizens' opinions regarding the threats to rangelands. The results suggest that the main threats as perceived by the respondents, are land use changes especially for urban development, and wildfires. The application of cluster analysis highlighted the differentiation among the respondents in ranking these threats. The more ecologically aware citizens recognised that mismanagement, abandonment and agriculture also threaten rangelands. These threats can have a considerable impact on the lives of the local people. Policy makers and managers should take the opinions of local citizens into consideration, and engage them in decision making so that sustainable management policies could be applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3acluster analysis 3adecision making 3afarming systems 3aforage production 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3alivestock 3amanagers 3aquestionnaires 3arangelands 3arecreation 3aurban development 3awater supply 3awildfires 2aAgriculture 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aHumans 2aPublic Opinion 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Assessment 3aGreece 0aGreece 0aSustainable management 0aRural development 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aLivestock farming 0aPerceptions1 aArabatzis, Garyfallos1 aAbraham, Eleni M.1 aParissi, Zoi M.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 129 p.615-620dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.08.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010800167520103800275592002801313650002301341650001801364650001401382650002001396650001401416650001901430650002101449650002301470650002201493650001201515650002201527653002101549653002301570653001901593653001901612653002101631653001801652653001801670700001701688700002001705700006001725700006101785773010001846856008701946852000902033655001202042IND60697856120221119213249.0201024e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069785612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Ying10aHeat treatment of β-lactoglobulin affects its digestion and translocation in the upper digestive tract  aHeat treatment is a commonly applied unit operation in the processing of β-lactoglobulin containing products. This does, however, influence its structure and thereby impacts its activity and digestibility. We describe how various heat-treatments of β-lactoglobulin change the digestibility using a modified version of the current consensus INFOGEST protocol. Additionally, protein was investigated for its translocation over the intestinal epithelial barrier, which would bring them in contact with immune cells. The extent of gastric digestibility was higher when the protein structure was more modified, while the influence of glycation with lactose was limited. Translocation studies of protein across Caco-2 cell monolayers showed a lower translocation rate of protein heated in solution compared to the others. Our study indicates that structural modifications after different heat-treatments of β-lactoglobulin increase in particular gastric digestibility and the translocation efficiency across intestinal epithelial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3aglycation 3aheat treatment 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestinal mucosa 3alactose 3aprotein structure 0aβ-Lactoglobulin 0aIn vitro digestion 0aHeat treatment 0aHydrophobicity 0aCaco-2 monolayer 0aTranslocation 0aImmune system1 aGovers, Coen1 aTomassen, Monic1 aHettinga, Kasper1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9017-44471 aWichers, Harry J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8030-70900 tFood chemistry.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 330 p.127184-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245018100171300001600352520157300368592002801941650001701969650001201986650001701998650001402015650001602029650002102045650001302066650001802079650000902097650001102106650001802117650001402135653001702149653001802166653001302184653001202197653001902209653001602228700001502244700001802259700001302277700001502290700001302305700001302318773010202331856008702433852000902520655001202529IND60531550120221122063229.0170626e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053155012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Wanjing,10aIn situ, high resolution ZrO-Chelex DGT for the investigation of iron-coupled inactivation of arsenic in sediments by macrozoobenthos bioturbation and hydrodynamic interactions  ap. 451-462.  aThe influence of chironomid larvae and hydrodynamics on the bioavailable arsenic (As) in sediments under different conditions was comprehensively investigated through water tank experiments spanning 132days. The high-resolution technique of revealing diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) with ZrO-Chelex resin was employed in this study; this was done to simultaneously obtain concentrations of labile As and Fe in the profile at millimeter resolution. Bioturbation by larvae may significantly decrease the bioavailable As and Fe concentrations under different hydrodynamic intensities during the first two months of larval burrowing; the greatest difference between the bioavailable As concentration with and without the addition of larvae was seen on the 56th day, with around 49%, 47%, 73% and 67% reduction of As in the profile under static water, 0.3ms−1, 0.5ms−1 and 1.0ms−1, respectively. However, these effects were diminished after the 56th day due to the eclosion of the chironomid larvae. The hydrodynamic conditions appeared to not have any significant effect on the labile concentration of As or Fe until after eclosion. The changing distributions of labile As and Fe were consistent with the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the profile under different conditions. Labile As showed the significantly correlation coefficients with labile Fe by a stepwise multiple linear regression under different experimental conditions in this study. We conclude that the decreases in bioavailable As are directly related to conversions between Fe2+ and Fe3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aarsenic 3abioturbation 3aburrowing 3acorrelation 3adissolved oxygen 3aeclosion 3ahydrodynamics 3airon 3alarvae 3alinear models 3asediments 0aBioturbation 0aHydrodynamics 0aSediment 0aArsenic 0aZrO-Chelex DGT 0aLake Hongze1 aWang, Chao1 aWang, Peifang1 aHou, Jun1 aWang, Teng1 aLiu, Cui1 aYuan, Ye0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 562 p.451-462dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005500092040001800147100002100165245006100186300001600247520176700263592002802030650002402058650001002082650001702092650002302109650001102132650001102143650002302154650001802177650001502195650001402210650001102224650002302235650001702258650001902275651001002294653002102304653001802325653002002343653002602363653001902389653002902408700002702437773011702464856011502581852000902696655001202705IND4402389120221122050432.0151126e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440238912DNAL7 a10.2111/1551-5028(2007)60[244:PPCRTS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsley, R.

However, effects of dormant season fires (i.e., winter fires) are inconsistent. Thus, there is increasing interest in use of growing season (summer) fires. Our objective was to evaluate effects of fire season and fire intensity on mortality and individual plant (i.e., ““motte””) structure (area per motte, cladodes per motte, motte height) of brownspine prickly pear (O. phaeacantha Engelm.). The study had 4 treatments: no fire, low-intensity winter fire, high-intensity winter fire, and summer fire. Three sizes of prickly pear mottes were evaluated: small (0––20 cladodes per motte), medium (21––100), and large (101––500). At 3 years postfire, prickly pear mortality in the summer fire treatment was 100%% in small mottes, 90%% in medium mottes, and 80%% in large mottes. Motte mortality increased in this treatment over time, especially in large mottes. Mortality from high-intensity winter fires was 29%% and 19%% in small and medium mottes, respectively, but no large mottes were killed. Motte mortality was < 10%% in low-intensity winter fire and no-fire treatments. Summer fires reduced all motte structural variables to 0 in small mottes and nearly 0 in other motte size classes. High-intensity winter fires reduced some structural variables of medium and large mottes, but had no long-term negative effects on area per motte or cladodes per motte in surviving small mottes. Low-intensity winter fires had no long-term negative effects on motte structure in any size class. Rapid growth of mottes, and especially small mottes, in the no-fire treatment suggested that resistance to winter fires can occur rapidly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpuntia phaeacantha 3aweeds 3aweed control 3aprescribed burning 3asummer 3awinter 3aseasonal variation 3aplant density 3arangelands 3amortality 3aheight 3aplant architecture 3aplant growth 3afire intensity 3aTexas 0abrush management 0afire behavior 0aprescribed fire 0arangeland restoration 0aseasonal fires 0awoody plant encroachment1 aCastellano, Michael J.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2007 May, v. 60, no. 3 p.244-252dSociety for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2F1551-5028%282007%2960%5B244%3APPCRTS%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245011800211520108900329592002801418650001801446650001301464650001501477650001901492650002601511650002101537650001501558650002001573650001301593650000901606650001901615650001601634650001201650650002201662650002901684653003801713653002201751653001901773653001101792700001801803700002501821700005801846773010001904856008702004852000902091655001202100IND60697856220221119213256.0200619e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069785622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStachniuk, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6384-199910aLC-QTOF-MS identification of rabbit-specific peptides for authenticating the species composition of meat products  aRabbit is a healthy meat, with low allergenicity and excellent nutritional properties. The global popularity of rabbit meat makes it a target for food fraud. We present a LC-QTOF-MS/MS approach for detecting and identifying rabbit-specific peptide-markers from thermally processed meat products to differentiate rabbit from other commonly-consumed animal species. We identified 49 heat-stable specific peptides. We selected the most stable markers for testing complex meat matrices by analysing pâtés-type products with a rabbit meat content ranging from 5% to 85%. Of the 49 heat-stable peptides detected in pure cooked rabbit meat, three were consistently detected in all investigated pâté samples i.e., SSVFVADPK, AFFGHYLYEVAR and PHSHPALTPEQK. Monitoring meat species other than rabbit in the examined pâtés using pork-, lamb- and chicken-specific peptides identified the presence of undeclared chicken in two samples. The results confirm that LC-QTOF-MS/MS is a suitable tool for multi-species detection in processed meat products, particularly for authentication purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3achickens 3afood fraud 3aheat stability 3aliquid chromatography 3ameat composition 3amonitoring 3anutritive value 3apeptides 3apork 3aprocessed meat 3arabbit meat 3arabbits 3aspecies diversity 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aHigh-resolution mass spectrometry 0aFood authenticity 0aPeptide marker 0aRabbit1 aSumara, Agata1 aMontowska, Magdalena1 aFornal, Emilia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0503-07060 tFood chemistry.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 329 p.127185-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012200168300001600290520158700306592002801893650001201921650001201933650002101945650001501966650001301981650000901994650002502003650002202028650001702050650002802067651001002095653002402105653002402129653001402153653001802167653001402185653004202199700001602241700001502257773014402272856008402416852000902500655001202509IND60123194620221120025740.0150325e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012319462DNAL7 a10.1080/13504509.2014.8863092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Suresh10aPrioritising development planning in the Indian semi-arid Deccan using sustainable livelihood security index approach  ap. 332-345.  aThis paper presents the status of sustainable livelihood security index (SLSI) of Karnataka, the most drought prone state in the Southern part of India. Computation of ecological security index, economic efficiency index and social equity index, and finally SLSI were carried out at the district level for the entire state, using empirical data. The selected indicators were first normalised, and then using estimated weights, indices were computed. The results indicate that the state has a very low SLSI with only 27.6% of total geographical area (TGA) and 21.7% of population being placed in the ‘sustainable’ and ‘highly sustainable’ categories (covering 10 districts) while only 34% of the TGA covering six districts falls in the ‘moderately sustainable’ category. The remaining area, confined mostly to the northern parts of the state, comprising 14 districts (51.8% of the state’s TGA) is categorised as ‘less sustainable’ and ‘very less sustainable’ exposing 44.4% (27.14 million) of state’s population to the perils of uncertain rainfall, high soil erosion rates, high social inequality and poor resource use efficiency. There is an urgent need to reorient development programmes and prioritise development investments in these vulnerable districts so that they are provided resources and opportunities to improve their ecological (more forest cover and less soil erosion), economic (higher agricultural productivity) and social (improved health and education facilities and rural infrastructure) status and achieve sustainable levels of livelihood.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3aforests 3ahealth education 3alivelihood 3aplanning 3arain 3arural infrastructure 3asocial inequality 3asoil erosion 3asustainable development 3aIndia 0aecological security 0aeconomic efficiency 0aKarnataka 0asocial equity 0asemi-arid 0asustainable livelihood security index1 aRaizada, A.1 aBiswas, H.0 tinternational journal of sustainable development and world ecology.g2014 July 4, v. 21, no. 4 p.332-345dTaylor & Francisx1745-26277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2014.8863093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010100167300001600268520111000284592002801394650001901422650002501441650002301466650001301489650002901502650001901531650001701550650001201567650003901579650001301618650003401631653001801665653001201683653003301695700002301728700001101751700001701762700003001779773010301809856008601912852000901998655001202007IND60585457920221123042917.0180830e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058545792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2017.10.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Yulong10aDispersal of single and mixed non-albicans Candida species biofilms by β-1,3-glucanase in vitro  ap. 342-347.  aβ-1,3-glucan plays a role in non-albicans Candida species biofilm formation and survival of biofilm Candida to stresses. In this study, we evaluated the antibiofilm activity of β-1,3-glucanase, which can degrade poly-β(1 → 3)-glucose of non-albicans Candida species biofilms, on single and mixed species biofilm of non-albicans Candida species, including Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida krusei. Biofilm by all tested species in microplate were dispersed more than 60%. β-1,3-glucanase also detached mixed species biofilm in microplate and on medical material surface. β-1,3-glucanase had no effect on Candida planktonic growth as well as adhesion. However, further biofilm formation was inhibited with β-1,3-glucanase added at 24 h after biofilm initiation. β-1,3-glucanase markedly enhanced the antifungal susceptibility of amphotericin B. The examination using confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscope confirmed the antibiofilm activity of β-1,3-glucanase. Our findings demonstrate that β-1,3-glucanase may be useful as an antibiofilm agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida krusei 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aCandida tropicalis 3aadhesion 3aantimicrobial properties 3abeta-glucanase 3abeta-glucans 3abiofilm 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aplankton 3ascanning electron microscopes 0aβ-1,3-glucan 0aBiofilm 0aNon-albicans Candida species1 aLeonhard, Matthias1 aMa, Su1 aMoser, Doris1 aSchneider-Stickler, Berit0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2017 Dec., v. 113 p.342-347dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.10.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245005800163300001600221520122400237592002801461650001701489650001001506650002401516650001301540650001601553650001701569650001301586650001801599650001301617650001801630650002301648650002501671700001901696773012801715856007901843852000901922655001201931IND60480679520221122234517.0160706e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048067952DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.33.2.2482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarriker, Margo10aPharmacists in Veterinary Education: Bridging the Gap  ap. 248-252.  aVeterinary patients stand to benefit greatly from the collaboration of pharmacy and veterinary medicine, and there are many ways pharmacy and veterinary medicine can work in concert. The best efforts to revise and remodel veterinary and pharmacy education to fit an evolving world of clinical practice are grounded in an understanding of each profession. Veterinary education should impart to its students and residents the skills necessary to critically evaluate drug therapy, select therapies based on facts from drug information sources, and operate a veterinary practice that abides by the legal, regulatory, and operational requirements necessary to maintain and dispense drugs. The academic training environment of each profession must include information on the other, in order to better prepare professionals for a realistic practice environment. When armed with an understanding of what pharmacists can provide their patients, veterinarians can demand these skills where appropriate. With the ultimate goal of producing an optimal learning environment, veterinary curricula should allow both pharmacy and veterinary medicine to work together to build a path to quality patient care and educational superiority.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ainformation sources 3alearning 3aoccupations 3apatient care 3apatients 3aprofessionals 3astudents 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary clinics 3aveterinary education1 aWiebe, Valerie0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 33, no. 2 p.248-252dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.33.2.2483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01531naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245008700166300001400253500002400267520061400291650001800905650001400923650001000937650001000947651002100957700001800978700001900996773011901015852000901134856008601143655001201229IND4450070420221119210907.0110304s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445007042DNAL7 a10.18474/0749-8004-46.1.462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoshina, Hideto14aThe Korean species of the genus Baeocera (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Scaphidiinae)  ap. 46-51.  aIncludes references  aTwo new rove beetle species of the genus Baeocera Erichson were described from Korea by examining specimens of the subfamily Scaphidiinae.

The ternary-emission fluorescence imprinted sensor showed wider linear range within concentration of 10 pM–0.5 nM and 0.5 nM–4.5 nM, with rapid response time of 3 min and the lower detection limit of 3.8 pM toward chloramphenicol. Meanwhile, NH₂-UiO-66 improved the fluorescence sensitivity and response speed, the near-infrared CdTe enhanced the anti-interference ability of the imprinted sensor. Compared with the traditional single-emission and dual-emission fluorescence imprinted sensors, the ternary-emission imprinted sensor provided richer color changes from yellowish green to apricot to orange-salmon to amaranth to purple to final blue. It was applied to detect trace chloramphenicol in food with the recoveries of 98.2–101.2 %, which provided a new way for rapid visual detection of chloramphenicol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapricots 3achloramphenicol 3acolor 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afood chemistry 3amolecular imprinting 3asol-gel processing 3asynthesis 0aTernary-emission fluorescence 0aMolecular imprinting 0aMetal organic frameworks 0aNear infrared 0aChloramphenicol1 aTang, Sisi1 aZhao, Pengfei1 aTang, Kangling1 aChen, Yu1 aFu, Jinli1 aZhou, Shu1 aYang, Zhaoxia,1 aZhang, Zhaohui0 tFood chemistry.g2023 Feb. 15, v. 402 p.134256-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1342563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009100173500001900264520148900283592002801772650001501800650003001815650001901845650001901864650001701883650001901900650002101919650000901940650001301949650002001962653002801982653003402010653001202044653002802056653003102084700002202115700002102137700002302158700001902181700002102200700005802221773011402279856008502393852000902478655001202487IND60712989620221119084650.0201104e20201108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071298962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4615362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeclercq, Xiaoling10aCharacterization of ultrahigh molar mass polyelectrolytes by capillary electrophoresis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh to ultrahigh molar mass (above 1 million g/mol) anionic poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide)s are widely used industrial polymers for water treatment and oil drilling. Their properties are strongly related to their charge density and molar mass distributions. However, due to inherent separation limits of SEC with currently available columns (< 5 ×10⁶ g/mol) and possible occurrence of chain breakage, and/or adsorption leading to abnormal elution, characterization of unusually high molar masses polyelectrolytes is challenging. In this work, we investigate the use of polymer sieving capillary electrophoresis for the size-based characterization of these high to ultrahigh molar mass polyelectrolytes. By optimizing the operating conditions (electric field, ionic strength, injected polyelectrolyte concentration, nature of the polymer sieving), it has been possible to considerably reduce polyelectrolyte aggregation and to get sufficient size-based selectivity, allowing to obtain the size distribution of the polyelectrolytes over a large range of molar mass from 10⁵ up to ~10×10⁶ g/mol. The data processing of the raw electropherograms is a key step in the analytical protocol leading to the molar mass distribution. The polyelectrolyte effective mobility in sieving conditions has to be normalized to its free-draining electrophoretic mobility in free solution conditions to take into account possible variability in the charge density between the different samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3aelectric field 3aelectrolytes 3aionic strength 3amolecular weight 3aoils 3apolymers 3awater treatment 0aHigh molar mass polymer 0aCapillary Gel Electrophoresis 0aSieving 0aMolar mass distribution 0aPolyacrylamide derivatives1 aLeclercq, Laurent1 aGuillard, Alexis1 aRodriguez, Laurent1 aBraun, Olivier1 aFavero, Cédrick1 aCottet, Hervé1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6876-175X0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Nov. 08, v. 1631 p.461536-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4615363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001400180245009800194300001800292506007600310520101300386592002801399506003701427650002001464650002301484650001401507650001201521650001601533650001301549650000901562700001701571700001901588700001801607773010301625856007501728852000901803655001201812IND60531880220221207065652.0160726e20141104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053188022DNAL7 a10.1021/bi500950x2doi7 aPMC42225412pmcid7 a252957062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Song10aProbing BoNT/A Protease Exosites: Implications for Inhibitor Design and Light Chain Longevity  ap. 6820-6824.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBotulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) is one of the most lethal toxins known. Its extreme toxicity is due to its light chain (LC), a zinc protease that cleaves SNAP-25, a synaptosome-associated protein, leading to the inhibition of neuronal activity. Studies on BoNT/A LC have revealed that two regions, termed exosites, can play an important role in BoNT catalytic activity. A clear understanding of how these exosites influence neurotoxin catalytic activity would provide a critical framework for deciphering the mechanism of SNAP-25 cleavage and the design of inhibitors. Herein, based on the crystallographic structure of BoNT/A LC complexed with its substrate, we designed an α-exosite binding probe. Experiments with this unique probe demonstrated that α-exosite binding enhanced both catalytic activity and stability of the LC. These data help delineate why α-exosite binding is needed for SNAP-25 cleavage and also provide new insights into the extended lifetime observed for BoNT/A LC in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abotulinum toxin 3acatalytic activity 3alongevity 3aneurons 3aproteinases 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aJavor, Sacha1 aHixon, Mark S.1 aJanda, Kim D.0 tBiochemistry.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 53, no. 43 p.6820-6824dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi500950x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245016900211300001400380520173500394592002802129650002002157650002502177650002002202650001402222650002302236650001902259650002102278650001702299650001302316650001102329650001002340650001602350651002202366651001002388653003102398653001602429653001602445653002202461653005302483700002702536700002402563700001902587700001802606700002802624700001902652700005202671700002502723773010002748856008702848852000902935655001202944IND60531550520221122074807.0170626e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053155052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Blas, Maite1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6621-168210aAtmospheric carbon tetrachloride in rural background and industry surrounded urban areas in Northern Iberian Peninsula: Mixing ratios, trends, and potential sources  ap. 26-34.  aLatest investigations on atmospheric carbon tetrachloride (CTC) are focused on its ozone depleting potential, adverse effects on the human health, and radiative efficiency and Global Warming Potential as a greenhouse gas. CTC mixing ratios have been thoroughly studied since its restriction under the Montreal Protocol, mostly in remote areas with the aim of reporting long-term trends after its banning. The observed decrease of the CTC background mixing ratio, however, was not as strong as expected. In order to explain this behavior CTC lifetime should be adjusted by estimating the relative significance of its sinks and by identifying ongoing potential sources.Looking for possible sources, CTC was measured with high-time resolution in two sites in Northern Spain, using auto-GC systems and specifically developed acquisition and processing methodologies. The first site, Bilbao, is an urban area influenced by the surrounding industry, where measurements were performed with GC–MSD for a one-year period (2007–2008). The second site, at Valderejo Natural Park (VNP), is a rural background area where measurements were carried out with GC-FID and covering CTC data a nonsuccessive five-year period (2003–2005, 2010–2011, and 2014–2015years).Median yearly CTC mixing ratios were slightly higher in the urban area (120pptv) than in VNP (80–100pptv). CTC was reported to be well mixed in the atmosphere and no sources were noticed to impact the rural site. The observed long-term trend in VNP was in agreement with the estimated global CTC emissions. In the urban site, apart from industrial and commercial CTC sources, chlorine-bleach products used as cleaning agents were reported as promotors of indoor sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acleaning agents 3aemissions 3agas chromatography 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3amixing 3aozone 3aurban areas 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 0aCarbon tetrachloride (CTC) 0aAuto-GC-MSD 0aAuto-GC-FID 0aMontreal Protocol 0aChlorinated Volatile Organic Compounds (Cl-VOCs)1 aUria-Tellaetxe, Iratxe1 aGomez, Maria Carmen1 aNavazo, Marino1 aAlonso, Lucio1 aGarcía, José Antonio,1 aDurana, Nieves1 aIza, Jon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6574-02431 aRamón, Jarol Derley0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 562 p.26-34dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245014500176300001600321520125400337592002801591650002301619650002401642650002601666650002901692650001601721650001301737650000901750650001201759650001801771650001401789650001201803650001801815650000901833650003001842650001401872650001001886650002501896650001401921650001501935650001801950653004101968653002702009653002302036653002602059700002202085700001502107700001602122700002402138700002002162773010302182856008602285852000902371655001202380IND60585458120221123044959.0180830e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058545812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2017.10.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMidhun, Sebastian J.10aAntibacterial activity of autochthonous bacteria isolated from Anabas testudineus (Bloch, 1792) and it's in vitro probiotic characterization  ap. 312-320.  aAntimicrobial potentials of bacteria isolated from Anabas testudineus have been evaluated through in vitro antagonistic activity against potent fish pathogens. The cellular components and filtered culture medium were effective against six fish pathogens. Altogether 110 strains were isolated from the fish gut, out of which 10 strains were selected through well diffusion method. From them, a strain HGA8B having cumulative maximum score was selected as candidate probiotic. The whole-cell product, heat-killed whole-cell product, Ethyl acetate extract, and the filtered broth were exhibited bactericidal activity against the tested pathogens. In addition, the isolated bacterium was capable of producing extracellular enzymes important for the digestion of food materials and was capable of growth in fish mucus from Oreochromis niloticus. The strain tolerated bile juice secreted by the host and effectively produced biofilm. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequence revealed that isolated strain HGA8B was Bacillus sp. (MF351637). Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of the bacterium did not induce any pathological signs, symptoms or mortalities in Oreochromis niloticus and revealed the safety of this bacterium as a candidate probiotic in aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabas testudineus 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aantibacterial properties 3aaquaculture 3abacteria 3abile 3abiofilm 3aculture media 3adigestion 3aenzymes 3aethyl acetate 3afish 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amortality 3amucus 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3aribosomal RNA 0aBacillus sp. strain HGA8B (MF351637) 0aAntibacterial activity 0aAnabas testudineus 0aOreochromis niloticus1 aNeethu, Sahadevan1 aVysakh, A.1 aSunil, M.A.1 aRadhakrishnan, E.K.1 aJyothis, Mathew0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2017 Dec., v. 113 p.312-320dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.10.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245015000161300001400311520139800325592002801723650002401751650001701775650002501792650001701817650001701834650001301851650001601864650001001880650002001890650002001910650002001930650003801950650003301988650002502021653002502046653002302071653002002094653002302114653002102137700001702158700001402175700001502189700001602204773011102220856007702331852000902408655001202417IND60516462620221117031117.0160325e20151023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051646262DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2015-04252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Shaoling10aExploration of the antioxidant system and photosynthetic system of a marine algicidal Bacillus and its effect on four harmful algal bloom species  ap. 49-59.  aA novel marine bacterium, strain B1, initially showed 96.4% algicidal activity against Phaeocystis globosa. Under this situation, 3 other harmful algal species (Skeletonema costatum, Heterosigma akashiwo, and Prorocentrum donghaiense) were chosen to study the algicidal effects of strain B1, and the algicidal activities were 91.4%, 90.7%, and 90.6%, respectively. To explore the algicidal mechanism of strain B1 on these 4 harmful algal species, the characteristics of the antioxidant system and photosynthetic system were studied. Sensitivity to strain B1 supernatant, enzyme activity, and gene expression varied with algal species, while the algicidal patterns were similar. Strain B1 supernatant increased malondialdehyde contents; decreased chlorophyll a contents; changed total antioxidant and superoxide dismutase activity; and restrained psbA, psbD, and rbcL genes expression, which eventually resulted in the algal cells death. The algicidal procedure was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy, which indicated that algal cells were lysed and cellular substances were released. These findings suggested that the antioxidant and photosynthetic system of these 4 algal species was destroyed under strain B1 supernatant stress. This is the first report to explore and compare the mechanism of a marine Bacillus against harmful algal bloom species of covered 4 phyla.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeocystis globosa 3aProrocentrum 3aSkeletonema costatum 3aalgal blooms 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3achlorophyll 3adeath 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3amalondialdehyde 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aharmful algal blooms 0aalgicidal Bacillus 0agene expression 0amorphologic damage 0aoxidative damage1 aShu, Wanjiao1 aTan, Shuo1 aZhao, Ling1 aYin, Pinghe0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2015 Oct. 23, v. 62, no. 1 p.49-59dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2015-04253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245004000167300001600207520110800223592002801331650003201359650001601391650001701407650001801424650002501442651001101467700002501478773012801503856007901631852000901710655001201719IND60480679920221122225108.0160706e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048067992DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.33.2.1762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLumeij, Johannes T.10aVeterinary Specialization in Europe  ap. 176-179.  aThe development of veterinary specialization in Europe is described, from its inception in 1989, through the establishment of the European Board for Veterinary Specialisation (EBVS) in 1996, to the establishment of the supervising European Coordinating Committee for Veterinary Training (ECCVT) in 2005. Currently there are about 1,500 European veterinary specialists in 21 different disciplines, which can be organ, species or discipline oriented. Each specialization is supervised by a college. Each college has representatives on the EBVS, which defines the rules, oversees procedures within the colleges, and deals with appeal procedures. The ECCVT, which consists of representatives from the European Association of Establishments for Veterinary Education (EAEVE), the Federation of Veterinarians in Europe (FVE), and the EBVS, is the supervising body that can approve procedures for the recognition of European veterinary specialists and acts as a liaison between the veterinary profession and relevant European and international bodies with respect to matters relating to post-graduate education.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainternational organizations 3aoccupations 3auniversities 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary education 3aEurope1 aHerrtage, Michael E.0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 33, no. 2 p.176-179dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.33.2.1763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012100157300001600278500002000294520034100314592002800655650002000683650002200703650001400725650001200739650001800751650002300769650004400792650001200836700005600848700001700904700001800921700002800939700001800967700001900985700001401004700005701018773013501075856007401210852000901284655001201293IND60602092920221120092622.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060209292DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.128692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoh, J.‐Y.10aLimited pathogenicity and transmissibility of Korean highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N6 clade 2.3.4.4 in ferrets  ap. 923-926.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe pathogenicity and transmissibility of a reassortant clade 2.3.4.4 avian influenza A (H5N6) virus were evaluated in ferrets.

This work discusses different approaches to predicting encapsidated viral RNA and highlights satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) RNA as a model system with excellent crystallography data. Fundamentally important issues for debate include thermodynamic versus kinetic control of virus assembly and the possible consequences of quasi-species in the primary structure on RNA secondary structure prediction of a single structure or an ensemble of structures. Multiple computational tools and chemical reagents are now available for improved viral RNA structure prediction. Two different predicted structures for encapsidated STMV RNA result from differences in three main areas: a different approach and philosophy to studying encapsidated viral RNA, an emphasis on different RNA motifs, and technical differences in computational methods and chemical reagents. The experiments with traditional chemical probing and SHAPE reagents are compared in terms of chemistry, results, and interpretation for STMV RNA as well as other RNA protein assemblies, such as the 5′UTR of HIV and the ribosome. This discussion of the challenges of viral RNA structure prediction will lead to new experiments and improved future predictions for viral RNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5' untranslated regions 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3acrystallography 3adrugs 3anucleotide motifs 3aprediction 3aribosomes 3asatellites 3athermodynamics 3avirus assembly0 tBiochemistry.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 53, no. 43 p.6728-6737dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi501051k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007300165300001600238520128700254592002801541650001401569650002401583650002901607650000901636651001301645700002201658700002601680773011301706856004801819852000901867655001201876IND4472408220221117023938.0120727e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447240822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-011-0437-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShabri, Ani Bin10aRegional analysis of annual maximum rainfall using TL-moments method  ap. 561-570.  aInformation related to distributions of rainfall amounts are of great importance for designs of water-related structures. One of the concerns of hydrologists and engineers is the probability distribution for modeling of regional data. In this study, a novel approach to regional frequency analysis using L-moments is revisited. Subsequently, an alternative regional frequency analysis using the TL-moments method is employed. The results from both methods were then compared. The analysis was based on daily annual maximum rainfall data from 40 stations in Selangor Malaysia. TL-moments for the generalized extreme value (GEV) and generalized logistic (GLO) distributions were derived and used to develop the regional frequency analysis procedure. TL-moment ratio diagram and Z-test were employed in determining the best-fit distribution. Comparison between the two approaches showed that the L-moments and TL-moments produced equivalent results. GLO and GEV distributions were identified as the most suitable distributions for representing the statistical properties of extreme rainfall in Selangor. Monte Carlo simulation was used for performance evaluation, and it showed that the method of TL-moments was more efficient for lower quantile estimation compared with the L-moments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineers 3ameteorological data 3aprobability distribution 3arain 3aMalaysia1 aDaud, Zalina Mohd1 aAriff, Noratiqah Mohd0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2011 June, v. 104, no. 3-4 p.561-570dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-011-0437-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245015000174300001600324520113100340592002801471650001501499650001601514650002601530650001701556650001901573650001801592650000701610650001101617650001901628651001601647653003201663653002501695653001601720653001701736653003201753700001701785773010201802856008701904852000901991655001202000IND60531550920221121145219.0170626e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053155092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOriekhova, Olena10aStability of uncoated and fulvic acids coated manufactured CeO2 nanoparticles in various conditions: From ultrapure to natural Lake Geneva waters  ap. 327-334.  aUnderstanding the behavior of engineered nanoparticles in natural water and impact of water composition in changing conditions is of high importance to predict their fate once released into the environment. In this study we investigated the stability of uncoated and Suwannee River fulvic acids coated CeO2 manufactured nanoparticles in various environmental conditions. The effect of pH changes on the nanoparticle and coating stability was first studied in ultrapure water as well as the variation of zeta potentials and sizes with time in presence of fulvic acids at environmental pH. Then the stability of CeO2 in synthetic and natural Lake Geneva waters was investigated as a function of fulvic acids concentration. Our results indicate that the adsorption of environmentally relevant concentrations of Suwannee River fulvic acids promotes CeO2 stabilization in ultrapure water as well as synthetic water and that the coating stability is high upon pH variations. On the other hand in natural Lake Geneva water CeO2 NPs are found in all cases aggregated due to the effect of heterogeneous organic and inorganic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aceric oxide 3aenvironmental factors 3afulvic acids 3ahydrochemistry 3ananoparticles 3apH 3arivers 3azeta potential 3aLake Geneva 0aCeO2 nanoparticle stability 0aFulvic acids coating 0aAggregation 0aComplexation 0aSurface charge modification1 aStoll, Serge0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 562 p.327-334dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008100167300001600248520174400264592002802008650001202036650001102048650001202059650002302071650001302094650002602107650002402133650002802157650001402185651001202199653002802211653001402239653003102253653002002284653001002304653001202314773014502326856008402471852000902555655001202564IND60123195320221120034852.0150325e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012319532DNAL7 a10.1080/13504509.2014.8801632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Clare10aSustainability, self-reliance and aloha aina: the case of Molokai, Hawai’i  ap. 389-397.  aA growing body of academic and popular literature associates localized systems of production and consumption with improved sustainability. However, there is a need for research that systematically addresses whether and how re-localization of an economy makes it sustainable, and under what conditions such regional self-sufficiency is possible. In the state of Hawai’i, there is growing momentum to create greater energy and food self-reliance throughout the islands as a means to achieve greater sustainability. Nowhere is this sentiment stronger than on the island of Molokai, frequently called the ‘last Hawaiian Island.’ On Molokai, the discourse of sustainability is interpreted through the lens of aloha aina , or love for the land, and an associated desire for stewardship of resources so that island residents can be as self-reliant as possible. This paper presents two recent examples from Molokai to illustrate some of the complexities associated with regional self-sufficiency on an island unavoidably buffeted by state, national and global socio-political and economic forces. Self-reliance in food on Molokai in fact requires greater collaboration with, as opposed to isolationism from, the central state. Conflicts arise when efforts to promote island sustainability are at odds with initiatives for sustainability at a broader organizational level – in this case, at the state level. The Hawai’i case raises broader questions about the viability of regional-focused sustainability initiatives that underestimate the degree to which their resource management systems are deeply interconnected to larger-scale state, national or global systems and that overlook the potential negative externalities of their efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3aenergy 3aislands 3amanagement systems 3amomentum 3aproduction technology 3aresource management 3asustainable development 3aviability 3aMolokai 0asustainable development 0aHawai’i 0amarine resource management 0aenergy politics 0ascale 0aMolokai0 tinternational journal of sustainable development and world ecology.g2014 Sept. 3, v. 21, no. 5 p.389-397dTaylor & Francisx1745-26277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2014.8801633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01138naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245005800163300001600221520033300237592002800570650002200598650002300620650002500643773012800668856007900796852000900875655001200884IND60480680620221120095831.0160706e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048068062DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.33.2.1722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhind, Susan M.10aCompetence at Graduation: Implications for Assessment  ap. 172-175.  aAssessment of clinical competence is an integral component of veterinary medical and medical programs.

Herein, we developed a colorimetric sensor using polydiacetylene (PDA)-based hydrogel beads that change color upon binding with BAs, thereby conveniently checking whether food is spoiled due to improper storage and distribution. The colorimetric sensor is fabricated by mixing PDA liposomes with an alginate solution. PDA undergoes a color change from blue to red when exposed to various external stimuli. In addition, alginate bestows the hydrogel with a three-dimensional porous structure, affording a large surface area. The PDA-based hydrogel beads can visually confirm the presence of BAs in solution or vapor form. Cadaverine and propylamine were rapidly detected with distinct color changes in the solution and vapor phases, respectively. The spoilage of pork meat at room temperature could be detected after two days as a 40.84% red chromatic shift.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalginates 3aambient temperature 3acadaverine 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3afood chemistry 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3apork 3aspoilage 3asurface area 3avapors 0aColorimetric sensor 0aFood sensor 0aBiogenic amine 0aHydrogel bead 0aPolydiacetylene1 aSon, Seong Uk1 aKim, Junseok1 aKim, Hyungjun1 aLim, Jaewoo1 aSeo, Seung Beom1 aKang, Byunghoon1 aKang, Taejoon1 aJung, Juyeon1 aSeo, Sungbaek1 aLim, Eun-Kyung0 tFood chemistry.g2023 Mar. 01, v. 403 p.134317-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1343173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014300157300001600300500002000316520135200336592002801688650003201716650002201748650002201770650001101792650001501803650001601818650002701834650002501861650001601886650001001902650001301912650001201925650001501937700002201952700002501974700006101999700006102060773013502121856007402256852000902330655001202339IND60602093320221121021714.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060209332DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.129092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRios, Liliam10aRevisiting the genetic diversity of classical swine fever virus: A proposal for new genotyping and subgenotyping schemes of classification  ap. 963-971.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClassical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious febrile viral disease caused by CSF virus (CSFV), and it is considered one of the most important infectious diseases that affect domestic pigs and wild boar. Previous molecular epidemiology studies have revealed that the diversity of CSFV comprises three main genotypes and different subgenotypes defined using a reliable cut‐off to accurately classify CSFV at genotype and subgenotype levels. However, a growing number of CSFV both complete genome and full E2 gene sequences have been submitted to GenBank (more than 500 sequences are currently available, revised on December 1, 2017). Therefore, the aim of this study was to revisit the taxonomy of CSFV at genotype and subgenotype levels, to unify nomenclature and to provide an update to the classification of CSFV. We propose here a new genotyping scheme with five well‐defined CSFV genotypes (CSFV Genotypes 1–5) and 14 subgenotypes (seven for each of the CSFV Genotype 1 and CSFV Genotype 2). The findings showed in this study are relevant for molecular epidemiology approaches and will help to better understand the genetic diversity and spreading of CSFV at a global scale. The update in the classification of CSFV will allow the scientific community to establish more accurately the links among different outbreaks of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aemerging diseases 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenotyping 3ahog cholera 3amolecular epidemiology 3anucleotide sequences 3asubgenotype 3aswine 3ataxonomy 3aviruses 3awild boars1 aNúñez, José I.1 aDíaz de Arce, Heidy1 aGanges, Llilianne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8644-35601 aPérez, Lester J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5717-51810 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2018 Aug., v. 65, no. 4 p.963-971dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.129093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245010000166500001400266520191700280592002802197650002002225650001602245650002002261650001302281650001402294650002002308650002602328650001202354650002202366650001402388650003902402650000902441650002002450650002002470650002502490650002602515650001102541650002002552650001102572700003102583700002102614700002502635700002402660773012002684856007502804852000902879655001202888IND60729175920221122050811.0210228e20210209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072917592DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110204582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontegiove, Nicolò 13aAn Alternative Approach to Evaluate the Quality of Protein-Based Raw Materials for Dry Pet Food  aNAL-light  aThe majority of dry pet food currently on the market is produced using fresh meats (FMs) and especially meat meals (MMs) as the main protein source. The transport and storage conditions of the raw materials, together with thermal and mechanical treatments in the case of MMs, may result in undesirable alterations of food products and their protein content. This study was conducted to analyze the protein component of three different kinds of raw materials used for dry pet food production, i.e., chicken, pork, and salmon. The quantitative analysis of the protein component was determined using the traditional Kjeldahl method and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, and an alternative method, i.e., the Bradford assay, while the qualitative analysis was performed through SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The amino acid (AA) profile was also evaluated by quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS). In addition, the digestibility was tested through in vitro gastric and small intestine digestion simulation. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student’s t-test, and data are reported as mean ± SEM, n = 10 (p < 0.05). The results showed that the MMs are lower in quality compared to FMs, both in terms of protein bioavailability and digestibility, having a lower soluble protein (SP) content (chicken MM = 8.6 g SP/100 g dry sample; pork MM = 6.2 g SP/100 g dry sample; salmon MM = 7.9 g SP/100 g dry sample) compared to FMs (chicken FM = 14.6 g SP/100 g dry sample; pork FM = 15.1 g SP/100 g dry sample; salmon FM = 13.7 g SP/100 g dry sample). FMs appear, therefore, to be higher-quality ingredients for pet food production. Moreover, the Bradford assay proved to be a quick and simple method to better estimate protein bioavailability in the raw materials used for dry pet food production, thanks to its correlation with the in vitro digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKjeldahl method 3aamino acids 3abioavailability 3achickens 3adigestion 3afood production 3aliquid chromatography 3amarkets 3amass spectrometry 3apet foods 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apork 3aprotein content 3aprotein sources 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3asalmon 3asmall intestine 3at-test1 aPellegrino, Roberto  Maria1 aEmiliani, Carla 1 aPellegrino, Alessia 1 aLeonardi, Leonardo 0 tAnimals.g2021 Feb. 09, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110204583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245009900173300001600272520151200288592002801800650001601828650001101844650001301855650002301868650001101891650001501902650000901917650001401926650001201940650001401952650001901966651000901985651001601994653002102010653003402031653002202065653003002087653001602117700002002133700002402153773010202177856008702279852000902366655001202375IND60531551020221123022035.0170626e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053155102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahib, Layth Y.10aStrontium isotopes as an indicator for groundwater salinity sources in the Kirkuk region, Iraq  ap. 935-945.  aThe Kirkuk region in northern Iraq hosts some of the largest oil fields in the Middle East. Several anticline structures enabled vertical migration and entrapment of the oil. Frequently, complex fracture systems and faults cut across the Eocene and middle Oligocene reservoirs and the cap rock, the Fatha Formation of Miocene age. Seepage of crude oil and oil field brines are therefore a common observation in the anticline axes and contamination of shallow groundwater resources is a major concern. In this study, 65 water samples were collected in the Kirkuk region to analyze and distinguish mixing processes between shallow groundwater resources, uprising oil field brines, and dissolution of gypsum and halite from the Fatha Formation. Hydrochemical analyses of the water samples included general hydrochemistry, stable water isotopes, as well as strontium concentrations and for 22 of the samples strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr). Strontium concentrations increased close to the anticline axes with highest concentrations in the oil field brines (300mg/l). Strontium isotopes proved to be a valuable tool to distinguish mixing processes as isotope signatures of the oil field brines and of waters from the Fatha Formation are significantly different. It could be shown, that mixing of shallow groundwater with oil field brines is occurring close to the major fault zones in the anticlines but high concentrations of strontium in the water samples are mainly due to dissolution from the Fatha Formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater 3agypsum 3aisotopes 3amigratory behavior 3amixing 3aoil fields 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aseepage 3astrontium 3awater salinity 3aIraq 3aMiddle East 0aSr isotope ratio 0aOil field brine contamination 0aKirkuk oil fields 0aL.

Here, we report the epitaxial growth of La₂/₃Sr₁/₃MnO₃ (LSMO)-SrIrO₃ (SIO) composite oxide films (LSMIO) with different crystalline orientations fabricated by a sequential two-target ablation process by pulsed laser deposition. The LSMIO films exhibit high crystalline quality with a homogeneous mixture of LSMO and SIO at an atomic level. Ferrimagnetic and insulating transport characteristics are observed, with the temperature-dependent electric resistivity well fitted by the Mott variable-range-hopping model. Moreover, the LSMIO films show strong PMA. By further constructing all-perovskite-oxide heterostructures of the ferrimagnetic insulator LSMIO and a strong spin-orbital-coupled SIO layer, pronounced spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) and spin Hall-like anomalous Hall effect (SH-AHE) were observed. These results illustrate the potential application of the ferrimagnetic insulator LSMIO in developing all-oxide ultralow-dissipation spintronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcBeijing Key Discipline Foundation of Condensed Matter Physicsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100012490  a11874367cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a12174406cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51902322cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51931011cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aU1832102cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  aZDBS-LY-SLH008cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  a2017YFA0303600cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2019YFA0307800cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  aLR20A040001cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004731  aGJTD-2020-11cK.

A total of 53 reliable PAP samples containing fish meal (FM), porcine, poultry, bovine, and ovine meat and bone meal (MBM) were collected, and 37 distinct fatty acids were statistically analyzed via gas chromatography. Principal component analysis and the partial least squares discriminant analysis algorithm were performed on the dataset. The results revealed that PAPs from different species could be clearly classified based on the presence or absence of fatty acid compounds with high sensitivity and specificity (>0.95), except for the discrimination of bovine MBM in the mixed dataset. It was possible to distinguish FM samples in the mixed dataset, ruminant MBM from non‐ruminant MBM and FM, and porcine MBM from poultry MBM samples based on the concentrations of 34 fatty acid compounds. Further discrimination of PAP samples from different species using fewer selected fatty acids was comparable to or better than discrimination based on the presence or absence and concentration of 34 fatty acid compounds. Practical applications: A new method for discriminating between processed animal proteins (PAP) from different species based on their fat characteristics was established for the first time in this study. Results suggested that the analytical methodology established in this study has great potential for species‐specific identification of PAP feed with respect to the global “mad cow” crisis.

Social interaction impairments are the most characteristic deficits in ASD. There is also evidence of impoverished language and empathy, a profound inability to use standard nonverbal behaviors (eye contact, affective expression) to regulate social interactions with others, difficulties in showing empathy, failure to share enjoyment, interests and achievements with others, and a lack of social and emotional reciprocity. In developed countries, it is now reported that 1%–1.5% of children have ASD, and in the US 2015 CDC reports that approximately one in 45 children suffer from ASD. Despite the intense research focus on ASD in the last decade, the underlying etiology remains unknown. Genetic research involving twins and family studies strongly supports a significant contribution of environmental factors in addition to genetic factors in ASD etiology. A comprehensive literature search has implicated several environmental factors associated with the development of ASD. These include pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls, solvents, air pollutants, fragrances, glyphosate and heavy metals, especially aluminum used in vaccines as adjuvant. Importantly, the majority of these toxicants are some of the most common ingredients in cosmetics and herbicides to which almost all of us are regularly exposed to in the form of fragrances, face makeup, cologne, air fresheners, food flavors, detergents, insecticides and herbicides. In this review we describe various scientific data to show the role of environmental factors in ASD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aair 3aair pollution 3aaluminum 3aautism 3abehavior 3achildren 3acosmetics 3adetergents 3adeveloped countries 3aenvironmental factors 3aetiology 3afamily studies 3aflavor 3aglyphosate 3aheavy metals 3aingredients 3ainsecticides 3anonverbal communication 3aodors 3aphthalates 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asolvents 3atoxic substances 3atwins 3avaccines 3aUnited States 0aAluminum 0aAutistic disorder/pathology 0aFragrances 0aGlyphosate 0aHormone disturbing chemicals 0aHumans 0aImmunotoxicity 0aInfant 0aMaternal antibodies 0aMonozygotic twins 0aNeuroimmunotoxicity 0aNeurotoxins 0aPrenatal 0aPostnatal 0aThimerosal 0aUnited States 0aVaccines1 aHughes, B.W.1 aSriskanda, A.N.1 aGuest, J.R.1 aGibson, A.D.1 aJohnson-Williams, L.1 aPace, D.G.1 aBagasra, O.0 tEnvironment international.g2016 Mar., v. 88 p.288-298dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2015.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002800188245014600216300001600362506007600378520179100454592002802245506003702273650001802310650001302328650001602341650002002357650001602377650001002393650001702403650002602420650004102446650002202487650002002509650001402529700002002543700001802563700002302581700002402604773008102628856004802709852000902757655001202766IND50063286620221207055920.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006328662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11745-012-3744-42doi7 aPMC35873532pmcid7 a233068292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarikumar, Kaleeckal G.10aMembrane Cholesterol Affects Stimulus-Activity Coupling in Type 1, but not Type 2, CCK Receptors: Use of Cell Lines with Elevated Cholesterol  ap. 231-244.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe lipid microenvironment of membrane proteins can affect their structure, function, and regulation. We recently described differential effects of acute modification of membrane cholesterol on the function of type 1 and 2 cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors. We now explore the regulatory impact of chronic cholesterol modification on these receptors using novel receptor-bearing cell lines with elevated membrane cholesterol. Stable CCK1R and CCK2R expression was established in clonal lines of 25RA cells having gain-of-function in SCAP [sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein] and SRD15 cells having deficiencies in Insig-1 and Insig-2 enzymes affecting HMG CoA reductase and SREBP. Increased cholesterol in the plasma membrane of these cells was directly demonstrated, and receptor binding and signaling characteristics were shown to reflect predicted effects on receptor function. In both environments, both types of CCK receptors were internalized and recycled normally in response to agonist occupation. No differences in receptor distribution within the membrane were appreciated at the light microscopic level in these CHO-derived cell lines. Fluorescence anisotropy was studied for these receptors occupied by fluorescent agonist and antagonist, as well as when tagged with YFP. These studies demonstrated increased anisotropy of the agonist ligand occupying the active state of the CCK1R in a cholesterol-enriched environment, mimicking fluorescence of the uncoupled, inactive state of this receptor, while there was no effect of increasing cholesterol on fluorescence at the CCK2R. These cell lines should be quite useful for examining the functional characteristics of potential drugs that might be used in an abnormal lipid environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute effects 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3acholecystokinin 3acholesterol 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3afunctional properties 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3amembrane proteins 3aplasma membrane 3areceptors1 aPotter, Ross M.1 aPatil, Achyut1 aEcheveste, Valerie1 aMiller, Laurence J.0 tLipids.g2013 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.231-244dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-012-3744-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245003400212300001600246506007600262520126000338592002801598506003701626650001701663650002101680650001101701650002201712700002301734773011901757856008401876852000901960655001201969IND60090106220221207102712.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009010622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.05.0172doi7 aPMC29749612pmcid7 a206856232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenisov, Ilia G.10aCytochromes P450 in Nanodiscs  ap. 223-229.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNanodiscs have proven to be a versatile tool for the study all types of membrane proteins, including receptors, transporters, enzymes and viral antigens. The self-assembled Nanodisc system provides a robust and common means for rendering these targets soluble in aqueous media while providing a native like bilayer environment that maintains functional activity. This system has thus provided a means for studying the extensive collection of membrane bound cytochromes P450 with the same biochemical and biophysical tools that have been previously limited to use with the soluble P450s. These include a plethora of spectroscopic, kinetic and surface based methods. Significant improvements in homogeneity and stability of these preparations open new possibilities for detailed analysis of equilibrium and steady-state kinetic characteristics of catalytic mechanisms of human cytochromes P450 involved in xenobiotic metabolism and in steroid biosynthesis. The experimental methods developed for physico-chemical and functional studies of membrane cytochromes P450 incorporated in Nanodiscs allow for more detailed understanding of the scientific questions along the lines pioneered by Professor Klaus Ruckpaul and his array of colleagues and collaborators.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosynthesis 3acytochrome P-450 3ahumans 3amembrane proteins1 aSligar, Stephen G.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Jan., v. 1814, no. 1 p.223-229dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03825naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002000170245011900190300001400309520175300323592002802076650001402104650001102118650002202129650000902151650003802160650001602198650001702214650001002231650002202241650000902263650001202272650001402284650001302298650001302311650002002324650002002344650001702364650001202381650001402393650001502407650003402422650003402456650000902490650003802499650004302537650002902580650004902609650000902658650003302667650001302700700002502713700001602738700001902754700001802773700001602791700001602807700001502823700001702838700001802855700001702873700001702890773010002907856008703007852000903094655001203103IND4485491420221123041741.0141110e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448549142DNAL7 a224058302pmid7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2012.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiessen, S.J.M.10aNovel diabetes mellitus treatment: mature canine insulin production by canine striated muscle through gene therapy  ap. 16-25.  aMuscle-targeted gene therapy using insulin genes has the potential to provide an inexpensive, low maintenance alternative or adjunctive treatment method for canine diabetes mellitus. A canine skeletal muscle cell line was established through primary culture, as well as through transdifferentiation of canine fibroblasts after infection with a myo-differentiation gene containing adenovirus vector. A novel mutant furin-cleavable canine preproinsulin gene insert (cppI4) was designed and created through de novo gene synthesis. Various cell lines, including the generated canine muscle cell line, were transfected with nonviral plasmids containing cppI4. Insulin and desmin immunostaining were used to prove insulin production by muscle cells and specific canine insulin ELISA to prove mature insulin secretion into the medium. The canine myoblast cultures proved positive on desmin immunostaining. All cells tolerated transfection with cppI4-containing plasmid, and double immunostaining for insulin and desmin proved present in the canine cells. Canine insulin ELISA assessment of medium of cppI4-transfected murine myoblasts and canine myoblast and fibroblast mixture proved presence of mature fully processed canine insulin, 24 and 48 h after transfection. The present study provides proof of principle that canine muscle cells can be induced to produce and secrete canine insulin on transfection with nonviral plasmid DNA containing a novel mutant canine preproinsulin gene that produces furin-cleavable canine preproinsulin. This technology could be developed to provide an alternative canine diabetes mellitus treatment option or to provide a constant source for background insulin, as well as C-peptide, alongside current treatment options.  aPublisher supplied data 3ac-peptide 3adesmin 3adiabetes mellitus 3adogs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibroblasts 3agene therapy 3agenes 3ainsulin secretion 3amice 3amutants 3amyoblasts 3amyocytes 3aplasmids 3askeletal muscle 3astriated muscle 3atransfection 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aCricetinae 2aDesminxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDiabetes Mellitusxveterinary 2aDogs 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGene Expression Regulationxphysiology 2aGenetic Therapyxmethods 2aInsulinxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aPlasmids1 aFernandez-Fuente, M.1 aMahmoud, A.1 aCampbell, S.C.1 aAldibbiat, A.1 aHuggins, C.1 aBrown, A.E.1 aHolder, A.1 aPiercy, R.J.1 aCatchpole, B.1 aShaw, J.A.M.1 aChurch, D.B.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2012 July, v. 43, no. 1 p.16-25dElsevier Inc.x0739-72407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2012.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010800172300001800280520204600298592002802344650002002372650002002392650002402412650001402436650002402450650002302474650002202497650001302519650001802532650001302550650002002563650001102583650002202594650001802616650001202634650001002646651001902656700002002675773014802695856008402843852000902927655001202936IND60123494620221118074442.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012349462DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2013.8156622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeaver, Daniel M.10aAssessing Effects of Stocked Trout on Nongame Fish Assemblages in Southern Appalachian Mountain Streams  ap. 1495-1507.  aFisheries managers are faced with the challenge of balancing the management of recreational fisheries with that of conserving native species and preserving ecological integrity. The negative effects that nonnative trout species exert on native trout are well documented and include alteration of competitive interactions, habitat use, and production. However, the effects that nonnative trout may exert on nongame fish assemblages are poorly understood. Our objectives were to quantify the effects of trout stocking on native nongame fish assemblages intensively on one newly stocked river, the North Toe River, North Carolina, and extensively on other southern Appalachian Mountain streams that are annually stocked with trout. In the intensive study, we adopted a before–after, control–impact (BACI) experimental design to detect short-term effects on the nongame fish assemblage and found no significant differences in fish density, species richness, species diversity, or fish microhabitat use associated with trout stocking. We observed differences in fish microhabitat use between years, however, which suggests there is a response to environmental changes, such as the flow regime, which influence available habitat. In the extensive study, we sampled paired stocked and unstocked stream reaches to detect long-term effects from trout stocking; however, we detected no differences in nongame fish density, species richness, species diversity, or population size structure between paired sites. Our results revealed high inherent system variation caused by natural and anthropogenic factors that appear to overwhelm any acute or chronic effect of stocked trout. Furthermore, hatchery-reared trout may be poor competitors in a natural setting and exert a minimal or undetectable impact on native fish assemblages in these streams. These findings provide quantitative results necessary to assist agencies in strategic planning and decision making associated with trout fisheries, stream management, and conservation of native fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3adecision making 3aexperimental design 3afisheries 3ahabitat preferences 3aindigenous species 3along term effects 3amanagers 3amicrohabitats 3aplanning 3apopulation size 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3asport fishing 3astreams 3atrout 3aNorth Carolina1 aKwak, Thomas J.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 142, no. 6 p.1495-1507dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.8156623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04414naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003100188245012600219300001100345500001500356506007600371520254700447592002802994506003703022650003203059650000903091650001903100650001503119650001103134650001403145650005203159650001503211650001203226650002603238650002203264650001903286650003403305650003803339650001203377650001503389650001403404650001303418651001003431653003203441700002203473700002603495700003003521700002903551700003703580700002203617773009503639856008103734852000903815655001203824IND60548515420221207143527.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054851542DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-015-0630-32doi7 aPMC47125612pmcid7 a267673632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Prieto, Víctor10aEvidence of shared bovine viral diarrhea infections between red deer and extensively raised cattle in south-central Spain  ap. 11.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pestivirus that affects cattle production worldwide and that can infect other ungulates such as cervids and even wild boar (Sus scrofa). It is believed that domestic livestock can become infected through contact with wild animals, though it is known that infection can spread among wild animals in the absence of contact with livestock. Little is known about the sharing of BVDV infection between wild and domestic animals in the same habitat, which is important for designing eradication campaigns and preventing outbreaks, especially on hunting estates with high animal densities. RESULTS: We assessed the sharing of BVDV infections among hunted red deer, wild boar and cattle in south-central Spain. Sampled red deer (Cervus elaphus; n = 267) and wild boar (n = 52) were located on 19 hunting estates, and cattle (n = 180) were located on 18 nearby farms. We used ELISA kits for the serological screening, Taqman RT-PCR assay for the virus determination, and subsequent phylogenetic analysis for 17 RT-PCR positive sample amplicons. Fifty-two red deer (19.5 %) and 82 cattle (45.6 %) samples tested positive by ELISA. A high apparent prevalence (22.47 %) was obtained for red deer, while only five cattle farms tested positive by RT-PCR. Conversely, no wild boar tested positive by both ELISA or RT-PCR. Eleven red deer (4.1 %) tested positive by both ELISA and RT-PCR; these animals may have been sampled during the last phase of viremia, or they may represent previously exposed individuals infected by a different BVDV strain. The amplicons shared 92.7–100 % identity and fell within the BVDV subgroup 1b, although nine of these (from four red deer and five cattle pools) formed a separate branch. This suggests that there might be a common BVDV infecting both cattle and red deer. Higher red deer abundance was significantly associated with greater risk that extensively raised cattle would test positive for BVDV by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that BVDV is circulating between cattle and red deer populations in proximity, but further work is required to determine whether they share the same strain(s). These results suggest the potential of BVDV to serve as a surveillance marker in these shared habitats. High seroprevalence of BVDV in red deer from our study area suggests that although BVDV infection is common, animals usually survive the infection. Further research is needed to verify and investigate the role of red deer as a BVDV reservoir.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alivestock and meat industry 3arisk 3aseroprevalence 3amonitoring 3acattle 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aSus scrofa 3aviremia 3abovine viral diarrhea 3acattle production 3aCervus elaphus 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aviruses 3awild boars 3ascreening 3ahabitats 3aSpain 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aKukielka, Deborah1 aRivera-Arroyo, Belén1 aMartínez-López, Beatriz1 ade las Heras, Ana Isabel1 aSánchez-Vizcaíno, José Manuel1 aVicente, Joaquín0 tBMC veterinary research.g2016 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.11-11dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0630-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245013000217300001800347520153100365592002801896650001201924650001901936650001301955650000901968650001101977651001101988651001401999651001802013700001702031700002502048700002002073700002302093700001902116700002802135700001902163700002502182700002002207773012702227856008202354852000902436655001202445IND60748809220221117110646.0210827e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074880922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-020-05317-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReboita, Michelle Simões1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1734-239510aFuture changes in the wintertime cyclonic activity over the CORDEX-CORE southern hemisphere domains in a multi-model approach  ap. 1533-1549.  aChanges in the characteristics of austral winter (June–July–August) synoptic activity in three domains (Africa, Australia and South America) of the extratropical Southern Hemisphere projected with the Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) are presented. The model is nested in three global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. The model grid spacing is 25 km and the simulations cover the period 1970–2100. Synoptic activity is analyzed using both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. The Eulerian analysis shows an increase of the synoptic activity south of 40° S in the RegCM4 and GCMs ensembles for the future (2080–2099) compared to the present (1995–2014), but this signal does not necessarily indicate an increase in the cyclone frequency since it includes cyclonic and anticyclonic features. The Lagrangian analysis, however, indicates a decrease in the frequency of cyclones, with a positive tendency towards stronger systems, although the latter is not statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Lifetime, traveled distance and mean speed of the cyclones do not present statistically significant changes in the future climate. On the other hand, a significant increase in both intensity and extension of areas affected by precipitation associated with cyclones is found. As a consequence, there is a statistically significant trend of individual cyclones to produce more rainfall in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3adynamics 3arain 3awinter 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 3aSouth America1 aReale, Marco1 ada Rocha, Rosmeri P.1 aGiorgi, Filippo1 aGiuliani, Graziano1 aCoppola, Erika1 aNino, Rosa Beatriz Luna1 aLlopart, Marta1 aTorres, Jose Abraham1 aCavazos, Tereza0 tClimate dynamics.g2021 Sept., v. 57, no. 5-6 p.1533-1549dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05317-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011400167300001600281520183700297592002802134650001702162650002002179650001702199650001702216650002302233650002302256650001802279650001202297650001102309650001202320650001502332650002202347650001902369650001002388650001502398650001302413651001102426651001802437653001702455653001702472653003102489653002002520653001002540653001002550773009802560856007702658852000902735655001202744IND60573140220180323000000.0170721e20170517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057314022DNAL7 a10.1515/frp-2016-00362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulakowski, Dominik10aManaging bark beetle outbreaks (Ips typographus, Dendroctonus spp.) in conservation areas in the 21st century  ap. 352-357.  aForests in Europe and North America are being affected by large and severe outbreaks of bark beetles, which have caused widespread concern about forest health and have led to proposals for tree removal in affected or susceptible forests. Any such intervention, as well as broader decisions of whether any active interventions are appropriate, should be based on the best scientific data. This is true for all forests, including those whose purposes include timber production, watershed protection, biogeochemical function and recreation, and especially protected and conservation areas as the latter often provide particularly unique and important cultural, social, scientific and other ecosystem services. Here, I summarize peer-reviewed literature on the effects of bark beetle outbreaks and on silvicultural treatments aimed at mitigating beetle-induced tree mortality. From an objective scientific perspective, beetle outbreaks do not destroy forests. Instead, in many cases they play an important role in promoting wildlife, biodiversity and other ecological services. The best available data indicate that logging in conservation areas is unlikely to stop ongoing bark beetle outbreaks and instead may be more ecologically detrimental to the forests than the outbreaks themselves. If the purpose of a forest is timber production, then logging is desirable and can be planned based on appropriate analyses of timber yield and economic profit. However, in areas in which conservation is the determined goal, it is recommended that cutting trees be limited to removing hazards, such as trees that might fall in areas of high human activity in order to limit property damage and personal injury. Based on extensive research in Europe and North America, logging beetle-affected forests is inconsistent with most conservation goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus 3aIps typographus 3abark beetles 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3aecosystem services 3aforest health 3aforests 3ahumans 3alogging 3arecreation 3atimber production 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awatersheds 3awildlife 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aDendroctonus 0adisturbances 0aecosystem based management 0aIps typographus 0aPicea 0aPinus0 tLeśne prace badawcze.g2017 May 17, v. 77, no. 4 p.352-357dDe Gruyter Openx2082-89267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/frp-2016-00363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001800144245009400162300001400256500000900270520121500279592002801494650002501522650001401547650001301561650001101574650002001585650001301605700001601618700001901634700001301653700001501666700001601681700001601697700001501713700001501728773015501743852000901898856008101907655001201988IND4435764220221122163911.0191124s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443576422DNAL7 a10.4195/jnrlse.2009.00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugust, P.

Our instrument allows quantitative measurement of a student's self-perception of his/her knowledge and interest in multidisciplinary inquiry. We use our T assessment tool to measure graduate student progress in an NSF IGERT-funded graduate program in coastal ecosystem management. The T model provides us a nomenclature to articulate learning goals, a quantitative means to evaluate current and future learning targets and progress in reaching those targets, and gives us another measure of assessing overall graduate program effectiveness. Our T tool is an instrument that should have considerable utility in measuring knowledge and interest in multidisciplinary research across a range of disciplines and graduate programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem management 3aeducation 3alearning 3amodels 3aself-perception 3astudents1 aSwift, J.M.1 aKellogg, D.

Addition of a combination of 10% rooibos and 4% PL + SDA inhibit growth of C. perfringens vegetative cell in Jokbal at 24 °C and 36 °C. The significant inhibition on germination and growth of C. perfringens spores was also observed in Jokbal with a combination of 10% rooibos and 4% PL + SDA (PL: 2.24%, SDA: 0.16%) at 24 °C. The Jokbal treated with 10% rooibos and 4% PL + SDA mixture had significantly (P < 0.05) lower TBARS values than the control at 10 and 24 °C. The lipid oxidation inhibition effect was the highest (P < 0.05) in anaerobic packed Jokbal with 10% rooibos. The addition of a combination of 10% rooibos and 4% PL + SDA during the processing of Jokbal prevented the growth of C. perfringens and the germination and growth of C. perfringens spores at room temperature. This study shows rooibos tea as a valuable natural food preservative in meat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspalathus linearis 3aClostridium perfringens 3aanti-infective properties 3afood science 3agermination 3alipid peroxidation 3ameat products 3apotassium 3aready-to-eat foods 3asodium 3aspores 3aswine 3atea 3atemperature 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aPark, Keun‐Cheol1 aYoon, Ki Sun0 tJournal of food science.g2014 Dec., v. 79, no. 12 p.M2507-M2515dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.127013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011400163520168600277592002801963650001801991650003402009650001402043650001302057650001702070650001802087650001602105650001402121650002202135650001302157650002302170653002302193653001302216653002202229653001802251653000802269700001702277700001702294700001502311700001802326773011502344856008202459852000902541655001202550IND60766062120221118042819.0220228e20220510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076606212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2022.1150412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Juntao10aEfficacy and safety of adjuvant curcumin therapy in ulcerative colitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis  aCurcumin, an active polyphenol extracted from Traditional Chinese medicine Curcuma longa (turmeric), has shown many health-related benefits and pharmacological effects. Adjuvant curcumin therapy for ulcerative colitis has become increasingly popular, but its efficacy and safety of which is still controversial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant curcumin therapy in ulcerative colitis. The Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, WanFang, and SinoMed databases were searched from inception to June 2021, to identify all randomized controlled clinical trials with adjuvant curcumin therapy in ulcerative colitis. The primary outcomes were clinical and endoscopic remission, and subgroup analyses were also performed. Six randomized trials with a total of 385 participants were included in this study. Qualified trials recommended that adjuvant curcumin therapy for ulcerative colitis was effective in inducing clinical remission (RR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.89), but not in clinical improvement (RR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.61), endoscopic remission (RR = 4.17, 95% CI 0.63 to 27.71) or endoscopic improvement (RR = 4.13, 95% CI 0.20 to 87.07). Included studies showed that appropriate dosage, formation, longer duration, and topical medication may have a greater potential advantage. No severe adverse effects had been reported. Available evidence suggested that adjuvant curcumin therapy may be effective for clinical remission in ulcerative colitis patients without causing severe adverse effects. The appropriate methods of administration can achieve better curative effect, which requires further study to verify.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma longa 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aadjuvants 3acurcumin 3adrug therapy 3ameta-analysis 3apolyphenols 3aremission 3asystematic review 3aturmeric 3aulcerative colitis 0aUlcerative colitis 0aCurcumin 0aSystematic review 0aMeta-analysis 0aRCT1 aWei, Lunshou1 aWang, Naiqin1 aLi, Xiumin1 aMiao, Mingsan0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2022 May 10, v. 289 p.115041-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2022.1150413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245013500177300001600312520205800328592002802386650001102414650002402425650001502449650001002464650001402474650002002488650001702508650001402525650001102539650002202550650001802572650001502590651001302605651001902618651001002637700002802647773009502675856008102770852000902851655001202860IND60520752220221120221110.0160522e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052075222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-016-9572-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina Torres, Kryztal M.10aTaxonomic and functional organization in metacommunity structure of stream-fish assemblages among and within river basins in Texas  ap. 247-259.  aMetacommunities are spatially structured communities linked by dispersal. They provide a connection between local community assembly and regional-level processes. One of the more widely used methods to address questions related to metacommunity concepts is those that characterize elements of metacommunity structure by quantifying aspects of coherence, species turnover, and boundary clumping. In this study, we used this approach to study the spatial ecology of freshwater fishes in Texas. Stream-fish assemblages in Texas provide an excellent opportunity to examine the patterns of metacommunity structure due to the number of drainages that empty directly into the Gulf of Mexico, which minimizes the likelihood of dispersal between basins while allowing for longitudinal movement within basins. We used fisheries data published by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and from the North American Water Quality Association, which consisted of 94 sampling localities distributed across 18 river basins and 11 ecoregions. To examine within-basin patterns, we focused only on the Brazos, Colorado, and Trinity rivers because of the number of sites within each of these basins. From a taxonomic standpoint, we consistently observed Clementsian patterns regardless of whether it was among or within river basins, whereas we mostly observed Gleasonian patterns from a functional perspective. Only one functional group was found at all sites in each of the three main river basins, which consisted of invertivores with an equilibrium life-history strategy. Various bioclimatic variables were significantly correlated with metacommunity structure, but these correlations differed between taxonomic and functional organization and differed depending on which river basin was considered. The results of this study support previous findings that species composition and functional traits relate to environmental gradients, but further our understanding by providing additional evidence that species sorting processes are the dominant structuring mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acommunity structure 3aecoregions 3afauna 3afisheries 3afreshwater fish 3alife history 3alimnology 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aColorado 3aGulf of Mexico 3aTexas1 aHiggins, Christopher L.0 tAquatic ecology.g2016 June, v. 50, no. 2 p.247-259dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-25887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-016-9572-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245009300175300001800268520056400286592002800850650001400878650001000892650002200902650004100924650001400965700002000979700002100999700001801020700002301038700002401061700002101085700002001106700001701126700002401143700002301167700002401190700003101214700002401245700001701269700002301286700002701309700002801336700001501364700001801379700002001397700002301417700002201440700001701462700001401479700002701493700001701520773011801537856008201655990002301737852000901760655001201769IND60091128220221123035228.0141103e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009112822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.10.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharya, Samit K.10aIdentification of novel series of pyrazole and indole-urea based DFG-out PYK2 inhibitors  ap. 7523-7529.  aPrevious drug discovery efforts identified classical PYK2 kinase inhibitors such as 2 and 3 that possess selectivity for PYK2 over its intra-family isoform FAK.

This study not only focuses on the key role of the high-altitude headwaters of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) on the water supply in its droughty downstream lowlands, but also analyzes the contributions of the headwaters’ changes to affect the variations of discharge in the entire basin especially in the early 21ˢᵗ century compared to the last half of the 20ᵗʰ century. The results indicated that more than 1/3 of the actual flow out of the headwaters of the YRB supported the excessive water demand (mainly for irrigation) downstream. The observed discharge (QObₛ) increased by 44.07% in the YRB as a whole before and after the mutation year 2002 during 1986–2019, and 76.45% of the discharge increment derived from the headwaters. The increasing precipitation in the headwaters dominated the discharge recovery of the YRB, and resulted in a relative increase of 36.28% in the QObₛ of the entire YRB; whereas the variations of the headwaters in terms of potential evapotranspiration, land cover and water use for human activities have decreased the QObₛ of the entire YRB by 4.68%, 2.07% and 5.10%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3aclimate 3aevapotranspiration 3ahumans 3airrigation 3aland cover 3amutation 3awater 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYellow River 0adischarge variations 0aheadwater region of the Yellow River 0awater-use1 aWang, Lei1 aLi, Xiuping1 aZhou, Jing1 aChen, Deliang1 aYang, Hanbo0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Oct. 03,  p.101230-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101230  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013300173300001800306520158200324592002801906650002701934650001101961650001601972650000901988650002401997650001302021650001402034650001002048650001302058650001402071650000902085650001902094650001302113650001202126650001502138651001202153700001802165700002002183700002302203700002202226700002002248773014802268856008402416852000902500655001202509IND60123495020221118075248.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012349502DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2013.8224192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, Madalena C.10aLateral and Longitudinal Displacement of Stream-Rearing Juvenile Bull Trout in Response to Upstream Migration of Spawning Adults  ap. 1590-1601.  aOntogenetic shifts in fish habitat use often occur to reduce the risk of predation or cannibalism. We examined the large- and small-scale spatial behavior of juvenile Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus during the spawning migration of adfluvial adult Bull Trout into a tributary (Smith-Dorrien Creek, Alberta) where juveniles rear. We evaluated whether juvenile spatial behavior suggested a direct response to adults that may be interpreted as an attempt to reduce predation risk. Our results showed that the juvenile response to the influx of adults was size dependent, with larger juveniles migrating downstream into Lower Kananaskis Lake and smaller juveniles moving into shallower reaches and margins of the creek. From 1992 to 2002, the downstream migration of juveniles occurred after the upstream migration of spawning adults. Juveniles migrating downstream into the lake were predominantly age 3, with some age-2 individuals. The lateral movement of juvenile Bull Trout in the creek in response to the presence of adult Bull Trout spawners was also assessed by comparing water depths occupied before, during, and after the spawning period. Median depths of water used by juveniles decreased when adults were present and then shifted to prespawning water depths once spawners had left the creek to return to the lake. These results suggest that behaviorally driven habitat segregation of juvenile and adult Bull Trout occurs at both a small scale (within the creek) and a large scale (within the watershed), likely to reduce cannibalism and to maximize juvenile survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvelinus confluentus 3aadults 3acannibalism 3afish 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3aontogeny 3apredation 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aspawning 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aAlberta1 aPost, John R.1 aPaul, Andrew J.1 aJohnston, Fiona D.1 aMushens, Craig J.1 aStelfox, Jim D.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 142, no. 6 p.1590-1601dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.8224193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002300163245010300186300001600289520139800305592002801703650002101731650001301752650002001765650001801785650002001803650004201823650003801865650003801903650001101941650001501952650002601967650003101993650001402024700002302038700002402061700001802085773011202103852000902215856008102224655001202305IND4435952220221118181319.0181206e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443595222DNAL7 a201301652pmid7 a10.1177/01457217093590892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnidge, Ellen K.10aTools for Building Clinic-Community Partnerships to Support Chronic Disease Control and Prevention  ap. 190-201.  aPurpose Developing partnerships among health care clinics and community organizations is an important strategy for increasing resources and supports for chronic disease care and management. Although several tools assessing partnership characteristics exist, tools to assess the progression from partnership development to the achievement of specific short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes have not been developed to date. The purpose of this article is to introduce tools developed by the Diabetes Initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to fill that gap. Conclusion The Diabetes Initiative used a group process with program grantees to better delineate the phases of partnership development that contribute to the achievement of a shared long-term goal. The Framework for Building Clinic-Community Partnerships to Support Chronic Disease Control and Prevention presented in this article was developed as a result of this process. To apply the framework, 3 checklists were created to correspond to each stage of the framework. The final tools include the framework; 3 checklists with items to assess partnership development, agency capacity within and between agencies, and intermediate and long-term outcomes; and a form to facilitate changes to improve the partnership. Overall, these tools seek to aid partnerships in achieving the best possible chronic disease outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic diseases 3adiabetes 3adisease control 3agroup process 3ahealth services 2aChronic Diseasexprevention & control 2aCommunity-Institutional Relations 2aDiabetes Mellitusxrehabilitation 2aHumans 2aLeadership 2aPatient Care Planning 2aPatient Education as Topic 2aSelf Care1 aBrownson, Carol A.1 aBaker, Elizabeth A.1 aShetty, Gowri0 tDiabetes educator.g2010 Mar., v. 36, no. 2 p.190-201dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217093590893Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03073naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007600169300001800245520182400263592002802087650002502115650001402140650001102154650001402165650001102179650002202190650000902212650001502221650002302236650001502259651001802274651001602292651002302308700002002331700001902351700001902370700002102389773014802410856008402558852000902642655001202651IND60123495120221118075253.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012349512DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2013.8224212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRohde, Jessica10aPartial Migration and Diel Movement Patterns in Puget Sound Coho Salmon  ap. 1615-1628.  aPartial migration, a term referring to populations in which only a fraction of the individuals migrate, is a widespread phenomenon among fishes. However, it is not always clear whether there are only two alternatives (migration or residency) or a continuum of movement patterns. For example, Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch are anadromous, and most individuals rear over the continental shelf or in offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean; however, some Coho Salmon (known as residents) spend all or part of their marine lives within Puget Sound. The movements of residents are poorly documented, and it is unclear whether they ever leave Puget Sound and move to the coast of Washington and to what extent they move within Puget Sound. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to investigate the patterns of movement by immature Coho Salmon in Puget Sound at a series of spatial scales. We tagged 45 resident Coho Salmon in the central basin of Puget Sound with acoustic transmitters and detected their movements with fixed receivers in the Salish Sea. Seven individuals were detected as departing Puget Sound through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but these fish did not differ in body size, origin (wild or hatchery), or tagging date from fish that remained in Puget Sound. The fish remaining as residents seldom moved between the marine basins of Puget Sound. Within the central basin, deeper/offshore sites had higher frequencies of detection and other indices of site use. Fish were more often present and moved more often at shallow sites close to shore during the night, whereas they were more often present and moved more at deep, offshore sites during the day. We suggest that rather than being a discrete behavior, residence in Puget Sound by Coho Salmon is part of a continuum of migratory behavior patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3aacoustics 3abasins 3abody size 3acoasts 3acontinental shelf 3afish 3ahatcheries 3amigratory behavior 3asite index 3aPacific Ocean 3aPuget Sound 3aWashington (state)1 aKagley, Anna N.1 aFresh, Kurt L.1 aGoetz, Fred A.1 aQuinn, Thomas P.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 142, no. 6 p.1615-1628dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.8224213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245016400167300002000331520099200351592002801343650002001371650001101391650001001402650000901412650001701421650000801438650001901446650001301465650002001478650001201498700002001510700002401530700002101554773010101575856007901676852000901755655001201764IND60119719420221119015347.0141226e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011971942DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.126932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalaban, Murat O.10aColor Change of the Snapper (Pagrus auratus) and Gurnard (Chelidonichthys kumu) Skin and Eyes during Storage: Effect of Light Polarization and Contact with Ice  ap. E2456-E2462.  aTen gurnard and 10 snapper were stored on ice. One side always contacted the ice; the other side was always exposed to air. At different intervals for up to 12 d, the fish were placed in a light box, and the images of both sides were taken using polarized and nonpolarized illumination. Image analysis resulted in average L*, a*, and b* values of skin, and average L* values of the eyes. The skin L* value of gurnard changed significantly over time while that of snapper was substantially constant. The a* and b* values of both fish decreased over time. The L* values of eyes were significantly lower for polarized images, and significantly lower for the side of fish exposed to air only. This may be a concern in quality evaluation methods such as QIM. The difference of colors between the polarized and nonpolarized images was calculated to quantify the reflection off the surface of fish. For accurate measurement of surface color and eye color, use of polarized light is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelidonichthys 3aPagrus 3acolor 3aeyes 3afood science 3aice 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3apolarized light 3asnapper1 aStewart, Kelsie1 aFletcher, Graham C.1 aAlçiçek, Zayde0 tJournal of food science.g2014 Dec., v. 79, no. 12 p.E2456-E2462dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.126933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009700172300001800269520140300287592002801690650001601718650001401734650002101748650000901769650001301778650001001791650001101801650001401812650001701826650002201843650001101865651001401876700002301890700002201913700001901935700002201954773014801976856008402124852000902208655001202217IND60123495220221118075255.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012349522DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2013.8224222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, Rodney B.10aDepths and Thermal Habitat Used by Large versus Small Northern Pike in Three Minnesota Lakes  ap. 1629-1639.  aWe monitored depths and temperatures used by large (>71-cm) versus small Northern Pike Esox lucius in three north-central Minnesota lakes with either acoustic telemetry or archival tags. Individual Northern Pike demonstrated flexibility in depths used within a season and between years. The fish had some tolerance for low levels of dissolved oxygen (<3 mg/L), but depth selection was generally constrained by low dissolved oxygen in summer and winter. The fish more fully exploited all available depths during winter and thermal turnover periods. During July and August, large Northern Pike tended to follow the thermocline into cooler water as upper water layers warmed. Selection ratios indicated that large Northern Pike preferred water temperatures of 16–21°C during August when temperatures up to 28°C were available. In two lakes providing dense overhead cover from water lilies in shallow water, small Northern Pike used warmer, shallower water compared with large fish during summer. In a third lake providing no such cover, small fish were more often in deeper, cooler water. For small Northern Pike, temperature seemed to be a secondary habitat consideration behind the presence of shallow vegetated cover. This study provided detailed temperature selection information that will be useful when considering temperature as an ecological resource for different sizes of Northern Pike.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEsox lucius 3aacoustics 3adissolved oxygen 3afish 3ahabitats 3alakes 3asummer 3atelemetry 3awater lilies 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aMinnesota1 aCarlson, Andrew J.1 aCarlson, Bruce M.1 aHudson, Dallas1 aStaples, David F.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 142, no. 6 p.1629-1639dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.8224223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012200162300001400284520194100298592002802239650001002267650002802277650001502305650002102320650001202341650001802353650001502371650002602386650003002412650000902442650001702451650001002468651001802478700001302496700002202509773010702531856007302638852000902711655001202720IND60517873020221120150230.0160405e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051787302DNAL7 a10.1111/wbm.120922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkelton, Joshua J.10aWaterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) control under drought stress with 2,4‐dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and glyphosate  ap. 34-41.  aWaterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) is a common and troublesome weed in cropping systems throughout the United States. With the potential for future periods of low rainfall or drought, the need for improved weed control under drought stress is necessary. Drought stress typically reduces herbicide efficacy by reducing the foliar uptake of herbicides and their translocation. The objectives of this research were to determine the efficacy of 2,4‐dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4‐D) and glyphosate, applied alone or when tank‐mixed, on waterhemp under varying levels of drought stress, the effect of the timing of drought stress in relation to herbicide application and the absorption and translocation of each herbicide in drought‐stressed waterhemp. At reduced herbicide rates, 2,4‐D had a greater level of control of waterhemp under drought stress, compared to glyphosate. The level of herbicide efficacy was lower when the amount of water that was applied to the plants was reduced. The level of waterhemp control was greatest when drought stress occurred before the herbicide application and when the plants were watered to saturation after the application, compared to when drought stress occurred after the herbicide application or restricted watering levels occurred throughout the entire study. Glyphosate absorption and translocation were reduced in the drought‐stressed plants, but 2,4‐D absorption and translocation were not altered. The absence of a reduction in 2,4‐D translocation in the drought‐stressed weeds has not been previously reported. Applying herbicides prior to a rainfall event could increase the weed control level, even if the weed is stressed. Determining how and why 2,4‐D absorption and translocation levels, compared to those of glyphosate, are unaffected by drought stress in waterhemp can aid in improving the control of drought‐stressed weeds with other postemergence herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aAmaranthus tuberculatus 3aabsorption 3acropping systems 3adrought 3afoliar uptake 3aglyphosate 3apesticide application 3apostemergent weed control 3arain 3awater stress 3aweeds 3aUnited States1 aMa, Rong1 aRiechers, Dean E.0 tWeed biology and management.g2016 Mar., v. 16, no. 1 p.34-41dBlackwell Science Asiax1444-61627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wbm.120923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245013500180300001800315520081700333592002801150596003401178596007801212650002401290650002501314650001701339650001101356650004301367650001101410650002501421650001601446650001101462650002701473650001301500653002801513653004101541653001601582653002501598700001701623700002201640700002101662773012501683856008501808852000901893655001201902IND60595387620221116234551.0180602e20180519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059538762DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2017.13260402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenabderrahmane, Wassila10aMatrix solid-phase dispersion as a tool for phytochemical and bioactivities characterisation: Crataegus oxyacantha L._A case study  ap. 1220-1223.  aThe use of a matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) process to extract polyphenols from hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha L.) a deciduous shrub with an expected rich phytochemical profile, has been evaluated.

The extracts were analysed by HPLC-DAD for the accurate identification of the major bioactive polyphenols, some of which have never been described for this species. MSPD has proven to be a good alternative to the classic methods of obtaining natural extracts, fast and with low consumption of organic solvents, therefore, environmentally friendly.

This is mainly due to the time it takes for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) to grow and lack of sensitivity of culture. Viable MAP cells can be detected in the blood of cattle suffering from Johne’s disease within 48 h using peptide-mediated magnetic separation (PMMS) followed by bacteriophage amplification. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the first detection of MAP in the blood of experimentally exposed cattle using the PMMS-bacteriophage assay and to compare these results with the immune response of the animal based on serum ELISA and shedding of MAP by faecal culture. RESULTS: Using the PMMS-phage assay, seven out of the 19 (37 %) MAP-exposed animals that were tested were positive for viable MAP cells although very low numbers of MAP were detected. Two of these animals were positive by faecal culture and one was positive by serum ELISA. There was no correlation between PMMS-phage assay results and the faecal and serum ELISA results. None of the control animals (10) were positive for MAP using any of the four detection methods. Investigations carried out into the efficiency of the assay; found that the PMMS step was the limiting factor reducing the sensitivity of the phage assay. A modified method using the phage assay directly on isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (without PMMS) was found to be superior to the PMMS isolation step. CONCLUSIONS: This proof of concept study has shown that viable MAP cells are present in the blood of MAP-exposed cattle prior to the onset of clinical signs. Although only one time point was tested, the ability to detect viable MAP in the blood of subclinically infected animals by the rapid phage-based method has the potential to increase the understanding of the pathogenesis of Johne’s disease progression by warranting further research on the presence of MAP in blood.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3abacteremia 3abacteriophages 3ablood serum 3acattle 3adisease course 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmune response 3amagnetic separation 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apathogenesis1 aHuxley, Jonathan N.1 aPlain, Karren M.1 aBegg, Douglas J.1 ade Silva, Kumudika1 aPurdie, Auriol C.1 aWhittington, Richard J.1 aRees, Catherine E.

E2441-E2446.  aSpices, including black pepper, are a source of microbial contamination and have been linked to outbreaks of salmonellosis when added to products that undergo no further processing. Traditional thermal processing employed to reduce microbial contamination can lead to losses of heat‐sensitive compounds. Thus, alternative processes such as atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) are desirable. The purpose of this research was to determine the efficacy of APP in the destruction of Salmonella inoculated on the surface of peppercorns. Secondarily, we examined the effect of storage on the subsequent inactivation of Salmonella on the surfaces of black peppercorns by APP. Black peppercorns inoculated with a cocktail of Salmonella enterica serotypes Oranienburg, Tennessee, Anatum, and Enteritidis were stored at 25 °C, 33% relative humidity (RH); 25 °C, 97% RH; and, 37 °C, 33% RH for 10 d and additionally at 25 °C, 33% RH for 1 and 30 d then treated with APP. Results showed that Salmonella populations decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with respect to the treatment time, but where not related to previous storage conditions (P > 0.05). Approximately a 4.5‐ to 5.5‐log₁₀reduction in population was achieved after 60 to 80 s treatment. A combination of treatments, storage and 80 s of plasma, may achieve a total reduction on the order of 7‐log₁₀CFU/g. These findings support the potential of APP to decontaminate Salmonella on the surfaces of black peppercorns and other dry foods and illustrate that a multiple hurdle approach may prove effective for achieving significant reductions of Salmonella in many low‐moisture foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella enterica 3aatmospheric pressure 3ablack pepper 3adried foods 3afood science 3aheat treatment 3amicrobial contamination 3arelative humidity 3asalmonellosis 3aserotypes 3astorage conditions1 aAnderson, Nathan M.1 aKeller, Susanne0 tJournal of food science.g2014 Dec., v. 79, no. 12 p.E2441-E2446dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.126963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245009900161300001400260520117900274592002801453650001401481650001201495650002101507650002201528650001901550650002501569650000901594650002701603651001201630653001401642653001801656653003401674653003101708653002101739653001601760700001701776700001901793700002401812773007601836856007901912852000901991655001202000IND60573141020221116143725.0170721e20170404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057314102DNAL7 a10.1515/helia-2017-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuca, Maria10aMolecular Characterization of Broomrape Populations from Republic of Moldova using SSR Markers  ap. 47-59.  aThe genetic diversity study of 39 broomrape populations from the Republic of Moldova was performed using 12 highly polymorphic SSR primer pairs, which shown the high level of polymorphism (average PIC value 0.57). We found that some of the SSR primers (Ocum-59 and Ocum-108) produced polymorphic bands suitable for discrimination between the studied populations. The diversity analysis within broomrape populations revealed a higher number of detected alleles and heterozygous loci in the accessions from the Southern region when compared to the Northern and Central ones. The average PIC values for the Northern, Central and Southern accessions ranged from 0.43, 0.48 to 0.56, respectively. Some populations from the Southern region (especially, Carabetovca, Alexanderfeld, Stefan-Voda and Slobozia Mare) have shown the major differences in the profiles obtained and presented the high level of genetic variability. The dendrogram based on genetic distance divided the 39 broomrape accessions into twelve clusters. High variability of O. cumana populations at molecular level was observed, which could be useful for further genetic studies and resistance-breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrobanche 3aalleles 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahybridization probes 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aMoldova 0abroomrape 0agenetic study 0aintrapopulational variability 0amolecular characterization 0aOrobanche cumana 0aSSR markers1 aPort, Angela1 aBoicu, Adriana1 aȘestacova, Tatiana0 tHelia.g2017 Apr. 4, v. 40, no. 66 p.47-59dDe Gruyterx2197-04837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helia-2017-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002500191245005800216300001400274506007600288520094500364592002801309506003701337650002501374650001601399650002601415650001701441650001901458650002401477650002101501650002001522650002201542650001201564650001101576650001901587650001501606650002201621650001201643650003701655700002501692773011701717856008401834852000901918655001201927IND60090107520221207130547.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009010752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.06.0062doi7 aPMC29627722pmcid7 a205472492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepesheva, Galina I.10aStructural basis for conservation in the CYP51 family  ap. 88-93.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSterol 14α-demethylases (14DM) comprise the CYP51 cytochrome P450 genome family. The 14DM reaction is essential for the biosynthesis of sterols which are necessary for production of cellular membranes. This is the most widely distributed P450, being present in all biological kingdoms. From one kingdom to another the primary amino acid sequence identity usually ranges between 30 and 20%. In this minireview we describe the conservation of specific amino acids and the various CYP51 orthologs and indicate the roles that they may play in the structure/function of this monooxygenase. The prediction of the roles of different amino acids in 14DM is based on high resolution tertiary structures of these enzymes which set the stage for detailed understanding of the 14α-demethylase reaction and its selective, phyla-specific inhibition which is crucial for the design of potent inhibitors for treatment of infection by pathogenic microbes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aanti-infective agents 3abiosynthesis 3acell membranes 3aconserved sequences 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzymes 3agenome 3amicroorganisms 3aprediction 3asequence analysis 3asterols 3astructure-activity relationships1 aWaterman, Michael R.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Jan., v. 1814, no. 1 p.88-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245016100171520214500332592002802477650002402505650002502529650001202554650001202566650002002578650002502598650001802623650002302641650001102664650001102675650001702686650000902703650002202712650000902734650001202743650001302755650002502768650002902793653001202822653001002834653002102844653001702865653001602882653000802898653000902906653000902915653000802924653000702932653000802939653000802947653000802955653000902963653000802972653000702980653001002987653001102997653001103008700001603019700001803035700002303053700002203076700002003098700002803118773011503146856008203261852000903343655001203352IND60766062920221118043010.0220228e20220510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076606292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2022.1150552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobani, Yahya Hasan10aGastroprotective effect of low dose Eugenol in experimental rats against ethanol induced toxicity: Involvement of antiinflammatory and antioxidant mechanism  aSyzygium aromaticum L. volatile oil (clove oil) has been traditionally used for various stomach disorders including inflammatory conditions. Eugenol is the major constituent present in the volatile oil, and it has been established as a gastroprotective agent through many published studies, but the exact and complete mechanism of ulcer protection is not delineated yet. Moreover, it plays precisely the opposite effect in higher dose in antiulcer properties with worsening the ulcer at a higher dose. This study aims to carry out the prophylactic cytoprotective effect of eugenol with single low doses and explore the probable interrelated underlying transcriptional and translational level mechanism of cytoprotection such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, mucous generation in rats using ethanol-induced ulcer model. Rats were administered with different doses of eugenol before ethanol intragastrically. The effects of the eugenol on mucous production, Nitric oxide generation, PGE2 synthesis, lipid peroxidation were recorded together with cytokines measurement in the blood. TNF-α and IL-6, two key cytokines, were also studied in specific. In addition, studies on the immunohistochemical and gene expression of HSP70 and iNOS indicators have been conducted. According to our findings, Eugenol substantially reduced the ulcer index and completely protected the mucosa from lesions. By restoring the lowered GSH and NP-SH levels, the protective effect of the eugenol was found to be augmented at both doses. This finding has corresponded to an increase in MDA, which was lowered by ethanol administration. Pre-treatment with eugenol on the ethanol-induced ulcer reduced the plasma NO levels and increased PGE2 along with a decreased TNF-α and IL-6 concentration. Additionally, significant transcriptional and translational upregulation of HSP70 and downregulation of iNOS were detected in the eugenol-treated rat stomach tissue. Our findings demonstrated that eugenol had a considerable gastroprotective impact at low doses, which could be attributed to its ability to regulate inflammatory reactions and antioxidant capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3aantioxidant activity 3aethanol 3aeugenol 3agene expression 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainterleukin-6 3alipid peroxidation 3amodels 3amucosa 3anitric oxide 3aoils 3aprotective effect 3arats 3astomach 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription (genetics) 0aEugenol 0aUlcer 0aGastroprotection 0aInflammation 0aAntioxidant 0aDAB 0aDTNB 0aEDTA 0aGAE 0aGp 0aGSH 0aH&E 0aHRP 0aIL-6 0aMDA 0aNO 0aNP-SH 0aRT-PCR 0aTNF-α1 aMohan, Syam1 aShaheen, Emad1 aAbdelhaleem, Aymen1 aFaruque Ahmad, Md1 aBhatia, Saurabh1 aAbou-Elhamd, Alaa Sayed0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2022 May 10, v. 289 p.115055-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2022.1150553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01770naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245007500162300001600237520071200253592002800965650001200993650001601005650001201021650001301033650001101046650001801057651001101075653002001086653002201106653001401128653001101142700002001153700001801173773011801191856007801309852000901387655001201396IND60127025720221117190830.0151110e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012702572DNAL7 a10.1639/079.030.04062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrodo, Irwin M.10aNotes on the Lichens Physcia aipolia and P. alnophila in North America  ap. 110-119.  aThe morphological and chemical characteristics of Physcia aipolia and P. alnophila are compared, and a distribution map for northern North America is presented.

M2485-M2490.  aThe consumption of trans fatty acids (TFAs) increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and coronary heart disease in human, and there are no effective ways to remove TFAs after consumption. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of elaidic acid on bacterial growth, cell surface hydrophobicity of lactobacilli, and metabolism of elaidic acid by lactobacilli. Lactobacilli were inoculated in MRS broth containing 0, 100, 200, and 500 mg/L of elaidic acid. Viable cell counts of lactobacilli were enumerated, concentrations of elaidic acid were determined, and cell surface hydrophobicity of lactobacilli was measured. The results showed that the growth of lactobacilli was significantly inhibited by 500 mg/L of elaidic acid, however, a cell count of 8.50 log₁₀CFU/mL was still reached for tested lactobacilli after 24‐h incubation. In particular, a reduction of elaidic acid was found for tested lactobacilli after 24‐h incubation as compared to its initial concentration of 200 mg/L. However, cell surface hydrophobicity showed no correlations with the metabolism of elaidic acid by lactobacilli. Moreover, elaidic acid was able to influence cell surface hydrophobicity, and the decrease in hydrophobicity was more obvious in Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus casei compared with that in other tested lactobacilli. This study suggests that elaidic acid could change physiochemical surface properties of lactobacilli and the lactobacilli have the potential to reduce TFAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3acoronary disease 3aelaidic acid 3afood science 3ahuman diseases 3ahydrophobicity 3ametabolism 3amicrobial growth 3arisk1 aShah, Nagendra P.0 tJournal of food science.g2014 Dec., v. 79, no. 12 p.M2485-M2490dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.126953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245008800160300001600248520106400264592002801328650000801356650002001364650000701384650001801391650001601409650002601425653002601451653001501477653002001492653002901512700002001541773011301561856007701674852000901751655001201760IND60516459720221119065237.0160325e20150420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051645972DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2014-08442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Gwy-Am10aReactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts after exposure to low-pressure UV irradiation  ap. 513-516.  aIn this study, we determined the repair capabilities of Giardia lamblia cysts when they were exposed to low-pressure (LP) UV and then 4 different repair conditions. A UV collimated beam apparatus was used to expose shallow suspensions of G.lamblia cysts in buffered reagent water (PBS, pH 7.2) to various doses of LP UV irradiation. After UV irradiation, samples were exposed to 4 repair conditions (light and dark repair conditions with 2 temperatures (25 °C and 37 °C) for each condition). The inactivation of G.lamblia cysts by LP UV was very extensive (∼5 log₁₀) even with a low dose of LP UV (1 mJ/cm²). More importantly, there was significant restoration of infectivity in G.lamblia cysts when they were exposed to a low dose of LP UV and then to all the repair conditions tested. Overall, the results of this study indicate that G.lamblia cysts do have the ability to repair their UV-damaged DNA when they are exposed to low doses of LP UV irradiation. This is the first study to report the presence of repair in UV-irradiated G.lamblia cysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGiardia lamblia 3apH 3apathogenicity 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 0aGiardia lamblia cysts 0aDNA repair 0alow pressure UV 0agerbil infectivity assay1 aLinden, Karl G.0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2015 Apr. 20, v. 61, no. 7 p.513-516dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2014-08443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245008500170500001400255520150500269592002801774650001501802650003101817650001801848650001001866650001701876650001201893650001101905650002301916650001501939650001401954650001701968650000901985650001901994650001202013650002202025650002102047700002902068700001702097700002302114700001902137700002202156773012002178856007502298852000902373655001202382IND60729172620221121025531.0210228e20210207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072917262DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110204282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández, Mᵃ  Carmen10aBehavioral Responses of Wild Rodents to Owl Calls in an Austral Temperate Forest  aNAL-light  aEcologically based rodent management strategies are arising as a sustainable approach to rodent control, allowing us to preserve biodiversity while safeguarding human economic activities. Despite predator signals being known to generally repel rodents, few field-based studies have compared the behavioral effects of several predators on different prey species, especially in Neotropical ecosystems. Here, we used camera traps to study the behavior of rodent species native to the Chilean temperate forest (Abrothrix spp., long-tailed pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) and an introduced rodent (black rat Rattus rattus). Using playbacks of raptor calls, we experimentally exposed rodents to three predation risk treatments: austral pygmy owl calls (Glaucidium nana), rufous-legged owl calls (Strix rufipes) and a control treatment (absence of owl calls). We evaluated the effects of the treatments on the time allocated to three behaviors: feeding time, locomotor activity and vigilance. Moonlight and vegetation cover were also considered in the analyses, as they can modify perceived predation risk. Results showed that predator calls and environmental factors modified prey behavior depending not only on the predator species, but also on the rodent species. Consequently, owl playbacks could be regarded as a promising rodent control tool, knowing that future studies would be critical to deeply understand differences between species in order to select the most effective predator cues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aOligoryzomys longicaudatus 3aRattus rattus 3aStrix 3abiodiversity 3acameras 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3alocomotion 3apredation 3aprey species 3arisk 3arodent control 3arodents 3atemperate forests 3avegetation cover1 aJara-Stapfer, Denise  M.1 aMuñoz, Ana 1 aBonacic, Cristian 1 aBarja, Isabel 1 aRubio, André  V.0 tAnimals.g2021 Feb. 07, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110204283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264520156900280592002801849650001101877650001401888650002001902650002901922650001801951650002401969650002401993650001502017650001202032650001202044650001202056651002202068651002502090651002902115651001302144700002102157700001802178773010602196856004802302852000902350655001202359IND50061030020221118234117.0130725e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006103002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-012-0201-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaneiro, João10aTowards the development of an operational tool for oil spills management in the Algarve coast  ap. 449-460.  aPortugal is strongly vulnerable to sea hazards due to intense vessel traffic and sea conditions. The southwest region off the Iberian Peninsula lies in the main route from the Mediterranean and Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Europe, causing a ship concentration in a narrow band off Cape São Vicente. Tankers represent a significant part of the vessel traffic and the occurrence of oil spills cannot be disregarded. Cape São Vicente region is part of a Natural Park with 110 Km of coastline, integrated in the European Natura 2000 network and its socio-economic context is closely related with sea resources exploitation, particularly fishing and tourism. Recognizing the importance of accurate information systems for the decision making process in an oil spill situation, this work presents the development of an integrated tool to support the process in the Algarve coast. The system relies in a regional operational mathematical model based on the MOHID modelling system. The system core is composed by three models (3D hydrodynamics, wave and Lagrangian transport) all linked in the same system and exchanging information in real time. Oil advection and weathering processes are coupled to the Lagragian transport model. The overall operational system includes external operational data products as inputs, to ensure a successful validation of the results. The system is linked to stakeholders and response authorities using a geographic referenced database based on Mapserver technology that will include relevant information for oil spill management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adatabases 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3ahydrodynamics 3ainformation systems 3amathematical models 3aoil spills 3atankers 3atourism 3atraffic 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMediterranean region 3aNorthern European region 3aPortugal1 aMartins, Flavio,1 aRelvas, Paulo0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2012 Dec., v. 16, no. 4 p.449-460dSpringer-Verlagx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-012-0201-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245014600166506010400312506007600416520162700492592002802119506003702147650002002184650001102204650001602215650001102231650002102242650001702263650002002280651001502300653003902315653001802354653002202372653002202394700001502416700001302431700001302444773009802457856008702555852000902642655001202651IND60793916120221207121311.0220929e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079391612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1199642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Tong12aA hybrid deep learning framework integrating feature selection and transfer learning for multi-step global horizontal irradiation forecasting  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe randomness and volatility of solar irradiance pose a challenge to efficient solar energy development and utilization across the world, which increases the necessity of developing an efficient solar irradiance forecasting model. However, previous studies rarely emphasized the importance of transfer learning and nonlinear feature selection, especially for the studies associated with newly-built photovoltaic plants. Moreover, multi-step ahead forecasting research is limited, despite its significance to dispatching efficiency improvement of photovoltaic system. Aiming to address the research gaps, a novel hybrid deep learning framework (HDLF), consisting of the modules of feature selection, feature convolution, forecasting, self-attention, transfer learning, performance evaluation, and performance analysis, is newly proposed in this paper to perform multi-step ahead solar irradiation forecasting. Specifically, the HDLF is pre-trained based on the studied datasets of global horizontal irradiation in the source domains, and the abstract information obtained from pre-training is transferred to the HDLF of the target domain to enhance its performance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed HDLF, two simulation experiments are carried out based on the datasets from California, USA, with a resolution of 1 h. The corresponding experimental results from the modules of performance evaluation and performance analysis indicate that the maximum improvements in mean absolute error reach 80.19% and 35.67% in two experiments, respectively, thereby confirming the superiority and feasibility of the HDLF.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3aenergy 3airradiation 3amodels 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aCalifornia 0aMulti-step irradiation forecasting 0aDeep learning 0aTransfer learning 0aFeature Selection1 aLi, Jinkai1 aWei, Wei1 aYue, Hui0 tApplied energy.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 326 p.119964-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1199643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01774naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147242003800165245004600203300001600249520084000265592002801105650001701133650002201150650001601172650001701188700001501205700001901220700001401239773011701253856008101370852000901451655001201460IND60437421720221122235717.0151022e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6043742172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-006-0124-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasenstab, A.10aUltraschallecho-Messungen an Holz10aUltrasonic echo technique applied to wood  ap. 475-481.  aIn practice, decay may present a big problem for timber constructions.

Tests were made by the Federal Institution for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) and the Technical University of Berlin to detect back walls and covered cavities using ultrasonic echo technique where transmitter and receiver are coupled to the same surface of the specimen. Thus a large variety of applications is possible. Two cylindrical longitudinal wave transducers were used in pulse echo technique and coupled with various coupling media. The ultrasonic centre frequency for pulse excitation was optimised to 100 kHz. Results were represented and evaluated as B-scans. In conclusion, the back walls of specimen without defects can be clearly recognized and cavities could be detected very well.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecayed wood 3amaterials testing 3aultrasonics 3awood defects1 aKrause, M.1 aHillemeier, B.1 aRieck, C.0 tEuropean journal of wood and wood products.g2006 Dec., v. 64, no. 6 p.475-481dSpringer-Verlagx0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-006-0124-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03761naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002900132024001100161040001800172100002200190245012200212300001600334506017300350520198100523650001902504650002302523650002702546650001602573650001202589650001502601650001802616650001302634650001402647650002302661650002802684650002102712650002202733650001702755650001902772650001002791650001102801651001502812700001902827700002102846773009702867856011202964856004203076956009503118961000903213852000903222655001203231IND60006020820221214230855.0150116e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000602082DNAL7 a2972762aris7 a10113/602082hdl7 a10.3368/er.32.4.3882doi8 ans6310  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca, Carolina10aPatterns of population differentiation in early traits of development in Elymus glaucus: Implications for restoration  ap. 388-395.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aRestoration of native plant communities is a foundational practice in restoration ecology, but land managers and biologists don’t often take into account the role of intraspecific variation in establishment of restoration seedings. Although ecologists have known for decades that lack of adaptation to local conditions may interfere with the success of ecological restoration, there is little information about the extent to which common restoration species demonstrate adaptive divergence among populations. If adaptive divergence occurs for early establishment, knowing which populations have better germination and early growth can maximize restoration performance. Restoring large parcels of California grassland requires perennial grass establishment in both riparian and upland habitats. To what degree does local adaptation to these two habitats influence early growth traits in commonly used restoration species? In this study, we compared time to germination and early growth rate of riparian, upland and commercial seed sources of Elymus glaucus under contrasting water regimes in a controlled environment. In this study, two hypotheses were tested: 1) plants grown from commercial seeds will outperform plants grown from locally-collected seeds under controlled conditions; and 2) plants will demonstrate local adaptation by high performance of riparian sources under high water treatments and high performance of upland sources under low water treatments. We saw no evidence of local adaptation but did observe population differentiation. Time to germination was significantly shorter for upland seeds compared to riparian or commercial seeds. In addition, the rate of shoot growth for upland plants was significantly higher than riparian or commercial plants. Understanding patterns of differentiation among seed sources, particularly their influence on early establishment will allow us to develop better seed sourcing for more successful restoration seedings. 3aElymus glaucus 3aadaptive radiation 3aecological restoration 3agermination 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrowth traits 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3aintraspecific variation 3aplant adaptation 3aplant communities 3aplant growth 3ariparian areas 3aseeds 3ashoots 3aCalifornia1 aEspeland, Erin1 aBaxter, James W.0 tEcological Restoration.g2014 Dec. 1, v. 32, no. 4 p.388-395wJournal:17913x1522-47407nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/602083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3368/er.32.4.388  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Espeland_297276.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011200170300001600282520177200298592002802070650001502098650001302113650001102126650002202137650001402159650001502173650001302188650001302201650002002214650001302234650000902247650001502256653002302271653000902294653002202303653001102325653001502336653002002351700001302371700001802384700005602402700001602458700002002474700001302494773010602507856008702613852000902700655001202709IND60531548020221118002234.0170713e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053154802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yujuan10aElectrocoagulation mechanism of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) on a zinc anode: Influence of cathodes and anions  ap. 542-550.  aBatch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of cathode materials and anions (Cl−, SO42−, NO3−, and CO32−/HCO3−) on perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) removal in electrocoagulation process using zinc anode. The results indicated that the hydroxide flocs generated in-situ in the electrocoagulation process using the stainless steel rod as cathode were more effective than those using aluminum rod as cathode for the removal of PFOA after 20min of electrocoagulation at a current density of 0.5mAcm−2. Hydroxide flocs generated in-situ in the electrocoagulation in the presence of Cl−/NO3− could effectively remove PFOA from aqueous solution with the removal ratios of 99.7%/98.1% and 98.9%/97.3% using stainless steel rod and aluminum rod as cathode, respectively. However, the PFOA removal ratios were 96.2%/4.1% and 7.4%/4.6% using stainless steel rod and aluminum rod as cathode, respectively, in the presence of SO42− and CO32−/HCO3−. The different removal ratios of PFOA during the electrocoagulation process were primarily due to the fact that the hydroxide flocs generated in-situ were different in the presence of diverse cathodes and anions. We firstly demonstrated that Zn0.70Al0.30(OH)2(CO3)0.15·xH2O and ZnO generated in-situ in the electrocoagulation process (except for CO32−/HCO3−) using zinc anode and aluminum/stainless steel rod cathode governed the sorption of PFOA. The adsorbent hydroxide flocs in-situ generated in the presence of Cl− could effectively remove PFOA from aqueous solution containing CO32−/HCO3− anion at the initial hydroxide flocs concentration of 2000mgL−1. These results provided an effective and alternative method to remove PFOA from aqueous solution containing CO32−/HCO3− anion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aaluminum 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3achlorides 3aelectrodes 3anitrates 3asorption 3astainless steel 3asulfates 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aElectrocoagulation 0aPFOA 0aCathode materials 0aAnions 0aMechanisms 0aHydroxide flocs1 aLin, Hui1 aJin, Fangyuan1 aNiu, Junfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2592-31031 aZhao, Jinbo1 aBi, Y.q(Ying),1 aLi, Ying0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 July 01, v. 557-558 p.542-550dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245013600201300002000337520137600357592002801733596009801761596009501859596009301954650001602047650000902063650001102072650001302083650001902096650001902115650003202134650001402166650002402180653002102204653002302225653001702248653002302265653001502288653002702303700001702330700005202347700005502399700005302454700001102507700001802518700005702536700001702593700001402610773014202624856007902766852000902845655001202854IND60772671120221118031600.0220407e20220323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077267112DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c004892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jueying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3450-708310aHigh-Sensitivity and Environmentally Friendly Humidity Sensors Deposited with Recyclable Green Microspheres for Wireless Monitoring  ap. 15608-15622.  aThe reliable, high-sensitive, wireless, and affordable requirements for humidity sensors are needed in high-precision measurement fields. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based on the piezoelectric effect can accurately detect the mass changes at the nanogram level. However, water-capture materials deposited on the surface of QCM generally show disadvantages in either cost, sensitivity, or recyclability. Herein, novel QCM-based humidity sensors (NQHSs) are developed by uniformly depositing green microspheres (GMs) of natural polymers prepared by the chemical synthesis of the emulsification/inner gel method on QCM as humidity-sensitive materials. The NQHSs demonstrate high accuracy and sensitivity (27.1 Hz/% RH) owing to the various hydrophilic groups and porous nano-3D deposition structure. Compared with the devices deposited with a smooth film, the frequency of the NQHSs shows almost no changes during the cyclic test and exhibits long-term stability. The NQHSs have been successfully applied to non-contact sensing human activities and remote real-time humidity monitoring via Bluetooth transmission. In addition, the deposited humidity-sensitive GMs and QCM substrate are fully recycled and reused (72% of the original value). This work has provided an innovative idea to construct environmental-friendly, high-sensitivity, and wireless humidity sensors.  aPublisher supplied data  a62075012cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  aCYXC2109cBeijing Chaoyang District Collaborative Innovation Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aemulsifying 3agels 3ahumans 3ahumidity 3ahydrophilicity 3amicroparticles 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asynthesis 3awireless technology 0ahumidity sensors 0agreen microspheres 0adrop casting 0aRaman spectroscopy 0arecyclable 0aBluetooth transmission1 aFeng, Liying1 aChen, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3773-45481 aFeng, Lihui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9171-89981 aLu, Jihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4780-16951 aDu, Le1 aGuo, Junqiang1 aCheng, Zhekun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1414-91511 aShi, Zhongyu1 aZhao, Lin0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Mar. 23, v. 14, no. 13 p.15608-15622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c004893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245007600163520144900239592002801688650001401716650001001730650002501740650000901765650002401774650001201798650002201810650001301832650002401845653003601869653002301905653002801928653002301956653003501979653002002014653000902034700001702043700002202060700001902082700001502101700003102116773010902147856007802256852000902334655001202343IND60480676220221120185448.0160129e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048067622DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.1114-114R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAulmann, Maria10aDevelopment and Evaluation of two Canine Low-Fidelity Simulation Models  aTwo self-made low-fidelity models for simulation of canine intubation and canine female urinary catheterization were developed and evaluated. We used a study design that compares acquired skills of two intervention groups and one control group in a practical examination. Fifty-eight second-year veterinary medicine students received a theoretical introduction to intubation and were randomly divided into three groups. Group I (high-fidelity) was then trained on a commercially available Intubation Training Manikin (item #2006, Veteffects), group II (low-fidelity) was trained on our low-fidelity model, and group III (text) read a text describing intubation of the dog. Forty-seven fifth-year veterinary medicine students followed the same procedure for training urinary catheterization using the commercially available Female Urinary Catheter Training Manikin (Paws 2 Claws), our self-made model, and text. Outcomes were assessed in a practical examination on a cadaver using an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) checklist. Considering a value of <i>p</i>≤.05 significant, intervention groups performed significantly better than the text groups. Group I (high-fidelity) and group II (low-fidelity) showed no significant differences (<i>p</i>≤.684, intubation; <i>p</i>≤.901, urinary catheterization). We thereby conclude that low-fidelity models can be as effective as high-fidelity models for clinical skills training.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatheters 3aclaws 3aclinical examination 3adogs 3aexperimental design 3afemales 3asimulation models 3astudents 3aveterinary medicine 0aevaluation of simulation models 0asimulation manikin 0alow-fidelity simulation 0alow-fidelity model 0adeveloping low-fidelity models 0aclinical skills 0aOSCE1 aMärz, Maren1 aBurgener, Iwan A.1 aAlef, Michaele1 aOtto, Sven1 aMülling, Christoph K.

Total soluble solids (TSS) is a major quality attribute of loquat fruit and detecting changes in its content can be used to monitor the ripening and postharvest senescence of loquat fruit. The refractometer method cannot provide detailed TSS distribution within loquat flesh, because the analysis focuses on measuring the mean TSS of only a flesh cube, which is used to make juice for the refractometer measurement. In this study, hyperspectral imaging was used to measure and visualize internal TSS distribution within loquat fruit. Loquat fruits with different TSS contents were selected and cut at different cross sections for imaging. Different calibration and wavelength selection algorithms were applied and compared. The uninformative variable elimination by partial least square regression model with preprocessing from spectral set I (468–1026 nm) was identified as the best model for the TSS determination of loquat flesh, which had a high prediction ability with a correlation coefficient of 0.960 and residual predictive deviation of 3.513. On the basis of the best model, the quantitative TSS distribution at different cross sections inside loquat fruit was visualized at pixel level. The results showed that hyperspectral imaging is a feasible way of visualizing the spatial changes of TSS distribution inside loquat fruit at pixel level, which would be helpful to understand the detailed TSS change inside postharvest loquat fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acorrelation 3afeasibility studies 3afruits 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3ajuices 3aleast squares 3aloquats 3amodels 3aplanting 3aprediction 3arefractive index 3aripening 3atotal soluble solids 3awavelengths1 aNie, Yating1 aWu, Di1 aHe, Yong1 aChen, Kunsong0 tFood analytical methods.g2017 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.287-297dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-016-0581-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146242008300166245008300249300001200332500002000344520110400364592002801468650002401496650002201520650001001542650001301552650002101565650001901586650001101605773010101616856008001717852000901797655001201806IND60588371320190311000000.0180621s1983    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058837132DNAL7 a10.1002/star.198303501022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemmersbach, K.10aPrinciples of Heat‐Power Co‐Generation in Relation to Production of Starch10aPrinzipien der Dampf‐Kraft‐Koppelung am Beispiel der Stärke‐Herstellung  ap. 1-4.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHeat‐power co‐generation allows the most economic use of primary fuels with minimal
      disturbance of the environment. Co‐generation systems are 80–90% energy efficient compared to
      only 30–40% for power generation only. In many countries co‐generation systems are being
      subsidized by the state in order to encourage the more efficient use and hence conservation of
      primary energy. The structure of the heat‐power demand in the starch industry is suited to
      heat‐power co‐generation. It is possible to lower production cost to energy savings gained by
      a one‐time investment in heat‐power co‐generation. Heat‐power co‐generation technology is well
      known, and a number of alternative systems is available, which can be adapted for any
      particular energy demand. Further development of the technologies involved in co‐generation
      with respect to more efficient utilization of fuel, reduction of environmental problems, and
      utilization of fuels high in non‐combustible material is being carried out
      world‐wide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3afuels 3aindustry 3apower generation 3aprimary energy 3astarch0 tStärke =.g1983, v. 35, no. 1 p.1-4dWILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbHwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.198303501023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013500170520144700305592002801752650001301780650001701793650002401810650001601834650001101850650001701861650001501878650001501893653003201908653005301940653002901993653004402022700002002066700001802086700001202104700001802116700001802134700002002152700001902172773009802191856008702289852000902376655001202385IND60793916520221120212852.0221004e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079391652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1199702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Mingkang10aDouble-blade structured triboelectric–electromagnetic hybrid generator with aerodynamic enhancement for breeze energy harvesting  aWind energy is a form of renewable energy with excellent development prospects. However, low-speed wind energy has not been effectively explored and utilized. To this end, a double-blade structured triboelectric–electromagnetic hybrid generator (DB-TEHG) is designed in this paper, which can efficiently harvest breeze energy by using double-blade structured design to improve the aerodynamic performance of the device. The improved blade structures directly drive the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic generator (EMG) without requiring additional transmission systems. The blade parameters are simulated and optimized using computational fluid dynamics to enhance the wind energy harvesting capability of the device. The minimum starting wind speed of DB-TEHG is found to be 2 m/s. The output performance of a single TENG unit is 910 V, 45 μA, 280 nC, and the peak power is 4 mW, and that of the EMG is 236 V, 24.2 mA, and a peak power of 0.5 W, when the wind speed is 5 m/s. It is also found that at this wind speed the DB-TEHG can convert wind energy into electricity output with an efficiency of 20.88%. The demonstration results prove that the proposed DB-TEHG can power a wireless thermometer by harvesting outdoor natural wind energy. This paper presents the application potential of DB-TEHG in the Internet of Things and also provides a novel solution to harvest breeze energy by combining TENGs and EMG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aaerodynamics 3aelectric generators 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3athermometers 3awind power 3awind speed 0aTriboelectric nanogenerator 0aTriboelectric–electromagnetic hybrid generator 0aBreeze energy harvesting 0aComputational fluid dynamics simulation1 aZhang, Jiacheng1 aWang, Zhaohui1 aYu, Xin1 aZhang, Yuejun1 aZhu, Jianyang1 aWang, Zhong Lin1 aCheng, Tinghai0 tApplied energy.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 326 p.119970-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1199703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010300170300001600273520122500289536015901514592002801673596001801701650002201719650001801741650001101759650001001770650001501780650002501795650002001820650001101840650001301851650001101864650001301875650002601888650001401914650002301928650000901951650001601960650001801976650001901994650001202013650001602025651001302041653001802054653002502072653001802097653001602115700001502131700001802146700001802164700001902182700002802201700001702229700002002246700002002266773011402286856008602400852000902486655001202495IND60711963320221116154018.0210101e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071196332DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2020.17911022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalid, Noreen10aAir pollution on highways and motorways perturbs carbon and nitrogen levels in roadside ecosystems  ap. 868-880.  aVehicle emissions create corridors of increased carbon and nitrogen concentrations near highways that influence surrounding ecosystems. This study used the leaves of a variety of wild plant species and soil samples to examine the extent of total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) near highway M-2 and FSR in Punjab, Pakistan, in all four seasons of the year. Results showed significantly higher concentrations of C and N near roads in both plants and soils, indicating that a high proportion of vehicle derived C and N is deposited near roads. Compared to control samples, average soil C and N concentrations were increased by 174% and 519%, respectively, on the M-2 road. Similarly, 237% and 628% more C and N were measured in soil on FSR, respectively. The difference in mean concentrations of C and N among different seasons varied significantly. We inferred from these results that the level of C and N along roads depends upon the distance from the road, traffic volume, and seasonal variations. The raised level of C and N compounds could cause perilous impacts on the environment, especially to farmlands around major highways. Hence, farming activities like growing fruits and crops should be avoided near roads.  aThe authors also extend their deep appreciation to Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University for funding through grant number R.G.P2/101/41.  aPublisher supplied data  aR.G.P2/101/41 3aagricultural land 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3acrops 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afarming systems 3afruits 3ahighways 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aparticulate emissions 3aroadsides 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3asoil carbon 3asoil sampling 3atotal nitrogen 3atraffic 3awild plants 3aPakistan 0aAir pollution 0aRoadsides ecosystems 0aC-N pollution 0aBiomonitors1 aNoman, Ali1 aMasood, Atifa1 aTufail, Aasma1 aHadayat, Naila1 aAlnusairi, Ghalia S.

We conducted a random effects model meta-analysis to identify the association between Hg exposure and THs levels in the general population.This meta-analysis were performed based on the PECO questions (P = general population; E =1ug/L Hg in blood and urine; C =1ug/L incremental increase on; and O = variation of THs levels). We searched four electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies published on or before 20th July 2020. Prospective and cross-sectional studies that evaluated the association between Hg exposure and the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) were included. We also assessed aggregate risks for the reliability of the included studies.Initially, we retrieved 4889 articles. 18 studies met our inclusion criteria after screening and 13 articles were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis results suggest that blood Hg may be significantly associated with THs levels. The presence of Hg in blood may significantly increase the levels of TSH (β=0.55; 95%CI: 0.20,0.90; p < 0.001) and FT4 (β=0.47; 95%CI: 0.11,0.82; p < 0.001), with the opposite association in T4 (β=−0.02; 95%CI: 0.02, −0.01; p < 0.001). For the subgroup analysis, blood Hg was positively correlated with TSH levels in children and adolescents (β=0.62; 95%CI: 0.09, 1.15; p < 0.001) and FT4 levels in pregnant women (β=1.00; 95%CI: 0.99, 1.00; p < 0.001) respectively.This meta-analysis indicates that exposure to Hg in blood could significantly corrrelate with the levels of TSH, T4, and FT4 in the general population. Therefore, it is crucial to control the use of Hg and strengthen protection of the thyroid.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3amercury 3ameta-analysis 3aresearch 3atriiodothyronine 3aurine 0aMercury exposure 0aThyroid hormone 0aMeta-analysis 0aHeavy metal 0aThyroid function1 aHan, Xiumei1 aDong, Guangzhu1 aYan, Wu1 aWang, Xu1 aBigambo, Francis Manyori1 aFang, Kacey1 aXia, Yankai1 aChen, Ting1 aWang, Xinru1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2636-95460 tEnvironmental research.g2021 May, v. 196 p.110928-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1109283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04051naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014400175520207300319592002802392650001902420650001202439650002402451650002402475650002802499650002802527650002302555650001702578650001502595650001002610650001102620650003002631650002002661650001402681650001402695650003002709650001702739650001002756651001702766653000902783653000902792653000802801653001002809653002502819653001102844653001702855653001902872653001902891700002602910700002802936700002502964700002602989700005903015700002403074700002303098700002603121700001503147700001803162773011503180856008503295852000903380655001203389IND60723912020221122023123.0211003e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072391202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1016522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlanazi, Abdullah D.12aA report on tick burden and molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in cattle blood samples collected from four regions in Saudi Arabia  aBabesiosis, theileriosis and anaplasmosis are among the most commonly reported tick-borne diseases in cattle and are associated with significant economic losses. Through the present study the researchers aimed to report the presence of various pathogens that cause babesiosis, theileriosis and anaplasmosis in cattle collected from different provinces in Saudi Arabia and to report their phylogenetic relationship. A total of 362 blood samples of cattle along with ticks that were present on the cattle were collected from four regions (Riyadh, Al-Kharj, Al-Hasa and Al-Qassim) of Saudi Arabia. Blood samples were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of various Babesia, Theileria and Anaplasma species by amplification of their 18S rRNA and/or 23S rRNA genes. A total of 541 ticks were collected and identified from the cattle. These included Hyalomma anatolicum, Hyalomma dromedarii, Hyalomma impeltatum, Hyalomma excavatum, Rhipicephalus annulatus and Rhipicephalus turanicus. Regarding tick-borne pathogens, the overall prevalence was 1.9 % (7/362) for Theileria annulata, (2/362) 0.6 % for Theileria and (21/362) 5.8 % for Anaplasma ovis. Four of the cattle were found to be co-infected with more than one pathogen (1.1 %). We did not detect any Babesia species in the blood of the studied cattle. Prevalence of the Theileria and Anaplasma species was highest in cattle that resided in Riyadh, followed by cattle from Al-Hasa and Al-Qassim. Representative amplified partial-gene sequences of T. annulata (GenBank accession numbers MK826137-39) and A. ovis (GenBank acc. no. MK 880224) were submitted to GenBank. The presence of ticks on cattle was found to be associated with a high prevalence of Theileria spp. (P = 0.02) and Anaplasma ovis (P < 0.001). We report novel genotypes of T. annulata and A. ovis from cattle in Saudi Arabia and we recommend that molecular surveys are undertaken throughout the country to address the prevalence and geographical distribution of tick-borne infections for their effective diagnosis and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma ovis 3aBabesia 3aHyalomma anatolicum 3aHyalomma dromedarii 3aRhipicephalus annulatus 3aRhipicephalus turanicus 3aTheileria annulata 3aanaplasmosis 3ababesiosis 3ablood 3acattle 3ageographical distribution 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atheileriosis 3aticks 3aSaudi Arabia 0aTBDs 0aTBPs 0aPCR 0aTicks 0aTick-borne pathogens 0aCattle 0aSaudi Arabia 0aTheileria spp. 0aAnaplasma ovis1 aAlouffi, Abdulaziz S.1 aAlshahrani, Mohammad Y.1 aAlyousif, Mohamed S.1 aAbdullah, Hend H.A.M.1 aAllam, Ahmad M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9776-72051 aElsawy, Bassma S.M.1 aAbdel-Shafy, Sobhy1 aAlsulami, Muslimah N.1 aKhan, Adil1 aIqbal, Furhan0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2021 May, v. 12, no. 3 p.101652-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1016523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001700183245013100200300001800331506007600349520054700425592002800972506003701000650001401037650001201051650001101063650002201074700001901096773013201115856007801247852000901325655001201334IND60541309720221207061137.0160821e20150805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054130972DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b047252doi7 aPMC46108182pmcid7 a262036622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yufan10aStereoconvergent Negishi Arylations of Racemic Secondary Alkyl Electrophiles: Differentiating between a CF3 and an Alkyl Group  ap. 9523-9526.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this report, we establish that a readily available nickel/bis(oxazoline) catalyst accomplishes a wide array of enantioconvergent cross-couplings of arylzinc reagents with CF₃-substituted racemic secondary alkyl halides, a process that necessitates that the chiral catalyst be able to effectively distinguish between a CF₃ and an alkyl group in order to provide good ee.

Phorid flies (Diptera: Phoridae) have been proposed as viable candidates for biological control of ants because of the importance of their trait‐mediated effects on their hosts. However, the impact of different densities of phorid flies has never been assessed in the field. Experiments were conducted by isolating 3‐m sections of Atta vollenweideri Forel foraging trails with tunnels, and sampling ants in trails with 0, 1, or 4 Eibesfeldtphora trilobata Disney female parasitoid flies. Samples were collected every 30 min from these trails. We also collected a sample before introducing the parasitoids and another one 30 min after removing them from the trail. We measured traffic of ants on the trails, weight and type of plant material transported, and the proportion and size of the workers collected. The presence of phorids on the trails reduced the ant traffic and amount of plant material transported into the nests and decreased the proportion of workers on the trails in the size range preferred as hosts by the flies. The effect on worker size, as well as the lag effect recorded after phorids were removed from the tunnels, was more pronounced with four phorids. The presence of phorids also affected the weight of monocotyledon and dicotyledon material transported. Even at the minimum density possible, phorids significantly influenced a key aspect of the colony life, the food intake through foraging. From an applied point of view, our results show that releases of these phorids into the field should not necessarily involve many individuals to reduce foraging by A. vollenweideri, making them potentially useful candidates for biological control of these ants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtta 3aLiliopsida 3aMagnoliopsida 3aNeotropics 3aPhoridae 3abiological control 3afemales 3afood intake 3aforaging 3aforestry 3ahosts 3anests 3aparasitoids 3atraffic1 aFolgarait, Patricia J.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2015 Jan., v. 154, no. 1 p.53-61dKluwer Academic Publishersx0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.122553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009700171300001400268520048300282592002800765650002100793650001400814650001500828650001500843650001200858650001900870650001800889650001300907650002100920653002000941653001000961653001500971653001700986653002101003700001801024700001301042700001201055700001801067700001901085773010601104856008401210852000901294655001201303IND60598949020221120163652.0180702e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059894902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2014.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Chao-Ying10aIdentification of a new bis-amino acid glycoside selectively toxic to multiple myeloma cells  ap. 39-42.  aA bis-triazolyl phenylalaninyl galactoside was synthesized by a two-fold click reaction between an azido phenylalanine and a di-O-propynyl galactoside.

The animals were included in the study using systematic random sampling. The gross lesions included firm and enlarged livers with tense capsule, haemorrhagic spots, multi focal nodules and enlarged hepatic lymph nodes. The bile ducts were thickened and distended with adult fluke especially in chronic cases. Frequently observed histologic lesions were, hepatic portal fibrosis with large amount of fibrin in the portal area, hepatocytes degeneration, fatty changes and periportal necrosis. Fibrous connective tissue of various amount with fibroblasts and infiltration of mononuclear cells, in particular lymphocytes were common lesions in tracts migrated by parasites. Biliary cirrhosis with epithelial hyperplasia were also observed in cattle and sheep. Eosinophilic hepatitis, talengechtasis and hepatocytes degeneration and necrosis were evident in the parenchyma. Chronic lesions were less prominent in goats’ and even no cirrhotic case examined in goat. Cytological examination showed large number of lymphocytes and few plasma cells and eosinophils. The findings of the present study indicated that gross, histopathological and cytological examination supports one another in characterization of liver lesions hence could be used together in diagnosis of ruminant fasciolosis. However, additional diagnostic tests would be added for better confirmation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanimal pathology 3abile 3acattle 3acomparative study 3aeosinophils 3aepithelium 3aexports 3afascioliasis 3afibrin 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3agoats 3ahepatitis 3ahepatocytes 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ahyperplasia 3aliver 3aliver flukes 3alymph 3anecrosis 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3aEthiopia 0aBishoftu 0aELFORA-Abattoir 0aCytology 0aLiver fluke 0aPathological changes 0aRuminant1 aDemissie, Tilaye1 aAshenafi, Hagos1 aTadesse, Abebayehu0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2015 June 1, v. 39, no. 2 p.113-120dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-970X.2015.00027.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245013000199300001600329500002000345520146900365592002801834596004701862596005201909596003901961596003102000596002102031596001902052650001902071650002102090650001602111650001902127650001202146650002002158650002702178650001102205650001602216650001402232650001402246650001902260650001302279650001402292650001902306650001002325651002002335700005502355700001902410700005502429773015702484856007502641852000902716655001202725IND60760467220221121201212.0211222e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076046722DNAL7 a10.1111/ajgw.125312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSosnowski, M.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3112-019810aWinegrape cultivars (Vitis vinifera) vary in susceptibility to the grapevine trunk pathogens Eutypa lata and Diplodia seriata  ap. 166-174.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Eutypa and Botryosphaeria dieback are diseases that affect vineyards worldwide, reducing productivity and longevity. The ability of the causal pathogens Eutypa lata and Diplodia seriata to colonise grapevine canes was investigated in the search for resistance or tolerance to trunk diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS: Visual assessments of 174 winegrape cultivars (Vitis vinifera) in a mature germplasm collection in the Barossa Valley in South Australia revealed substantial variation (0–98%) in severity of foliar symptoms and dieback. A selection of 18 cultivars representing those without symptoms or low (<10%) severity was compared with the susceptible cultivars Shiraz and Sauvignon Blanc. Inoculation of canes in situ in the vineyard and detached canes in the greenhouse, confirmed variability among cultivars for the extent of pathogen colonisation. CONCLUSIONS: Cultivars varied in susceptibility to colonisation by E. lata and D. seriata, with some differences between the two pathogens in terms of the ranking of cultivars. Muscadelle was most resistant to colonisation by both pathogens, and Sauvignonasse was the most susceptible. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Knowledge of cultivar susceptibility to grapevine trunk diseases will assist in prioritisation of disease management strategies. Identification of cultivars with resistance could inform selection of planting material and may lead to improved breeding programs in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  cClare Region Winegrape Growers Association  cMcLaren Vale Grape Wine and Tourism Association  cBarossa Grape and Wine Association  cAdelaide Hills Wine Region  cNufarm Australia  cWine Australia 3aBotryosphaeria 3aDiplodia seriata 3aEutypa lata 3aVitis vinifera 3adieback 3adisease control 3agermplasm conservation 3agrapes 3agreenhouses 3alongevity 3apathogens 3aprioritization 3aresearch 3avineyards 3awine cultivars 3awines 3aSouth Australia1 aAyres, M.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7668-12151 aMcCarthy, M.G.1 aScott, E.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6829-519X0 tAustralian journal of grape and wine research.g2022 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.166-174dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl4138516x1322-71307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajgw.125313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011600161300002200277520113200299592002801431650004401459650002201503650001301525650001201538650001801550650001901568650001901587650001901606650001601625650001701641650001801658650003301676700002701709700003201736700002301768773012701791856007501918852000901993655001202002IND60641306820221121190037.0210813e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064130682DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra22104a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManshad, Soheila10aFabrication of nanohybrid polyetherimide/graphene oxide membranes: biofuel dehydration by pervaporation process  ap. 103888-103894.  aPolyetherimide (PEI) flat-sheet membranes (PM) as a nanohybrid membrane were fabricated through dry-thermal (PMDT) and thermal treatment (PMTT) methods using graphene oxide (GO) as a nanofiller. Characterization of PM membranes was carried out using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The PMDT membrane cross-section showed a sponge-like structure resulting in higher permeability and lower separation factor. The SEM image (cross-section) of the PMTT membrane showed a dense structure with higher separation factor and lower permeation flux than those of the PMDT membrane. Incorporation of GO into the PEI matrix significantly reduced the contact angle surface hydrophobicity of the membranes. The nanohybrid membrane exhibited an exceptional pervaporation performance at a concentration of 95 wt% n-butanol. The permeation flux of PMDT and PMTT membranes were 1100.26 and 642.69 kg m⁻² h⁻¹ and their separation factors were 89.39 and 96.96, respectively.

(Meliaceae) (Mx-Sm) against the Laboratory strains (LS) and Wild Strains (WS) of Aedes aegypti Linn. and their non-target screening against the aquatic predator was analyzed. The larval mortality was significant in Temephos (0.5 ppm-93.5%) and Mx-Sm (300 ppm-92.10%) and statistically altered with control. Despite this, the larval mortality is relatively higher in LS than WS treated with Temephos in all the treated instars. Both strains LS and WS displayed stable mortality rate across all the instars while treated with Mx-Sm (300 ppm). The sub-lethal concentration of Mx-Sm (205 ppm) showed no significant differences in the level of α- and β-carboxylesterase. But, there is a significant difference observed between both strains treated with Temephos (0.35 ppm). Similar trends were observed in the GST and CYP450 levels, as the enzyme ratio gets uplifted prominently in the WS compared to the LS in Temephos treatment. Whereas the enzyme regulation up-lifted steadily in both LS and WS treated with Mx-Sm. The non-target screening of Mx-Sm and Temephos against the mosquito predator Toxorhynchites splendens revealed that the Mx-Sm was less toxic at the prominent dosage 1000 ppm as compared to Temephos (1 ppm). Thus the safety index recommends that Mx-Sm was a target-specific and suitable alternative for chemical pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aSwietenia mahagoni 3aToxorhynchites splendens 3aagricultural biotechnology 3abiocatalysis 3aenzymes 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amortality 3atemephos 3atoxicity 0aMeliaceae 0aWild strain 0aResistance 0aNon-target1 aKarthi, Sengodan1 aGanesan, Raja1 aSenthil-Nathan, Sengottayan1 aKrutmuang, Patcharin1 aChellappandian, Muthiah1 aRadhakrishnan, Narayanaswamy1 aPonsankar, Athirstam1 aKarthick, Kalvikkarasan1 aNelofer, Abdul-Raheem0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2021 Jan., v. 31 p.101915-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1019153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245016900177300001600346520085300362592002801215650001901243650002501262650001801287650001701305650001001322650002801332650002201360650002301382650001701405653002401422653003001446653002501476653002701501653001101528653001401539653001501553700002201568700001601590700002601606700002101632773012801653856008101781852000901862655001201871IND60113648020221118002745.0190318e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011364802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuñez-Mancilla, Yissleen10aOsmotic dehydration under high hydrostatic pressure: Effects on antioxidant activity, total phenolics compounds, vitamin C and colour of strawberry (Fragaria vesca)  ap. 151-156.  aSimultaneous application of osmotic dehydration under high hydrostatic pressure conditions of strawberries was studied with the purpose of analyzing the effect of the combined process on the antioxidant capacity, phenolic compounds, colour and vitamin C of strawberries during refrigerated storage.

The radical scavenging activity showed higher antioxidant activity at 400 MPa rather than at low pressure (100, 200 and 300 MPa). The total phenolic content increased with pressure presenting a maximum at 400 MPa. Pressurized samples retained vitamin C content.

The objective was to determine anatomical features of both healthy and clinically abnormal donkey metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints (n = 13) using anatomical dissection, casting, X-ray and computed tomography. The joint capsule contained two palmar/plantar and two dorsal recesses. The proximal–palmar or plantar recess was larger than the distodorsal recess and potential sites of approaches to the recesses were determined. Soft tissue structures were distinguished using computed tomography at 300 mA, which was superior to 120 mA. This methodology gave better assessments of the synovial tendon sheath, joint recesses, and cruciate, collateral, and short sesamoidean ligaments. Computed tomography provided outstanding discrimination between the cortex and medulla of the third metacarpal, the proximal sesamoid bones, the proximal phalanx, and excellent details of the osseous structures. Although the joints appeared free from exostosis using X-ray; the position and extension of exostosis in pathologically affected donkeys (a novel finding) were revealed using computed tomography with 300 mA in comparison to 120 mA. The study also provided an anatomical record of the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints using the latest technology, which could impact on clinical situations including anesthesia injection sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aanesthesia 3aasses 3acomputed tomography 3acortex 3aimage analysis 3ajoints (animal) 3aligaments 3amedicine 3ametacarpus 3asesamoid bones 3asocioeconomics 0aRadiography 0aExostosis 0aLameness1 aAlsafy, Mohamed A.M.1 aRutland, Catrin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2009-48981 aEL-Khamary, Ahmad N.1 aAbu-Ahmed, Howaida M.1 aEl-Kammar, Mahmoud H.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2020 May, v. 88 p.102904-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2019.1029043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002800125040001800153100002200171245009100193300002000284506007600304506003100380520145400411592002801865596004701893506003701940650001501977650001301992650001902005650001102024650001902035650001902054650001502073650002502088650001102113700002102124700002202145700001802167700001702185773012402202856007502326852000902401655001202410IND60672342920221207141729.0191016e20191007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067234292DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06018a2chorus7 a10.1039/c9ra06018a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorbett, Derek B.10aHydrophobic resin treatment of hydrothermal autohydrolysate for prebiotic applications  ap. 31819-31827.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe production of a high-value xylooligosaccharide (XOS) prebiotic product from lignocellulosic autohydrolysate requires processing for the removal of non-carbohydrate components such as lignin and furfural. In this research, the nature of XOS dissolved in autohydrolysate is evaluated including the XOS degree of polymerization (DP) distribution and potential covalent association between XOS and lignin (LCC). The impact of these factors on the yield of XOS during treatment of Miscanthus autohydrolysate with hydrophobic resin is assessed. Over 30% of the XOS in autohydrolysate was found to be likely associated with lignin (“tied” XOS), all of which was removed during hydrophobic resin treatment along with over 90% of the dissolved lignin. However, loss of dissolved XOS during resin treatment was found to not be due solely to XOS association with lignin. Over 50% of the “free,” non-lignin-associated XOS was also removed by resin treatment. Interaction between “free” XOS and the hydrophobic resin was found to be highly dependent on DP with higher DP XOS being removed far more readily than low DP XOS. Over 80% of dissolved “free” XOS with a DP of six and above (X6+) was removed from autohydrolysate during treatment while only 17% of xylose (X1) was removed. Efforts to understand the interaction between the hydrophobic resin and XOS and to improve the recovery of XOS during hydrophobic resin treatment are presented.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMiscanthus 3afurfural 3ahydrophobicity 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3apolymerization 3aprebiotics 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylose1 aHong, Changyoung1 aVenditti, Richard1 aJameel, Hasan1 aPark, Sunkyu0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 07, v. 9, no. 55 p.31819-31827dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06018a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245010500157300001600262520227000278592002802548650001502576650001602591650001102607650001902618650002002637650001302657650001302670650001802683650001702701650002202718700001702740700001602757773012602773856007702899852000902976655001202985IND60765106420221119163018.0220714e20100916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510642DNAL7 a10.17221/39/2009-swr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovák, P.10aAssessment of the soil quality as a complex of productive and environmental soil function potentials  ap. 113-119.  aSoil quality is a measure of the ability of soil to carry out particular ecological and plant productive functions. It reflects the combination of chemical, physical, and biological properties. Some of the soil properties are relatively more important than the others and unchangeable. Others can be significantly changed by human activity. Nowadays, three groups of soil functions are usually defined: soil utility function (productive function, infrastructure area, source of materials); functions of soil in the environment (non-productive functions such as: water infiltration and water retention, transport of matter, buffering and sanitary functions); soil cultural function (history of nature and humans). The cultural function is, from our point of view, different from the others. The complex assessment of the soil quality is the topic of this paper and includes both the productive and environmental functions. The productive function (productive potential) of Czech soils has been long studied and is &plusmn; known. It is expressed by means of a one-hundred-point scale in the Czech Land Evaluation System. Its point values depend on different soil and local characteristics together with the natural conditions and their influence on the plant production. A similar principle was used for the assessment of the non-productive soil functions. The importance of the individual soil characteristics is defined. The values of the environmental soil function potentials are determined from the common soil characteristics and are compared with the values of the soil productive potential. Total soil quality can be then expressed as the average or as the sum of the points for all individual functions. Some selected function can be preferred by increasing its value coefficient for a specific land use area (for example, an area for obtaining underground water). Three texturally different forms of Chernozem (middle textured, clayic, arenic) which correspond to the Main Soil Units of the Czech Land Evaluation System are given as an example of the assessment. The evaluation of the total soil quality would then involve not only the agricultural and locality determined financial values but also an assessment of all environmental functions of the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3aland evaluation 3aland use 3aresearch 3asoil function 3asoil quality 3autility functions1 aVopravil, J.1 aLagová, J.0 tSoil and Water Research.g, v. 5, no. 3 p.113-119dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21421x1801-53957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/39/2009-swr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245015100169500001900320520198300339592002802322650001002350650002502360650000902385650001602394650001602410650001402426650003602440650001302476650002102489650002002510650001202530650002802542650001202570650002002582650001902602653002102621653001702642653001702659653001302676653002102689700001802710700001702728700001602745700001502761773011302776856008802889852000902977655001202986IND60679695720221118161204.0200601e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067969572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2019.1064272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanielo, J.10aEffects of post-weaning supplementation of immunomodulatory feed ingredient on body weight and cortisol concentrations in program-fed beef heifers  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effects of an immunomodulatory feed ingredient during post-weaning on growth and cortisol concentrations of beef heifers. Commercial Angus heifers (n = 72) from 2 AI sires were blocked (n = 9) by BW and randomly assigned to one of 2 pens per block. Each pen (4 heifers/pen) per block was randomly assigned to either one of 2 treatments, Celmanax (CEL) or corn germ (CON).

The feed was top-dressed once daily with either 72g of Celmanax (CEL) or corn germ (CON) per pen. Body weight (BW) was collected on d −1, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 61.

Sixteen heifers (n = 8 CEL; n = 8 CON) were randomly selected for a corticotropin-releasing hormone/arginine vasopressin (CRH/AVP) challenge and an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) on d 64 and 67 of the study. The pen was the experimental unit, and data were analyzed by ANOVA or repeated measures analysis as appropriate. Feed efficiency and BW gain were increased (P = 0.04) in CEL heifers compared to CON heifers. Serum cortisol concentrations were decreased (P < 0.01) in CEL heifers compared to CON heifers on d 30 to 60 post-weaning. Serum cortisol concentrations were decreased (P < 0.05) in CEL heifers compared to CON heifers throughout the transportation challenge. Serum cortisol concentrations were decreased (P < 0.05) in CEL heifers compared to CON heifers during the CRH/AVP challenge from 60 to 150 min post-infusion. Treatment did not influence (P = 0.29) plasma insulin or glucose (P = 0.63) concentrations during the IVGTT. In summary, supplementation of Celmanax post-weaning increased BW gain and reduced cortisol concentrations in challenged beef heifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aarginine vasopressin 3abeef 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acorn germ 3acorticotropin-releasing hormone 3acortisol 3afeed composition 3afeed conversion 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ainsulin 3astress response 3atransportation 0aImmunomodulatory 0aBeef heifers 0aPost weaning 0aCelmanax 0aYeast supplement1 aMcCarty, K.J.1 aTipton, J.E.1 aRicks, R.E.1 aLong, N.M.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2020 July, v. 72 p.106427-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl34945x0739-72407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2019.1064273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011500168520128400283592002801567650001501595650001201610650001101622650002701633650001701660650001601677650001501693650001701708650002901725650001501754650001001769650001601779650001101795650002101806650001501827653002701842653001701869653003901886653002001925653002801945700001701973700001801990700001702008700001802025700001902043700001702062773011402079856008602193852000902279655001202288IND60776649720221120065414.0220621e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077664972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1290542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Haoran10aOccurrence of dissolved black carbon in source water and disinfection byproducts formation during chlorination  aDissolved black carbon (DBC), the water-soluble component of black carbon, which is formed by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels or biochar, takes up about 10% of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in river water. However, the distribution of DBC in water environment especially in source water is not clear and as an important component of DOM, whether DBC can produce disinfection byproducts (DBPs) like other DOM during disinfection remains unknown. In this study, the DBC concentrations in seventeen source water samples from East China were measured. The concentrations of DBC in the source water samples ranged from 60 to 270 μg/L, which were positively correlated with UV₂₅₄ absorbance and chemical oxygen demand. The levels of DBC in wet season were higher than that in dry season. The average concentrations of DBC in different types of source water samples followed the order of reservoir > canal > lake > river. DBC could only be removed by 20% during the simulated coagulation, and further generate different categories of DBPs during chlorination, among which the concentrations of haloacetic acids (HAA) were the highest. The results indicated that DBC widely distributes in source water and is an important precursor of HAAs and THMs during chlorination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abiochar 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorination 3acoagulation 3acombustion 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic matter 3adry season 3alakes 3ariver water 3arivers 3awater solubility 3awet season 0aDissolved black carbon 0aSource water 0aBenzene polycarboxylic acid method 0aQuality control 0aDisinfection byproducts1 aWang, Junjie1 aZhao, Xiating1 aWang, Yuting1 aHuang, Zhijun1 aGong, Tingting1 aXian, Qiming0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 435 p.129054-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1290543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245014200202300001800344506007600362520154700438592002801985506003702013650001902050650002402069650001402093650000902107650002202116650001902138650001702157650001302174650001102187650001302198650001402211650001102225650000702236650001902243700002602262700002102288700002502309700002502334700002502359773013202384856007802516852000902594655001202603IND60541310220221207084626.0160821e20150805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054131022DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b052292doi7 aPMC52865682pmcid7 a261615042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Liang
L.10aActivation of Dioxygen by a TAML Activator in Reverse Micelles: Characterization of an FeIIIFeIV Dimer and Associated Catalytic Chemistry  ap. 9704-9715.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIron TAML activators of peroxides are functional catalase-peroxidase mimics. Switching from hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) to dioxygen (O₂) as the primary oxidant was achieved by using a system of reverse micelles of Aerosol OT (AOT) in n-octane. Hydrophilic TAML activators are localized in the aqueous microreactors of reverse micelles where water is present in much lower abundance than in bulk water. n-Octane serves as a proximate reservoir supplying O₂ to result in partial oxidation of Feᴵᴵᴵ to Feᴵⱽ-containing species, mostly the FeᴵᴵᴵFeᴵⱽ (major) and FeᴵⱽFeᴵⱽ (minor) dimers which coexist with the Feᴵᴵᴵ TAML monomeric species. The speciation depends on the pH and the degree of hydration w₀, viz., the amount of water in the reverse micelles. The previously unknown FeᴵᴵᴵFeᴵⱽ dimer has been characterized by UV–vis, EPR, and Mössbauer spectroscopies. Reactive electron donors such as NADH, pinacyanol chloride, and hydroquinone undergo the TAML-catalyzed oxidation by O₂. The oxidation of NADH, studied in most detail, is much faster at the lowest degree of hydration w₀ (in “drier micelles”) and is accelerated by light through NADH photochemistry. Dyes that are more resistant to oxidation than pinacyanol chloride (Orange II, Safranine O) are not oxidized in the reverse micellar media. Despite the limitation of low reactivity, the new systems highlight an encouraging step in replacing TAML peroxidase-like chemistry with more attractive dioxygen-activation chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aanionic surfactants 3achlorides 3adyes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydroquinone 3amicelles 3aoctane 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphotochemistry1 aGunderson, William A.1 aWeitz, Andrew C.1 aHendrich, Michael P.1 aRyabov, Alexander D.1 aCollins, Terrence J.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Aug. 05, v. 137, no. 30 p.9704-9715dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b052293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245005400159300001600213520118900229592002801418650001301446650001101459650001201470650002501482650001301507650001201520773014001532856007701672852000901749655001201758IND60765106620221119162911.0220714e20111214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510662DNAL7 a10.17221/39/2010-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, M.,10aInfluence of surface integrity on bonding process  ap. 153-162.  aAdhesive bonding technology is successfully applied partly in the primary production, partly in the renovation in various fields of human activities. This fact emphasizes the importance of the partial factors research, which influence is essential for the quality, reliability and necessarily the usable life of bonded joints. The mechanical preparation of bonded surface is a varied process which influences directly the resultant bonded joint quality. The aim of the bonded surface mechanical preparation is the adhesion improvement in the adhesive &ndash; adherend interface. For mechanical preparation we use tools of defined cutting edge, by means of which we get the uniform surface texture, e.g. by milling. On the contrary such methods are more often used when the uniform surface cannot be reached. Shot blasting and grinding are significant representatives of these methods. The manual grinding can be significantly applied mainly in the agriculture. The absence of connected areas availability for the mechanical tooling and impossibility of their work clamping are the reasons for that. The breakwater in the sprinkler cistern restricting the liquid motion is the example.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3ahumans 3aliquids 3aprimary productivity 3aresearch 3atexture0 tResearch in Agricultural Engineering.g, v. 57, no. 4 p.153-162dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21420x1212-91517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/39/2010-rae3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017000158300002000328520198000348592002802328650001302356650001102369650001602380650001402396650004302410650001102453650001502464650001902479650002102498650002002519650001302539650002402552650001302576650001802589650001702607700002702624700001602651700002502667700002102692700001602713700003102729700002402760700001902784773012402803856007402927852000903001655001203010IND60672343420221118061628.0191016e20191009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067234342DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06158d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hee-Kwon10aOn-demand radiosynthesis of N-succinimidyl-4-[¹⁸F]fluorobenzoate ([¹⁸F]SFB) on an electrowetting-on-dielectric microfluidic chip for ¹⁸F-labeling of protein  ap. 32175-32183.  aAn all-electronic, droplet-based batch microfluidic device, operated using the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) mechanism was developed for on-demand synthesis of N-succinimidyl-4-[¹⁸F]fluorobenzoate ([¹⁸F]SFB), the most commonly used ¹⁸F-prosthetic group for biomolecule labeling. In order to facilitate the development of peptides, and proteins as new diagnostic and therapeutic agents, we have diversified the compact EWOD microfluidic platform to perform the three-step radiosynthesis of [¹⁸F]SFB starting from the no carrier added [¹⁸F]fluoride ion. In this report, we established an optimal microliter droplet reaction condition to obtain reliable yields and synthesized [¹⁸F]SFB with sufficient radioactivity for subsequent conjugation to the anti-PSCA cys-diabody (A2cDb) and for small animal imaging. The three-step, one-pot radiosynthesis of [¹⁸F]SFB radiochemistry was adapted to a batch microfluidic platform with a reaction droplet sandwiched between two parallel plates of an EWOD chip, and optimized. Specifically, the ratio of precursor to base, droplet volume, reagent concentration, reaction time, and evaporation time were found be to be critical parameters. [¹⁸F]SFB was successfully synthesized on the EWOD chip in 39 ± 7% (n = 4) radiochemical yield in a total synthesis time of ∼120 min ([¹⁸F]fluoride activation, [¹⁸F]fluorination, hydrolysis, and coupling reaction, HPLC purification, drying and reformulation). The reformulation and stabilization step for [¹⁸F]SFB was important to obtain a high protein labeling efficiency of 33.1 ± 12.5% (n = 3). A small-animal immunoPET pilot study demonstrated that the [¹⁸F]SFB-PSCA diabody conjugate showed specific uptake in the PSCA-positive human prostate cancer xenograft. The successful development of a compact footprint of the EWOD radiosynthesizer has the potential to empower biologists to produce PET probes of interest themselves in a standard laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3adrying 3aevaporation 3afluorides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aimage analysis 3aisotope labeling 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3apeptides 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aproteins 3aradioactivity 3atherapeutics1 aJaved, Muhammad Rashed1 aChen, Supin1 aZettlitz, Kirstin A.1 aCollins, Jeffrey1 aWu, Anna M.1 aKim, Chang-Jin “C.

In this paper, mesoporous carbon microspheres/graphene composites (MCMG) were synthesized in situ via a soft template method and subsequent thermal reduction by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the structure-directing agent, and aqueous mesophase pitch (AMP) and graphene oxide (GO) as the carbon sources. The strong electrostatic interaction between GO/CTAB and AMP promoted the self-assembly of CTAB and AMP to form the MCMG precursor. The results showed that the CTAB concentration and aging temperature have an important effect on the morphology and pore structure of the synthesized MCMG. The high aging temperature promoted the formation of mesoporous carbon spheres and its diameter increased with the increase in the concentration of CTAB. The as-prepared MCMG at the aging temperature of 140 °C had obvious spherical and layered carbon materials after carbonization at 900 °C. When the concentration of CTAB was 10.6 g L⁻¹, the formed mesoporous carbon spheres with the diameter of 30–40 nm were uniformly dispersed among the layered graphenes in MCMG-140-0.2 (the aging temperature of 140 °C and the CTAB content of 0.2 g). In addition, its specific surface area was 1150.5 m² g⁻¹ and the mesopore size was centered at 4.3 nm, 7.9 nm, and 17.1 nm. Compared with the MCMG precursor, the ordered degree of the mesopores for MCMG was reduced due to the high temperature carbonization. Importantly, the specific capacitance of MCMG-140-0.2 at the current density of 0.1 A g⁻¹ was as high as 356.3 F g⁻¹. Moreover, the specific capacitance of MCMG-140-0.2 at 1 A g⁻¹ remained at 278.5 F g⁻¹, the capacitance retention was 92.1% after 6000 cycles, and the coulombic efficiency was over 98% at a high current density of 2 A g⁻¹. Therefore, the as-prepared MCMG can be an excellent candidate for electrode materials in supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbonization 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3amicroparticles 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aCheng, Youliang1 aZhang, Qingling1 aFang, Changqing1 aWu, Linlin1 aBai, Mengsha1 aYao, Yongtao0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 10, v. 9, no. 55 p.32258-32269dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06191f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245013000167300002000297520152500317592002801842650001801870650001501888650001701903650002101920650001901941650001601960650001401976650001701990650001302007650001802020650001402038650001302052650001702065650002302082650001402105650001102119650001502130653003002145653003302175653000802208653000702216653002502223653001502248653001802263653001902281653001902300653002302319653003602342700002802378700002602406700002802432700002902460700002502489700005702514773014202571856007902713852000902792655001202801IND60614671820181121000000.0181020e20180824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061467182DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b104522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Alfredo,10aHybrid Decorated Core@Shell Janus Nanoparticles as a Flexible Platform for Targeted Multimodal Molecular Bioimaging of Cancer  ap. 31032-31043.  aIn the recent years, targeted cancer theranosis, the concomitant therapeutic treatment and selective visualization of cancerous tissue, has become a powerful strategy to improve patient prognosis. In this context, targeted multimodal molecular imaging, the combination of different imaging modalities overcoming their individual limitations, has attracted great attention. Due to their unique properties, advanced nanomaterials have taken center stage in the development of theranostics. In this work, we report a novel Janus nanoplatform by combining an Fe₃O₄ NPs/mesoporous silica core@shell face together with an Au nanoparticle face. Due to its anisotropy, this hybrid nanomaterial enabled the orthogonal site-selective modification of each face permitting the incorporation of a targeting peptide for cancer detection (cRGD) and a fluorescent dye. Due to the intrinsic characteristics of this Janus nanoplatform together with those selectively generated on their surfaces, the resulting hybrid nanocarrier successfully promoted the in vivo tumor-targeted multimodal imaging by magnetic resonance (Fe₃O₄ core), computed tomography (AuNP face), and fluorescent tracking (fluorescent dye loading) in a fibrosarcoma-bearing mouse model. The achieved results endorse these hybrid Janus nanoparticles as a powerful and flexible platform with integrated imaging and carrier functionalities to be equipped with therapeutic features to generate an advanced multifunctional nanocarrier for targeted cancer theranosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanisotropy 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3ananocarriers 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aporous media 3aprecision medicine 3aprognosis 3asilica 3atomography 0ahybrid Janus nanoparticle 0amultimodal molecular imaging 0aMRI 0aCT 0afluorescence imaging 0atheranosis 0adrug delivery 0ananotechnology 0acancer imaging 0agold nanoparticles 0amesoporous silica nanoparticles1 aOvejero Paredes, Karina1 aRuiz-Cabello, Jesús,1 aMartínez-Ruíz, Paloma1 aPingarrón, José Manuel1 aVillalonga, Reynaldo1 aFilice, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8142-45660 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Aug. 24, v. 10, no. 37 p.31032-31043dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b104523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04518naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015900168300001800327520240400345592002802749650001602777650001002793650002502803650001702828650001902845650001802864650001902882650001002901650001702911650001002928650001802938650001302956650001802969650002602987650001803013650001503031650001303046650001903059650001403078650002103092650001403113650002103127650001403148650001903162650001303181650002503194653000803219653000803227653000803235653000803243653000703251653000903258653001403267653001403281653000803295653001903303653002203322653000803344700001803352700002003370700001803390700002203408700001903430700002003449700001903469700001603488700001903504700001603523773009203539856008403631852000903715655001203724IND60542011420221118032936.0161020e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054201142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Wen-Ni10aKnocking down 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase increased oxidative stress and impeded zebrafish embryogenesis by obstructing morphogenetic movement  ap. 2340-2350.  aFolate is an essential nutrient for cell survival and embryogenesis. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) is the most abundant folate enzyme in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2, the only pathway responsible for formate oxidation in methanol intoxication. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase has been considered a potential chemotherapeutic target because it was down-regulated in cancer cells. However, the normal physiological significance of 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase is not completely understood, hampering the development of therapeutic drug/regimen targeting 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase.10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase expression in zebrafish embryos was knocked-down using morpholino oligonucleotides. The morphological and biochemical characteristics of fdh morphants were examined using specific dye staining and whole-mount in-situ hybridization. Embryonic folate contents were determined by HPLC.The expression of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase was consistent in whole embryos during early embryogenesis and became tissue-specific in later stages. Knocking-down fdh impeded morphogenetic movement and caused incorrect cardiac positioning, defective hematopoiesis, notochordmalformation and ultimate death of morphants. Obstructed F-actin polymerization and delayed epiboly were observed in fdh morphants. These abnormalities were reversed either by adding tetrahydrofolate or antioxidant or by co-injecting the mRNA encoding 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase N-terminal domain, supporting the anti-oxidative activity of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and the in vivo function of tetrahydrofolate conservation for 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase N-terminal domain.10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase functioned in conserving the unstable tetrahydrofolate and contributing to the intracellular anti-oxidative capacity of embryos, which was crucial in promoting proper cell migration during embryogenesis.These newly reported tetrahydrofolate conserving and anti-oxidative activities of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase shall be important for unraveling 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase biological significance and the drug development targeting 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aactin 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarbon dioxide 3acell movement 3acell viability 3adeath 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aembryogenesis 3aformates 3ahematopoiesis 3ain situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amethanol 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apoisoning 3apolymerization 3astaining 3atetrahydrofolic acid 0aFDH 0aTHF 0adpf 0ahpf 0aMO 0aWISH 0aFDH-N-ter 0aZebrafish 0aROS 0aCell migration 0aFolate metabolism 0aFDH1 aLee, Gang-Hui1 aKao, Tseng-Ting1 aLin, Cha-Ying1 aHsiao, Tsun-Hsien1 aTsai, Jen-Ning1 aChen, Bing-Hung1 aChen, Yau-Hung1 aWu, Hsin-Ru1 aTsai, Huai-Jen1 aFu, Tzu-Fun0 tBBA - General Subjects.g2014 July, v. 1840 p.2340-2350dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245019400165300001600359520145000375592002801825650001301853650001101866650001201877650001401889650001401903650001401917650001301931650004401944650001501988650002002003653002402023653001202047653001202059653001202071653001302083700002302096773015002119856007702269852000902346655001202355IND60521934420221123035552.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052193442DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-05092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWrackmeyer, Bernd10a15N Nucelar Magnetic Resonance Study of Two-Coordinate Phosphorus Cations - Sign-Determination of Coupling Constants – Application of Two-Dimensional (2D) Heteronuclear Shift Correlations  ap. 662-667.  aCyclic and non-cyclic bis(amino)phosphenium cations (1 to 4) together with their precursors (bis(amino)phosphorus chlorides 5 to 8) and some other bis(amino)phosphorus compounds (9 to 14) have been studied by ¹³C, ¹⁵N (natural abundance), ²⁹Si and ³¹P NMR spectroscopy. ¹⁵N chemical shifts and coupling constants ¹J(³¹P¹⁵N) of phosphenium cations have been determined for the first time. NMR data of 1 to 4 are compared with those of a bis(amino)carbene and various bis(amino)stannylenes. In the phosphenium cations 1 to 4 the ¹⁵N nuclear shielding is considerably reduced (ca. 70 to 100 ppm as compared with 5 to 14) and there is a crude linear relationship between δ¹⁵N and δ³¹P values. Changes in the δ¹⁵N values of 1 to 4 do not reflect P-N (pp)π interactions. A positive sign has been determined for the coupling constants ¹J(³¹Ρ¹⁵Ν) [reduced coupling constants ¹K(³¹P¹⁵N) < O] for the phosphenium cations and for all other P(III)-N compounds studied. This was achieved by applying various one- and twodimensional heteronuclear double resonance techniques. The experiments also gave signs of the coupling constants ²J(³¹PN¹³C), ²J(³¹PN²⁹Si), ³J(³¹PNC¹³C), ³J(³¹PNSi¹³C), ⁴J(³¹PNCC¹H) and ⁴J(³¹PNSiC¹H). Negative contributions to ¹K(³¹P¹⁵N), arising from the lone pair of electrons at phosphorus, are more noticeable in the case of the phosphenium cations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbenes 3acarbon 3acations 3achlorides 3aelectrons 3amagnetism 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorus 3astable isotopes 0aPhosphenium Cations 0a31P NMR 0a13C NMR 0a15N NMR 0a29Si NMR1 aSchiller, Jürgen,0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 47, no. 5 p.662-667dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1992-05093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012600161300002000287520182400307592002802131650002702159650001202186650001402198650002202212650003302234650001902267700002802286700001802314700001702332700002202349700001702371700001902388700001902407773012402426856007402550852000902624655001202633IND60672343620221118061504.0191016e20191008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067234362DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06198c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuah, Perng Yang10aExtractable impurities from fluoropolymer-based membrane filters – interference in high-throughput, untargeted analysis  ap. 31918-31927.  aThe removal of particles using fluoropolymer-based membrane filters is usually done so to prolong the life span of an analytical column, prevent hardware damage, and reduce signal suppression. Ironically, these membrane filters tend to leach impurities into the samples as the samples are filtered through them. These impurities have the potential to affect the researcher's interpretation in high-throughput, non-targeted analysis. In this study, extractable impurities from different brands of fluoropolymer-based membrane filters present in the filtrate filtered using the said filters were investigated. The results demonstrated that different brand membrane filters and materials tend to elute vastly different numbers of impurities. There were instances whereby the extractable impurities persisted in both the membrane filter and the filtrate despite the filter being pre-conditioned (up to 3 times). Principle component analysis revealed that filtrates at different purge intervals are distant from the unfiltered samples. Pre-conditioning of the PTFE membrane filters could potentially reduce the number of extractable impurities across the tested brands. PVDF filtrates, however, tend to co-cluster with their respective brands, thus suggesting that dissimilarity persists in brands following conditioning. As such, pre-conditioning of the PTFE membrane filters should be encouraged so as to reduce false positive results, while the use of PVDF membrane filters for mass-spectrometry-based untargeted analysis is not advisable as extractable impurities would still persist after 3 rounds of conditioning. Neither the use of different filter brands, nor the use of different filter materials in a sample batch are encouraged as different membrane materials or brands could potentially elute varying impurities.  aPublisher supplied data 3afalse positive results 3afilters 3afiltrates 3amass spectrometry 3aprincipal component analysis 3athermoplastics1 aHerng Lee, Dexter Jiunn1 aMak, Ken Hing1 aAng, Hui Jun1 aChen, Hsing-Chang1 aMoh, Pak Yan1 aFong, Siat Yee1 aLing, Yee Soon0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 08, v. 9, no. 55 p.31918-31927dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06198c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245005900155300001300214520181400227592002802041650004402069650001302113650001302126650002702139650003902166650002102205650001202226650001702238650001202255650002102267650004402288650001302332650001102345650002402356650001702380650003702397650001002434700002302444700002102467700001502488700001802503773012302521856007702644852000902721655001202730IND60765107020221119163050.0220904e20140123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510702DNAL7 a10.17221/39/2013-swr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnev, V.10aSpectral characterization of selected humic substances  ap. 9-17.  aCurrent concern for soil quality has stimulated research on soil organic matter (OM). Humic substances (HS) of different origin were compared applying ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), &ldquo;steady-state&rdquo; fluorescence spectroscopy, and <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>13</sup>C NMR). Sodium humates samples were isolated from soil (Gleyic Luvisol), compost, and South-Moravian lignite from the mine M&iacute;r in Mikulčice. Sodium humates (SH) were extracted by a conventional procedure recommended by the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS). Results showed that the presence of O-containing functional groups (carbonyl in aldehydes and ketones, carboxyl in carboxylic acids, ester and ether groups) are in the order of compost > soil > lignohumate > lignite. Further, results of FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy, and <sup>13</sup>C NMR suggested that samples of sodium humates isolated from soil, compost, and lignite were a more polycondensed, oxidized, unsaturated, humified, and aromatic structure. On the other hand, commercial lignohumate (LH) had very simple structural components and wide molecular heterogeneity. Furthermore, a small molecular size and weight, low degree of aromatic polycondensation, low level of conjugated chromophores and fluorophores, and low humification degree were characteristic for commercial LH.

In this work, Co-doped Fe₃O₄ magnetic particles encapsulated by zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-Fe₃O₄@UiO-66) were prepared and employed to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the elimination of fenitrothion (FNT) and the simultaneous in-situ adsorption of produced phosphate. The catalyst exhibited efficient catalytic performance, achieving above 90.0% removal of FNT (10 mg/L) in the presence of PMS (1 mM) within 60 min. Moreover, the produced phosphate during the degradation process was also completely adsorbed onto the catalyst. Both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals were responsible for the degradation of FNT. The degradation products of FNT in the system were identified and the possible pathways were proposed. This study represents a promising and adoptable strategy to develop other versatile composite nanomaterials in a green manner hence broadening its environmental application range, as it can not only remove OPPs by catalytic oxidation but also immobilize degraded phosphorus by adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afenitrothion 3amagnetism 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3asulfates 0aMetal-organic framework 0aFenitrothion 0aPeroxymonosulfate 0aAdsorption 0aCatalytic degradation1 aSun, Yue1 aGu, Yingpeng0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 436 p.129058-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1290583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011100169300001600280500001500296520147300311592002801784650002401812650001501836650001101851650001401862650002001876650001501896650001501911650002901926650002301955651001201978651001001990653001502000653001702015653001302032653001102045653001402056653002902070700002002099700001702119700002002136700003002156700002102186700001902207700001802226700001802244700001802262700001502280700001702295700001502312700002302327773010802350856008602458852000902544655001202553IND50060356920221120230757.0190318e20130116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006035692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.11.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeacock, Mike10aQuantifying dissolved organic carbon concentrations in upland catchments using phenolic proxy measurements  ap. 251-260.  a2019-12-06  aConcentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil and stream waters in upland catchments are widely monitored, in part due to the potential of DOC to form harmful by-products when chlorinated during treatment of water for public supply. DOC can be measured directly, though this is expensive and time-consuming. Light absorbance in the UV–vis spectrum is often used as a surrogate measurement from which a colour-carbon relationship between absorbance and DOC can be derived, but this relationship can be confounded by numerous variables. Through the analysis of data from eight sites in England and Wales we investigate the possibility of using the concentration of phenolic compounds in water samples as a proxy for DOC concentration. A general model using data from all the sites allowed DOC to be calculated from phenolics at an accuracy of 81–86%. A detailed analysis at one site revealed that a site-specific calibration was more accurate than the general model, and that this compared favourably with a colour-carbon calibration. We therefore recommend this method for use where estimates of DOC concentration are needed, but where time and money are limiting factors, or as an additional method to calculate DOC alongside colour-carbon calibrations. Tests demonstrated only small amounts of phenolic degradation over time; a loss of 0.92mgL−1 after 8months in storage, and so this method can be used on older samples with limited loss of accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3apublic water supply 3aabsorbance 3amodels 3ahighlands 3awater treatment 3awatersheds 3asoil water 3adissolved organic carbon 3aphenolic compounds 3aEngland 3aWales 0aAbsorbance 0aWater colour 0aPeatland 0acarbon 0aPhenolics 0aDissolved organic carbon1 aBurden, Annette1 aCooper, Mark1 aDunn, Christian1 aEvans, C.

This research aimed to clarify the influence of fruit exposure to light and postharvest water loss on the concentration of green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and lipoxygenase (LOX) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity of grapes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nebbiolo grapes from Control vines (no defoliation) (ND) and from vines defoliated at fruitset (DFS) or defoliated post‐veraison (DPV) were harvested at about 23°Brix and dehydrated at 10 and 20°C, 60% RH and air flow of 1.5 m/s. Berries were sampled at 10 and 20% mass loss (ML). Significant differences in crop yield, bunch mass and berry mass were observed. As expected, the higher the dehydration temperature, the faster the dehydration process: 20% ML at 20°C occurred between 18 and 25 days, the shortest time corresponding to ND and the longest to DFS; at 10°C, the dehydration lasted between 27 and 32 days. At 10°C, the ADH activity was almost double that at 20°C, and in DFS was much higher than in other samples. At harvest, LOX did not show any difference among the samples, while at 10°C and 10% ML, the enzyme activity increased significantly and then declined at 20% ML, especially in defoliated samples. At harvest, the total free GLVs associated with the metabolism of lipid oxidation were 9434, 7212 and 11 656 μg/kg dry weight (DW) in ND, DFS and DPV samples, respectively; the total bound GLVs lipid‐derived were 7599, 18 486 and 15 409 μg/kg DW in ND, DFS and DPV samples, respectively. During dehydration at 10°C, the ML induced ADH + LOX activity, especially in defoliated samples, but the bound GLVs, produced by defoliation, greatly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Defoliation affected the response of Nebbiolo grapes to dehydration temperature: postharvest cold stress (10°C) and ML induced glycosylation of GLVs, alcohol formation (via ADH) and membrane oxidation (via LOX); a further stress effect was observed with leaf removal, regardless of the time of application. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The timing of defoliation and postharvest dehydration temperature are significant factors to mitigate the postharvest stress response of Nebbiolo grapes.  aPublisher supplied data  cItalian Ministry of Agriculture  cItalian Ministry of University 3aair flow 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aalcohols 3acold stress 3acrop yield 3adefoliation 3aenzyme activity 3afruits 3aglycosylation 3agrapes 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3alipoxygenases 3aoxidation 3aresearch 3astress response 3atemperature 3awines1 aGenovese, A.1 aRustioni, L.1 aMoio, L.1 aFailla, O.1 aBellincontro, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5856-70241 aMencarelli, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0677-50100 tAustralian journal of grape and wine research.g2022 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.107-118dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl4138516x1322-71307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajgw.125213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245005200158300001800210520113200228592002801360650001201388650001701400650001401417650001301431700001401444700001601458700002001474700001801494700002101512773013201533856007801665852000901743655001201752IND60541310720221117060353.0160821e20150805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054131072DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b057582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Zheng10aStepwise Motion in a Multivalent [2](3)Catenane  ap. 9739-9745.  aThe motions of biomolecular machines are usually multistep processes, and are involved in a series of conformational changes. In this paper, a novel triply interlocked [2](3)catenane composed of a tris(crown ether) host eTC and a circular ditopic guest with three dibenzyl ammonium (DBA) sites and three N-methyltriazolium (MTA) sites was reported. Due to the multivalency nature of the catenane, the acid–base triggered motion was performed by a stepwise manner. The coconformations of the four related stable states have been directly identified and quantified which confirmed the multistep process. In order to quantify the dynamics with environmental acidity changes, the values of the three levels of dissociation constant pKₐ have been determined. The special interlocked topology of the [2](3)catenane also endows the motion of each crown ether ring in the host with unexpected selectivity for the MTA sites. This study provides clues to comprehend the underlying motion mechanism of intricate biological molecular machines, and further design artificial molecular machine with excellent mechanochemistry properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3adissociation 3aequipment 3atopology1 aHan, Ying1 aWang, Lina,1 aXiang, Jun-Feng1 aHe, Sheng-Gui1 aChen, Chuan-Feng0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Aug. 05, v. 137, no. 30 p.9739-9745dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b057583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245012100181300001600302520161700318592002801935650002201963650001001985650001201995650002502007650001302032650001202045650001102057650001102068650000902079650002402088650001402112650000902126650002502135650002602160650001202186650004302198650003502241650002902276650001102305650000902316650000902325650002102334650001502355650001702370650002902387650001902416650003002435650003302465700001802498700002002516700001502536700001702551700001602568700001902584700001402603773011202617856008102729852000902810655001202819IND50067664320221120151536.0141111e20130730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006766432DNAL7 a237020362pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cong10aCycloartane triterpenoid saponins from water soluble of Passiflora edulis Sims and their antidepressant-like effects  ap. 812-817.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Various species of genus Passiflora have been used as traditional folk medicines owing to their sedative and anti-hypertensive properties. Passiflora edulis Sims most widely grown in the warm temperate for their fragrant fruits and their twigs and leaves are used as a folk medicine for treating both anxiety and nervousness in American countries. The present study was to evaluate the antidepressant-like effect and the active components of this plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The alcohol extracts of the stems (PES, 10 and 2g/kg of the plant materials) and leaves (PEL, 10 and 2g/kg of the plant materials) of Passiflora edulis Sims were orally administered to mice for 7 day. The animals were tested in the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). After behavioral assay of ethanol extract, phytochemical research of the stems and leaves (5.7kg) of Passiflora edulis Sims were developed and further bioactive verification of monomeric compounds were conducted. RESULTS: There are mainly cycloartane triterpenoids and their saponins isolated from this plant, including two new cycloartane triterpenoid saponins named cyclopassifloside ХII (1) and ХIII (2), together with six known cycloartane triterpenoids, cyclopassifloic acids B and E, cyclopassiflosides II, VI, IX and XI. The ethanol extract of Passiflora edulis Sims together with isolated compounds cyclopassiflosides IX and XI may possess antidepressant-like effect. CONCLUSIONS: Cycloartane triterpenoid was one of the main compositions of Passiflora edulis Sims and possess antidepressant-like activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPassiflora edulis 3aacids 3aanxiety 3abioactive properties 3abranches 3aethanol 3afruits 3aleaves 3amice 3aoral administration 3asedatives 3atail 3atraditional medicine 3atriterpenoid saponins 2aAnimals 2aAntidepressive Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aDepressionxdrug therapy 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aPassiflora 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Components, Aerial 2aPlant Extracts 2aSaponinsxtherapeutic use 2aTriterpenesxtherapeutic use1 aXu, Feng-Qing1 aShang, Jian-Hua1 aXiao, Huai1 aFan, Wei-Wei1 aDong, Fa-Wu1 aHu, Jiang-Miao1 aZhou, Jun0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 July 30, v. 148, no. 3 p.812-817dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01809naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245002300158300001600181520103700197592002801234650001201262650001301274650002101287650000901308773014001317856007701457852000901534655001201543IND60765107220221119163142.0220714e20161128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510722DNAL7 a10.17221/39/2015-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrožek, M.10aBonding of plywood  ap. 198-204.  aThe contribution contains results of bonded joints strength tests.

The rupture force and the rupture type were registered. Finally, the technical-economical evaluation of the experiments was carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplywood 3aresearch 3atensile strength 3awood0 tResearch in Agricultural Engineering.g, v. 62, no. 4 p.198-204dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21420x1212-91517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/39/2015-rae3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013200162300002000294520135100314592002801665650002401693650001301717650001801730650002201748650001901770650001301789650001901802650001301821650001801834650001501852650001501867650001901882650003701901650001601938700002501954700001801979700001601997700001902013700002002032700001902052773012402071856007402195852000902269655001202278IND60672343920221118061437.0191016e20191009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067234392DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06300e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirke, Yogita M.10aInfluence of nitrogen/phosphorus-doped carbon dots on polyamide thin film membranes for water vapor/N₂ mixture gas separation  ap. 32121-32129.  aNanoparticles have been attracting attention because they can significantly improve the performance of membranes when added in small amounts. In this study, the effect of polyamide membranes incorporating hydrophilic nitrogen/phosphorus-doped carbon dots (NP-CDs) to enhance water vapor/N₂ separation has been investigated. NP-CD nanoparticles with many hydrophilic functional groups are synthesized from chitosan by a one-pot green method and introduced to the surface of the polysulfone (PSf) substrates by interfacial polymerization reaction. The mean particle diameter of NP-CDs, estimated from transmission electron microscopy images, is 2.6 nm. By adding NP-CDs (0–1.5 wt%) to the polyamide layer, the contact angles of the membranes dramatically decreased from 65° (PSf) to <9° (thin film nanocomposite (TFN)), which means that the TFN membranes become significantly hydrophilic. From the water vapor separation results, the addition of NP-CDs in the polyamide layer improves the water vapor permeance from 1511 (thin film composite (TFC) without nanoparticles) to 2448 GPU (TFN with 1.0 wt% NP-CD loading, CD-TFN(1.0)) and the water vapor/N₂ selectivity from 73 (TFC) to 854 (CD-TFN(1.0)). To our knowledge, this is the first study of highly functionalized NP-CD-incorporated polyamide membranes to enhance water vapor separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon quantum dots 3achitosan 3acontact angle 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrophilicity 3amoieties 3ananocomposites 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3aphosphorus 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater vapor1 aAbou-Elanwar, Ali M.1 aChoi, Won-Kil1 aLee, Hyojin1 aHong, Seong Uk1 aLee, Hyung Keun1 aJeon, Jae-Deok0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 09, v. 9, no. 55 p.32121-32129dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06300e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245014700209300001800356500001500374506007600389520153300465592002801998506003702026650002202063650001002085650001802095650002002113650002802133650003102161650001402192650002102206650002102227650001502248650005202263650001202315650002402327650001402351650002502365653001302390653000802403653001002411653001202421653001102433653002402444653002002468700001302488700001702501700001402518700001602532700001602548700002002564700001802584700001602602700001802618700002202636700001902658773009302677856008402770961001302854852000902867655001202876IND60542012120221207101200.0161020e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054201212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.04.0162doi7 aPMC44237522pmcid7 a247806452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiaren14aThe cytochrome P450 genes of channel catfish: Their involvement in disease defense responses as revealed by meta-analysis of RNA-Seq data sets  ap. 2813-2828.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCytochrome P450s (CYPs) encode one of the most diverse enzyme superfamily in nature. They catalyze oxidative reactions of endogenous molecules and exogenous chemicals.We identified CYPs genes through in silico analysis using EST, RNA-Seq and genome databases of channel catfish. Phylogenetic analyses and conserved syntenic analyses were conducted to determine their identities and orthologies. Meta-analysis of RNA-Seq databases was conducted to analyze expression profile of CYP genes following bacterial infection.A full set of 61 CYP genes was identified and characterized in channel catfish. Phylogenetic tree and conserved synteny provided strong evidence of their identities and orthorlogy. Lineage-specific gene duplication was evident in a number of clans in channel catfish. CYP46A1 is missing in the catfish genome as observed with syntenic analysis and RT-PCR analysis. Thirty CYPs were found up- or down-regulated in liver, while seven and eight CYPs were observed regulated in intestine and gill following bacterial infection.We systematically identified and characterized a full set of 61 CYP genes in channel catfish and studied their expression profiles after bacterial infection. While bacterial challenge altered the expression of large numbers of CYP genes, the mechanisms and significance of these changes are not known.This work provides an example to systematically study CYP genes in non-model species. Moreover, it provides a basis for further toxicological and physiological studies in channel catfish.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asequence analysis 3aliver 3ameta-analysis 3adata collection 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression regulation 3aphylogeny 3acytochrome P-450 3agene duplication 3aintestines 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3acatfish 3aIctalurus punctatus 3adatabases 3abacterial infections 0aImmunity 0aCYP 0agenes 0aCatfish 0aGenome 0aBacterial infection 0aCytochrome P4501 aYao, Jun1 aWang, Ruijia1 aZhang, Yu1 aLiu, Shikai1 aSun, Luyang1 aJiang, Yanliang1 aFeng, Jianbin1 aLiu, Nannan1 aNelson, David1 aWaldbieser, Geoff1 aLiu, Zhanjiang0 tBBA - General Subjects.g2014 Sept., v. 1840 p.2813-2828dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245017500174520128500349592002801634650002601662650000801688650001701696650002501713650001301738650002101751650001601772650001601788650003601804650002301840650001001863650001901873650002501892650001001917653002301927653001901950653002401969653002001993653001202013700002102025700001802046700001902064700002202083700001802105773011902123856008802242852000902330655001202339IND60733327920221120232742.0220906e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073332792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1469072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Pratiksha10aImpact of chronic elevated ozone exposure on photosynthetic traits and anti-oxidative defense responses of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de wit tree under field conditions  aIn this study, the impact of long term exposure of elevated ozone (+20 ppb above ambient) on photosynthetic traits and anti-oxidative defense system of Leucaena leucocephala, a tree of great economic importance, was studied in a Free Air Ozone Concentration Enrichment (O₃-FACE) facility at different time intervals (6, 12, 18, and 24 months). Results showed that net photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments and lipid peroxidation were significantly reduced after 6, 12 and 24 months of exposure to elevated ozone (eO₃) whereas stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were significantly decreased after 12 months of exposure to eO₃. Antioxidant enzymatic activities (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) were significantly increased after 12 months of exposure to eO₃. Ascorbate was increased significantly after 6 and 12 months of exposure to eO₃ while reduced glutathione content declined significantly after 6 and 24 months of exposure to eO₃. The study showed that there were several negative long lasting physiological and biochemical responses in Leucaena. The results provide evidence that Leucaena exhibited greater sensitivity to O₃ during initial exposure (up to 12 months) but showed moderate tolerance by the end of the 2nd year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3aair 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3achronic exposure 3aenvironment 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3alipid peroxidation 3aozone 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3atrees 0aTropospheric ozone 0aElevated ozone 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aL. leucocephala 0aO3-FACE1 aKannaujia, Rekha1 aNarayan, Shiv1 aTewari, Ashish1 aShirke, Pramod A.1 aPandey, Vivek0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 782 p.146907-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1469073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02034naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245015600165300001600321520087400337592002801211650002201239650001701261650001201278650002101290650002201311650001201333650000901345650001301354650003301367650001201400700001601412700002101428773013701449856007701586852000901663655001201672IND60521935120221123035721.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052193512DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-05162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacher, Alfred D.10aEin neuer Zugang zu Tetrathiooxalaten.

The present study was undertaken with the following objectives: (1) to find acceptable levels of ingredients on a dry mass basis to constitute the chhana podo feed-mix and (2) to conduct a sensory evaluation study of chhana podo samples. In addition to chhana and sugar, different additional ingredients were tried in various proportions, namely, cornflour, refined wheat flour, raw semolina and roasted semolina. Acceptable levels of roasted semolina and sugar in the feed-mix was found to be 0.1 kg (db) and 0.5 kg (db) respectively per kg of chhana (db). Five samples (two market samples, two samples produced at other conditions and one produced at optimum conditions, wherein constrained optimization was done using genetic algorithm) were evaluated and results were analyzed using fuzzy logic (similarity analysis). Analysis of samples using fuzzy logic showed that product produced at optimum conditions as obtained from constrained optimization using genetic algorithm was indeed better than other samples. Importance of quality attributes for chhana podo in general was (in decreasing order): taste, color, aroma and mouthfeel. For the optimized product, the most important quality attribute was taste, followed by mouthfeel, color and aroma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acolor 3acorn flour 3adairy products 3afuzzy logic 3aingredients 3amarkets 3amouthfeel 3aodors 3asemolina 3asensory evaluation 3asugars 3ataste 3awheat flour 3aIndia 0aChhana podo 0aGenetic algorithm 0aFuzzy logic 0aSensory evaluation 0aSimilarity analysis1 aMajumdar, G.C.1 aGoswami, T.K.1 aMishra, H.N.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 Sept., v. 53, no. 1 p.204-210dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2013.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245010300160300001600263520114900279592002801428650001701456650001101473650001701484650002601501650001901527650001301546650001801559650001201577650001801589700001701607773015201624856007701776852000901853655001201862IND60765107620221119163122.0220422e20171222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510762DNAL7 a10.17221/39/2017-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetr, Šařec10aChanges in soil properties due to the application of activators in conditions of very heavy soils  ap.

Their application should lead to a change in physical, physical-chemical and biological properties of soil, along with ecological material fixation, improved water retention and infiltration, reduction of soil susceptibility to water erosion and decreased soil tillage energy requirements. Field trial was established in Sloveč in Central Bohemia in the year 2014. The experiment was divided into several variants and was designed as multiannual. Z›fix activator was used as a biological transformation activator of manure. PRP Sol was used as a soil activator. In order to verify the effect, soil infiltration, cone index, bulk density and draft of tillage implement were measured. Measurements have shown a beneficial effect of the activators with regard to the decomposition of organic matter. Consequently, changes in soil properties and a reduction of draft at tillage operations developed. Finally, the effect should evolve gradually with a prolonged activator treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aenergy 3afermentation 3afield experimentation 3aorganic matter 3aresearch 3asoil strength 3atillage 3awater erosion1 aPetr, Novák0 tResearch in Agricultural Engineering.g, v. 63, no.

To graft saccharides onto the plane of GO, it was reacted with sodium azide to introduce azide groups on the plane. Then, it was treated with alkyne-modified glucose, mannose, galactose, and maltose. In the next approach, we attached 1,3-diazideoprop-2-ol onto the edges of GO and it was subsequently clicked with alkyne-glucose. The products were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field-emission scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction spectrometry. FTIR and TGA results showed both sugar-grafted GO sheets were reduced by sodium ascorbate during click-coupling reaction which is an advantage for this reaction. Besides, glycoside-grafted GNS were easily dispersed in water and stable for two weeks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkynes 3aascorbic acid 3acopper 3acycloaddition reactions 3agalactose 3aglucose 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3amaltose 3amannose 3ananosheets 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium azide 3athermogravimetry 3awater solubility 0aGraphene oxide 0aClick chemistry 0aCarbohydrate 0aWater-soluble1 aNamazi, Hassan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2457-14840 tCarbohydrate research.g2014 Sept. 19, v. 396 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2014.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245020600159300001600365520101400381592002801395650001601423650001301439650002201452650001501474650004401489650001101533650001101544700002001555700002501575700001801600700001901618773015001637856007701787852000901864655001201873IND60521935220221117164321.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052193522DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-05172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButh, Silke10aSynthese und Kristallstrukturen von Tris(glykolato)molybdän(VI) und Tris(pinakolato)molybdän(VI) / Syntheses and Crystal Structures of Tris(glycolato)molybdenum(VI) and Tris(pinacolato)molybdenum(VI)  ap. 706-712.  aPPh₄[MoN(OPh)₄] has been prepared by reaction of PPh₄[MoNCl₄] with sodium phenolate, as an orange-red crystal powder.

AHD was derivatised with 4-carboxybenzaldehyde to produce 1-[(4-carbo-benzylidene)-amino]-imidazolidin-2,4-dione (CPAHD). Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against AHD were prepared through immunization of BALB/c mice with synthesized CPAHD–Jeffamine–BSA as an antigen. Luminol, p-iodophenol, and urea peroxide mixture solution served as the substrate in CLELISA. The specificity of the MAb, estimated as the cross-reactivity values from the dcCLEILISA assay for 1-[(4-nitro-benzylidene)-amino]-imidazolidin-2,4-dione (NPAHD) and CPAHD, was 100% and 39.67%, respectively. All other compounds showed less than 0.01%. The sensitivity of the antibody, estimated as the IC₅₀ value, was 0.60 μg L⁻¹. The limits of detection for dcCLELISA in fish and honey samples were 0.1 and 0.28 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, and the mean recovery values ranged from 83.6% to 94.7% for fortified samples at levels of 0.25–10 μg kg⁻¹ with coefficient of variation values below 15%. Finally, dcCLELISA was compared to a commercial kit in the detection of AHD in spiked fish and honey samples. The immunoassay method described here showed a broad detection range and high sensitivity. It could be used for high-throughput monitoring of AHD in fish and honey samples and possibly other types of food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aantigens 3achemiluminescence 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afish 3ahoney 3aimmunization 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ametabolites 3amice 3amonitoring 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anitrofurantoin 3aurea1 aLiu, Yingjun,1 aChen, Yong-Jun1 aJiang, Wei1 aShi, Jin-Lei1 aXiao, Yan1 aZhang, Meng0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 May 29, v. 6, no. 12 p.4414-4420dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00487f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245021700159300002000376520193200396592002802328650001602356650001402372650001202386650001202398650001502410650001302425650001402438650001702452650001702469650001102486650003202497650001202529650001002541650001302551650001302564650001902577650001402596650000702610650001302617650001702630650001302647650001102660650001302671650001402684700002402698700002002722700001902742700004202761773012402803856007402927852000903001655001203010IND60672344420221118061603.0191016e20191007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067234442DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06488e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellam, Rajesh10aSeven membered chelate Pt(ii) complexes with 2,3-di(2-pyridyl)quinoxaline ligands: studies of substitution kinetics by sulfur donor nucleophiles, interactions with CT-DNA, BSA and in vitro cytotoxicity activities  ap. 31877-31894.  aDichloro platinum(ii) complexes coordinated with 2,3-di(2-pyridyl)quinoxaline ligands which form seven-membered chelates namely, bpqPtCl₂, dmbpqPtCl₂ and bbqPtCl₂ (where bpq, dmbpq and bbq are 2,3-di(2-pyridyl)quinoxaline, 6,7-dimethyl-2,3-di(2-pyridyl)quinoxaline and 2,3-bis(2′pyriyl)benzo[g]quinoxaline, respectively) were synthesized, characterised and their respective hydrated product complexes namely, bpqPt(OH₂)₂²⁺, dmbpqPt(OH₂)₂²⁺ and bbqPt(OH₂)₂²⁺ were prepared by chloride metathesis. The substitution kinetics of the aquated cations by thiourea nucleophiles indicated that the two aqua ligands are substituted simultaneously according to the rate law: kₒbₛ = k₂[Nu]. This is followed by a forced dechelation of the ligands from the Pt (II) to form Pt(Nu)₄²⁺ species. The dechelation step is considerably slow to be monitored reliably. The rate of substitution is marginally enhanced by introducing two methyl groups and by extending the π-conjugation on the bpq core ligand. The reactivity order increased as bpqPt(OH₂)₂²⁺ < dmbpqPt(OH₂)₂²⁺ < bbqPt(OH₂)₂²⁺. Reactivity trends were well supported by theoretical computed DFT electronic descriptors. The interactions of the Pt(ii) complexes with CT-DNA and BSA were also examined spectroscopically in tris buffers at pH 7.2. Spectroscopic and viscosity measurements suggested strong associative interactions between the Pt(ii) complexes and CT-DNA, most likely through groove binding. In silico theoretical binding studies showed energetically stable poses through associative non-covalent interactions. In vitro MTT cytotoxicity IC₅₀ values of the Pt(ii) complexes on human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) cancer cell lines revealed bbqPtCl₂ as the least active. The fluorescence staining assays revealed the morphological changes suggested early apoptotic induction as well as non-specific necrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aapoptosis 3abuffers 3acations 3acell lines 3achelates 3achlorides 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aligands 3aliver 3amoieties 3anecrosis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aplatinum 3aspectroscopy 3astaining 3asulfur 3athiourea 3aviscosity1 aJaganyi, Deogratius1 aMambanda, Allen1 aRobinson, Ross1 aBalaKumaran, Manickam Dakshinamoorthi0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 07, v. 9, no. 55 p.31877-31894dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06488e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014600154300002200300520101900322592002801341650004401369650002201413650003801435650001301473650001401486650001301500650002201513650001101535650001601546650002201562650001401584700001301598700002001611700001901631773012701650856007401777852000901851655001201860IND60641308520221117033419.0190505e20161025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064130852DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra22151c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Jian14aThe nitrogen-rich energetic compound 4-carboxamide-5-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole and its 1D sodium complex: synthesis and properties  ap. 101430-101436.  aThe new nitrogen-rich energetic compound 4-carboxamide-5-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole (2) and its sodium complex (3) have been synthesized using diaminomaleodinitrile as the starting material in a three step synthesis.

We explore plant-soil relationships in this species by evaluating plant performance and soil physicochemical properties in the different types of ecosystems where it grows. METHODS: Ten natural populations from southern Spain were chosen for the study. In each experimental site, a number of variables related to the growth, reproduction and nutritional status of G. flavum were studied and an analysis of the soil physicochemical properties (texture, pH, electrical conductivity and total N, P, S and Ca concentration) was conducted. Data were statistically analyzed in order to characterize the habitat of G. flavum and to explore possible relationships between the studied variables. RESULTS: At all experimental sites, the soil presented an alkaline pH and high concentrations of Ca. Despite the low levels of soil N, P and S, our data did not indicate nutrient deficiencies in leaf tissues. The percentage of reproductive plants and number of seeds per fruit correlated positively with leaf Ca concentrations.

However, MB induces tumors of pancreatic islets and small intestine in experimental animals. This finding raises a possibility that MB induces carcinogenicity in these organs via light-independent mechanisms, although MB is known to cause light-dependent DNA damage.We investigated the mechanism of MB-induced DNA damage using 32P-5′-end-labeled DNA fragments of human tumor-relevant genes. We investigated the redox reaction of MB by UV–visible spectrometry.MB induced DNA damage at the 5′-ACG-3′ sequence, a hot spot of the p53 gene, in the presence of NADH and Cu(II). DNA damage was inhibited by catalase and bathocuproine, a Cu(I)-specific chelator. MB induced DNA damage at every nucleotide in the presence of NADH and Fe(III)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, which was inhibited by OH scavengers and catalase. MB significantly increased the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine, an oxidative DNA lesion, in the presence of NADH and metal ions. UV–visible spectrometry revealed that the absorbance of oxidized form of MB at 668nm was decreased by NADH, and the addition of metal ions attenuated the spectral change.MB undergoes NADH-dependent reduction followed by metal ion-mediated reoxidation. Reduced metal ions [Cu(I) and Fe(II)] interact with H2O2, generated during the redox reaction, to produce Cu(I)OOH and OH that cause DNA damage, respectively. These findings suggest that metal-mediated DNA damage contributes to MB-mediated carcinogenesis.This study would provide an insight into the mechanism of MB-induced carcinogenesis and its safety assurance for clinical use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA fragmentation 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aabsorbance 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinogenicity 3acatalase 3achelating agents 3acopper 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3aislets of Langerhans 3alaboratory animals 3ametal ions 3amethemoglobinemia 3amethylene blue 3apancreatic neoplasms 3asmall intestine 3aspectroscopy 0aMB 0aUV 0a1O2 0aNTP 0aROS 0a8-oxodG 0aHPLC–ECD 0aDTPA 0aSOD 0aFpg 0aEDTA 0aANOVA 0aO2− 0aH2O2 0aOH 0aMethylene blue 0aDNA damage 0aMetal ion 0aReactive oxygen species 0aNADH 0aCarcinogenesis1 aGotō, Hiroyuki,1 aKohno, Masaki1 aKawanishi, Shosuke1 aMurata, Mariko0 tBBA - General Subjects.g2014 Sept., v. 1840 p.2776-2782dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245009500190300001400285520120100299592002801500650002701528650002201555650001601577650001201593650001101605650002101616650001801637650001801655650001401673650001401687650001201701650003901713650001401752650003001766650001101796650003301807650003001840650003001870650005301900650003701953650005201990700002602042700002002068700002002088773010802108856008402216990002302300852000902323655001202332IND60097909520221119153641.0141104e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009790952DNAL7 a234618512pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshimaru, Makiko10aInvolvement of P2Y₁₁ receptor in IFN-γ-induced IL-6 production in human keratinocytes  ap. 67-73.  aExtracellular ATP and P2 receptors are reported to be involved in interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by human keratinocytes, but the role of extracellular ATP in cytokine-induced IL-6 production remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the involvement of various P2 receptors in IL-6 production induced by the Th1 cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. IFN-γ increased IL-6 production in HaCaT cells. A non-selective antagonist of P2Y receptors (suramin), a selective P2Y₁₁ receptor antagonist (NF157), ecto-nucleotidase (apyrase), and a soluble adenylate cyclase inhibitor (KH7) all inhibited IL-6 production. It was further confirmed that ATP was released from HaCaT cells stimulated with IFN-γ. These results suggest that extracellular ATP and P2Y₁₁ receptor are involved in IFN-γ-induced IL-6 production. Knockdown of P2Y₁₁ receptor suppressed IL-6 production, strongly supporting this idea. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that P2Y₁₁ receptor mediates IFN-γ-induced IL-6 production in human keratinocytes, and suggest the importance of purinergic signaling in IFN-γ-induced skin inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenylate cyclase 3aantagonists 3aapyrase 3ahumans 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-6 3akeratinocytes 3apsoriasis 3areceptors 3asuramin 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aGene Knockdown Techniques 2aHumans 2aInterferon-gammaxmetabolism 2aInterleukin-6xmetabolism 2aKeratinocytesxmetabolism 2aPurinergic P2 Receptor Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics 2aReceptors, Purinergic P2xgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aTsukimoto, Mitsutoshi1 aHarada, Hitoshi1 aKojima, Shūji,0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 703, no. 1-3 p.67-73dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.02.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011100166300001600277520107300293536053501366592002801901596008301929596011602012596010302128596011402231596007702345650000902422650001502431650002002446650001102466650002202477650001602499650001602515650001102531650002102542650001302563650001802576650001602594650001402610651001002624653002502634653002102659653002202680653003202702653001802734700001302752700001602765700001902781773013102800856008502931852000903016655001203025IND60639732020221117065732.0190503e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063973202DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2019.15675912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Yu-Li10aLeaf blight caused by Curvularia coicis on Chinese pearl barley (Coix chinensis) in Fujian Province, China  ap. 270-276.  aChinese pearl barley (Coix chinensis Tod.) is grown worldwide as a cereal food and medicinal plant. During 2016 and 2017, a severe leaf blight outbreak was observed in Nanjing prefecture, Fujian Province, China. The disease outbreak affected almost 100% of the Chinese pearl barley plants under field conditions. The pathogen was isolated from infected leaves showing typical symptoms of dark brown spots surrounded by yellow halos, and was identified as Curvularia coicis Castellani based on morphological characteristics and sequencing of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (rDNA-ITS). The optimal temperature for mycelial growth of C. coicis on potato dextrose agar (PDA) ranged from 25°C to 28°C. Pathogenicity assays were performed using Chinese pearl barley ‘Longyi 1' at the seven- to eight-leaf stage. Overall, C. coicis had a high virulence on these inoculated plants, even in the absence of wounds, and the pathogen was successfully reisolated. The results from this study identified the causal organism of leaf blight on Chinese pearl barley.  aThis study was supported by (a) the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest of Fujian Province, China (2017R1025-3 and 2018R1025-1), (b) the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFD0200706); (c) the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China (2016J05073), (d) the 100 Youth Science and Technology Talents Project of Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences (YC2016-4), and (e) the Innovation Team of Plant Protection, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences (STIT2017-1-8).  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0200706c(b) the National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2017R1025-3c(a) the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest of Fujian Province, China  aSTIT2017-1-8c(e) the Innovation Team of Plant Protection, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences  aYC2016-4c(d) the 100 Youth Science and Technology Talents Project of Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences  a2016J05073c(c) the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China 3aCoix 3aCurvularia 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3adisease outbreaks 3agrain foods 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amycelium 3aribosomal DNA 3atemperature 3avirulence 3aChina 0aChinese pearl barley 0aCoix leaf blight 0aCurvularia coicis 0ainternal transcribed spacer 0apathogenicity1 aGan, Lin1 aChen, Fu-Ru1 aYang, Xiu-Juan0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 41, no. 2 p.270-276dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43214x1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2019.15675913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001700168245013600185300001600321520109900337592002801436650001201464650001301476650002001489650003101509650004201540650002201582650001501604650001801619650002001637650001301657650001201670650003201682650003001714650002001744650005101764650002401815650002501839650002701864650003601891700001801927700001901945700001801964700001301982700001801995700001302013700001702026700001702043700001302060700001802073700001602091700001802107700002002125773008102145856008302226852000902309655001202318IND60080897820221120044105.0140812e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008089782DNAL7 a213337332pmid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Yun-Fei10aTranscriptome profiling and digital gene expression by deep-sequencing in normal/regenerative tissues of planarian Dugesia japonica  ap. 364-371.  aPlanarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts which is attributed to an abundance of pluripotent somatic stem cells called neoblasts. In this article, we report a transcriptome sequence of a Planaria subspecies Dugesia japonica derived by high-throughput sequencing. In addition, we researched transcriptome changes during different periods of regeneration by using a tag-based digital gene expression (DGE) system. Consequently, 11,913,548 transcriptome sequencing reads were obtained. Finally, these reads were eventually assembled into 37,218 unique unigenes. These assembled unigenes were annotated with various methods. Transcriptome changes during planarian regeneration were investigated by using a tag-based DGE system. We obtained a sequencing depth of more than 3.5million tags per sample and identified a large number of differentially expressed genes at various stages of regeneration. The results provide a fairly comprehensive molecular biology background to the research on planarian development, particularly with regard to its regeneration progress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDugesia 3aPlanaria 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amolecular biology 3astem cells 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mappingxmethods 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGenes, Helminth 2aHigh-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencingxmethods 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlanariansxgenetics 2aRegenerationxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxmethods1 aFang, Huimin,1 aTian, Qing-Nan1 aBao, Zhen-Xia1 aLu, Ping1 aZhao, Jin-Mei1 aMai, Jia1 aZhu, Zhao-Yu1 aShu, Lin-Lin1 aZhao, Li1 aChen, San-Jun1 aLiang, Feng1 aZhang, Yi-Zhe1 aZhang, Shou-Tao0 tGenomics.g2011 June, v. 97, no. 6 p.364-371dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014100165300001400306520125900320592002801579650001201607650002001619650002001639650002501659650001501684650001201699650001501711650002401726650002401750651002301774700001601797700001801813700001901831700001701850773011701867856008101984852000902065655001202074IND4391921320221121042440.0151024e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439192132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-006-9320-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullivan, T.

It covered only 28% of the region, and yet included almost all known streams that have low acid neutralizing capacity (ANC ≤20 μeq l⁻¹) or that are acidic (ANC ≤0). The five-class geologic classification scheme was developed based on recent lithologic maps and streamwater chemistry data for 909 sites. The vast majority of the sampled streams that had ANC ≤20 μeq l⁻¹ and that were totally underlainby a single geologic sensitivity class occurred in the siliceous class, which is represented by such lithologies as sandstone and quartzite. Streamwater acid-base chemistry throughout the region was also found to be associated with a number of watershed features that were mapped for the entire region, in addition to lithology and elevation, including ecoregion, physiographic province, soils type, forest type and watershed area.

The Coccinellidae fauna comprises a total of 101 species: 83 from the Mainland, 39 from Madeira, and 32 from the Azores. The listed species are distributed among 2 sub-families and 13 tribes: within the subfamily Microweiseinae, Madeirodulini (1 species), Serangiini (2 species), and within the subfamily Coccinellinae, Azyini (1 species), Chilocorini (4 species), Coccidulini (7 species), Coccinellini (30 species), Epilachnini (4 species), Hyperaspidini (7 species), Noviini (2 species), Platynaspini (1 species), Scymnini (37 species), Stethorini (3 species), and Sticholotidini (2 species). The Portuguese fauna comprises 10 exotic species: 5 present in the Mainland, 7 in Madeira, and 6 in the Azores. Harmonia axyridis (Pallas, 1773) from Madeira, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (Linnaeus, 1758) from the Azores, Delphastus catalinae (Horn, 1895) from the Azores and Madeira, Nephus (Geminosipho) reunioni (Fürsch, 1974) and Nephus (Nephus) voeltzkowi Weise, 1910 from Madeira and Microserangium sp. from the Mainland, are reported for the first time. Some species are considered doubtful records, as explained in the text. These results were obtained by compiling information on the available literature regarding ladybeetle species on the Portuguese mainland and insular territories, and original data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphastus catalinae 3aHarmonia axyridis 3aNephus 3aPropylea quatuordecimpunctata 3afauna 3aintroduced species 3aAzores 3aPortugal 0aCoccinellidae 0aMadeira 0aPalearctic Region1 aCalado, Hugo Renato1 aFranco, José Carlos1 aAguiar, António Franquinho1 aAndrade, Miguel M.1 aZina, Vera1 aAmeixa, Olga M.C.C.1 aBorges, Isabel1 aMagro, Alexandra0 tZooKeys.g2021 Aug. 02, v. 1053 p.107-144dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1053.642683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006800167300002000235500001900255520085000274592002801124650001601152650001001168650001501178650001401193650001001207650001101217650001001228700001801238700006001256773011601316856008401432852000901516655001201525IND60715781220221117231348.0201103e20201023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071578122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c024102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Daniel10aMucin Biopolymers and Their Barrier Function at Airway Surfaces  ap. 12773-12783.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the lung, the airway epithelium produces secreted and tethered mucin biopolymers to form a mucus hydrogel layer and a surface-attached polymer brush layer. These layers work in concert to facilitate the cilia-mediated transport of mucus for the capture and clearance of inhaled materials to prevent lung damage. The mechanisms by which mucin biopolymers protect the lung from injury have been an intense area of study in airway biology for the past several decades. In this feature article, we will discuss how airway mucins achieve these protective barrier functions. We will present the key findings, rooted in polymer and surface science, that have aided in understanding mucin barrier function. In addition, we will describe how this work may influence the design of nanoparticles to overcome the mucus barrier to effective drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3adrugs 3aepithelium 3ahydrogels 3alungs 3amucins 3amucus1 aCahn, Devorah1 aDuncan, Gregg A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6811-13270 tLangmuir.g2020 Oct. 23, v. 36, no. 43 p.12773-12783dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c024103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012100164300002000285520218300305592002802488650002202516650001302538650001402551650001302565650001302578650001302591650002002604650002402624650001302648650000902661650002102670650002102691650001602712700005202728700006902780700005702849700002002906700001902926700001302945700006202958700006303020773011603083856008403199852000903283655001203292IND60677901220221118070023.0191213e20191025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067790122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b028642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin10aReconfigurable Multicompartment Emulsion Drops Formed by Nematic Liquid Crystals and Immiscible Perfluorocarbon Oils  ap. 16312-16323.  aLiquid crystalline (LC) oils offer the basis of stimuli-responsive LC-in-water emulsions. Although past studies have explored the properties of single-phase LC emulsions, few studies have focused on complex multicompartment emulsions containing co-existing isotropic and LC domains. In this paper, we report a study of multiphase emulsions using LCs and immiscible perfluoroalkanes dispersed in water or glycerol (the latter continuous phase is used to enable characterization). We found that the nematogen 4′-pentyl-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (5CB) anchors homeotropically (perpendicularly) and weakly at liquid perfluorononane (F9) interfaces, consistent with the smectic layering of 5CB molecules. The proposed role of smectic layering is supported by experiments performed with 4-(trans-4-pentylcyclohexyl)benzonitrile, a nematogen that possesses a cyclohexyl group that frustrates the smectic packing and leads to tilted orientations at the F9 interface. By employing perfluorocarbon and hydrocarbon surfactants in combination with multiphase 5CB and F9 emulsion droplets dispersed in a continuous water or glycerol phase, we observe a range of emulsion droplet morphologies to form, including core–shell and Janus structures, with internal organizations that reflect an interplay of interfacial (anchoring energies; F9 and glycerol) and elastic energies within the confines of the geometry of the emulsion droplet. By comparing experimental observations to simulations of the LC–perfluorocarbon droplets based on a Landau-de Gennes model of the free energy, we place bounds on the orientation-dependent interfacial energies that underlie the internal ordering of these complex emulsions. Additionally, by forming core–shells emulsion droplets from 5CB (shell) and perfluoroheptane (cores), we demonstrate how a liquid-to-vapor phase transition in the perfluorocarbon core can be used to actuate the droplet and rapidly thin the nematic shell. Overall, the results reported in this paper demonstrate that multiphase LC emulsions formed from mixtures of perfluoroalkanes and LCs provide new opportunities to engineer hierarchical and stimuli-responsive emulsion systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3ageometry 3aglycerol 3aisotropy 3aliquid crystals 3amathematical theory 3amoieties 3aoils 3aperfluorocarbons 3aphase transition 3asurfactants1 aZhou, Ye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4618-93181 aPalacio-Betancur, Viviana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1588-318X1 aKim, Young-Ki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4420-34891 aDelalande, Lily1 aTsuei, Michael1 aYang, Yu1 aDe Pablo, Juan J.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3526-516X1 aAbbott, Nicholas L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9653-03260 tLangmuir.g2019 Oct. 25, v. 35, no. 49 p.16312-16323dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b028643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011700173300001600290520105200306592002801358650001001386650002201396650001101418650001501429650001201444650001401456650001301470651001201483651001101495653001801506653000801524653001501532653001701547653001501564653001601579653002201595653001301617653001501630653001901645700002501664773009701689856008201786852000901868655001201877IND60746968920221121014649.0210811e20210802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074696892DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.1053.527612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPohjoismäki, Jaakko10aReview of the Nordic Gymnocheta Robineau-Desvoidy (Diptera, Tachinidae) with report of two species new to Europe  ap. 145-184.  aThe genus Gymnocheta Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 (Diptera, Tachinidae) has until now been represented by two species in Europe, G. viridis (Fallén, 1810) and G. magna Zimin, 1958. Two species are newly recorded from Finland and Sweden, Gymnocheta lucida Zimin, 1958 and G. zhelochovtsevi Zimin, 1958, both previously known only from the Russian Far East and Japan. These four European species are redescribed and illustrated, including the first description of the female of G. zhelochovtsevi. A key is provided to seven of the eight described species of Palaearctic Gymnocheta. The holotype of G. viridis was examined and found to differ from the present concept of the species, instead matching the concept of the more recently described G. magna. In the interests of nomenclatural stability, the two names are maintained in their current usage pending a request to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to replace the current holotype of G. viridis with a neotype that corresponds to the long-established concept of that species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aPalearctic region 3aRussia 3aTachinidae 3afemales 3aholotypes 3aneotypes 3aFinland 3aSweden 0aDNA barcoding 0aCo1 0aErnestiini 0aFennoscandia 0aGymnocheta 0anew species 0aspecies diversity 0asynonymy 0aTachininae 0atype specimens1 aBergström, Christer0 tZooKeys.g2021 Aug. 02, v. 1053 p.145-184dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1053.527613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012200164300001600286520102100302536017301323592002801496596008201524596003001606650002201636650001901658650002901677650001001706650001101716650001301727650001801740650003101758650000801789651001001797653005901807653001401866700003001880700001101910700001101921700001301932700001401945700001901959700001401978773013101992856008502123852000902208655001202217IND60639732220221117070026.0190503e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063973222DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2019.15695592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, H.L.10aLasiodiplodia theobromae and L. pseudotheobromae causing leaf necrosis on Camellia sinensis in Fujian Province, China  ap. 277-284.  aCamellia sinesis (tea) is an economically important crop in China, especially in Fujiang Province. Leaf necrosis symptoms were observed on C. sinensis in Fujian Province, China, during 2015. Initial symptoms were small brown, irregular lesions on young and mature leaves, which become necrotic with a brown margin. Isolations from diseased leaves yielded several pycnidial-forming fungi, including two Lasiodiplodia species which were characterized based on morphology and combined analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and translation elongation factor 1-α (tef) gene sequences. The isolates obtained from symptomatic leaves from C. sinensis were identified as Lasiodiplodia theobromae and L. pseudotheobromae. Pathogenicity of both species was demonstrated and symptoms which developed on inoculated C. sinensis leaves were similar to those observed on diseased plants in the field. This is the first report of L. theobromae and L. pseudotheobromae causing leaf necrosis on Camellia sinensis in China.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Plan [2016YFD0200900]; Beijing Nova Program [Z141105001814047]; CARS-19 and Beijing Talent Program.  aPublisher supplied data  aZ141105001814047cBeijing Nova Programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005090  aZ141105001814047cCARS-23 3aCamellia sinensis 3aEragrostis tef 3aLasiodiplodia theobromae 3afungi 3aleaves 3anecrosis 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3atea 3aChina 0aBotryosphaeriaceae, L. pseudotheobromae, L. theobromae 0aleaf spot1 aJayawardena, Ruvishika S.1 aXu, W.1 aHu, M.1 aLi, X.H.1 aLiu, J.H.1 aHyde, Kevin D.1 aYan, Jiye0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 41, no. 2 p.277-284dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43214x1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2019.15695593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245009800186300001400284500001500298520155300313592002801866650001101894650001901905650001201924650001701936650001401953650001401967650001301981650001601994650001702010650001102027650000902038650002402047650003902071650001202110650004202122650004302164650004802207650002502255650003802280650001902318650001402337650002802351650000902379650003202388650003202420650004102452650005502493650004602548650000902594650001702603650002602620650003702646653001502683700002302698700002102721700002002742773010802762856008402870990002302954852000902977655001202986IND60097909820221119153510.0141104e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009790982DNAL7 a232008972pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanji, David10aPiperine and curcumin exhibit synergism in attenuating d-galactose induced senescence in rats  ap. 91-99.  a2019-12-06  aAging is associated with progressive decline in mental abilities and functional capacities. Postmitotic tissues are most vulnerable to alteration due to oxidative damage leading to behavioral and biochemical changes. We hypothesized that the anatomical and functional facets of the brain could be protected with powerful antioxidants such as piperine and curcumin by examining their effects individually and in combination in delaying senescence induced by d-galactose. Young adult male Wistar rats were treated with piperine (12mg/kg) alone, and curcumin (40mg/kg) alone; and in combination for a period of 49 days by the oral route with treatment being initiated a week prior to d-galactose (60mg/kg, i.p.). A control group, d-galactose alone and naturally aged control were also evaluated. Behavioral tests, hippocampal volume, CA1 neuron number, oxidative parameters, formation of lipofuscin like autofluorescent substances, neurochemical estimation, and histopathological changes in CA1 region of hippocampus were established. Our results suggest that the combination exerted a superior response compared to monotherapy as evidenced by improved spatial memory, reduced oxidative burden, reduced accumulation of lipofuscin; improvement in signaling, increase in hippocampal volume and protection of hippocampal neurons. We speculate that the powerful antioxidant nature of both, augmented response of curcumin in the presence of piperine and enhanced serotoninergic signaling was responsible for improved cognition and prevention in senescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3amemory 3ahistopathology 3aneurons 3apharmacology 3asynergism 3acognition 3acurcumin 3ahippocampus 3aantioxidants 3aadults 3arats 2aAgingxdrug effects 2aAlkaloidsxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosage 2aBenzodioxolesxadministration & dosage 2aBrainxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aCurcuminxadministration & dosage 2aDrug Synergism 2aGalactose 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aMale 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aMaze Learningxdrug effects 2aPiperidinesxadministration & dosage 2aPolyunsaturated Alkamidesxadministration & dosage 2aPyramidal Cellsxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSerotoninxmetabolism 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 0asenescence1 aBanji, Otilia J.F.1 aDasaroju, Swetha1 aAnnamalai, A.R.0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 703, no. 1-3 p.91-99dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006400167300002000231500001900251520125800270592002801528650000801556650000901564650001301573650001901586650001501605650001901620700001201639700001601651700001401667700005601681773011601737856008401853852000901937655001201946IND60715781420221117231327.0201103e20201023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071578142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c024322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoyang10aFreezing of Nanofluid Droplets on Superhydrophobic Surfaces  ap. 13034-13040.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDroplet freezing on cold superhydrophobic surfaces has been studied extensively in recent years. However, previous works are mainly focused on studying water droplet freezing behavior; little work has been conducted to investigate the freezing dynamics of nanofluid droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces. In this work, freezing morphologies of water and nanofluid droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces with different roughnesses were compared and studied. The nanofluid droplets underwent a shape transition from spherical to flat plateau morphology, different from the frozen water droplets that exhibit a sharp cusp. The size of the flat plateau for the frozen nanofluid droplet increases with increasing nanoparticle concentration. The underlying mechanism of the morphology change during the freezing process was elucidated using COMSOL Multiphysics. Compared to the frozen water droplets, more air bubbles are trapped inside the frozen nanofluid droplets, which might be ascribed to the fast freezing speed of the nanofluid droplets. These results can provide important insights for many applications that require freezing of nanofluid droplets, such as material solidification, three-dimensional (3D) printing, as well as phase change enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acold 3adroplets 3ahydrophobicity 3ananofluids 3asolidification1 aYu, Jie1 aHu, Dinghua1 aLi, Qiang1 aChen, Xuemei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8240-27050 tLangmuir.g2020 Oct. 23, v. 36, no. 43 p.13034-13040dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c024323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245011700179300001600296520105200312536014001364592002801504596008701532650002701619650000801646650001101654650003501665650001001700650002301710650000901733650002201742650003001764650002201794650001201816651000901828653001601837653001801853653002601871700001501897700002501912700002001937773013101957856008502088852000902173655001202182IND60639732320221117070949.0190503e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063973232DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2019.15709722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahid, Muhammad Shafiq10aIdentification of Chilli leaf curl virus associated with tomato leaf curl betasatellite infecting Mentha in Oman  ap. 291-295.  aMint (Mentha sp.; family: Lamiaceae) plants showing yellowing and stunting symptoms from Salalah, Dhofar region, Oman were shown to be infected by a monopartite begomovirus (family: Geminiviridae). Cloning and sequencing of restriction endonuclease digested rolling-circle amplified viral DNA identified a begomovirus associated with the symptomatic mint plants. Further analysis of complete sequences showed the virus to be a variant of the ‘Oman’ strain of Chili leaf curl virus (ChLCV-OM), a virus prevalent in a number of crops across Oman. However, the ChLCV-OM identified in mint has a recombination pattern distinct from all other ChLCV isolates. Additionally, PCR amplification and sequencing showed the mint plants to also harbour the betasatellite, Tomato leaf curl betasatellite (ToLCB). This is the first identification of ChLCV in association with ToLCB infecting mint. The distinct recombination pattern of ChLCV-OM from mint suggests that the host is epidemiologically important in the spread of ChLCV-OM to other crops in Oman.  aWe thank Sultan Qaboos University for providing funds through the internal grant [Project Number: IG/AGR/CROP/17/02] for this research.  aPublisher supplied data  aIG/AGR/CROP/17/02cSultan Qaboos Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004351 3aChilli leaf curl virus 3aDNA 3aMentha 3aTomato leaf curl betasatellite 3acrops 3agrowth retardation 3amint 3amolecular cloning 3arestriction endonucleases 3asequence analysis 3aviruses 3aOman 0abegomovirus 0abetasatellite 0aChili leaf curl virus1 aRaza, Amir1 aAl-Sadi, Abdullah M.1 aBriddon, Rob W.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 41, no. 2 p.291-295dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43214x1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2019.15709723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011900166300002000285520195300305592002802258650001302286650001802299650001202317650001302329650001102342650001802353650001902371650002102390650001202411650002102423650001602444700001802460700005602478700005302534700005202587773011602639856008402755852000902839655001202848IND60677901420221118070125.0191213e20191118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067790142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b028852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Cuicui10aCritical and Optimal Wall Conditions for Coalescence-Induced Droplet Jumping on Textured Superhydrophobic Surfaces  ap. 16201-16209.  aThe effectiveness of coalescence-induced jumping of microdroplets on superhydrophobic surfaces is critical to a wide range of applications such as self-cleaning surfaces, anti-icing/frosting, water harvesting, phase-change heat transfer, and hotspot cooling. Introducing textures on the surfaces can readily enlarge the effective contact angle, while an overlarge texture spacing may unfavorably lead to droplet penetration into the gaps in droplet coalescence processes. To clarify the effect of surface textures on the droplet jumping dynamics, we simulated the coalescence of droplets on textured superhydrophobic surfaces with various surface wettability and texture spacings and theoretically derived the critical conditions of jumping and the optimal condition of maximum jumping velocity. The results show that the nonmonotonic emergence of “nonjumping”–“jumping”–“nonjumping” with decreasing solid fraction is synergistically controlled by the surface adhesion and the effective impinging pressure. At a large solid fraction, the transition from “nonjumping” to “jumping” is caused by the reduction of the dimensionless surface adhesion energy below a critical value, which is determined to be 0.035 for Oh = 0.02 and 0.01 for Oh = 0.12. At a small solid fraction, the transition from “jumping” to “nonjumping” is dominated by the reduction of the dimensionless effective impinging pressure, the critical value of which is identified to be 0.14 and is independent of Oh. Moreover, jumping velocity maximizes when wetting critically transits from the Cassie–Baxter (CB) state to the partial-wetting state, and a penetration index is proposed from the wetting theory to predict such transition, which shows good agreement with both present simulations and previous experiments. The present findings are helpful for the design of superhydrophobic surfaces that pursue robust and efficient jumping of droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acontact angle 3acooling 3adroplets 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3ahydrophobicity 3aphase transition 3atexture 3awater harvesting 3awettability1 aWang, Tianyou1 aChe, Zhizhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0682-06031 aJia, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2544-02591 aSun, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6409-792X0 tLangmuir.g2019 Nov. 18, v. 35, no. 49 p.16201-16209dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b028853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245017200154300001400326520180000340592002802140650002502168650001602193650001002209650001602219650001802235650002302253650002002276650001602296650002102312650002302333650001102356650001402367650001902381650001502400650001202415653001902427653002002446653001102466653002802477653002702505653002002532700001702552700002402569700001802593700001502611773009402626856007102720852000902791655001202800IND60119151820221121021317.0141204s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011915182DNAL7 a10.1071/AN132862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttia, Y.

In total, 108 rabbits 32 days of age were divided into four homogeneous groups fed the same basal diet and submitted to the following dietary treatments: control group, without supplementation; inulin group, supplemented with inulin (0.25 g/rabbit.day); MOS group, supplemented with MOS (0.083 g/rabbit.day); and ZnB group, supplemented with ZnB (0.083 g/rabbit.day). The supplements were administered 2 days per week from 32 to 81 days of age. At 32, 56 and 81 days, the rabbits were weighed and feed intake was measured. Mortality was recorded daily. Nutrient digestibility was measured at 65 days by an ingesta–excreta balance. Samples of blood were collected at 53, 67 and 81 days of age. The control group showed the highest (P < 0.01) mortality rate throughout the trial (17.0%), followed by ZnB (8.18%), inulin (3.7%) and then the MOS group, which had the lowest mortality (1.6%; P < 0.01). Addition of MOS led to a more favourable (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio than addition of ZnB at 32–56 days of age and inulin for the entire trial period. The MOS group showed increased (P < 0.01) digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, ash and crude fibre relative to the control group. All supplements increased (P < 0.01) protein digestibility relative to the control. The level of alanine aminotransferase was reduced due to the use of feed supplements, and MOS supplementation gave the lowest (P < 0.01) value. Administration of prebiotics to growing rabbits as an alternative to ZnB can lead some advantages compared with both antibiotic and unsupplemented diets; MOS was more effective than inulin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aantibiotics 3ablood 3acrude fiber 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3agrowth performance 3ainulin 3amortality 3aorganic matter 3aprebiotics 3arabbits 0ablood profiles 0agrowing rabbits 0ainulin 0amannan-oligosaccharides 0anutrient digestibility 0azinc-bacitracin1 aHamed, R.

G.10aMicrowave-Assisted Fabrication of Titanium Implants with Controlled Surface Topography for Rapid Bone Healing  ap. 13587-13593.  aMorphological surface modifications have been reported to enhance the performance of biomedical implants. However, current methods of introducing graded porosity involves postprocessing techniques that lead to formation of microcracks, delamination, loss of fatigue strength, and, overall, poor mechanical properties. To address these issues, we developed a microwave sintering procedure whereby pure titanium powder can be readily densified into implants with graded porosity in a single step. Using this approach, surface topography of implants can be closely controlled to have a distinctive combination of surface area, pore size, and surface roughness. In this study, the effect of various surface topographies on in vitro response of neonatal rat calvarial osteoblast in terms of attachment and proliferation is studied. Certain graded surfaces nearly double the chance of cell viability in early stages (∼one month) and are therefore expected to improve the rate of healing. On the other hand, while the osteoblast morphology significantly differs in each sample at different periods, there is no straightforward correlation between early proliferation and quantitative surface parameters such as average roughness or surface area. This indicates that the nature of cell-surface interactions likely depends on other factors, including spatial parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3adelamination 3afatigue strength 3amicrowave treatment 3aosteoblasts 3aporosity 3aroughness 3asurface area 3asurface roughness 3atitanium 0abone tissue engineering 0asurface porosity 0aroughness 0amicrowave sintering 0acell proliferation 0aosteoblast1 aDe, Alok1 aBhaduri, Sarit B.,1 aYaghoubi, Alireza0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Aug. 27, v. 6, no. 16 p.13587-13593dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am502967n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03996naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008600168300001600254520258000270592002802850650002802878650001002906650001202916650001502928650001802943650000902961650001802970650003402988650001103022650001703033650002503050650000903075650002403084650001603108650001703124650001903141650002303160651001603183653001603199653001703215653001703232700001903249700001703268773012303285856008503408852000903493655001203502IND60711958520221120131316.0201009e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071195852DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2020.17451092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambers, GP10aEffect of treatment of phantom cows with a progesterone-based synchrony programme  ap. 313-323.  aAim: To determine the effect of a progesterone-based synchrony programme on the daily hazard of conception and the probability of being pregnant at the end of the seasonal mating period in cows not observed in oestrus within 35–49 days of insemination and that were diagnosed non-pregnant (phantom cows) on seasonally calving New Zealand dairy farms. Secondary aims were to determine the prevalence of phantom cows and estimate the proportion of phantom cows with a functional corpus luteum (CL) at enrolment. Methods: Phantom cows from 14 New Zealand commercial dairy farms were enrolled in a randomised, controlled trial. Cows that were artificially inseminated ≤14 days after mating start date and were not subsequently detected in oestrus, were presented for pregnancy diagnosis approximately 49 days after mating start date. Non-pregnant cows were diagnosed as phantom cows and randomly allocated to treatment and control groups. A milk sample was collected for progesterone assay to determine the presence of a functional CL. Treatment consisted of an injection of buserelin and insertion of an intravaginal device containing progesterone on Day 0, injections of dinoprost and equine chorionic gonadotrophin, and removal of the intravaginal device on Day 7, injection of buserelin on Day 9, and fixed time artificial insemination on Day 10. Treatment group cows were then mixed with bulls for the remainder of the seasonal mating period. Cows allocated to the control group were mated naturally by bulls. Statistical models were constructed to determine the effect of treatment on the daily hazard of conception and the probability of being pregnant at the end of the seasonal mating period. Results: A total of 378/4,214 (9.0%) cows presented for pregnancy diagnosis were diagnosed as phantom cows. A functional CL was diagnosed in 257/362 (71.0%) phantom cows. Median predicted enrolment to conception intervals were 33 (95% CI = 30–45) and 30 (95% CI = 28–33) days, for cows in the control and treatment groups, respectively. The odds of being pregnant at the end of mating were 1.70 (95% CI = 1.34–2.17) times greater for treated phantom cows than untreated phantom cows. Estimated marginal mean proportion pregnant at mating end date were 59.5 (95% CI = 47.9–70.1)% and 71.5 (95% CI = 62.6–79.0)% for control and treatment group cows, respectively. Conclusions: Treatment with a progesterone-based synchrony programme significantly increased the probability of phantom cows being pregnant at the end of the seasonal mating period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3abulls 3acalving 3aconception 3acorpus luteum 3acows 3adairy farming 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3aestrus 3ainsemination 3aintravaginal devices 3amilk 3apregnancy diagnosis 3aprobability 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3astatistical models 3aNew Zealand 0aPhantom cow 0adairy cattle 0areproduction1 aO'Sullivan, ML1 aCompton, CWR0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2020 Nov. 1, v. 68, no. 6 p.313-323dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12298x1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2020.17451093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245014700217300001800364520182000382592002802202596012502230650002502355650002102380650001302401650001802414650001002432650001702442650001502459650001502474650001502489650001402504650001902518650001402537650001602551650001602567650001402583650001202597650001602609650001602625650001402641650001302655650001602668650001102684700003702695700003102732700002202763700003002785700002902815700003202844700002902876773013802905856008203043852000903125655001203134IND60707182320221120155315.0200819e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070718232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-020-00566-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Robson Andrade1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4807-794X10aHematological, biochemical, and histopathological responses in sorubim Pseudoplatystoma spp. experimentally infected with Lactococcus garvieae  ap. 1907-1923.  aThis study evaluated the hematological, biochemical, and histopathological responses of sorubim Pseudoplatystoma spp., experimentally infected with Lactococcus garvieae. Sorubim juveniles (n = 66; 21.3 ± 5.5 g; 17.1 ± 1.3 cm) were infected with L. garvieae by coelmatic inoculation (1.5 × 10⁸ CFU mL⁻¹) and sampling to 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post-inoculation (dpi) for evaluation of hematological, biochemical parameters. Histopathological data of the spleen and kidney were estimated according to the histological alteration index (HAIn). Additionally, a decrease of hematocrit (1, 3, and 14 dpi), hemoglobin, and count of erythrocytes (3, 14, and 21 dpi), blood glucose (3 dpi), and proteinemy (14 dpi) were observed. Monocytes decreased at 7, 14, and 21 dpi; neutrophils at 3, 7, and 21 dpi; and lymphocytes at 21 dpi. Edema, hyperemia, hemorrhage, inflammatory infiltrate, and necrosis were the major histological changes observed in the spleen and kidney. HAIn was higher at 7 to 14 dpi in the spleen. Edema, hyperemia, and hyperplasia with hypertrophy of melanomacrophage centers (MMCs) associated with mild focal necrosis areas, particularly in white pulp, were observed. In the head kidney, it was observed that MMCs and melanomacrophages surrounded the capillaries and dispersed inside the sinusoidal capillaries network. Internalized bacteria by macrophages were commonly observed at 3 to 7 dpi. Tubular neogenesis characterized by nephrogenic bodies and rare MMCs at 21 dpi was observed. The experimental infection with L. garvieae caused significant hematological and biochemical responses. Pathological manifestations are closely related to the spleen and head kidneys mainly represented by hyperplasia and hypertrophy of melanomacrophage centers and mild necrosis areas.  aPublisher supplied data  a23/200.233/2014cFundação de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aPseudoplatystoma 3abacteria 3ablood glucose 3aedema 3aerythrocytes 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ahyperemia 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3ajuveniles 3akidneys 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3amonocytes 3anecrosis 3aneutrophils 3aspleen1 ado Nascimento Silva, André Luiz1 aSiqueira, Mayara Schueroff1 aPilarski, Fabiana1 aLeal, Cassia Rejane Brito1 aKuibida, Karin Virgínia1 ade Campos, Cristiane Meldau1 aFernandes, Carlos Eurico0 tAquaculture international.g2020 Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.1907-1923dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-020-00566-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009000176300001600266520143900282536016001721592002801881596013901909650002702048650001102075650001602086650002002102650001402122650001202136650002702148650002602175650002602201650001102227650001602238650001102254650001102265650001002276650000802286651001202294653001402306653002902320653002802349700002302377700002202400700002102422700002402443773013102467856008502598852000902683655001202692IND60639732420221117070047.0190503e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063973242DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2019.15749012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, Jennifer. M.10aSusceptibility to Stemphylium vesicarium of asparagus, onion, pear, and rye in Canada  ap. 228-241.  aDiseases caused by Stemphylium vesicarium are an increasing problem in the major asparagus and onion production regions of eastern and central Canada. Replicated and repeated controlled environment and field trials were conducted in Ontario to assess the disease reaction of asparagus and onion cultivars to determine if isolates from one crop can cross-infect other hosts, to assess the variation of disease symptoms among cultivars of onion and of asparagus, and to assess the ability of the pathogen to survive in a non-host species. All of the varieties of asparagus and onion assessed were susceptible to infection by S. vesicarium. There were small differences in susceptibility among varieties and in aggressiveness among isolates. These differences were not strongly associated with host crop. Onion cultivars that developed higher numbers of lesions often had lower levels of leaf dieback and vice versa. This indicated that resistance to infection was independent of susceptibility to development of dieback symptoms. In asparagus, infection on spears was not consistently correlated with severity on ferns. All isolates from asparagus and onion produced typical symptoms on wounded, but not unwounded, pear fruit. Finally, the pathogen was shown to colonize and sporulate on necrotic leaves of autumn rye, which is often used as a cover crop in asparagus fields. Stemphylium vesicarium can cross-infect asparagus and onion.  aThe authors thank the OMAFRA/University of Guelph Partnership and the Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association for partial funding of this research.  aPublisher supplied data  cOMAFRA/University of Guelph Partnership and the Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers Associationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000094 3aStemphylium vesicarium 3aautumn 3acover crops 3acrop production 3acultivars 3adieback 3adisease susceptibility 3aferns and fern allies 3afield experimentation 3afruits 3ahost plants 3aleaves 3aonions 3apears 3arye 3aOntario 0aPleospora 0apurple spot of asparagus 0aStemphylium leaf blight1 aTayviah, C.

Twenty-four goat kids averaging 16.93 ± 1.25 kg initial bodyweight were randomly assigned to four experimental diets in a completely randomised design for 90 days. The experimental diets consisted of (1) 0% oak acorn (control), (2) 8% oak acorn, (3) 17% oak acorn and (4) 25% oak acorn on a DM basis. The goats were slaughtered after 105 days of feeding and carcass characteristics were measured. DM intake increased linearly in small amounts as the level of acorn in the diet increased (P < 0.004). The results showed that average daily gain, water intake and feed conversion ratio were unaffected by levels of ground oak acorn (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences in blood parameters (P > 0.05). Carcass fat depth and abdominal fat weight decreased with increasing ground oak acorn in the diet. Other carcass characteristics were not affected by different levels of ground oak acorn. On the basis of the results of the present study, it may be concluded that ground oak acorn can be used up to 25% in the diets of young goats without any adverse effects on growth performance and carcass characteristics. At this level of acorns, the goats received low concentrations of hydrolysable tannins (11 g/kg DM) in their diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aadverse effects 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood composition 3abody weight 3acarcass characteristics 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afruits 3agrowth performance 3akids (goats) 3atannins1 aAzizi, O.1 aSadeghi, G.1 aFatehi, F.1 aLashkari, S.0 tAnimal production science.g2015, v. 55, no. 1 p.87-92dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN133123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010400167300001600271520138500287592002801672650001501700650001101715650001801726650001501744650001501759650001101774650001301785650001301798650001701811650002301828650001701851653002701868653002101895653003601916653002301952653002601975653003602001700001802037700002502055700001302080700001502093773009002108856008502198852000902283655001202292IND60730632220221120211637.0220103e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073063222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.02.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJagiello, J.12aA dual shape pore model to analyze the gas adsorption data of hierarchical micro-mesoporous carbons  ap. 113-124.  aHierarchical micro/mesoporous carbons obtained by template carbonization were investigated by nitrogen adsorption/desorption and gave a type IV isotherm with a H1 hysteresis loop closing perfectly near P/P₀ = 0.6. When using the 2D-NLDFT theory to calculate the pore size distribution (PSD) from the adsorption branch of the isotherms, while assuming slit pores with a heterogeneous rough surface (2D–HS–SLIT model), an unexpected artifact was observed ca. 3.5 nm. Recognizing that the H1 hysteresis loop is usually related to the adsorption in materials with cylindrical pores, where in general it is recommended to use the desorption branch for the pore size analysis, we have applied the 2D–HS–SLIT model to the adsorption isotherm up to P/P₀ = 0.2 and a cylindrical pore model to the desorption isotherm down to P/P₀ = 0.2. Interestingly, the application of this dual shape pore model to hierarchical micro/mesoporous carbons of various mesopore sizes and oxygenated surface functionalities shows an excellent fit with the experimental isotherms, while the mesopore peak in the PSDs is narrower, and the previously labeled artifact is eliminated. It is noteworthy that the cumulative surface area values are significantly larger than when applying the 2D–HS–SLIT model, what is due to the larger surface area of cylindrical than slit-shaped mesopores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3adesorption 3ahysteresis 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 0aTemplate carbonization 0aColloidal silica 0aBimodal micro/mesoporous carbon 0aH1 hysteresis loop 0aDual shape pore model 0a2D-NLDFT pore size distribution1 aChojnacka, A.1 aPourhosseini, S.E.M.1 aWang, Z.1 aBeguin, F.0 tCarbon.g2021 June 30, v. 178 p.113-124dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.02.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009500170300001600265500001900281520124500300592002801545650001901573650001101592650001301603650001401616650002601630650001501656650001201671650001101683651001201694653002301706653002201729653002801751653003101779653002401810653002201834653002301856700002401879700002001903700002201923773011201945856008002057852000902137655001202146IND60695835720221120080113.0200519e20070901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069583572DNAL7 a10.1179/174328207X2273842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllwood, Neil T.

Here we report seasonal changes in the kinetics of surface phosphatase in six moss populations, representing four species (Fontinalis antipyretica, Fontinalis squamosa, Rhynchostegium riparioides and Warnstorfia fluitans) from N.E. England. Kinetic parameters of shoots assayed within a few hours of sampling from the streams showed a summer/autumn increase in K ₘ and V ₘₐₓ corresponding to seasonal decrease in phosphate supply. The detection of phosphomonoesterases and phosphodiesterases with both low and high substrate affinities in all the populations studied confirms the widespread existence of this phenomenon in mosses. Similar two-phase kinetics were found for clonal, axenic isolates of two of the species (Rhynchostegium and Warnstorfia), indicating that any influence of epiphytes on the results with stream material was negligible. The seasonal changes in the kinetic parameters indicate that surface phosphatase activity is a dynamic response to seasonal changes in nutrient supply and/or requirement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhynchostegium 3aautumn 3abryology 3aepiphytes 3amosses and liverworts 3aphosphates 3astreams 3asummer 3aEngland 0aAQUATIC BRYOPHYTES 0aORGANIC PHOSPHATE 0aFONTINALIS ANTIPYRETICA 0aRHYNCHOSTEGIUM RIPARIOIDES 0aPHOSPHOMONOESTERASE 0aPHOSPHODIESTERASE 0aTWO-PHASE KINETICS1 aTurner, Benjamin L.1 aHaile, Susan M.1 aWhitton, Brian A.0 tJournal of bryology.g2007 Sept. 1, v. 29, no. 3 p.174-182dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2030x1743-28207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1179/174328207X2273843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002700137245006400164300001600228520151300244592002801757650001801785650001701803650001601820650001201836650002401848650001701872650001001889650001001899650002001909650001301929650002201942650002101964650001001985650001301995650001202008653001702020653001502037653001902052653002102071700003202092700003102124700002602155700001702181700002102198773009602219856007102315852000902386655001202395IND60119152020221120214849.0141204s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011915202DNAL7 a10.1071/AN133162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhafouri-Kesbi, Farhad12aA genetic study on sexual dimorphism of bodyweight in sheep  ap. 101-106.  aThe aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism of bodyweight in Zandi sheep. To do this, a pedigree including 1450 dams and 170 sires was used. Six bivariate animal models were applied for investigating direct and maternal effects for three age-specific bodyweights (bodyweight at birth, 3 and 6 months of age) in male and female Zandi lambs. The variance components were estimated via REML procedure. Males were, respectively, 6%, 7% and 9% heavier than females at birth, weaning and 6 months of age. Estimates of sexual dimorphism levels (expressed as M/F) were 1.11 at birth, 1.07 at weaning and 1.09 at 6 months of age, which indicated relatively low levels of sexual size dimorphism in the traits studied. Except for birthweight, for which estimates of additive genetic, residual and phenotypic variances as well as direct heritability and additive coefficient of variation were higher in females, for other traits studied, estimates were higher in males. However, regarding direct and maternal effects, none of the differences between the sexes was significant, indicating no need for sexual selection. Cross-sex genetic correlations were 0.862 at birth, 0.918 at weaning and 0.922 at 6 months of age, which highlighted birthweight as the most dimorphic trait. It was concluded that, owing to possible contribution of sexual chromosomes to variation of growth-related traits, bodyweight in male and female lambs may not be under the exactly same genetic control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abirth weight 3achromosomes 3afemales 3agenetic correlation 3aheritability 3alambs 3amales 3amaternal effect 3apedigree 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 3asires 3avariance 3aweaning 0aanimal model 0abodyweight 0adirect effects 0amaternal effects1 aMianji, Ghodratollah Rahimi1 aPirsaraei, Zarbakht Ansari1 aHafezian, Seyed Hasan1 aBaneh, Hasan1 aSoleimani, Bijan0 tAnimal production science.g2015, v. 55, no. 1 p.101-106dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN133163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011600156300002000272520121400292592002801506650001101534650001401545650002101559650001301580650001201593650001701605650003701622653003401659653001601693653001701709653001701726653002401743700001301767700001901780773012901799856007301928852000902001655001202010IND60527698520221119124615.0160715e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052769852DNAL7 a10.1021/am503016s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Huawei10aAbnormal Cyclibility in Ni@Graphene Core–Shell and Yolk–Shell Nanostructures for Lithium Ion Battery Anodes  ap. 13765-13769.  aElectrochemical pulverization, a commonly undesirable process for durable electrodes, is reinterpreted in popular yolk–shell nanostructures. In comparison with core–shell counterparts, the yolk–shell ones exhibit enhancing ion storage and rate capability for lithium ion battery anodes. The enhancement benefits from lowered activation barriers for lithiation and delithiation, improved surfaces and interfaces for ion availability contributed by endless pulverization of active materials. By controlled etching, stable cycling with significantly improved capacity (∼800 mAh g–¹ at 0.1 A g–¹, 600 mAh g–¹ at 0.5 A g–¹, and 490 mAh g–¹ at 1 A g–¹ vs 140 mAh g–¹ at 0.1 A g–¹) is achieved at various rates for Ni@Graphene yolk–shell structures. Meanwhile, large rate of 20 A g–¹ with capacity of 145 mAh g–¹ is retained. Given initial pulverization for the activation, the tailored electrodes could stably last for more than 1700 cycles with an impressive capacity of ca. 490 mAh g–¹ at 5 A g–¹. Insights into electrochemical processes by TEM and STEM reveal dispersive pulverized active nanocrystals and the intact protective graphene shells play the leading role.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3alithium 3ananocrystals 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aelectrochemical pulverization 0aNi@Graphene 0acore−shell 0ayolk−shell 0aLithium ion battery1 aCui, Hao1 aWang, Chengxin0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Aug. 27, v. 6, no. 16 p.13765-13769dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am503016s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013900173300001600312520133300328592002801661650001601689650001101705650002201716650002001738650001501758650002201773650001101795650000901806650001301815650001401828650001401842650001701856650001701873650001501890650001601905653002101921653002701942653001601969653001501985653001402000700006002014700003102074700001602105700001702121700005602138700001902194773009002213856008502303852000902388655001202397IND60730632420221120211626.0220103e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073063242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilian, A.T.

We achieved the rapid and ultrasensitive electrocatalytic sensing of tryptophan (Trp) in 0.1 M KOH by using intrinsically metallic NiCoSe₄ anchored on CNFs as an alternative working electrode material. Benefiting from the large surface area due to rich defect active sites and the high electrocatalytic behavior of NiCoSe₄ with CNF, the fabricated sensor exhibits a lower electron-transfer resistance of Rcₜ 92 Ω with respect to the CNF–NiCo and CNFs electrodes. The results of voltammetric technique confirmed that the CNF–NiCoSe₄-GCE showed higher anodic peak intensity and a lower anodic potential for Trp detection than CNFs-GCE and CNF–NiCo-GCE electrodes since the integration of sp² carbon on the surface of the CNFs and bimetallic selenides improves the sensing performance. The amperometric I-t curve showed a linear response in the Trp concentration range of 5–95 nM and a detection limit of 0.68 nM at low potential of 0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO. The CNF–NiCoSe₄-GCE was successfully utilized for the electrocatalytic monitoring of Trp from human serum, milk, and tomato juice samples with a recovery of 95.4–105.5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acarbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3ahumans 3amilk 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aselenides 3asurface area 3atomato juice 3atryptophan 3avoltammetry 0aCarbon nanofiber 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aAmperometry 0aTryptophan 0aComposite1 aHwang, Seung-Kyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8463-51471 aRanjith, Kugalur Shanmugam1 aLee, Min Ji1 aPark, Bumjun1 aHuh, Yun Suk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1612-44731 aHan, Young-Kyu0 tCarbon.g2021 June 30, v. 178 p.103-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013900154300001600293500001500309520133200324592002801656650001201684650001201696650002701708650002701735650002301762650001001785650001501795650002201810650001001832650002601842650001101868650001101879653002601890700001701916700002201933700001701955700001401972773009801986856007302084852000902157655001202166IND50090251920221118184803.0150206e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009025192DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.120492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSookar, P.10aMating compatibility of wild and sterile melon flies, Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) treated with entomopathogenic fungi  ap. 409-417.  a2019-12-05  aField cage tests were carried out to determine the mating compatibility of sterile and wild melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett), males that were treated or not treated with entomopathogenic fungi. The melon flies were irradiated at 70 Gy, and the adults were treated with dry conidia of either Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) or Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin 1 day before the mating test. Our results demonstrate that sterile melon flies treated with either B. bassiana or M. anisopliae showed mating compatibility with the wild flies. Inoculation of the flies with the fungi did not significantly affect the mean time of copulation (323–567 min) as compared to mating involving only wild flies (407–518 min). Treatment of the flies with either B. bassiana or M. anisopliae did not significantly affect the propensity of mating. Wild females mated indiscriminately with sterile, sterile B. bassiana‐treated or sterile M. anisopliae‐treated males. Irrespective of the treatment combinations, mean percentage remating was significantly higher for sterile females with sterile males (7.72–27.12%) as compared to wild females with sterile males (0.76–14.90%). The possibility of using sterile melon flies as vectors of the entomopathogenic fungi to enhance an SIT programme is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afemales 3aconidia 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aBeauveria bassiana 3amales 3acopulation 3aCitrullus lanatus 3acages 3aZeugodacus cucurbitae 3aadults 3amelons 0aBactrocera cucurbitae1 aBhagwant, S.1 aKhayrattee, F.

Photodynamic therapy is an approach that offers control of drug delivery by use of an external photon source to allow active therapeutic release to a target area. Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) have potential to operate as integral components of photodynamic therapeutic platforms based on the resonant absorption of near-infrared (NIR) radiation and emission at shorter wavelengths. NIR radiation is minimally absorbed and scattered by biological tissues, and the NIR excitation of UCNPs can generate anti-Stokes emission in the ultraviolet–visible wavelength range at intensities that can be used to trigger cleavage of bonds linking therapeutics at the nanoparticle interface. Herein, we describe an investigation of photocleavage at the surface of UCNPs to release the chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Core–shell UCNPs composed of a β-NaYF₄: 4.95% Yb, 0.08% Tm core and a β-NaYF₄ shell were coated with o-phosphorylethanolamine ligands and coupled to an o-nitrobenzyl (ONB) derivative of 5-FU. NIR excitation of the UCNPs resulted in photoluminescence (PL) emission bands centered at 365, 455, and 485 nm. The UV–blue PL was in resonance with the absorption band of the ONB–FU derivative resulting in photocleavage and subsequent release of the 5-FU drug from the UCNPs for these in vitro studies. The release of 5-FU was complete in <14 min using a NIR laser source centered at 980 nm that operated at a power of <100 mW. The efficiency of triggered release was as high as 77% of the total ONB–FU conjugate, while the rate of drug release could be tuned with the laser power output. This work provides an important first step in the development of a UCNP platform capable of targeted chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3afluorouracil 3ain vitro studies 3aligands 3ananoparticles 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotons 3atissues 3atoxicity 3awavelengths 0alanthanide 0aupconverting nanoparticles 0aphotolysis 0adrug delivery 0anear-infrared 0a5-fluorouracil1 aTavares, Anthony

Under these reactions, microbes are prone to photocatalytic activity. In this study, microbial responses to photocatalytic activity in VPCB used for phenol degradation were investigated. VPCB was conducted with Er3+:YAlO3/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared at heat-treatment temperatures [HT] of 110 °C, 130 °C, and 150 °C to evaluate photocatalytic activities. The highest phenol removal rate (71.6%) was observed in photocatalysis [HT] 130, and particular microbial responses were elicited in VPCB [HT] 130. Dehydrogenase activity exhibited the highest decrease (90.7%) in VPCB [HT] 130. In this treatment, large amounts of biofilm were detached from the exterior of the carrier but the biofilm remained well protected in the interior. Extracellular polymeric substances with decreases of 65.6% and 31.4% in protein and polysaccharide levels, respectively, were not stimulated in VPCB [HT] 130 but were evidently stimulated in the other two protocols, which could be due to lower phenol inhibition. These results indicated that the most efficient removal rates of phenol and dissolved organic carbon reached 99.8% and 67.1%, respectively, in VPCB [HT] 130.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahot water treatment 3amicroorganisms 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3apolysaccharides 3atemperature 0aCoupling 0aPhotocatalysis 0aVisible light 0aMicrobial response 0aBiodegradation 0aPhenol1 aZou, Donglei1 aZhou, Dandan1 aLi, Tingting1 aDong, Shanshan1 aXu, Zhengxue1 aDong, Shuangshi0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2015 Oct., v. 104 p.178-185dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007500170300001600245520126700261592002801528650001301556650001901569650001501588650001401603650001401617650001801631650000901649650001401658650001201672650001301684650001501697650001101712650001801723650001001741651001801751653002401769653001201793653001501805653001801820653002101838700001901859700001701878700001901895773013701914856008502051852000902136655001202145IND60639732820221117070530.0190503e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063973282DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2018.14731582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Natalie10aBaseline Knowledge of Potential Pet Toxins among the US General Public  ap. 219-228.  aIn 2014, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty toAnimals Animal Poison Control Center fielded more than 167,000cases of potential nonhuman animal toxicosis. Concomitantly, thereremain limited free and reputable veterinary toxicology resourcesavailable for companion-animal (pet) caregivers (owners) seekingassistance and advice about potentially harmful exposures inanimals. The objective of this study was to assess pet toxicantknowledge among a representative sample of Americans andgauge the need for additional toxicology resources. The studyinvolved a survey designed to capture participants’ ability to identifypotential animal toxicants and what resource they would use ifan accidental toxic ingestion occurred. Participants were ableto correctly identify 52% of potential pet toxins. Women, olderparticipants and participants from the South expressed moreconcern about each potential pet poison. Approximately halfof participants indicated they would consult a veterinarian andwhereas most others indicated they would search the Internet formore information about pet toxicology. The findings suggest moreveterinary poisoning education is needed for pet owners to be ableto accurately distinguish potential pet toxicants from nontoxicants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aanimal welfare 3acaregivers 3aeducation 3aingestion 3apet ownership 3apets 3apoisoning 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atoxins 3aveterinarians 3awomen 3aUnited States 0aVeterinary medicine 0aanimals 0apet toxins 0aanimal toxins 0aknowledge survey1 aRoyal, Kenneth1 aLovee, Bryan1 aDavidson, Gigi0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2019 July 3, v. 22, no. 3 p.219-228dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56472x1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2018.14731583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015700163300001800320520131600338592002801654650002401682650002301706650002601729650001801755650001501773650001001788650001601798650000901814650000901823700005601832700002101888700002201909700001801931773013801949856008202087852000902169655001202178IND60707182720221120164705.0200819e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070718272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-020-00575-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngkha, B.10aMobilization of mica by Bacillus sp. and its effect on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cum holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum)–based aquaponic system  ap. 2045-2058.  aA 60-day experiment was carried out to optimize the mica dosage for the best growth of the plant (holy basil) and fish (Nile tilapia) in aquaponics. Mica is a potassium-bearing phyllosilicate mineral rock used as a fertilizer in agriculture. Four mica dose treatments of C (0 g l⁻¹), T1 (2 g l⁻¹), T2 (4 g l⁻¹), and T3 (6 g l⁻¹) were taken with equal bacterial (Bacillus megaterium) dosages of 5 × 10⁸ CFU ml⁻¹ in all the treatments. The experiment was performed in aquaponics units with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) stocked at 1.14 kg m⁻³ and 28 plants m⁻², respectively. The results showed that the yield of basil was highest in T2 (365.66 ± 34.27 g), followed by T3 (362.10 ± 19.99 g), T1 (337.70 ± 15.15 g), and C (324.26 ± 16.88 g). Tilapia growth was highest in C (10.79 ± 0.35 g) followed by T1 (10.45 ± 0.12 g), T2 (10.31 ± 0.09 g), and T3 (10.18 ± 0.08 g). However, there was no significant difference in fish growth corresponding to different treatments. Thus, the treatment which showed the best compromised overall growth was T2 (4 g l⁻¹ mica). Thus, 4 g l⁻¹ mica can be suggested as optimum mica dose for Nile tilapia and holy basil in an aquaponic system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus megaterium 3aOcimum tenuiflorum 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aanimal growth 3aaquaponics 3abasil 3afertilizers 3afish 3amica1 aVerma, A.

The act faced strong opposition surrounding correct identification of prohibited dogs. A questionnaire was distributed to the public via an online platform, especially targetting those who have worked with dogs. The questionnaire assessed respondents’ abilities to identify the four banned types of dogs from other breeds and their capability to identify Pit Bull Terrier types from other similar dog types. Identification of both banned breeds, F(1, 20) = 57.746, p < .001, and bull breeds, F(1, 20) = 9.293, p = .006, was significantly lower than identification of other breeds. Recognition of Pit Bull Terrier types from similar types of dogs was generally poor, although people in a dog-related profession, as opposed to those in other professions, could correctly distinguish more pit bull-type dogs (U = 46,164.0, n₁ = 187, n₂ = 575, p = .003). Findings suggest public understanding of dangerous dogs is poor, and it may impact societal perceptions of dogs more widely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBull Terrier 3aaggression 3aanimal welfare 3abulls 3adogs 3aoccupations 3aquestionnaires 3aUnited Kingdom 0aDangerous dogs 0adog breeds 0aPit Bull Terrier 0abreed-specific legislation1 aFarnworth, Mark J.0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2019 July 3, v. 22, no. 3 p.240-254dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56472x1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2018.14768643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010000170300001800270520100700288592002801295596004301323650002401366650002701390650000901417650001701426650002301443650003201466650001801498650001401516650001101530650003201541650002601573650001701599700002301616700001901639700002101658700005601679700002401735700001801759700001801777773013801795856008201933852000902015655001202024IND60707182920221120164541.0200819e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070718292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-020-00574-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurmuş, Mustafa,10aInfluence of olive oil–based nanoemulsion on the fatty acid profiles of rainbow trout fillets  ap. 1997-2014.  aThe influence of oil-in-water nanoemulsion using commercial olive oil at different concentrations on the fatty acid profile of rainbow trout fillets stored at 4 ± 2 °C was evaluated. At the end of the storage period, the highest content of the total saturated fatty acids (SFA) was found in the control samples (18.1%) while the lowest content was observed in olive oil samples (17.27, 17.59 and 17.48%). The concentration of total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) contents of treated samples remained relatively constant during the storage time while a marked decrease was observed in the control samples since olive oil–based nanoemulsion prevented the lipid oxidation. In addition, PUFA/SFA and n-6/n-3 ratios were found in good range, which are considered to be an important dietetic parameter. Olive oil used in oil-in-water nanoemulsion maintained the MUFA and PUFA contents of fish during storage and can be recommended as a preservative for fish.  aPublisher supplied data  aFBA-2017-7405cÇukurova Üniversitesi 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afatty acid composition 3afish 3afish fillets 3alipid peroxidation 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3ananoemulsions 3aolive oil 3aolives 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3astorage time1 aBensid, Abdelkader1 aOzogul, Yeşim1 aKosker, Ali Riza1 aUcar, Yilmaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6770-66521 aKuley Boga, Esmeray1 aDurmus, Murat1 aOzogul, Fatih0 tAquaculture international.g2020 Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.1997-2014dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-020-00574-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04421naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245018000169300001400349520289400363592002803257650001603285650002603301650001303327650001803340650001303358650002103371650001103392650005003403650001503453650001803468650001903486650001303505650001503518650001403533650002503547650001803572650003003590650001403620651001903634700001403653700001603667700001303683700001903696700001503715773008903730856008703819852000903906655001203915IND60547070220221121010741.0160903e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054707022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2013.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllee, R.J.10aApplication of the coastal and marine ecological classification standard using satellite-derived and modeled data products for pelagic habitats in the Northern Gulf of Mexico  ap. 13-20.  aThe expansive and dynamic nature of the ocean's water column may limit the feasibility of the frequent in situ sampling that would be necessary to monitor these habitats and produce region-wide map products with any regularity. Alternatives to in situ sampling such as remote sensing and classification offer a means of routinely characterizing the environmental forcing functions that shape and determine habitat suitability and distribution. Four products derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-aqua satellite (chlorophyll concentration, salinity, sea-surface temperature, and euphotic depth) and a hydrodynamic modeled product for bottom to surface temperature differences (Δt) were evaluated to assess the utility of these products as proxies for in situ measurements. MODIS images covering the northern Gulf of Mexico were obtained for a 5-year time period (January 2005 – December 2009; 300 total images) and processed through Automated Processing System. The products were used to classify surface waters in three regions of the northern Gulf of Mexico using subcomponents and modifiers from the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) Water Column Component (WC) to determine if CMECS categories could be affectively used to categorize the products into meaningful management units. Products were assessed for each month over the five year period. Sea-surface temperature and salinity were classified into CMECS WC temperature and salinity subcomponent categories, respectively. Three modifiers from the WC were also used for the pelagic classification: water column stability, productivity, and turbidity. Δt was used to assign classification for water column stability; surface chlorophyll was used to determine phytoplankton productivity; and euphotic depth was used to indicate the level of turbidity. Statistical analyses of the products compared to the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission's Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program in situ data indicated that the MODIS and hydrodynamic modeling products were consistently different from the in situ data; however, we believe the potential is strong for use of these standard products to enhance water column information. Use of the CMECS WC with appropriate modifiers captures all the significant pelagic environmental parameters which influence habitat and species distributions. Of the parameters evaluated, the sea-surface salinity and temperature, as expected, were most useful for making comparisons. Further research incorporating different types of data is necessary to explore the full potential of this approach. Specifically, resource managers would like to see the incorporation of sediment and bathymetry data. We believe addition of these data layers would result in more robust habitat maps and provide an innovative tool for resource managers.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 3amanagers 3amarine fisheries 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3asalinity 3asatellites 3asediments 3astatistical analysis 3asurface water 3asurface water temperature 3aturbidity 3aGulf of Mexico1 aKurtz, J.1 aGould, R.W.1 aKo, D.S.1 aFinkbeiner, M.1 aGoodin, K.0 tOcean & coastal management.g2014 Feb., v. 88 p.13-20dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2013.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01538naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009500165300001800260520048200278592002800760650001200788650002300800650002300823650002800846653003600874653001000910653001100920653001600931653003000947700001300977700001300990773009501003856008101098852000901179655001201188IND60593356820221116141518.0180426e20180517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059335682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.03.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Denghu10aPotassium tert-butoxide-mediated generation of arynes from o-bromoacetophenone derivatives  ap. 2428-2434.  ao-bromoacetophenone derivatives as new versatile aryne precursors are induced to selectively eliminate the CArBr and CArC(Ac) bonds in the help of t-BuOK.

A key point this survey highlights is that the outcome of self-organization is strongly dependent on the boundary imposed, and new insight into the complex functions of embryonic boundaries will be necessary to create better self-organizing tissues for basic science, drug development, and regenerative medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug development 3aembryology 3amedicine 3amorphogenesis 3asurveys 0aSynthetic embryology 0aSelf-organization 0aBoundaries 0aBioengineering1 aGartner, Zev J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7803-12190 tDevelopmental biology.g2021 June, v. 474 p.62-70dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2021.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010000162500002200262520140800284592002801692650002001720650001501740650000901755650002301764650001101787650001301798650001101811650000901822650001601831650002201847653002601869653003101895653001801926700001301944700001901957700001701976700001301993700001802006773008902024856008302113852000902196655001202205IND60628714320221121223615.0190415e20190106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062871432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2019.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiang10aBRIF-Seq: Bisulfite-Converted Randomly Integrated Fragments Sequencing at the Single-Cell Level  aPre-press version  aSingle-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS-seq) was developed to assess DNA methylation heterogeneity in human and mouse. However, the reads are under-represented in regions with high DNA methylation, because these regions are usually fragmented into long segments and are seldom sequenced on the Illumina platform. To reduce the read distribution bias and maximize the use of these long segments, we developed bisulfite-converted randomly integrated fragments sequencing (BRIF-seq), a method with high rates of read mapping and genome coverage. Single microspore of maize, which has a highly methylated and repetitive genome, was used to perform BRIF-seq. High coverage of the haploid genome was obtained to evaluate the methylation states of CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C, or T). Compared with scBS-seq, BRIF-seq produced reads that were distributed more evenly across the genome, including regions with high DNA methylation. Surprisingly, the methylation rates among the four microspores within one tetrad were similar, but differed significantly among tetrads, suggesting that non-simultaneous methylation reprogramming could occur among tetrads. Similar levels of heterogeneity, which often occur in low-copy regions, were detected in different genetic backgrounds. These results suggest that BRIF-seq can be applied for single-cell methylome analysis of any species with diverse genetic backgrounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3abisulfites 3acorn 3agenetic background 3agenome 3ahaploidy 3ahumans 3amice 3amicrospores 3asequence analysis 0asingle-cell methylome 0awhole-genome amplification 0areprogramming1 aChen, Lu1 aZhang, Qinghua1 aSun, Yonghao1 aLi, Qing1 aYan, Jianbing0 tMolecular plant.g2019 Jan. 06, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2019.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012400167300001800291520163600309592002801945650002201973650001701995650001702012650001202029650001102041650004402052650000702096650001702103700001902120700002302139773011702162856008102279852000902360655001202369IND60119152720221120224816.0141204e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011915272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-6987-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraszni, Márta10aNMR assignments and the acid–base characterization of the pomegranate ellagitannin punicalagin in the acidic pH-range  ap. 5807-5816.  aIn exploring the capability of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for pomegranate juice analysis, the eight aromatic singlet resonances of α- and β-punicalagin were clearly identified in the¹H NMR spectra of juice samples. The four downfield resonances were found to be sensitive to small pH changes around pH 3.50 where the NMR spectra of the juice samples were recorded. To understand this unusual behavior, the¹H and¹³C resonance assignments of the punicalagin anomers were determined in aqueous solution and pH titrations with UV and¹H NMR detection carried out to characterize the acid–base properties of punicalagin over the pH range 2–8. Simultaneous fitting of all of the pH-sensitive¹H NMR signals produced similar but significantly different pKₐvalues for the first two deprotonation equilibria of the gallagic acid moiety of the punicalagin α- (pKₐ₁ = 4.57 ± 0.02, pKₐ₂ = 5.63 ± 0.03) and β- (pKₐ₁ = 4.36 ± 0.01, pKₐ₂ = 5.47 ± 0.02) anomers. Equivalent pKₐvalues, (α : 6.64 ± 0.01, β : 6.63± 0.01) were measured for the third deprotonation step involving the ellagic acid group, in good agreement with a prior literature report. The punicalagin anomer equilibrium readjusts in parallel with the proton dissociation steps as the pH is raised such that β-punicalagin becomes the most abundant anomer at neutral pH. The unusual upfield shifts observed for the glucose H3 and H5 resonances with increasing pH along with the shift in the α/β anomer equilibrium are likely the consequence of a conformational rearrangement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3adissociation 3aellagic acid 3aglucose 3ajuices 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apomegranates1 aMarosi, Attila1 aLarive, Cynthia K.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 July, v. 405, no. 17 p.5807-5816dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-6987-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006100170300001600231520127200247592002801519650002301547650001901570650002401589650002001613650001801633650001101651650000901662650000901671650001901680650001201699650001801711651001901729653002001748653002101768653001901789700002301808700001501831700002001846773013701866856008502003852000902088655001202097IND60639733220221117065845.0190503e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063973322DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2018.14901832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrong, Sandra12aA Collaborative Model for Managing Animal Hoarding Cases  ap. 267-278.  aCompanion-animal hoarding is a significant problem in the United States and internationally. Hoarding situations can incubate for years before a case is reported to law enforcement or animal control agencies. According to a survey by Gary Patronek, animal control agencies have estimated there are approximately 3000 reportable cases of animal hoarding annually in the United States. Animal hoarding cases vary in size from fewer than 20 animals to hundreds of animals. Every case of animal hoarding results in suboptimal animal welfare. Wake County, North Carolina, developed a proactive plan for addressing companion-animal hoarding that implemented a team approach to assist animals at risk, hold people accountable, address the mental health component of this problem, and create a more humane community. The plan involved animal control officers, crisis intervention counselors, law enforcement officers, veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and animal rescue partners. This intervention strategy was implemented in 2015, and cases were tracked to document animal outcomes. The conclusion of this experience is that a diverse team approach can best address the animal and human welfare challenges and the environmental concerns associated with animal hoarding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal technicians 3aanimal welfare 3acrisis intervention 3alaw enforcement 3amental health 3amodels 3apets 3arisk 3asocial welfare 3asurveys 3aveterinarians 3aNorth Carolina 0aAnimal hoarding 0acompanion animal 0aanimal control1 aFederico, Jennifer1 aBanks, Ron1 aWilliams, Cathy0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2019 July 3, v. 22, no. 3 p.267-278dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56472x1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2018.14901833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001400168245012900182300001400311520118600325592002801511650002101539650001701560650002001577650002601597650003101623650001001654650001401664650001901678650002401697650002901721650003101750650003901781650004301820650001101863650000901874650003401883700001601917700001701933700001701950700001601967700001401983700001201997773007902009856008302088852000902171655001202180IND60080898820221120112621.0140812e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008089882DNAL7 a215153572pmid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yun10aDifferential expression pattern-based prioritization of candidate genes through integrating disease-specific expression data  ap. 64-71.  aExpression data can reveal subtle transcriptional changes that mediate the clinical phenotype of the disease resulting from interaction between genetic and environmental factors, which offers us a new perspective to prioritize candidate genes. Here, we proposed a novel differential expression pattern (DEP)-based approach integrating numerous disease-specific expression data sets for prioritizing candidate genes. Using breast cancer as a case study, we validated the efficiency of our approach through integrating 12 breast cancer-related expression data sets based on the leave-one-out cross-validation. Particularly, prioritization based on subtype-specific expression data sets could generate significantly higher performance. The performance could be continually improved with the increasing expression data sets regardless of platform heterogeneity. We further validated the robustness of this approach by application to prostate cancer. Additionally, our approach showed higher performance in comparison with other expression-based approaches and better capability of identification of less well-studied disease genes in comparison with other integration-based approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aphenotype 3aprioritization 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atranscription (genetics) 2aBreast Neoplasmsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profilingxmethods 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHumans 2aMale 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxgenetics1 aXu, Chaohan1 aPing, Yanyan1 aGuan, Jinxia1 aFan, Huihui1 aLi, Yiqun1 aLi, Xia0 tGenomics.g2011 July, v. 98, no. 1 p.64-71dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007900161300001600240520152400256592002801780650002101808650001201829650001801841650001901859650002001878650001901898650001001917650002701927650002201954650001001976651001101986700001401997700002102011700002202032700001502054700002402069773012002093856004002213852000902253655001202262IND50090252620221118184813.0140612e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009025262DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.120422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZygouridis, N. E.10aGenetic changes during laboratory domestication of an olive fly SIT strain  ap. 423-432.  aEarly attempts to apply the SIT on the olive fly, Bactrocera oleae, were unsuccessful, mainly due to the low competitiveness of the sterile mass‐reared males compared with the wild ones. Recently, new efforts are underway in Israel to develop a vigorous and efficient mass‐reared olive fly laboratory strain. To understand the genetics of the adaptation process and possibly link the corresponding loss of competitiveness to genetic markers, we followed the fluctuation of genotypic frequencies of ten microsatellite markers during the course of 22 generations of the colonization of a wild Israeli population in laboratory conditions. Effective and observed allele number is halved after 11 generations, so is mean heterozygosity. Practically, there is very little change between F0 and F1, there are substantial changes between F1 and F2–F5, and there is a virtual complete adaptation to the new laboratory environment by F11, because no more changes are observed between F11 and F22. If we assume that the loss of allele number and heterozygosity also reflects the loss of the ‘wild’ character of the colonized strain and, possibly, the loss of a substantial part of its natural vigour, our results indicate that there is an apparent need to refresh a mass‐reared colony with wild material at about every five to eight generations.

The principal component regression (PCR) and partial least-squares regressions (PLS) model represent very good ability in describing the quality indices of the selected three sets of peaches in calibration and prediction. The results showed that the PLS model represents a good ability in predicting quality index, with high correlation coefficients (R = 0.86 for penetrating force [CF]; R = 0.83 for sugar content [SC]; R = 0.83 for pH) and relatively low standard error of prediction (SEP; 8.77 N, 0.299 °Brix, and 0.2 for CF, SC, and pH, respectively). The PCR model had high correlation coefficients (R = 0.84, 0.82, 0.78 for CF, SC, and pH, respectively) between predicted and measured values and a relatively low SEP (7.33 N, 0.44 °Brix, 0.21 for CF, SC, and pH, respectively) for prediction. These results prove that the electronic noses have the potential to assess fruit quality indices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrix 3apeaches 3acalibration 3aprincipal component analysis 3aleast squares 3afruit quality 3apH 3aforces 3aelectronic nose 3aprediction 0asensors1 aWang, Jun1 aYe, Sheng1 aChang, Mingxun0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2012 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.65-72dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-009-0295-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245013700171300001600308520111800324592002801442650001601470650002001486650001101506650001201517650002201529650001601551650002201567650001101589650001201600650004101612650001701653650001101670650000901681650001901690650001301709700001701722700002301739773011901762856008201881852000901963655001201972IND60617254420221117161459.0181024e198607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061725442DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517586056007062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakamoto, Munenori10aGas Chromatographic and Mass Spectrometric Study of the Bromination of Protein Fibers with N-Bromosuccinimide and Triphenylphosphine  ap. 429-437.  aSilk fibers were brominated with a 1:1 (mole/mole) mixture of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and triphenylphosphine (TPP) in dimethylformamide. β-Bromoalanine (Brala) residues formed by the bromination of serine residues with NBS/TPP were very un stable under acid hydrolysis conditions, and Brala was not detected in the hydrolyzate of the brominated silk by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of amino acids as their butyl esters of N(Q)-triftuoroacetyl derivatives. The brominated silk fibers were treated with aqueous solutions of ammonia and methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butyl amines. Chromatographic-spectrometric analysis of amino acids of the treated silk samples showed the formation of corresponding β-aminoalanine and β-alkylami noalanines formed by the reaction of Brala residues, by direct condensation, or through the formation of dehydroalanine residues as intermediates. The analysis also showed that monobromotyrosine was formed by the treatment with NBS/TPP. Bromination of tyrosine residues must proceed by electrophilic substitution, probably by the action of free NBS in the reaction mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aacid hydrolysis 3aamines 3aammonia 3aaqueous solutions 3abromination 3adimethylformamide 3aesters 3afabrics 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrolysates 3aserine 3asilk 3atextile fibers 3atyrosine1 aMasuko, Fumi1 aNakanishi, Shigeko0 tTextile research journal.g1986 July, v. 56, no. 7 p.429-437dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517586056007063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245015800176300001600334520103100350592002801381650002101409650002101430650001501451650000901466650002501475650001501500650001801515650001501533650001501548650001601563650001701579650002901596650003101625650002101656650000901677650002101686653001401707653001601721653001901737653003101756653002901787700001901816700002601835700001801861700002501879773011301904856008302017852000902100655001202109IND60547070520221121010246.0161023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054707052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPramanik, Biplob Kumar10aComparisons between biological filtration and coagulation processes for the removal of dissolved organic nitrogen and disinfection by-products precursors  ap. 164-169.  aEffects of biological aerated filter (BAF), sand filter (SF), biological activated carbon (BAC), alum coagulation, and Moringa oleifera coagulation on the removal of DOC and DON from reservoir water were investigated. The DOC removal efficiency was in the following sequence: BAC (56%), BAF (51%), SF (45%), alum (27%), and M. oleifera (22%). The trend for DON removal efficiency was similar to that of DOC. The better performance by BAC was attributed to the effective microbial breakdown of organic matter and the adsorption of some molecules onto activated carbon. The organic content with a molecular weight (MW) of less than 10 kDa accounted for more than 45% of the total DOC, whereas a MW of less than 1 kDa accounted for 50% of the total DON. The biofilters removed the entire MW range of organic contents, unlike the coagulants which only removed organics with a MW of more than 10 kDa. Consistent with greater DOC and DON removal, BAC led to greater removal of DBP precursors as shown by DBP formation potentials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aalum 3abioactive properties 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3abyproducts 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic carbon 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3amolecular weight 3asand 3awater reservoirs 0aBiofilter 0aCoagulation 0aDrinking water 0aDissolved organic nitrogen 0aDisinfection by-products1 aChoo, Kwang-Ho1 aPramanik, Sagor Kumar1 aSuja, Fatihah1 aJegatheesan, Veeriah0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2015 Oct., v. 104 p.164-169dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100001700190245011000207300001300317506007600330520102900406592002801435506003701463650001201500650001301512650002401525650002301549650002201572650001101594650001801605650004001623650000901663650003701672650002501709650001101734650000901745650001001754650000901764650002201773650004701795650003101842650001101873650001701884650003801901650003401939650001501973650006401988650001102052650004902063650000902112650001602121650001602137700002102153700001902174700002602193773007802219856008302297852000902380655001202389IND60080898920221207093907.0140812e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008089892DNAL7 a214393682pmid7 aPMC31294132pmcid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConde, Lucia12aA search for overlapping genetic susceptibility loci between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and autoimmune diseases  ap. 9-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNon-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a hematological malignancy of the immune system, and, as with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (ADs), is influenced by genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Persons with a history of specific ADs also have increased risk of NHL. As the coexistence of ADs and NHL could be caused by factors common to both diseases, here we examined whether some of the associated genetic signals are shared. Overlapping risk loci for NHL subytpes and several ADs were explored using data from genome-wide association studies. Several common genomic regions and susceptibility loci were identified, suggesting a potential shared genetic background. Two independent MHC regions showed the main overlap, with several alleles in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region exhibiting an opposite risk effect for follicular lymphoma and type I diabetes. These results support continued investigation to further elucidate the relationship between lymphoma and autoimmune diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aantigens 3aautoimmune diseases 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aloci 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3anon-Hodgkin lymphoma 3apeople 3arisk 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAutoimmune Diseasesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 6 2aFemale 2aGenetic Loci 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenome-Wide Association Study 2aHaplotypes 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class IIxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHumans 2aLymphoma, Non-Hodgkinxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aYoung Adult1 aBracci, Paige M.1 aHalperin, Eran1 aSkibola, Christine F.0 tGenomics.g2011 July, v. 98, no. 1 p.9-14dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245010300168300001600271500001900287520135500306592002801661650001201689650001301701650001301714650001101727650002601738650001101764650001201775651001201787651001101799651001301810651001001823651002801833653003001861653001701891653001201908653001401920653002001934653002301954700002301977700002002000773011102020856008002131852000902211655001202220IND60695836520221118061632.0200519e20071201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069583652DNAL7 a10.1179/174328207X2297602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBates, Jeffrey W.10aDialytrichia fragilifolia (Bryopsida: Pottiaceae) in Berkshire and Caernarvonshire, new to Britain  ap. 228-234.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDialytrichia fragilifolia (Bizot & Cl. Roux) F.Lara has been found at two localities near the River Thames in Berkshire (v.-c. 22), southern England and also identified as a herbarium specimen from Caernarvonshire (v.-c. 49), North Wales. A description is presented based on the British material which is sterile. This moss is similar to D. mucronata but possesses fragile leaves and a bistratose leaf border with markedly crenate margins, particularly in the apical one-third of the leaf. Mature shoots often have a brush-like apex produced by the persistent costas. It appears to require shadier and less-frequently flooded conditions than D. mucronata. An earlier record of Syntrichia (Tortula) fragilis from Mont-St-Michel in north-west France is shown to be erroneous; the specimen (in E) is also D. fragilifolia. A survey of numerous Dialytrichia specimens held at NMW revealed a further British specimen of D. fragilifolia and also drew attention to the widespread occurrence in Britain, previously overlooked, of D. mucronata plants with fragile leaves. The pattern of leaf fragility differs between the two species. Previously, D. fragilifolia was known only from southern France, Portugal and western Spain. The new records together with other recent finds in Europe extend the range of this moss significantly northwards in western Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTortula 3abryology 3aherbaria 3aleaves 3amosses and liverworts 3arivers 3asurveys 3aEngland 3aFrance 3aPortugal 3aSpain 3aWestern European region 0aDIALYTRICHIA FRAGILIFOLIA 0aD.

Forty-eight sows (Landrace× Large White) were housed in either a farrowing pen without straw (C, n = 24) or with straw (S, n = 24). Behaviors were observed using video recordings and were statistically analyzed. Lateral recumbency was higher and standing was lower in S compared with C (p = .034 and p = .020, respectively), and lateral recumbency to other postures, ventral to lateral recumbency and standing to lying were markedly lower in S than C (p = .014, p = .025 and p = .023, respectively) on Day 1 postpartum. However, except piglet losses during the first three days postpartum (p = .032), piglet weight on Day 21 (p = .037), and piglet weaning weight (p = .020), other production performances were not significantly different between the two groups during the whole experimental period (p ˃.05). The results suggest the enrichment of a farrowing pen with straw has important beneficial effects on sow and piglet welfare and improves piglet survival rates.  aThis study was supported by a grant from the Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System (No. CARS-35), the Province Science Foundation of Hei Longjiang in China (Project Nos.

This structure is packed with light-sensitive molecules known as visual pigments that consist of a G-protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane protein known as opsin, and a chromophore prosthetic group, either 11-cis retinal (‘A₁’) or 11-cis 3,4-didehydroretinal (‘A₂’). The enzyme cyp27c1 converts A₁ into A₂ in the retinal pigment epithelium. Replacing A₁ with A₂ in a visual pigment red-shifts its spectral sensitivity and broadens its bandwidth of absorption at the expense of decreased photosensitivity and increased thermal noise. The use of vitamin A₂-based visual pigments is strongly associated with the occupation of aquatic habitats in which the ambient light is red-shifted. By modulating the A₁/A₂ ratio in the retina, an organism can dynamically tune the spectral sensitivity of the visual system to better match the predominant wavelengths of light in its environment. As many as a quarter of all vertebrate species utilize A₂, at least during a part of their life cycle or under certain environmental conditions. A₂ utilization therefore represents an important and widespread mechanism of sensory plasticity. This review provides an up-to-date account of the A₁/A₂ chromophore exchange system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenzymes 3aepithelium 3aoccupations 3aopsin 3aphotosensitivity 3aplasticity 3avertebrates 0aRetina 0aPhotoreceptors 0aRods 0aCones 0aVitamin A1 0aVitamin A2 0aPorphyropsin 0aChromophore 0aVisual plasticity 0aSensory plasticity 0aSpectral tuning 0aVisual pigments 0aOpsins 0aVisual ecology0 tDevelopmental biology.g2021 July, v. 475 p.145-155dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2021.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013600165300001800301520169100319592002802010596009702038650001502135650002302150650001002173650002502183650002002208650001002228650002702238650002402265650001402289650001902303650002002322650002902342650001702371650002002388650004302408650001202451700001602463700001902479773013802498856008202636852000902718655001202727IND60707183320221117180016.0200819e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070718332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-020-00557-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Qingman10aEffects of astragalus polysaccharides on hemocytes phagocytosis and gene expression of immune-related factors in Eriocheir sinensis  ap. 1787-1796.  aThe 4-week feeding experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of astragalus polysaccharides (APS) on hemocytes phagocytosis and gene expression of immune-related factors in Eriocheir sinensis—with initial weights of 6.11 ± 2.25 g. The phagocytic activity of hemocytes in E. sinensis was determined by fluorescence labeling, and the expression of immune-related factor genes in different tissues of E. sinensis was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Results showed that APS significantly improved the phagocytic activity of hemocytes in E. sinensis (p < 0.05), and the phagocytic activity of hemocytes in the 0.1% APS group was the highest (50.84%). Moreover, 0.05% APS significantly increased the expression of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), anti-lipopolysaccharide (ALF), phenol oxidase (PO) and heat shock protein (HSP) genes in the hemocytes, and HSP in the hepatopancreas, and masquerade-like protein (MasL) in the gill (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 0.1% APS significantly increased the expression levels of PO, GSH-Px, ALF, MasL, and HSP genes in the hemocytes and gill (p < 0.05) and significantly increased the expression levels of PO, Crusl, and HSP genes in crab hepatopancreas (p < 0.05). In addition, 0.2% APS significantly increased the expression levels of all immune-related factor genes in the hemocytes and gill (p < 0.05) and significantly increased the expression levels of PO, ALF, Crusl, and HSP genes in the crab hepatopancreas (p < 0.05). It is estimated that APS could enhance the immune function of E. sinensis by increasing the phagocytic activity of hemocytes and the expression levels of the PO, GSH-Px, ALF, Crus1, MasL, and HSP genes.  aPublisher supplied data  aITTFRS2017006cthe innovation team for Tianjin modern agricultural industry technical system 3aAstragalus 3aEriocheir sinensis 3acrabs 3afluorescent labeling 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheat shock proteins 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3aimmune response 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aphagocytosis 3apolysaccharides 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atissues1 aZhao, Ziyue1 aYuan, Chunying0 tAquaculture international.g2020 Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.1787-1796dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-020-00557-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007300166300001800239500001100257520117000268592002801438596007101466596005801537650001301595650002001608650001501628650001301643650002401656650002201680650001101702650001401713650001201727700002401739700002401763700001801787700003001805700001501835700001301850700001301863700005601876773013901932856008302071852000902154655001202163IND60746970320221122031937.0211001e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074697032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-021-03845-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kangni10aChallenges and prospects for a potential allohexaploid Brassica crop  ap. 2711-2726.  aReview  aThe production of a new allohexaploid Brassica crop (2n = AABBCC) is increasingly attracting international interest: a new allohexaploid crop could benefit from several major advantages over the existing Brassica diploid and allotetraploid species, combining genetic diversity and traits from all six crop species with additional allelic heterosis from the extra genome. Although early attempts to produce allohexaploids showed mixed results, recent technological and conceptual advances have provided promising leads to follow. However, there are still major challenges which exist before this new crop type can be realized: (1) incorporation of sufficient genetic diversity to form a basis for breeding and improvement of this potential crop species; (2) restoration of regular meiosis, as most allohexaploids are genetically unstable after formation; and (3) improvement of agronomic traits to the level of “elite” breeding material in the diploid and allotetraploid crop species. In this review, we outline these major prospects and challenges and propose possible plans to produce a stable, diverse and agronomically viable allohexaploid Brassica crop.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0100601cNational Key Research and Development Program (CN)  aGZ 1362; DFG MA6473/3-1cSino-German Research Project 3aBrassica 3aallotetraploidy 3acole crops 3adiploidy 3agenetic instability 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3aheterosis 3ameiosis1 aMason, Annaliese S.1 aFarooq, Muhammad A.1 aIslam, Faisal1 aQuezada-Martinez, Daniela1 aHu, Dandan1 aYang, Su1 aZou, Jun1 aZhou, Weijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1471-96440 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2021 Sept., v. 134, no. 9 p.2711-2726dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-03845-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012300161300001800284500002000302520174500322592002802067650001802095650001402113650001302127650001202140650001702152650001202169650001102181650002602192650002402218650002402242700006402266700002202330700002502352700006302377773014202440856007502582852000902657655001202666IND60760465520221121225311.0211222e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076046552DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.162732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoward, Leigh A.10aEvaluation of a flash glucose monitoring system in nondiabetic dogs with rapidly changing blood glucose concentrations  ap. 2628-2635.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: A flash glucose monitoring system (FGMS; FreeStyle Libre) is useful for monitoring hypoglycemic dogs with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of this FGMS in dogs with induced hypoglycemia and rapid fluctuations in blood glucose (BG) concentrations. ANIMALS: Twenty‐four apparently healthy research (n = 10) and teaching (n = 14) dogs. METHODS: Prospective, observational study performed in tandem with a teaching laboratory. Regular insulin was administered to dogs and resulting hypoglycemia was corrected. Before insulin administration and every 10 minutes over a 90‐minute period, serial measurements of interstitial glucose (IG) with FGMS and BG with a portable blood glucose meter (PBGM) and clinical chemistry analyzer concentrations were made. Portable blood glucose meter and FGMS readings were compared to that of the clinical chemistry analyzer. Analytical and clinical accuracy were assessed using ISO 15197:2013 criteria, including Parkes error grid analysis. RESULTS: The proportions of readings in the low BG range (BG <100 mg/dL) for which the test method measurement was within ±15 mg/dL of the reference BG for the PBGM and FGMS were 81.7% (161/197) and 39.1% (72/184), respectively. The proportions of readings for the PBGM and FGMS, which were not likely to affect clinical outcome according to Parkes error grid analysis, were 97.9% (233/238) and 80.1% (177/221), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In this model, there was limited agreement between the FGMS and reference standard BG measurements. The FGMS (measuring IG concentrations) was compared to peripheral BG concentrations, not brain‐tissue glucose concentrations, and failed to reliably detect hypoglycemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3achemistry 3adiabetes 3aglucose 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3amodels 3aobservational studies 3areference standards 3aveterinary medicine1 aLidbury, Jonathan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5107-45771 aJeffery, Nicholas1 aWashburn, Shannon E.1 aPatterson, Carly A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1087-78800 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2021 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.2628-2635dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.162733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245016500169300001600334500001500350520169900365592002802064650002102092650001002113650001202123650002102135650001902156650001402175650002602189650002102215650003002236650001502266650001002281650002602291650001302317650001202330651001102342653001602353653003702369653002102406700002202427700004202449773010702491852000902598856008102607655001202688IND4462288420221120150937.0160405e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446228842DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585110002012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Farrill, Georgina10aOrigin and deposition sites influence seed germination and seedling survival of Manilkara zapota: implications for long-distance, animal-mediated seed dispersal  ap. 305-313.  a2019-12-05  aThe distribution and dynamics of plant populations depend on the recruitment of young individuals, which is influenced by seed production, animal seed dispersal, dispersal distance, and the deposition of seeds in favourable places for seed germination/establishment and seedling survival. In particular, seeds dispersed over long distances will likely encounter new environmental conditions that occur at large spatial scales, with seed and seedling survival influenced by the adaptation of plant populations to soil and climate conditions. In this paper, it is hypothesized that seed germination and seedling survival probabilities depend on seed origin and deposition sites. A reciprocal seed and seedling transplant experiment was carried out with zapote seeds (Manilkara zapota) to determine the effect of origin and deposition sites on seed germination and seedling survival over a year in the Greater Calakmul Region of Mexico. Two origin and two deposition sites were selected that show different soil moisture levels within the habitat of the Baird's tapir, a major seed disperser of M. zapota seeds. The results show that sites of origin and deposition influenced seed germination and seedling survival probabilities. This suggests that the displacement of seeds far from parent trees, while potentially reducing intraspecific competition, does not ensure their survival, and that seeds need to be deposited in microsites within their environmental tolerance for dispersal to be successful. Furthermore, this paper emphasizes the importance of field experiments to provide strong inference about the effects of environmental conditions on recruitment and distribution of plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3aanimals 3aManilkara zapota 3aseed dispersal 3aseedlings 3aenvironmental factors 3aplant adaptation 3aintraspecific competition 3asoil water 3atrees 3afield experimentation 3ahabitats 3aclimate 3aMexico 0arecruitment 0areciprocal transplant experiment 0alocal adaptation1 aChapman, Colin A.1 aGonzalez, Andrew B.,cBrother, F.S.C.0 tSeed science research.g2011 Dec., v. 21, no. 4 p.305-313dCambridge University Pressx1475-27357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09602585110002013Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02685naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010900170300001400279520137200293592002801665650002201693650001101715650002101726650001601747650001401763650001201777650001201789650001001801650001101811650001301822653002001835653001401855653002201869653001601891700001601907700001601923700001601939700001601955700001601971773015701987856008602144852000902230655001202239IND60721263320221121060626.0201224e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072126332DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2015.00009.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambade, P.S.10aClinicopathological studies of experimentally induced Nickel Chloride in Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus)  ap. 41-45.  aThe present work was carried out to study the clinicopathological changes induced by nickel chloride toxicity in rats. Forty adult Wistar rats were divided into four equal groups viz. Group I, Group II, Group III and Group IV. Group I rats received only deionized water and served as control. Group II, Group III and Group IV rats were orally administered daily with nickel chloride at the dose of 5.25 mg/kg (low dose), 10.5 mg/kg (mid dose) and 21 mg/kg (high dose), respectively, for a period of 28 days. Clinical signs in rats included dullness and depression in rats of Group IV receiving high dose (21 mg/kg) of nickel chloride from 21st day of post treatment through drinking. The significant (P < 0.05) decrease in body weight was observed in rats of Group IV from day 21 onwards as compared with the control group. The relative weight of testes and kidney was significantly decreased in male rats, also relative weight of kidney was significantly decreased in female rats. All the rats exposed to nickel chloride at three different dose levels revealed dose dependant pathological changes. The pathomorphological changes comprised of varying degrees of degenerative and vascular changes in various visceral organs. The severity and distribution of such lesions were found higher in rats of group III and IV as compared to group II and control (group I) rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRattus norvegicus 3aadults 3aanimal pathology 3abody weight 3achlorides 3afemales 3akidneys 3amales 3anickel 3atoxicity 0aNickel chloride 0aPathology 0aSubacute toxicity 0aWistar rats1 aJoshi, D.V.1 aPatel, B.J.1 aPatel, J.G.1 aRaval, S.H.1 aPatel, J.D.0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2015 Mar. 1, v. 39, no. 1 p.41-45dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-970X.2015.00009.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121072001700139072001700156100001600173245016900189300001600358520160600374650002101980650001502001650004202016650001802058650001802076650001602094650002002110650002002130650002202150650001002172700001402182700001402196700001402210700001402224700001602238700001402254773007302268852000902341856007902350930003302429945002502462946001302487655001202500IND4380344020221121040709.0060522e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438034402DNAL7 a10.1093/ps/85.3.5052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOnderci, M.10aEfficacy of supplementation of α-amylase-producing bacterial culture on the performance, nutrient use, and gut morphology of broiler chickens fed a corn-based diet  ap. 505-510.  aA trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an Escherichia coli strain producing alpha-amylase of Bacillus stearothermophilus on growth performance, nutrient use, and the morphology of the small intestine of broilers fed a corn-based diet. One hundred thirty-five 1-d-old chicks (Cobb 500) were randomly divided into 3 groups and treated as follows: (i) basal diet (control); (ii) basal diet and water supplemented with an E. coli strain that produced amylase, and (iii) basal diet and water supplemented with an E. coli strain that produced amylase plus bacterial hemoglobin. At 21 d of age, supplementation of E. coli improved daily gain (P < 0.05) and feed conversion (P < 0.01). At the end of the trial, birds supplemented with water containing bacteria consumed more and grew faster (P < 0.05) and had better feed conversion (P < 0.10) than broilers given no bacteria. Also, the presence of bacteria improved apparent digestibility of organic matter (P < 0.01). However, no effects were detected for CP or fat digestibility. Supplementation with E. coli reduced relative pancreas weight (P = 0.06) but did not affect the weight of the liver (P > 0.05) and length of duedonum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum (P > 0.05). Length of the villi and crypts were significantly increased with bacterial supplementation. Presence of the bacterial hemoglobin gene did not cause a significant difference in changes observed. The data indicated that supplementation of an E. coli strain capable of producing alpha-amylase improved digestibility of nutrients and performance of broilers fed a corn-based diet. 3abroiler chickens 3aprobiotics 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3aalpha-amylase 3adigestibility 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3aliveweight gain 3aintestinal crypts 3avilli1 aSahin, N.1 aSahin, K.1 aCikim, G.1 aAydin, A.1 aOzercan, I.1 aAydin, S.0 tPoultry science.g2006 Mar., v. 85, no. 3 p.505-510x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/85.3.5053Available from publisher's Web site  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/06/01  aOther US 7aarticle03794naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174072001700191100001300208245015800221300001400379520196900393650001902362650002002381650002002401650002502421650002002446650004702466650001202513650002902525650002502554650005202579650004802631650001402679650006302693650000902756650002002765650006002785650003202845650002402877650002402901700002002925700001902945700001902964700001602983773007102999852000903070856007803079930003303157945002503190946001303215655001203228IND4372375020221120224156.0050718e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437237502DNAL7 a156859402pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.1.372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMeng, X.10aDegradation of cell wall polysaccharides by combinations of carbohydrase enzymes and their effect on nutrient utilization and broiler chicken performance  ap. 37-47.  aIn vitro incubation studies were carried out to determine if various carbohydrase preparations contained appropriate activities to target nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) of wheat, soybean meal (SBM), canola meal, and peas. Triplicate samples (0.1 g) were incubated with a number of carbohydrase preparations (i.e., cellulase, pectinase, xylanase, glucanase, galactanase, and mannanase) or their combinations at 45 degrees C and pH 5.2. A more pronounced degradation of NSP was achieved when the enzyme preparations were used in concert. When compared with the control (nonenzyme treatment), the highest degree of NSP degradation reached was 37% for wheat, and 36, 26, and 28% for canola meal, SBM, and peas, respectively. Four enzyme combinations were studied further in a 2-wk (5 to 18 d of age) growth performance and nutrient digestibility trial with broiler chickens. All enzyme combinations were effective in improving (P < 0.05) weight gain, feed-to-gain ratio, AME(n), apparent ileal digestibilities of starch and protein, and apparent total tract digestibility of NSP in birds fed a wheat, wheat screening, SBM, canola meal, and peas-based diet. The most complex enzyme combination was found to be superior (P < 0.05) to others in improving ileal protein digestibility and feed-to-gain ratio. The effectiveness of this combination in elimination of the nutrient-encapsulating effect of cell walls was further evaluated in a balance study with adult roosters fed a conventionally ground full-fat canola seed. Enzyme addition increased (P < 0.05) NSP digestibility from 11.1 to 30.1%, which, in turn, resulted in a marked increase (P < 0.05) in TME(n) value (4.176 vs 4.744 Mcal/kg) of the seed. It is evident from the present studies that the addition of an appropriate combination of carbohydrase enzymes to target cell wall polysaccharide structures could further improve enzyme efficacy in practical wheat, SBM, canola meal, and peas-based broiler diets. 3afeed additives 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3acell wall components 3abroiler feeding 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBrassica rapaxchemistry 2aCell Wallxchemistry 2aCellulasexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aDigestion 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPeasxchemistry 2aPolygalacturonasexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aTriticumxchemistry1 aSlominski, B.A.1 aNyachoti, C.M.1 aCampbell, L.D.1 aGuenter, W.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.37-47x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.1.373Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/07/27  aOther US 7aarticle03600naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011300145300002000258500001500278520189600293650002602189650001502215650002002230650002702250650002902277650002102306650002002327650001402347650002602361650002502387650002002412650002702432650001002459650001202469650002702481650005302508650002902561650003702590650001302627650001002640650003002650650002402680653001502704653003402719653001502753653001802768653001802786700002302804700001702827773009802844852000902942930003302951945001302984946001302997655001203010IND2037374120221120224225.0940217e19930815mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203737412DNAL7 a83943422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCubitt, A.B.10aDevelopmentally regulated changes in 1,2-diacylglycerol in Dictyostelium: regulation by light and G proteins  ap. 17431-17439.  a2019-12-05  aWe have measured 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) mass during Dictyostelium development. DG levels are initially high in vegetative cells, decrease upon starvation, increase during aggregation, and rise dramatically during culmination, concomitant with SpiA (a spore cell-specific gene) expression. These results are consistent with DG being involved in culmination-stage morphological changes and cell-type differentiation. Mutant analysis shows that the rise in DG during aggregation requires cAMP signaling pathways but is not directly regulated through these processes but via developmental programs induced through cAMP. DG accumulation during aggregation is approximately 8-fold higher than would be expected from inositol lipid hydrolysis, suggesting that DG is produced from sources in addition to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Our data suggest that during aggregation, although some DG is formed through phospholipase D activity, other pathways (e.g. de novo synthesis) may be more important regulators of DG accumulation. During culmination, DG accumulation correlated with the formation of phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanol suggesting the activation of phospholipase D. During this time, the [3H]palmitate labeling of a number of phospholipids decreased rapidly, suggesting a rapid metabolism of phospholipids at this time. Exposure of slugs developed in the dark to light, which initiates culmination, causes rapid DG accumulation, suggesting the activation of phospholipid hydrolysis. The temporal pattern and level of DG accumulation is altered in G alpha 1 null and overexpressing strains, suggesting that G alpha 1 is upstream from DG formation during culmination. These results demonstrate that specific pathways of DG formation are under developmental control and suggest a possible link between light, the activation of DG production, and induction of culmination. 3aguanosine diphosphate 3acyclic AMP 3adiacylglycerols 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aDictyostelium discoideum 3abinding proteins 3aphospholipase D 3alipolysis 3aphosphatidylinositols 3acell differentiation 3aenzyme activity 3alife cycle (organisms) 3alight 2aAnimals 2aCyclic AMPxmetabolism 2aDictyosteliumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDiglyceridesxmetabolism 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLight 2aPhospholipidsxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 0ametabolism 0aphosphoric diester hydrolases 0aregulation 0aDictyostelium 0aphospholipids1 aDharmawardhane, S.1 aFirtel, R.A.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1993 Aug. 15, v. 268, no. 23 p.17431-17439x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03591naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001700192245009500209300001600304520204700320650002102367650002102388650001902409650001202428650001802440650001802458650002302476650001902499650002402518650001602542650002102558650001202579650002502591650001102616650003002627650002002657650000902677650003602686650001702722650001602739700001502755700001902770700001602789773007302805852000902878856007902887930003302966945002502999946001303024655001203037IND4380306520221120203939.0060518e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438030652DNAL7 a165532642pmid7 a10.1093/ps/85.3.3842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCoufal, C.D.10aNitrogen emissions from broilers measured by mass balance over eighteen consecutive flocks  ap. 384-391.  aEmission of nitrogen in the form of ammonia from poultry rearing facilities has been an important topic for the poultry industry because of concerns regarding the effects of ammonia on the environment. Sound scientific data is needed to accurately estimate air emissions from poultry operations. Many factors, such as season of the year, ambient temperature and humidity, bird health, and management practices can influence ammonia volatilization from broiler rearing facilities. Precise results are often difficult to attain from commercial facilities, particularly over long periods of time. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to determine nitrogen loss from broilers in a research facility under conditions simulating commercial production for 18 consecutive flocks. Broilers were reared to 40 to 42 d of age and fed diets obtained from a commercial broiler integrator. New rice hulls were used for litter for the first flock, and the same litter was recycled for all subsequent flocks with caked litter removed between flocks. All birds, feeds, and litter materials entering and leaving the facility were quantified, sampled, and analyzed for total nitrogen content. Nitrogen loss was calculated by the mass balance method in which loss was equal to the difference between the nitrogen inputs and the nitrogen outputs. Nitrogen partitioning as a percentage of inputs averaged 15.29, 6.84, 55.52, 1.27, and 21.08% for litter, caked litter, broiler carcasses, mortalities, and nitrogen loss, respectively, over all eighteen flocks. During the production of 18 flocks of broilers on the same recycled litter, the average nitrogen emission rate was calculated to range from 4.13 to 19.74 g of N/kg of marketed broiler (grams of nitrogen per kilogram) and averaged 11.07 g of N/kg. Nitrogen loss was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for flocks reared in summer vs. winter. Results of this experiment have demonstrated that the rate of nitrogen volatilization from broiler grow-out facilities varies significantly on a flock-to-flock basis. 3alitter (bedding) 3anitrogen content 3avolatilization 3aammonia 3aair pollution 3agas emissions 3aseasonal variation 2aAir Pollutants 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFloors and Floorcoverings 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aNitrogenxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gain1 aChavez, C.1 aNiemeyer, P.R.1 aCarey, J.B.0 tPoultry science.g2006 Mar., v. 85, no. 3 p.384-391x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/85.3.3843Available from publisher's Web site  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/06/01  aOther US 7aarticle03044naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245006000149300001600209520144700225650001501672650003001687650001201717650002301729650003601752650002101788650001001809650000801819650001001827650001501837650001001852650002401862650003301886650003401919650003401953650001801987650001102005650001102016650002802027650000902055650002402064650002602088650001602114650002202130700001802152700001502170700001702185700001702202773019102219852000902410930003302419945001302452946001302465655001202478IND2037054320221120183242.0940202e199312  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203705432DNAL7 a81184752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontvielle, A.M.10aEnergy cost of arousal: effect of sex, race and obesity  ap. 705-709.  aThe basal (BMR) to sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) ratio might represent an estimate of the activation of the nervous system (central/sympathetic) from sleeping to basal state. Since this activation might be influenced by the degree of obesity, and might be different between sexes, we retrospectively analysed energy expenditure data collected for a large number of subjects. Twenty-four hour energy expenditure (24EE), BMR and SMR were measured in a respiratory chamber in 122 Caucasians (63 males/59 females, 32 +/- 10 years, 94 +/- 33 kg, 29 +/- 11% fat) (means +/- s.d.) and in 123 Pima Indians (68 males/55 females, 29 +/- 7 years, 100 +/- 25 kg, 34 +/- 9% fat). The BMR/SMR ratio varied greatly between individuals (1.05 +/- 0.08; range 0.87-1.34). In Pima Indians, BMR/SMR was inversely correlated to both fat mass (r = -0.26; P < 0.01) and BMI (r = -0.22; P < 0.05), whereas, in Caucasians, BMR/SMR was inversely correlated to waist/thigh circumference ratio (r = -0.28; P < 0.01). On average, the BMR/SMR was higher in Pima indians than in Caucasians (1.06 +/- 0.08 vs 1.03 +/- 0.07, P < 0.01) and higher in Pima Indian males than in Pima Indian females (1.08 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.06, P< 0.05). Studies are needed to investigate whether these differences in the increase in energy expenditure from the sleeping to the basal state are related to differences in the activation of the nervous system and/or to other metabolic factors. 3ametabolism 3aenergy cost of activities 3aobesity 3agender differences 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3abody composition 3asleep 3amen 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aArousalxphysiology 2aBasal Metabolismxphysiology 2aBody Constitutionxphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIndians, North American 2aMale 2aObesityxmetabolism 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSex Factors 2aSleepxphysiology1 aFerraro, R.T.1 aRising, R.1 aLarson, D.E.1 aRavussin, E.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g1993 Dec., v. 17, no. 12 p.705-709x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle02994naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245018100144300001600325520120100341650002201542650002501564650001501589650001101604650002501615650002301640650001201663650002201675650001901697650001601716650001001732650002501742650001301767650001101780650002201791650001101813650002501824650000901849650005701858650002001915650003201935650001501967650001601982700001501998700001902013700001302032700001802045700001902063700002002082700001902102700001402121773018902135852000902324930003302333945001302366946001302379655001202392IND2303222220221120162445.0010504e200005  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND230322222DNAL7 a108495782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlem, M.L.12aA case-control study of successful maintenance of a substantial weight loss: individuals who lost weight through surgery versus those who lost weight through non-surgical means  ap. 573-579.  aTo determine if method of weight loss (surgery; non-surgery) is associated with current levels of psychosocial functional or current weight maintenance behaviors in individuals who have lost large amounts of weight.

Cases had initially lost weight through bariatric surgery while controls had lost weight through non-surgical means. The current psychosocial functioning and weight maintenance behaviors of cases and controls were assessed and compared. Cases and controls were matched on gender, current weight and total weight loss. Surgical cases reported significantly higher fat intake and lower physical activity levels. There were no differences in cases' and controls' reports of the impact of weight loss on other areas of their lives, neither were there differences on measures of depression or binge-eating. Reported improvement in psychosocial functioning did not depend upon how weight was initially lost, but cases and controls appear to be using very different behaviors to maintain their weight losses. 3abariatric surgery 3acase-control studies 3afat intake 3agender 3alongitudinal studies 3ametabolic diseases 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aweight control 3aweight loss 2aAdult 2aCase-Control Studies 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aObesityxdiet therapyxpsychologyxsurgeryxtherapy. 2aQuality of Life 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRegistries 2aWeight Loss1 aWing, R.R.1 aHo Chang, C.C.1 aLang, W.1 aMcGuire, M.T.1 aSugerman, H.J.1 aHutchison, S.L.1 aMakovich, A.L.1 aHill, Jo.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2000 May, v. 24, no. 5 p.573-579x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03600naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001200192245014300204300001600347520194400363650002102307650002002328650001802348650001802366650003102384650001802415650002502433650002302458650002302481650001002504650001202514650003002526650005702556650000902613650003302622650003102655650004902686650004702735700002002782700001702802700001902819773007302838852000902911856007902920930003302999945002503032946001303057655001203070IND4380341020221120162403.0060522e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438034102DNAL7 a165532702pmid7 a10.1093/ps/85.3.4222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLiu, C.10aDifferential expression of membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the skeletal muscle of turkeys with different growth rates  ap. 422-428.  aHeparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are key components of the cell membrane and extracellular matrix of skeletal muscle cells. Two major groups of membrane-associated HSPG found in skeletal muscle are syndecans (SYN) and glypicans (GPC), both of which can regulate growth factor activities and, thus, modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. In the current study, the mRNA expression of a group of membrane-associated HSPG (SYN 2 through 4 and GPC 1) was investigated in embryonic pectoralis major muscle [embryonic days (ED) 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24] and myogenic satellite cells isolated from males of a turkey genetic line selected for increased 16-wk BW (F line) and an unselected randombred control (RBC2 line) from which the F line was developed. The mRNA expression was measured by a real-time quantitative PCR approach. The SYN 2 and SYN 4 expression exhibited a similar pattern during embryonic p. major muscle development, which remained constant from ED 14 to ED 22 and declined sharply from ED 22 to ED 24 to a very low level. In contrast, the SYN 3 and GPC 1 expression showed a continuous decline from ED 14 to ED 24. The F line had higher SYN 2 (ED 14, 18, 20, 22), SYN 3 (ED 22), and SYN 4 (ED 22) expression than the RBC2 line. In myogenic satellite cells, initiating differentiation resulted in a decrease in SYN 2 expression and an increase in GPC 1 expression. Both SYN 3 and SYN 4 expression stayed almost constant through both the proliferation and differentiation stages. The proliferating satellite cells from the F line displayed higher SYN 4 expression than those from the RBC2 line. Collectively, the results from the current study suggest that membrane-associated HSPG are differentially expressed in both embryonic p. major muscle tissue and satellite cells isolated from F-line and RBC2-line male turkeys, implying their distinct roles in myogenesis and differing influence on muscle growth properties. 3aline differences 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryogenesis 3abreast muscle 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3acell differentiation 3acell proliferation 3amuscle development 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aHeparan Sulfate Proteoglycansxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSatellite Cells, Skeletal Musclexmetabolism 2aTurkeysxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aMcFarland, D.C.1 aNestor, K.E.1 aVelleman, S.G.0 tPoultry science.g2006 Mar., v. 85, no. 3 p.422-428x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/85.3.4223Available from publisher's Web site  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/06/01  aOther US 7aarticle03729naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175072001700192100001700209245011200226300001600338500001500354520212400369650002302493650001602516650002002532650001502552650002702567650002102594650002102615650001602636650001202652650003302664650002502697650002102722650002502743650000902768650001102777650002602788650003102814650003902845653001302884653002702897700001902924773007302943852000903016856007903025930003303104945002503137946001303162655001203175IND4380341320221120162458.0060522e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438034132DNAL7 a165532722pmid7 a10.1093/ps/85.3.4352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

More SE somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antibodies were found in plasma pools from efficient hens (R-) compared with nonefficient hens (R+) after oral challenge with live SE. Mean titers of somatic agglutinins in bile were 2.3 in R- hens and 1.9 in R+ hens (P = 0.06) following live challenge. Salmonella enteritidis antibodies were also found in bile of nonchallenged hens of both types but their levels were not significantly different. Flagellar (H) agglutinin scores were higher in SE-challenged hens compared with nonchallenged hens (3.1 vs. 2.1; P less than or equal to 0.004) but efficiency types did not differ. Bile also contained high titers of the anti-Gal antibody indicated by the agglutination of glutaraldehyde-stabilized rabbit erythrocytes. The average titer of all SE-nonexposed hens was 9.0 corresponding to 1:5,120 when corrected for the initial dilution and expressed in conventional terms. Salmonella enteritidis exposure was associated with higher anti-Gal titers. The average anti-Gal titer for all SE-exposed hens was 10.0, corresponding to 1:10,240 in conventional terms; this difference was significant (P less than or equal to 0.016). Diet efficiency type-associated differences in anti-Gal titers were not significant. Collectively, our data indicate that diet efficiency status is not associated with compromised Salmonella-specific immune responses. Rather it appears that the immune responses of diet efficient hens (R-) are also more efficient. This is because R- hens produced higher levels of O- and H-type antibody only as the result of direct exposure to living SE. On the contrary, R+ hens produced H-type antibody because of challenge with heat-killed SE, a circumstance that will not result in disease. Moreover, the hen type difference does not seem to occur at the expense of innate immunity as measured by anti-Gal antibody levels. 3aantibody formation 3alaying hens 3afeed conversion 3aantibodies 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunoglobulin A 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aAntibody Specificity 2aBileximmunology 2aChickensximmunology 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aGalactoseximmunology 2aHemagglutininsximmunology 2aSalmonella enteritidisximmunology 0aimmunity 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aEerden, E. van0 tPoultry science.g2006 Mar., v. 85, no. 3 p.435-440x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/85.3.4353Available from publisher's Web site  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/06/01  aOther US 7aarticle03961naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245013700143300001600280520196700296650001102263650001802274650001902292650002802311650001702339650002002356650002802376650001202404650001202416650002302428650001102451650003102462650002302493650002302516650001202539650000902551650002102560650002102581650002302602650001002625650001202635650001902647650001002666650002102676650002202697650001602719650002802735650001102763650001102774650002302785650002102808650001802829650003102847650001602878650001702894650002502911700001402936700001302950700001602963700001402979773019002993852000903183930003303192945001303225946001303238655001203251IND2321339120221120143044.0010605e200006  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232133912DNAL7 a108786822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTai, E.S.10aBody fat distribution and cardiovascular risk in normal weight women. Associations with insulin resistance, lipids and plasma leptin  ap. 751-757.  aOBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the correlations between insulin resistance, plasma leptin concentration, obesity and the distribution of fat assessed by anthropometry and magnetic resonance imaging in Asian women. DESIGN: A cross sectional study of non-diabetic, normal weight women. SUBJECTS: Twenty-one healthy women aged 38.8 y (s.d. 11.7) and BMI 22.6 kg/m2 (s.d. 2.3). MEASUREMENTS: Intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal and subcutaneous abdominal fat volume was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Anthropometric data were collected. Total fat mass was assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis. Fasting serum lipids, insulin and plasma leptin were assayed. RESULTS: Generalized obesity correlated with subcutaneous abdominal fat mass (r = 0.83, P < 0.001), but not with intra-abdominal fat mass. Both intraperitoneal fat mass and retroperitoneal fat mass increased with age (r = 0.58, P = 0.005 and r = 0.612, P = 0.003, respectively). Abdominal subcutaneous fat mass was the most important determinant of insulin resistance and plasma leptin. Of the serum lipids, only fasting triglyceride correlated significantly with the waist-to-hip ratio. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that the large size of the subcutaneous depot compared to the intra-abdominal depot overwhelms any metabolic differences between adipose tissue from these two sites, resulting in the stronger correlation between insulin resistance and subcutaneous abdominal fat mass rather than intra-abdominal fat mass. On the other hand, the distribution of fat between subcutaneous fat depots may be important in the metabolic syndrome given the correlation of fasting triglyceride with waist to hip ratio but not with abdominal fat. However, the study population was small, younger and leaner compared to previous studies and we may not be able to generalize these results to all segments of the population. We confirm that subcutaneous fat mass is the major determinant of plasma leptin. 3aAsians 3aabdominal fat 3aadipose tissue 3abioelectrical impedance 3ablood lipids 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3afasting 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aleptin 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3arisk 3asubcutaneous fat 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3awomen 2aAbdomen 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAdult 2aBody Composition 2aBody Constitution 2aBody Weight 2aCardiovascular Diseases 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistance 2aLeptinxanalysis 2aLipidsxblood 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aTriglyceridesxblood1 aLau, T.N.1 aHo, S.C.1 aFok, A.C.K.1 aTan, C.E.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2000 June, v. 24, no. 6 p.751-757x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle05096naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245016300187300001400350500001500364520274000379650002303119650004303142650002603185650005603211650007603267650003003343650001103373650002203384650003903406650001103445650006103456650000903517650004303526650001603569650002303585650002103608650005103629650006403680650006003744650005103804651001103855653001603866653002203882653002303904653001003927653003003937653003503967700001604002700001304018700001404031700001604045700001304061700002104074700001504095700001204110700001704122773012604139852000904265856009204274930003304366946001104399655001204410IND4404894620221120132008.0080425e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440489462DNAL7 a184356732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00886.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarz, B.10aCost-effectiveness of sitagliptin-based treatment regimens in European patients with type 2 diabetes and haemoglobin A1c above target on metformin monotherapy  ap. 43-55.  a2019-12-04  aSitagliptin is a novel oral incretin enhancer that acts by inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 enzyme and is indicated in Europe as a treatment adjunct to metformin (MF), sulphonylurea (SU), MF plus SU and diet and exercise, in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The objective of the current analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding sitagliptin to the regimens of patients with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) above the International Diabetes Federation goal (6.5%) while on MF in six European countries: Austria, Finland, Portugal, Scotland (United Kingdom), Spain and Sweden. A discrete event simulation model, which employed the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model risk equations for predicting risks of diabetes-related complication, was used. Lifetime costs and benefits were projected for alternative treatment strategies of adding sitagliptin, compared with adding rosiglitazone or a SU to MF in patients not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy. Changes in HbA1C as well as side effects associated with these different treatment strategies were based on clinical trial data. Mean baseline values from local epidemiologic studies involving patients with type 2 diabetes not at HbA1C goal on MF monotherapy were included in the current analysis. Costs of medications, side effects and direct costs of diabetes-related complications were based on country-specific data. UKPDS-based disutility weights associated with diabetes complications were incorporated. Disutilities associated with medication side effects were based on published data. All future costs and benefits were discounted according to local guidelines on cost-effectiveness analysis. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying key input parameters. The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) associated with the addition of sitagliptin to MF, compared with adding rosiglitazone, in the different countries analysed ranged from treatment with sitagliptin being dominant (cost saving with improved health outcome) to its being cost-effective [[Euro Sign]4,766 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)]. Treatment with sitagliptin added to MF was cost-effective compared with adding a SU, with discounted ICER values ranging from [Euro Sign]5949/QALY to [Euro Sign]20 350/QALY across countries. Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust to changes in input parameters, including clinical efficacy, costs and utility weights for both diabetes-related complications and hypoglycaemia. Compared with adding rosiglitazone or a SU to MF, adding sitagliptin to MF is projected to be either cost saving or cost-effective for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not at HbA1C goal on MF. 3acost effectiveness 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aCost-Benefit Analysis 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapyxeconomics. 2aDipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitorsxadministration & dosagexeconomics. 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aFemale 2aHealth Care Costs 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxdrug effects. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadministration & dosagexeconomics. 2aMale 2aMetforminxeconomicsxtherapeutic use. 2aMiddle Aged 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Economic 2aPyrazinesxadministration & dosagexeconomics. 2aSulfonylurea Compoundsxadministration & dosagexeconomics. 2aThiazolidinedionesxadministration & dosagexeconomics. 2aTriazolesxadministration & dosagexeconomics. 0aEurope 0asitagliptin 0aeconomic analysis 0aeconomic modelling 0aUKPDS 0adiscrete event simulation 0adiabetes-related complications1 aGouveia, M.1 aChen, J.1 aNocea, G.1 aJameson, K.1 aCook, J.1 aKrishnarajah, G.1 aAlemao, E.1 aYin, D.1 aSintonen, H.0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2008 June, v. 10, no. s1 p.43-55dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00886.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03056naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001700192245010900209300001600318500001500334520143500349650002501784650001601809650002701825650002401852650001501876650001201891650001301903650000901916650002401925650001901949650002601968650004301994650003502037650003502072650002002107650001402127650001302141653001602154700001702170700002202187700001802209700001302227700001802240773007302258852000902331856007902340930003302419945002502452946001302477655001202490IND4372380120221120121822.0050718e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437238012DNAL7 a156859552pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.1.1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

One hundred sixty Babcock B-300 x laying hens, 20 wk of age, were allotted to 5 dietary treatments comprising a control diet (D5) with soybean oil at 100% or SSS in proportions of 25% (D1), 50% (D2), 75% (D3), and 100% (D4) replacing the oil source in commercial-type diets throughout the 15-wk laying period. Egg quality parameters were recorded weekly. Four pooled yolks for each treatment were collected at 0, 9, and 15 wk, and their FA profiles were determined. Egg weight, shell thickness, shape index, and Haugh unit were not influenced by dietary treatment. The concentrations of saturated FA (SFA) in yolks were generally kept at a constant level, regardless of the percentage of SSS in the hen diets. Total monounsaturated FA (MUFA) content did not vary over the course of the experiment, except for C14:1. After 15 wk of feeding, the total polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) n-3 increased in yolks of all diets. Among the long-chain PUFA, the percentage of C20:4 (arachidonic acid) was less affected. Inclusion of 100% SSS allowed production of eggs with similar PUFA/SFA and n-6/n-3 ratios when compared with eggs from hens fed D5. As SSS represents one-third of the oil cost, its inclusion in layer diets could represent an important economic benefit. 3aegg yolk composition 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3aegg shell thickness 3aegg weight 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDiet 2aEgg Yolkxchemistry 2aEggsxanalysis 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxanalysis 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xanalysis 2aFatty Acids, Omega-6xanalysis 2aQuality Control 2aSoy Foods 2aSoybeans 0aegg quality1 aLandin, L.A.1 aWaliszewski, K.N.1 aPerez-Gil, F.1 aDiaz, L.1 aHernandez, B.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.148-157x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.1.1483Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/07/28  aOther US 7aarticle03295naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245014700146300002000293500001500313520132400328650001801652650002101670650002001691650002201711650001601733650001501749650002201764650002001786650001301806650002501819650001901844650001801863650001001881650002401891650001801915650002201933650002301955650001501978650004201993650002802035650007502063650003502138650002702173650003402200650003602234650004402270653002302314653001402337653001902351653002502370653002802395653001902423700001902442700001802461773009802479852000902577930003302586945001302619946001302632655001202645IND2060180820221120101214.0971020e19960906mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206018082DNAL7 a87029852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOelmuller, R.10aMolecular studies of CtpA, the carboxyl-terminal processing protease for the D1 protein of the photosystem II reaction center in higher plants  ap. 21848-21852.  a2019-12-05  aThe D1 reaction center protein of the Photosystem II complex in green plants is synthesized with a short carboxyl-terminal extension. Proteolytic cleavage and removal of this extension peptide in the thylakoid lumen are necessary for the assembly of a manganese cluster that is essential for the oxygen evolution activity of Photosystem II. We have isolated cDNAs encoding CtpA, the carboxyl-terminal processing protease for the D1 protein, from two higher plants, spinach and barley. In each of these organisms, CtpA is encoded by a single copy nuclear gene, and its steady-state mRNA levels are light-regulated. The CtpA protein is detectable in etiolated material, and its level increases approximately 5-fold upon illumination. Moreover, the CtpA gene is expressed in shoot tissues and not in roots. In its precursor form, the CtpA protein harbors a bipartite transit sequence characteristic for thylakoid lumenal proteins. Cell fractionation studies demonstrated that CtpA is associated with thylakoid membranes and is resistant to treatments with thermolysin, consistent with its localization in the lumen of thylakoids. Comparisons of the sequence of the higher plant CtpA enzyme with those of other related carboxyl-terminal processing proteases suggest that these proteins constitute a new family of proteases. 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3aHordeum vulgare 3acomplementary DNA 3aproteinases 3athylakoids 3aSpinacia oleracea 3agene expression 3azymogens 3anucleotide sequences 3asignal peptide 3acytochemistry 3alight 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCarboxypeptidases 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDNA, Plant 2aEndopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complex 2aProprotein Convertases 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSpinacia oleraceaxchemistryxgenetics. 0agenetic regulation 0actpa gene 0agenbank/x90929 0aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x905581 aHerrmann, R.G.1 aPakrasi, H.B.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Sept. 6, v. 271, no. 36 p.21848-21852x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02866naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245011100190300001400301500002400315520116500339650001501504650002101519650001801540650002101558650001701579650001701596650001601613650002001629650001001649650001701659650002401676650001201700650003201712650002001744650004001764650004701804650003101851650003701882650000901919650005401928650001001982700001401992700001502006700001802021700001402039700001602053700001602069773012602085852000902211856009202220655001202312IND4463188520221120035240.0120510e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446318852DNAL7 a150961052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2004.00557.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaliharova, V.14aThe effects of fenbendazole, flubendazole and mebendazole on activities of hepatic cytochromes P450 in pig  ap. 85-90.  aIncludes references  aFenbendazole (FBZ), flubendazole (FLBZ) and mebendazole (MBZ) are benzimidazole anthelmintics widely used in veterinary medicine. The effects of these drugs on cytochromes P450 (CYP) were investigated in primary cultures of swine (Sus scrofa f. domestica) hepatocytes. After 48-h incubation of hepatocytes with benzimidazoles (0.1–2.5 μm), ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD), benzoxyresorufin O-dearylation (BROD), testosterone hydroxylase (6β-TOH) and testosterone oxidase (17-TO) activities were measured and the CYP1A and 3A protein levels were determined by Western blotting. FBZ produced a significant, concentration-dependent increase of CYP1A activity (EROD) and protein level. No enhancement of CYP1A was observed after exposure to FLBZ and MBZ. All benzimidazoles tested did not cause any induction of CYP3A (BROD, 6β-TOH, 17-TO activities and protein content). On the other hand, MBZ produced a significant, concentration-dependent decrease of CYP3A (BROD, 6β-TOH and 17-TO) activities. Pharmacological and toxicological consequences of CYP1A induction and CYP3A inhibition should be taken into account in treatment of pigs with FBZ and MBZ. 3aSus scrofa 3aWestern blotting 3abenzimidazole 3acytochrome P-450 3afenbendazole 3aflubendazole 3amebendazole 3aprotein content 3aswine 3atestosterone 3aveterinary medicine 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxpharmacology 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxmetabolism 2aFenbendazolexpharmacology 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMale 2aMebendazolexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aSwine1 aVelik, J.1 aSavlik, M.1 aSzotakova, B.1 aLamka, J.1 aTahotna, L.1 aSkalova, L.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2004 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.85-90dBlackwell Sciencex0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2004.00557.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03365naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245016000155300001800315300003200333520176800365650002702133650002502160650000902185650001602194650002002210650002202230650005002252650001202302650002002314650000902334650005102343650001802394650002702412650001102439650005702450650000902507650005302516650000902569650002502578653001802603700001902621700002202640700002202662700001902684773006902703852000902772939003302781945000802814946001302822655001202835991573792220742620221123044033.0840724e198311  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840052342DNAL7 a65802522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunningham, John.10aIncreased efficiency of weight gain and altered cellularity of brown adipose tissue in rats with impaired glucose tolerance during diet-induced overfeeding  ap. 1023-1027.  ap. 1023-1027. ill., charts.  aExtract: We examined the relationship among glucose tolerance, efficiency of weight gain, and cellularity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in rats (initial weight: 362 g) made hyperphagic and obese by feeding on a highly palatable "cafeteria" (CAF) diet for 4-8 weeks. As compared with chow-fed controls, CAF feeding resulted in a 45-60% increase in caloric intake, a 40-50% increase in weight gain, and hyperinsulinemia. Glucose disposal rate (K) on intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was greater than or equal to 1.4% in all chow-fed rats, but fell to less than or equal to 1.3 in 10 of 23 CAF-fed rats. As compared with the chow-fed controls, rats with normal glucose tolerance demonstrated a 12% decline in efficiency of weight gain (g/100 kcal of food consumed) in response to CAF feeding. In marked contrast, in rats with impaired glucose tolerance, efficiency of weight gain failed to decline in response to overfeeding and was 18% higher than in the overfed group with normal glucose tolerance. Although CAF feeding increased the mass of interscapular BAT by 110-130% in rats with normal as well as impaired glucose tolerance, DNA content of BAT rose only in the normal-K CAF-fed rats (0.19 mg DNA/100 mg versus 0.12 in chow-fed controls and 0.12 in low-K rats). We conclude that (1) impaired glucose tolerance accompanying dietary-induced obesity is associated with an increase in efficiency of weight gain and (2) failure of BAT cellularity to increase may contribute to the increase in efficiency. These data suggest that the link between obesity and diabetes may be bidirectional: obesity increases the risk of diabetes while impaired glucose tolerance may accelerate the development of obesity by enhancing efficiency of weight gain.

To test for a TA bias, we constructed clone libraries of fungal amplicons spanning the ribosomal internally transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial large subunit (LSU) from 92 boreal forest soil DNA extracts using two contrasting methods: the Invitrogen TOPO-TA system and the Lucigen PCR-SMART system. The Lucigen system utilizes blunt-ended rather than TA cloning and transcription terminators to reduce biases due to toxicity of expressed inserts. We analysed 588 clone sequences from the two libraries. Species diversity estimators applied to operational taxonomical units (OTUs) were slightly higher for Invitrogen than Lucigen, but confidence intervals for accumulation curves overlapped. Abundances of OTUs were correlated between the libraries (r² = 0.5, P < 0.0001), but certain OTUs had contrasting abundances in the two libraries and a likelihood ratio test rejected homogeneity of the OTU counts. We constructed parsimony and Bayesian trees from aligned LSU regions, and the 'phylogenetic test' revealed that lineage representation was not significantly different between the two libraries. We conclude that characterization of this fungal community was fairly robust to cloning method and no biases due to TA cloning were found. 3aDNA 3aOtus 3aboreal forests 3aclones 3aconfidence interval 3aenvironmental assessment 3aforest soils 3afungi 3alibraries 3aspecies diversity 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aFungixgenetics 2aGene Library 2aPhylogeny 2aRibosomesxclassification 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxinstrumentation 2aSoil Microbiology1 aHerriott, Ian C.1 aLong, James1 aO'Neill, Keith0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2007 May, v. 9, no. 5 p.1329-1334dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01253.x 7aarticle02319naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100001500132245012500147300001600272300002400288520089400312650001601206650002201222650001201244650001001256650001201266650001701278650002001295650001401315650001201329650003501341650003401376650003201410650003201442650001901474650001101493650003901504650002101543650001401564653002301578700002201601700001901623700001401642700001501656773006701671852000901738939003301747945000801780946001301788655001201801991573791270742620221123031853.0800909e197910  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800022302DNAL7 a4781862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirk, R.L.10aGenetic susceptibility to diabetes mellitus: The distribution of properdin factor B (Bf) and glyoxalase (GLO) phenotypes  ap. 949-951.  ap. 949-951. charts.  aThe role of genetic factors in susceptibility to juvenile diabetes is demonstrated in a study of blood samples from 239 patients with insulin dependent (type 1) and 297 patients with non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes. Increased frequency fo F1 and S1 alleles at the properdin factor (BF) locus on chromosome 6 is associated with Type 1 diabetes, and the combined frequency of the two alleles is highly significant in Type 1 patients. Phenotypic expression of the BF genotype also correlates with Type 1 diabetes. At the glyoxalase (GLO) locus on the sixth chromosome, a nonsignificant increase in the GLO2 allele is found in type 2 patients; however, the distribution of GLO phenotypes in these individuals is unusually distorted. These two loci are close to the HLA loci where a significant increase in human leucocyte antigens in diabetic patients has previously been demonstrated. 3achromosomes 3adiabetes mellitus 3ainsulin 3amales 3afemales 3arisk factors 3aclinical trials 3aphenotype 2aAlleles 2aChromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X 2aComplement Factor Bxgenetics 2aDiabetes Mellitusxgenetics 2aEnzyme Precursorsxgenetics 2aGene Frequency 2aHumans 2aLactoylglutathione Lyasexgenetics 2aLyasesxgenetics 2aPhenotype 0aHereditary factors1 aTheophilus, Jaya.1 aWhitehouse, S.1 aCourt, J.1 aZimmet, P.0 tDiabetes.g1979 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.949-951x0012-17977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800909c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03135naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012500129300001500254500001500269520175900284650001402043650001802057650001202075650002502087650001102112650001302123650001802136650002302154650002102177650001302198650002202211650002702233650001802260650001102278650001802289653002502307653001602332653002102348653001602369653001102385653001802396700001402414700001602428700001802444773008902462852000902551930003302560945001302593946001102606655001202617IND2206227920221123032125.0000804s1999    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220622792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrlikowska, T.10aEffects of growth regulators and incubation period on in vitro regeneration of adventitious shoots from gerbera petioles  ap. 95-102.  a2019-12-05  aAn effective system for in vitro regeneration of adventitious shoots from callus for the transformation or mutation of gerbera was developed. Callus was produced from petioles of the youngest 3-4 leaves detached from auxillary shoots produced in vitro. Induction medium, on which leaves were incubated over 3 or 6 days, contained 2.3 micromolar thidiazuron and 0.53 micromolar alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid. Explants were than transferred to one of three regeneration media with lower levels of growth regulators. Regeneration was quantified over four (4-weeks each) passages at the time of explant transfer to fresh medium. Direct shoot regeneration occurred during the first 4 weeks, and after these shoots were discarded a semi-compact organogenic callus was produced. Effectiveness of shoot regeneration depended on four criteria: the cultivar (three cultivars were tested), the sequence of passage on regeneration medium, the growth regulators in regeneration medium and the duration of the induction period. Regeneration potential from calli of all cultivars increased from the first to the fourth passage. Duration of the incubation period on induction medium (3 or 6 days) influenced regeneration to varying degrees, depending on the cultivar used and the regeneration medium contents. There were no differences between two of the regeneration media--B, containing 2.2 micromolar 6-benzyladenine and 0.3 micromolar indole-3-acetic acid and C, containing 4.4 micromolar 6-benzyladenine, 4.6 micromolar zeatin and 0.6 micromolar indole-3-acetic acid. Cultivar Mariola was the most productive and regenerated more than seven shoots per callus in the fourth passage. Regeneration on medium B was further evaluated on four additional gerbera cultivars. 3acultivars 3adose response 3aGerbera 3adevelopmental stages 3ashoots 3aexplants 3abenzyladenine 3aindole acetic acid 3amicropropagation 3apetioles 3agenetic variation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aculture media 3acallus 3aorganogenesis 0aregenerative ability 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture 0athidiazuron 0atiming 0aplant anatomy1 aNowak, E.1 aMarasek, A.1 aKucharska, D.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g1999, v. 59, no. 2 p.95-102x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02627naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012900128300001600257500001500273520125600288650001901544650001201563650001801575650001401593650002101607650002501628650001901653650001301672650002601685650002101711650001801732650002101750650002201771650001901793650001001812650001801822650001701840650001101857651001801868653001201886653002501898653003101923700001101954773009001965852000902055930003302064945001302097946001102110655001202121IND2207006720221122221830.0000929s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220700672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhury, A.10aSomatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration of turf-type bermudagrass: effect of 6-benzyladenine in callus induction medium  ap. 113-120.  a2019-12-05  aIn order to optimize tissue culture conditions for bermudagrass, an important warm-season turfgrass species, tissue culture responses of young inflorescences of a hybrid bermudagrass cultivar 'Tifgreen' (Cynodon dactylon x Cynodon transvaalensis) and a common bermudagrass cultivar 'Savannah' (Cynodon dactylon) were investigated. When cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium with 4.52 to 13.57 micromolar (1-3 mg l(-1)) 2,4-D, young inflorescence segments yielded non-embryogenic calli which were unorganized and had loosely associated, long tubular cells on the surface. However, inclusion of 6-benzyladenine (BA) in callus induction medium at a level of 0.044 micromolar (0.01 mg l-1) induced formation of a compact, nodular embryogenic structure on approximately 20% of the calli. Calli with such a compact embryogenic structure were highly regenerable. When young inflorescences smaller than 0.75 cm were cultured, the embryogenic structure yielded green plantlets with regeneration rates of 79.5% and 83.3%, respectively for two cultivars. All 96 plants regenerated from calli induced in the BA-containing medium were green and morphologically normal. The embryogenic nature of the compact structure was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. 3ainflorescences 3ahybrids 3adose response 3acultivars 3aCynodon dactylon 3adevelopmental stages 3alawns and turf 3aexplants 3asomatic embryogenesis 3aplant morphology 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3agenetic variation 3aultrastructure 3a2,4-D 3aculture media 3agolf courses 3acallus 3aUnited States 0aCynodon 0aregenerative ability 0amurashing and skoog medium1 aQu, R.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 60, no. 2 p.113-120x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03162naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100001200191245008000203300001400283520145900297650002201756650003101778650002001809650002101829650002401850650001201874650002301886650001101909650004601920650001101966650003901977650000902016650006602025650002802091650002402119650002702143650002902170650002302199650001702222650003502239650001202274700001402286700002102300700001902321700001502340773007102355852000902426856007802435930003302513945002502546946001302571655001202584IND4372376520221122221844.0050718e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437237652DNAL7 a156859452pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.1.752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVan, L.10aDevelopmental regulation of a turkey intestinal peptide transporter (PepT1)  ap. 75-82.  aA cDNA encoding a turkey intestinal peptide transporter, tPepT1, was isolated from a turkey small intestinal cDNA library. The tPepT1 cDNA encodes a 714-amino acid protein with 12 predicted transmembrane domains. The amino acid sequence of tPepT1 is 94.3% identical to chicken PepT1 and approximately 60% identical to PepT1 from rat, sheep, rabbit, and human. Using a 2-electrode voltage-clamp technique in Xenopus oocytes expressing tPepT1, Gly-Sar transport was pH dependent but was independent of Na(+) and K(+). For the dipeptides Gly-Sar and Met-Met, the evoked inward currents indicated that the transporter was saturable and had high affinity (0.69 +/- 0.14 mM and 0.23 +/- 0.04 mM, respectively) for these substrates. However, transport of the tetrapeptide, Met-Gly-Met-Met, exhibited apparent substrate inhibition at high substrate concentrations. To study developmental regulation of PepT1 mRNA in turkey embryos, embryos (6 males and 6 females) were sampled daily from 5 d before hatch to the day of hatch (d 0). The abundance of PepT1 mRNA in the small intestine was quantified densitometrically from Northern blots after hybridization with full-length tPepT1 cDNA as probe. A 3.2-fold increase in PepT1 mRNA was observed in intestinal tissue from 5 d before hatch to d 0. This increase in PepT1 mRNA abundance indicates that the PepT1 gene is developmentally regulated and that there may be an important role for PepT1 in the neonatal poult. 3asequence homology 3agene expression regulation 3aembryo (animal) 3aactive transport 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aHumans 2aIntestinesxchemistryxembryology. 2aMale 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOocytesxmetabolism 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aSequence Alignment 2aTransfection 2aTurkeysxembryologyxgenetics. 2aXenopus1 aPan, Y.X.1 aBloomquist, J.R.1 aWebb, K.E.

To identify such proteins, we have searched for proteins that may form high-molecular-weight (HMW) aggregates in the matrix of fish otoliths that have aragonite and vaterite as their crystal polymorphs. By screening a cDNA library of the trout inner ear using an antiserum raised against whole otolith matrix, a novel protein, named otolith matrix macromolecule-64 (OMM-64), was identified. The protein was found to have a molecular mass of 64 kDa, and to contain two tandem repeats and a Glu-rich region. The structure of the protein and that of its DNA are similar to those of starmaker, a protein involved in the polymorphism control in the zebrafish otoliths [Söllner C, Burghammer M, Busch-Nentwich E, Berger J, Schwarz H, Riekel C & Nicolson T (2003) Science302, 282-286]. ⁴⁵Ca overlay analysis revealed that the Glu-rich region has calcium-binding activity. Combined analysis by western blotting and deglycosylation suggested that OMM-64 is present in an HMW aggregate with heparan sulfate chains. Histological observations revealed that OMM-64 is expressed specifically in otolith matrix-producing cells and deposited onto the otolith. Moreover, the HMW aggregate binds to the inner ear-specific short-chain collagen otolin-1, and the resulting complex forms ring-like structures in the otolith matrix. Overall, OMM-64, by forming a calcium-binding aggregate that binds to otolin-1 and forming matrix protein architectures, may be involved in the control of crystal morphology during otolith biomineralization. 3aDanio rerio 3aWestern blotting 3aantiserum 3aaragonite 3abiomineralization 3acDNA libraries 3acollagen 3acomplementary DNA 3acrystals 3aheparan sulfate 3amolecular weight 3aotoliths 3aprotein structure 3ascreening 3atandem repeat sequences 3atrout 3avaterite1 aTakagi, Yasuaki1 aNagasawa, Hiromichi0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 10 p.2512-2523dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06400.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03091naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245010700137300001600244500001500260520134900275650001701624650001301641650001601654650002701670650001101697650001801708650001001726650003001736650001301766650002001779650001301799650001501812650002301827650002501850650002001875650001801895650001701913650001801930650002701948650001801975650001401993650002202007650001902029653002502048653001602073653001402089653002102103653001402124653003002138700002602168700002202194700003302216700002302249700002502272773009002297852000902387930003302396945001302429946001102442655001202453IND2206232320221122194341.0000804s1999    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220623232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnriquez-Obregon, G.A.10aAgrobacterium-mediated Japonica rice transformation: a procedure assisted by an antinecrotic treatment  ap. 159-168.  a2019-12-05  aAn Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol for Japonica rice (cv.

We evaluated the effect of two compounds with known antioxidant activity (ascorbic acid and cysteine) and silver nitrate on the viability of stem sections taken from in vitro rice plantlets, and on their interaction with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At 2260) containing a shuttle vector bearing the gus and bar genes. After co-culture, caili formed on the callus-induction medium were supplemented with phosphinotricin and cefotaxime; putative transgenic plants were recovered on the regeneration medium after three months. All recovered plants were challenged with the herbicide BASTA under greenhouse conditions, and some resistant individuals were analyzed using PCR and a histochemical GUS test. Southern blot analysis of several R1 transgenic plants indicated the presence of at least two intact bar gene copies per genome. Inheritance of the bar gene at the R2 generation was confirmed. Antinecrotic pretreatment of the explants provides an adequate environment for the interaction of A. tumefaciens with the plant cells, thus allowing satisfactory transformation performance without the need of super-binary vectors and hyperinfective A. tumefaciens strains. 3aOryza sativa 3anecrosis 3aglufosinate 3ainheritance (genetics) 3acallus 3adose response 3astems 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aexplants 3agene expression 3acysteine 3acefotaxime 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aherbicide resistance 3aenzyme activity 3aculture media 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aviability 3atransgenic plants 3asilver nitrate 0aregenerative ability 0amethodology 0agus genes 0ain vitro culture 0abar genes 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aPrieto-Samsonov, D.L.1 aRiva, G.A. de la.1 aPerets, Mikhaʼel ben Yosef.1 aSelman-Housein, G.1 aVazquez-Padron, R.I.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g1999, v. 59, no. 3 p.159-168x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03302naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245015400130300001600284520194200300650004202242650002402284650003602308650002102344650001002365650001002375650001102385650001302396650002202409650001902431650002602450650001802476650001802494650001902512650002602531650001302557650001702570653001502587653001502602653001102617700001802628700001802646773009002664852000902754930003302763945001302796946001102809655001202820IND2206229020221122194400.0000804s1999    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220622902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZobayed, S.M.A.10aEvaluation of a closed system, diffusive and humidity-induced convective throughflow ventilation on the growth and physiology of cauliflower in vitro  ap. 113-123.  aThe effects of ethylene inhibitors (silver nitrate--AgNO3 and silver thiosulphate--Ag2S2O3 as inhibitors of ethylene activity, cobalt chloride--CoCl2 as inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis) and ethylene stimulator (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid--ACC) were studied on the growth of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.) seedlings cultured in closed vessels (60 cm3). The addition of ethylene inhibitors have significant stimulatory effects on the growth and development of seedlings and the effects were greatest with 10 micromolar AgNO3, the fresh weight of leaves was 2.6x, and the leaf area 2.8x those of the control (no additives). The effects of various methods of ventilation (humidity-induced convective through-flow ventilation, diffusive ventilation and sealed condition) on the growth and physiology of in vitro cauliflower seedlings were also investigated. The seedlings were cultured either in the presence or absence of AgNO3 (inhibitors of ethylene activity) and ACC (a precursor). Ethylene and CO2 levels in the head-space of the culture vessels were monitored. The humidity-induced through-flow ventilation system has shown to be effective for improving growth, leaf chlorophyll content and the rate of net photosynthesis and preventing symptoms of hyperhydricity, such as leaf epinasty, and franginess, reduction of leaf area etc. In contrast, the results also indicated that the sealing of culture vessels could have serious inhibitory effects on growth and development, induce hyperhydricity and reduce leaf chlorophyll content. In the light period, CO2 depletion occurred in the head-space of the sealed vessels (ca. 40 microliter l-1), the CO2 concentration increased with increasing efficiency of the ventilation. No ethylene accumulation was noticed in the head-space of the culture vessels when humidity-induced throughflow ventilation was applied: however, high ethylene accumulation occurred in sealed vessels. 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aventilation systems 3aBrassica oleracea var. botrytis 3ain vitro culture 3astems 3aroots 3aleaves 3aair flow 3arelative humidity 3aphotosynthesis 3anet assimilation rate 3aculture media 3adose response 3acarbon dioxide 3aquantitative analysis 3aethylene 3abiosynthesis 0ainhibition 0aregulation 0agrowth1 aArmstrong, J.1 aArmstrong, W.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g1999, v. 59, no. 2 p.113-123x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02104naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245004200127300001600169520088300185650001901068650001101087650001101098650000901109650001801118650001801136650001801154650001301172650001801185650002101203650002701224650002401251651001501275653002501290653001401315653002201329653002901351653003501380653003101415700001601446700001601462773009001478852000901568930003301577945001301610946001101623655001201634IND2206230620221122124815.0000804s1999    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220623062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStojicic, D.10aMicropropagation of Pinus heldreichii  ap. 147-150.  aMicropropagation by organogenesis from mature embryos of Pinus heldreichii Christ. was achieved.

Four monoclonal antibodies were raised against H6H purified from cultured roots of Hyoscyamus niger. The IgG1 antibody mAb5 inhibited H6H activities present in cell-free extracts of H. niger roots and specifically recognized 38-40-kDa proteins from six different scopolamine-producing plant species in Western blot analysis after sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The other three monoclonal antibodies all recognized SDS-denatured H6H proteins from Hyoscyamus species, but did not bind to native H6H. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from various tissues of H. niger using these antibodies showed that H6H is abundant in cultured roots, present in plant roots, but absent in leaf, stem, calyx, cultured cells, and cultured shoots. Immunohistochemical studies using monoclonal antibody and immunogold-silver enhancement detected H6H only in the pericycle cells of the young root in several scopolamine-producing plants. Mature roots that underwent secondary growth and lacked the pericycle did not react with the antibody. This pericycle-specific localization of scopolamine biosynthesis provides an anatomical explanation for the tissue-specific biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids and may be important for translocation of tropane alkaloids from the root to the aerial parts. 3aHyoscyamus niger 3abiosynthesis 3ascopolamine 3aoxygenases 3aroots 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aAtropinexmetabolism 2aBlotting, Western 2aCells, Cultured 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Proteinsximmunology 2aPlantsxenzymology 2aScopolaminexmetabolism. 0aalkaloids1 aHayashi, A.1 aAmano, Y.1 aKohno, J.1 aIwanari, H.1 aUsuda, S.1 aYamada, Y.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1991 Mar. 5, v. 266, no. 7 p.4648-4653x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01726naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002100193245005000214300001600264520070200280650002100982650002101003653003101024700002701055700002001082700002101102700001701123773011901140852000901259856007601268930003301344946001101377655001201388IND4387481420221122094601.0070204e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438748142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00484.x2doi7 aPMC38646772pmcid7 a172912932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahan, Stephanie10aEpithelia: lymphocyte interactions in the gut  ap. 243-253.  aThe mucosal immune system is governed by a unique set of rules and regulations. The local microenvironment dictates the necessity for these differences. The intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) sits at the interface between an antigen-rich lumen and a lymphocyte-rich lamina propria (LP). The cross talk that occurs between these compartments serves to maintain intestinal homeostasis. IECs have the capacity to talk to LP lymphocytes, activating populations of unique regulatory T cells. These cells have the capacity to talk back to the epithelium, influencing epithelial cell growth and differentiation. This review looks at this cross talk and places it in the context of mucosal immunoregulation. 3aepithelial cells 3amucosal immunity 0alamina propria lymphocytes1 aRoth-Walter, Franziska1 aArnaboldi, Paul1 aAgarwal, Shradha1 aMayer, Lloyd0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Feb., v. 215, no. 1 p.243-253dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00484.x3electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02980naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002100193245009800214300001600312520172500328650001602053653002302069653003202092653002302124700002502147700002802172700002302200700001402223700001802237700002102255700001502276700002702291773011902318852000902437856009202446930003302538946001102571655001202582IND4397425320221122065907.0071104e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439742532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00564.x2doi7 aPMC71659312pmcid7 a179798502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shen-Ying10aHuman Toll-like receptor-dependent induction of interferons in protective immunity to viruses  ap. 225-236.  aFive of the 10 human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9), and four of the 12 mouse TLRs (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR9) can trigger interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ, which are critical for antiviral immunity. Moreover, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 differ from TLR4 in two particularly important ways for antiviral immunity: they can be activated by nucleic acid agonists mimicking compounds produced during the viral cycle, and they are typically present within the cell, along the endocytic pathway, where they sense viral products in the intraluminal space. Investigations in mice have demonstrated that the TLR7/9-IFN and TLR3-IFN pathways are different and critical for protective immunity to various experimental viral infections. Investigations in humans with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) deficiency (unresponsive to TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9), UNC-93B deficiency (unresponsive to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9), and TLR3 deficiency have recently shed light on the role of these two pathways in antiviral immunity in natural conditions. UNC-93B- and TLR3-deficient patients appear to be specifically prone to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis, although clinical penetrance is incomplete, whereas IRAK-4-deficient patients appear to be normally resistant to most viruses, including HSV-1. These experiments of nature suggest that the TLR7-, TLR8-, and TLR9-dependent induction of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ is largely redundant in human antiviral immunity, whereas the TLR3-dependent induction of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ is critical for primary immunity to HSV-1 in the central nervous system in children but redundant for immunity to most other viral infections. 3ainterferons 0aToll-like receptor 0aherpes simplex encephalitis 0aantiviral immunity1 aJouanguy, Emmanuelle1 aSancho-Shimizu, Vanessa1 avon Bernuth, Horst1 aYang, Kun1 aAbel, Laurent1 aPicard, Capucine1 aPuel, Anne1 aCasanova, Jean-Laurent0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Dec., v. 220, no. 1 p.225-236dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00564.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071104b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01994naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245011700161300001600278500002400294520094000318650001101258650001701269650001401286650001301300650001101313650001301324650001701337650001501354650002001369650001301389650001301402700002301415700002301438773010201461852000901563856004801572655001201620IND4422134220221122065822.0090619e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442213422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-009-0289-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSridevi, V.10aEndogenous polyamine profiles in different tissues of Coffea sp., and their levels during the ontogeny of fruits  ap. 757-764.  aIncludes references  aPolyamines are essential compounds for growth and development in plants. An attempt has been made to find out the endogenous polyamine profiles in various parts and during the ontogeny of fruit formation of two commercially important Coffea species viz., arabica and canephora. Putrescine (Put), spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd) are the predominant polyamines during the ontogeny of fruit and their level increased with the advancement of fruit development. However, in the initial stages of flower and fruit development Spm levels were found to be decreased. Elevated levels of major polyamines Put, Spd, and Spm were observed in zygotic embryos than in somatic embryos. Along with this cadavarine (Cad) and other biogenic amines viz., tyramine (Tyr) and tryptamine (Try) were also found during the ontogeny of fruit in C. canephora. In this study the enodogenous polyamine profiles in coffee tissues and beans have been addressed. 3aCoffea 3acoffee beans 3aflowering 3afruiting 3afruits 3aontogeny 3aplant growth 3aputrescine 3asomatic embryos 3aspermine 3atyramine1 aGiridhar, Parvatam1 aRavishankar, G.

As the major recognition element of antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex-derived proteins, an examination of the structure of the αβTCR in intestines has provided significant insights into the potential function of these cells and the major determinants that drive their selection. Studies in the human intestine have shown that the repertoires of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), and likely lamina propria lymphocytes, are polyclonal before and shortly after birth, with the repertoire becoming oligoclonal in adults. Similarly, in adult mice the repertoire is oligoclonal, while in the newborn it is polyclonal. Investigations in mice have shown that some T cells may evade thymic selection. The population size and oligoclonality of IELs is influenced by the microbial content of the luminal microenvironment. This microenvironment probably directly determines the TCR repertoire. Studies in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) indicate that inflammation further skews the TCR repertoire. We speculate that dominant antigens associated with the pathogenesis of IBD are responsible for such skewing and that identifying the antigenic drivers may shed light on the environmental factors that trigger or potentiate human IBD. 3aintestines 0aT-cell receptor 0arepertoire1 aSaubermann, Lawrence J.1 aBalk, Steven1 aBlumberg, Richard S.0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Feb., v. 215, no. 1 p.215-225dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00480.x3electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02428naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001600136245009800152300002000250520153200270650002601802650002501828650002001853700002301873700001801896700001501914700001901929773009801948852000902046930003302055945001302088946001302101655001202114IND2058376620221122071555.0970714e199704  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205837662DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoran, T.H.10aVagal afferent and efferent contributions to the inhibition of food intake by cholecystokinin  ap. R1245-R1251.  aTo assess the role of subdiaphragmatic vagal afferent and efferent fibers in the mediation of the inhibition of food intake by cholecystokinin (CCK), we compared the ability of a dose range (1-16 micrograms/kg) of CCK to affect 30-min liquid glucose (0.125 g/ml) intake in rats with either total subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, selective subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation, selective subdiaphragmatic vagal deefferentation, or sham surgery. Selective vagal deafferentation and deefferentations were produced by combinations of unilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy and contralateral afferent or efferent rootlet transection as fibers enter the caudal medulla. CCK produced a dose-related suppression of glucose intake in sham animals, and this action was eliminated in rats with total subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. CCK suppression of intake was attenuated in rats with vagal deafferentation, such that there was a loss of sensitivity to CCK. Vagal deefferentation resulted in lower levels of baseline intake and a truncation of the feeding inhibitory actions of CCK. These data demonstrate that CCK's suppression of intake depends on actions of both vagal afferent and efferent fibers. We interpret these data as suggesting that 1) the actions of low doses of CCK depend on activation of vagal afferent CCK receptors and 2) the greater efficacy of higher CCK doses is the result of the potentiation of these vagal afferent actions due to local physiological gastrointestinal effects of the peptide that rely on vagal efferent input. 3adiet-related diseases 3anutrition physiology 3ahuman nutrition1 aBaldessarini, A.R.1 aSalorio, C.F.1 aLowery, T.1 aSchwartz, G.J.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1997 Apr., v. 272, no. 4:pt.2 p.R1245-R1251x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02713naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245010700176300001400283500002400297520141800321650002101739650002501760650001701785650001301802650001401815650002001829650001501849650002401864650002501888650002101913650001901934650000901953650001301962650002501975650001602000700001902016700002102035700002002056700001702076773011002093852000902203856005502212655001202267IND4432290320221122053928.0100205e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443229032DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4514.2009.00265.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRAI, PRASHANT KUMAR10aAntioxidant potential of oral feeding of cynodon dactylon extract on diabetes-induced oxidative stress  ap. 78-92.  aIncludes references  aThe present study is an extension of our previous research work and it deals with the scientific evaluation of antioxidant potential of the aqueous extract of Cynodon dactylon on diabetes-induced oxidative stress of diabetic rats. The most effective dose of 500 mg/kg of extract was given orally to diabetic rats for 30 days. Different oxidative stress parameters were analyzed in various tissues of control and treated diabetic rats. The observed elevated level of LPO comes down significantly (P < 0.05), and decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, SOD, GPx and GST got increased (P < 0.05) significantly in diabetic rats on extract treatment. The flavonoids present in the aqueous extract of this plant might be responsible for its marked antioxidant efficacy at tissue level in STZ-induced diabetic rats. The Cynodon dactylon has been shown to possess varied medicinal properties. The aqueous extract of the rhizome is used as anti-inflammatory, diuretic, antiemetic, antidiabetic and blood-purifying agent. Recently, it has been reported by our research group that the extract of C. dactylon has hypoglycemic as well as antidiabetic potential. The present communication is an endeavor in the direction of evaluating its in vivo antioxidant effect in STZ-induced diabetic rats so that it can be used as a value-added agent for managing diabetes as well as oxidative stress associated with it. 3aCynodon dactylon 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3adiabetes 3adiuretics 3aenzyme activity 3aflavonoids 3ahypoglycemic agents 3amedicinal properties 3aoxidative stress 3aplant extracts 3arats 3arhizomes 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avalue added1 aJAISWAL, DOLLY1 aRAI, DEVENDRA K.1 aSharma, Bechan.1 aWATAL, GEETA0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2010 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.78-92dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4514.2009.00265.x 7aarticle02748naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245012500172300001400297520146600311650002401777653004501801653002601846653002501872700001601897700002101913700002601934700001701960700002201977700002601999700002102025700001902046700001502065700002402080773011702104852000902221856007602230930003302306946001102339655001202350IND4389077920221122043238.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438907792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00487.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarneiro, Jorge10aWhen three is not a crowd: a Crossregulation Model of the dynamics and repertoire selection of regulatory CD4⁺ T cells  ap. 48-68.  aRegulatory CD4⁺ T cells, enriched in the CD25 pool of healthy individuals, mediate natural tolerance and prevent autoimmune diseases. Despite their fundamental and potential clinical significance, regulatory T (TR) cells have not yet been incorporated in a coherent theory of the immune system. This article reviews experimental evidence and theoretical arguments supporting a model of TR cell dynamics, uncovering some of its most relevant biological implications. According to this model, the persistence and expansion of TR cell populations depend strictly on specific interactions they make with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and conventional effector T (TE) cells. This three-partner crossregulation imposes that TR cells feed on the specific autoimmune activities they suppress, with implications ranging from their interactions with other cells to their repertoire selection in the periphery and in the thymus, and to the relationship between these cells and the innate immune system. These implications stem from the basic prediction that the peripheral dynamics sort the CD4⁺ T-cell repertoire into two subsets: a less diverse set of small clones of autoreactive effector and regulatory cells that regulate each other's growth, and a more diverse set of barely autoreactive TE cell clones, whose expansion is limited only by APC availability. It is argued that such partitioning of the repertoire sets the ground for self-non-self discrimination. 3amathematical models 0aregulatory CD4⁺CD25⁺Foxp3⁺ T cells 0aCrossregulation Model 0arepertoire selection1 aLeon, Kalet1 aCaramalho, Íris1 avan den Dool, Carline1 aGardner, Rui1 aOliveira, Vanessa1 aBergman, Marie-Louise1 aSepúlveda, Nuno1 aPaixão, Tiago1 aFaro, Jose1 aDemengeot, Jocelyne0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Apr., v. 216, no. 1 p.48-68dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00487.x3electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03547naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001900179245008600198300001600284500002400300506007600324520173800400506003702138650001902175650002002194650001302214650002302227650002002250650002202270650001202292650001602304650003002320650002802350650002902378650001902407650000902426650002402435650002302459650003402482650002002516650002702536650002102563650002202584650002802606651001002634651001002644700002002654700001702674700001802691700001702709773010002726852000902826856007802835856003202913655001202945IND4396480620221207081529.0071021e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439648062DNAL7 a177045382pmid7 aPMC27592002pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcm1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Shi-Hua10aProgress in Research and Development on Hybrid Rice: A Super-domesticate in China  ap. 959-966.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: China has been successful in breeding hybrid rice strains, but is now facing challenges to develop new hybrids with high-yielding potential, better grain quality, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. This paper reviews the most significant advances in hybrid rice breeding in China, and presents a recent study on fine-mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield traits. SCOPE: By exploiting new types of male sterility, hybrid rice production in China has become more diversified. The use of inter-subspecies crosses has made an additional contribution to broadening the genetic diversity of hybrid rice and played an important role in the breeding of super rice hybrids in China. With the development and application of indica-inclined and japonica-inclined parental lines, new rice hybrids with super high-yielding potential have been developed and are being grown on a large scale. DNA markers for subspecies differentiation have been identified and applied, and marker-assisted selection performed for the development of restorer lines carrying disease resistance genes. The genetic basis of heterosis in highly heterotic hybrids has been studied, but data from these studies are insufficient to draw sound conclusions. In a QTL study using stepwise residual heterozygous lines, two linked intervals harbouring QTLs for yield traits were resolved, one of which was delimited to a 125-kb region. CONCLUSIONS: Advances in rice genomic research have shed new light on the genetic study and germplasm utilization in rice. Molecular marker-assisted selection is a powerful tool to increase breeding efficiency, but much work remains to be done before this technique can be extended from major genes to QTLs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabiotic stress 3acrop production 3acrossing 3adisease resistance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3amajor genes 3amarker-assisted selection 3aquantitative trait loci 3aresearch and development 3arestorer lines 3arice 2aAgriculturextrends 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPlant Infertility 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 3aChina 0aChina1 aZhuang, Jie-Yun1 aFan, Ye-Yang1 aDu, Jing-Hong1 aCao, Li-Yong0 tAnnals of botany.g2007 Oct., v. 100, no. 5 p.959-966dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcm1213Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/ 7aarticle02142naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245013700172300001500309520075900324650001501083650002401098650001501122700001901137700001901156700002101175700001701196700001701213700001801230700002701248700002001275700002101295700002001316700001701336700001501353700002401368700001801392700002201410773011801432852000901550856009301559930003301652946001101685655001201696IND4391569820221122013242.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439156982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00521.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeer, Frederick10aRole of β-chemokines in mast cell activation and type I hypersensitivity reactions in the conjunctiva: in vivo and in vitro studies  ap. 96-104.  aChemokines have a clearly defined role in mobilizing the recruitment of leukocytes to both healthy and inflamed tissues.

However, the sensing mechanism of BconP by CCK-producing cells is unknown. Aim of the study We investigated signal transduction pathways mediating CCK secretion in response to BconP in the murine CCK-producing cell line, STC-1. Methods STC-1 cells were seeded in 48-well culture plates until sub-confluent and CCK secretion was examined under various conditions. CCK concentration was determined by the enzyme immunoassay. Results BconP dose-dependently induced CCK secretion in STC-1 cells. Treatment with BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca²⁺ chelator, reduced BconP-induced CCK secretion, however, removal of extracellular Ca²⁺ did not affect the secretory response. Treatment with 2-amino borate (2-APB) reduced CCK releasing responses, suggesting the involvement of IP₃. In addition, BconP failed to induce CCK secretion after treatment with the Gαq protein inhibitor (YM-254890). Conclusion These results indicate that Gαq pathway is responsible for BconP-induced CCK secretion in STC-1 cells, and suggest the involvement of a Gαq-coupled GPCR(s) in dietary peptide sensing in enteroendocrine cells. 3aborates 3acholecystokinin 3aenzyme immunoassays 3afood intake 3aproteins 3arats 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3asoybeans1 aMaekawa, Toshihiro1 aAsano, Kozo1 aHara, Hiroshi0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2009 Mar., v. 48, no. 2 p.124-127dSteinkopff-Verlagx1436-62077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-008-0764-1 7aarticle02359naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245006600173300001600239520127900255653002801534653003701562653002101599653002001620653003901640700001901679700001801698700001801716700002301734773011901757852000901876856009201885930003301977946001102010655001202021IND4393102820221122012744.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439310282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00539.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelke, Michael10aCa²⁺ signaling in antigen receptor-activated B lymphocytes  ap. 235-246.  aB cells respond to antigen stimulation with mobilization of the Ca²⁺ second messenger in two phases operated by two distinct sets of effector proteins. First, an antigen receptor-specific Ca²⁺ initiation complex is assembled, activated, and targeted to the plasma membrane to trigger the transient release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores of the endoplasmic reticulum. Second, more ubiquitously expressed Ca²⁺ channels of the plasma membrane are opened to allow for sustained Ca²⁺ influx from the extracellular medium. Depending on the developmental stage of the B cell, the kinetics and profile of the two phases are adjusted at multiple levels of positive and negative regulation. A molecular basis for the Ca²⁺ signaling plasticity is provided by cytosolic and transmembrane adapter proteins. They act as signal organizers, which control enzyme/substrate interactions by directing the different signaling modules into specific subcellular compartments. These arrangements orchestrate a graduated activation of Ca²⁺-sensitive downstream pathways, which ultimately determine appropriate cellular responses, namely elimination of autoreactive B cells or proliferation and differentiation of immunocompetent B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. 0aB-cell antigen receptor 0aprotein tyrosine phosphorylation 0aadapter proteins 0aCa²⁺channels 0aintracellular protein localization1 aEngels, Niklas1 aDittmann, Kai1 aStork, Björn1 aWienands, Jürgen.0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Aug., v. 218, no. 1 p.235-246dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00539.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02689naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011100174300001400285520146800299653001001767653001001777653001001787653001001797653000901807653000901816700002001825700002101845700002301866700002401889700002401913700002301937700001901960700001701979700002101996773011702017852000902134856009202143930003302235946001102268655001202279IND4397425920221122013150.0071104e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439742592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00579.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLotze, Michael T.14aThe grateful dead: damage-associated molecular pattern molecules and reduction/oxidation regulate immunity  ap. 60-81.  aThe response to pathogens and damage in plants and animals involves a series of carefully orchestrated, highly evolved, molecular mechanisms resulting in pathogen resistance and wound healing. In metazoans, damage- or pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs, PAMPs) execute precise intracellular tasks and are also able to exert disparate functions when released into the extracellular space. The emergent consequence for both inflammation and wound healing of the abnormal extracellular persistence of these factors may underlie many clinical disorders. DAMPs/PAMPs are recognized by hereditable receptors including the Toll-like receptors, the NOD1-like receptors and retinoic-acid-inducible gene I-like receptors, as well as the receptor for advanced glycation end products. These host molecules 'sense' not only pathogens but also misfolded/glycated proteins or exposed hydrophobic portions of molecules, activating intracellular cascades that lead to an inflammatory response. Equally important are means to not only respond to these molecules but also to eradicate them. We have speculated that their destruction through oxidative mechanisms normally exerted by myeloid cells, such as neutrophils and eosinophils, or their persistence in the setting of pathologic extracellular reducing environments, maintained by exuberant necrotic cell death and/or oxidoreductases, represent important molecular means enabling chronic inflammatory states. 0aDAMPs 0aPAMPs 0aredox 0aHMGB1 0aTLR4 0aRAGE1 aZeh, Herbert J.1 aRubartelli, Anna1 aSparvero, Louis J.1 aAmoscato, Andrew A.1 aWashburn, Newell R.1 aDeVera, Michael E.1 aLiang, Xiaoyan1 aTör, Mahmut1 aBilliar, Timothy0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Dec., v. 220, no. 1 p.60-81dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00579.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071104b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03024naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245007900185300001600264500002400280520157700304650001801881650001101899650001001910650001401920650001701934650001201951650002701963650001101990650001702001650007002018650004102088650003602129650004102165650002202206650006102228700001602289700001902305700002202324700001502346700001302361773011602374852000902490856005502499655001202554IND4391587020221122012932.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439158702DNAL7 a175068142pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2006.00779.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoede, NM10aFollicle Development during Luteal Phase and Altrenogest Treatment in Pigs  ap. 329-332.  aIncludes references  aSynchronization of the oestrous cycle of gilts using altrenogest treatment has been found to increase ovulation rate. The current experiment investigated if the increase in ovulation rate after altrenogest treatment is related to increased follicle size at the end of altrenogest treatment compared with late luteal phase follicles. Crossbred gilts (n = 15) received altrenogest during 18 days [20 mg Regumate (Janssen Animal Health, Beerse, Belgium)], starting 5-7 days after onset of first oestrus. Control gilts (n = 15) did not receive altrenogest. At days 10-12 of the oestrous cycle [i.e. in the presence of corpora lutea (CL)], average follicle development was 2.51 ± 0.20 mm (assessed with ultrasound) in altrenogest-treated gilts and 2.58 ± 0.16 mm in control gilts (p > 0.10). During the last days of altrenogest treatment (i.e. when CL had gone into regression), average follicle size had increased to 3.01 ± 0.31 mm (p < 0.05). Subsequent ovulation rate was 16.6 ± 1.7 in altrenogest treated gilts and 15.1 ± 1.2 in control gilts (p < 0.05). Altrenogest treatment resulted in increased follicle size after regression of the CL, showing that suppression of follicle growth by altrenogest alone is less severe than suppression by endogenous progesterone (either with or without altrenogest). Altrenogest treatment also resulted in a higher ovulation rate. However, it is unclear if the increased follicle size and higher ovulation rate after altrenogest treatment are causally related, as the relation between the two on an animal level was not significant. 3aanimal health 3aestrus 3agilts 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 2aAnimals 2aEstrus Synchronization 2aFemale 2aLuteal Phase 2aOvarian Folliclexdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aOvulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOvulation Inductionxveterinary 2aProgesterone Congenersxpharmacology 2aSwinexphysiology 2aTrenbolone Acetatexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology.1 aBouwman, EG1 aLangendijk, P.1 aLaan, I. van der.1 aKanora, A.1 aKemp, B.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2007 June, v. 42, no. 3 p.329-332dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2006.00779.x 7aarticle01606naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003300145245012400178300001600302500002400318500001500342520055200357650002000909650001300929650004300942650002400985650001401009653001601023653001601039700001901055700001701074773012001091852000901211856004801220655001201268IND4438753220221122013038.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443875322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-010-1549-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, Sabbasani Rajasekhara12aA Novel Method for Monitoring the Transesterification Reaction of Oil in Biodiesel Production by Estimation of Glycerol  ap. 747-754.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA quantitative method is reported for the estimation of glycerol during transesterification of oil to form biodiesel.

We compared the reproduction of laboratory mice in a normal and a hot, humid environment to test this claim. Thirty males and 150 females from a non-inbred line adapted to normal conditions were mated twice (the second time after rerandomisation) to produce the experimental animals. Individual experimental mice from each litter were allocated from weaning (3 weeks) either to the normal or hot environment. At 9 to 12 weeks of age these mice were paired, 1 male with 1 female, until the female had a chance to have 2 litters. 354 pairs in the normal and 362 pairs in the hot environment were mated. All living progeny were weaned at 3 weeks. Average values of reproductive traits, phenotypic correlations between traits, and heritability estimates for many traits were found in each environment. Negative correlations (trade-offs) between litter number and weight of individual progeny in both environments demonstrated clearly that fitness was limited even in the normal laboratory situation. All quantitative measures of reproduction were lower in the hot room showing that it was more stressful. Yet size of individual young and their survival was not reduced. This may be an adaptive mechanism restricted to housemice. Lower heritability estimates in first than in second parities for quantitative measures of litter size show that while the mouse is still growing she has fewer resources available for reproduction, making her more susceptible to environmental stress. This challenges accepted wisdom that animal breeders should select their animals when they are young. They are least likely to respond then. We believe that natural selection causes animals always to push their fitness (reproduction and survival of the progeny) against a limit set by their particular environment. Each environment selects animals that optimally allocate environmental resources there. Problems arise when inappropriate genetic settings cause phenotypes to misallocate metabolic resources. In relatively difficult environments productive animals, including successful transgenics, allocate insufficient resources to fitness. 3aMus musculus 3aanimal breeders 3aartificial selection 3afemales 3aheritability 3alaboratory animals 3alitter size 3amales 3amice 3anatural selection 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic correlation 3aprogeny 3areproductive traits 3aweaning1 aMitpaiboon, Kalaya0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g1994 Jan. 12, v. 111, no. 1-6 p.14-26dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.1994.tb00433.x 7aarticle03062naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245006500176300001400241520209800255650001302353650002402366653002002390653002302410653002202433653001902455700002802474773011702502852000902619856007602628930003302704946001102737655001202748IND4389078120221121142820.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438907812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00486.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurroughs, Nigel J.10aStochasticity and spatial heterogeneity in T-cell activation  ap. 69-80.  aStochastic and spatial aspects are becoming increasingly recognized as an important factor in T-cell activation. Activation occurs in an intrinsically noisy environment, requiring only a handful of agonist peptide-major histocompatibility complex molecules, thus making consideration of signal to noise of prime importance in understanding sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, it is widely established that surface-bound ligands are more effective at activation than soluble forms, while surface patternation has highlighted the role of spatial relocation in activation. Here we consider the results of a number of models of T-cell activation, from a realistic model of kinetic segregation-induced T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering through to simple queuing theory models. These studies highlight the constraints on cell activation by a surface receptor that recruits kinases. Our analysis shows that TCR triggering based on trapping of bound TCRs in regions of close proximity that exclude large ectodomain-containing molecules, such as the phosphatases CD45 and CD148, can effectively reproduce known signaling characteristics and is a viable 'signal transduction' mechanism distinct from oligomerization and conformation-based mechanisms. A queuing theory analysis shows the interrelation between sensitivity and specificity, emphasizing that these are properties of individual cell functions and need not be, nor are likely to be, uniform across different functions. In fact, threshold-based mechanisms of detection are shown to be poor at ligand discrimination because, although they can be highly specific, that specificity is limited to a small range of peptide densities. Time integration mechanisms however are able to control noise effectively, while kinetic proofreading mechanisms endow them with good specificity properties. Thus, threshold mechanisms are likely to be important for rapidly detecting minimal signaling requirements, thus achieving efficient scanning of antigen-presenting cells. However, for good specificity, time integration on a scale of hours is required. 3akinetics 3amathematical models 0aT-cell receptor 0atheoretical models 0aT-cell activation 0aqueuing theory1 avan der Merwe, P.

The absence of these scaffolding molecules profoundly affects development and function of various hematopoietic lineages, underscoring their importance as regulators of signaling cascades. An emerging aspect of the mechanism by which engaged immunoreceptors and integrins transmit signals within the cell is by differential usage of various adapters that function to nucleate formation of distinct signaling complexes in a specific location within the cell. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which adapter proteins coordinate signal transduction with an emphasis on the role of subcellular compartmentalization in adapter function. 3asignal transduction 0aadapter proteins 0asubcellular localization 0aITAM 0aintegrin activation 0aSLP761 aKoretzky, Gary A.0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Aug., v. 218, no. 1 p.9-28dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00541.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04525naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245010700149300001600256300002100272520290500293650000803198650001003206650001303216650001803229650001503247650001203262650002203274650001203296650002203308650003103330650001203361650002803373650001603401650005403417650006203471650000903533650002403542650002703566650001103593650003503604650003103639650000903670650003303679650001603712650001203728653001803740700001603758700001803774773006703792852001303859939003303872945000803905946001303913852000903926655001203935991573770370742620221121111726.0880610e198609  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880011552DNAL7 a35278292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenry, R.R.10aEffects of weight loss on mechanisms of hyperglycemia in obese non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus  ap. 990-998.  ap. 990-998. ill.  aExtract: To quantitate the effects of weight loss on the mechanisms responsible for hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), eight obese subjects with NIDDM were studied before and after weight reduction with posttreatment assessment after 3 wks of isocaloric (weight maintenance) refeeding. After weight loss of 16.8 +/- 2.7 kg (mean +/- SE), the fasting plasma glucose level decreased 55% from 277 +/- 21 to 123 +/- 8 mg/dl. The individual fasting glucose levels were highly correlated with the elevated basal rates of hepatic glucose output (HGO) (r = 0.91, P less than .001), which fell from 138 +/- 11 to 87 +/- 5 mg.m-2.min-1 after weight loss. The change in fasting plasma glucose also correlated significantly with the change in the basal rates of HGO (r = 0.74, P less than .05). This was associated with reduced fasting serum levels of glucagon (from 229 +/- 15 to 141 +/- 12 pg/ml), reduced free fatty acids (from 791 +/- 87 to 379 +/- 35 micro eq/L), and unchanged basal insulin levels (17 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 2 micro U/ml). Peripheral glucose disposal, assessed by the euglycemic glucose-clamp technique, at insulin infusion rates of 120 and 1200 mU.m-2.min-1 increased between 135 and 165%, from 128 +/- 17 to 288 +/- 24 mg.m-2.min-1 during the 120-mU.m-2.min-1 studies and from 159 +/- 19 to 318 +/- 24 mg.m-2.min-1 during the 1200-mU.m-2.min-1 clamp studies, despite comparable steady-state serum insulin levels at each infusion rate before and after weight loss. HGO during the 120-mU.m-2.min-1 clamp studies increased from 85% to complete (100%) suppression after treatment. Adipocyte size was reduced 44% (851 +/- 91 to 475 +/- 48 pl), whereas surface area decreased by 32% (4.30 X 10(4) to 2.92 X 10(4) micro m2/cell). Insulin binding to isolated adipocytes was unchanged, whereas basal in vitro rates of 3-O-methylglucose transport increased from 0.21 +/- 0.13 to 0.53 +/- 0.24 pmol/(2 X 10(9) micro m2) X (10 s-1) and maximal glucose transport rates increased from 0.64 +/- 0.29 to 1.18 +/- 0.48 pmol/(2 X 10(5) cells) X (10 s-1) and 0.42 +/- 0.20 to 1.04 +/- 0.30 pmol/(2 X 10(9) micro m2) X (10 s-1). Finally, absolute serum insulin levels during oral glucose-tolerance tests and meal-tolerance tests were unchanged by weight reduction, whereas plasma glucose levels were markedly reduced. We conclude that in obese NIDDM, weight loss results in improved glucose homeostasis with 1) reduced basal HGO predominantly responsible for the lowering of fasting glucose levels; 2) improved postprandial glucose excursions with marked amelioration of peripheral insulin resistance due to improved postreceptor insulin action, which is at least partly due to enhanced glucose transport system activity; and 3) unchanged absolute insulin levels in the face of markedly reduced glycemia, indicative of enhanced beta-cell sensitivity to insulinogenic stimuli.(author) 3amen 3awomen 3adiabetes 3ahyperglycemia 3ametabolism 3aobesity 3ainsulin secretion 3aglucose 2a3-O-Methylglucose 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Weight 2aDiabetes Mellitusxdiet therapyxphysiopathology. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdiet therapyxphysiopathology. 2aDogs 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aHyperglycemiaxphysiopathology 2aInsulinxbloodxsecretion. 2aMale 2aMethylglucosidesxmetabolism 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesity 0aweight losses1 aWallace, P.1 aOlefsky, J.M.0 tDiabetes.g1986 Sept., v. 35, no. 9 p.990-998x0012-17977nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19880610c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200733 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245015700151300001800308300002600326520115800352650002801510650001601538650001701554650001201571650002201583650001301605650001201618650002901630650001701659650002101676650001901697650001101716650001001727650002001737650002001757650002201777650000901799650001001808650005301818650005301871650002701924650002901951650005301980650001102033650001902044650002402063650002702087650001102114650005202125650001902177650005102196650005102247650001202298650004802310650001702358700002002375700001902395700001702414700001602431700004802447700001402495773006902509852001302578939003302591945000802624946001302632852000902645655001202654991573769970742620221121111758.0910315e199012  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910005932DNAL7 a22458772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarakat, H.A.10aInfluence of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and NIDDM on LDL structure and composition: Possible link between hyperinsulinemia and atherosclerosis  ap. 1527-1533.  ap. 1527-1533. charts.  aThe possible causes of the enhanced risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) were examined in morbidly obese women with normoglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) before and after gastric bypass surgery. Compared with age-matched lean women, plasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations of the obese women before surgery favored atherogenesis. The risk for CHD may further be exacerbated in the IGT and NIDDM groups by the prevalence of smaller and denser low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) particles. LDL size correlated negatively with plasma insulin levels independent of triglyceride levels, age, or body mass index (BMI). After surgery, BMI, plasma insulin, and triglyceride levels decreased, but LDL size increased, and LDL density decreased. Neither cholesterol nor LDL cholesterol levels were affected after surgery, but high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol was increased in all patients after surgery. Although the mechanisms underlying the changes in the properties of LDL could not be determined from this study, these changes appear to be of benefit in reducing CHD risk in these patients. 3alow density lipoprotein 3acholesterol 3ablood plasma 3aobesity 3adiabetes mellitus 3abody fat 3ainsulin 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3atriacylglycerols 3aheart diseases 3aadults 3awomen 3abody mass index 3aapolipoproteins 3aglucose tolerance 3arisk 2aAdult 2aArteriosclerosisxbloodxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aCoronary Diseasexbloodxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aDiabetes Complications 2aDiabetes Mellitusxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxcomplications. 2aFemale 2aGastric Bypass 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aHyperinsulinismxbloodxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aInsulinxblood 2aLipoproteins, HDLxanalysisxbloodxchemistry. 2aLipoproteins, LDLxanalysisxbloodxchemistry. 2aObesity 2aObesity, Morbidxbloodxmortalityxsurgery. 2aRisk Factors1 aCarpenter, J.W.1 aMcLendon, V.D.1 aKhazanie, P.1 aLeggett, N.1 aHeath, Johnc(Principal scientific officer)1 aMarks, R.0 tDiabetes.g1990 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.1527-1533x0012-17977nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008800171300001600259520146400275650001701739650001501756653001101771653002501782700001901807700002101826700001901847773011901866852000901985856009301994930003302087946001102120655001202131IND4391568720221121062502.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439156872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00517.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolowka, David10aInsights into immunoglobulin E receptor signaling from structurally defined ligands  ap. 269-279.  aThe asymmetrical structure of bent immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to its high-affinity receptor, FcεRI, suggests a possible role for this configuration in the regulation of signaling mediated by cross-linking of FcεRI on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Indeed, the presence of bound IgE strongly influences the capacity of cross-linked FcεRI dimers to trigger mast cell degranulation, implicating orientational constraints by bound IgE. Bivalent ligands that cross-link by binding to bivalent IgE can form linear and cyclic chains of IgE/FcεRI complexes, and these exhibit only limited capacity to stimulate downstream signaling and degranulation, whereas structurally analogous trivalent ligands, which can form branched networks of cross-linked IgE/FcεRI complexes, are more effective at cell activation. Long bivalent ligands with flexible spacers can form intramolecular cross-links with IgE, and these stable 1:1 complexes are very potent inhibitors of mast cell degranulation stimulated by multivalent antigen. In contrast, trivalent ligands with rigid double-stranded DNA spacers effectively stimulate degranulation responses in a length-dependent manner, providing direct evidence for receptor transphosphorylation as a key step in the mechanism of signaling by FcεRI. Thus, studies with chemically defined oligovalent ligands show important features of IgE receptor cross-linking that regulate signaling, leading to mast cell activation. 3acrosslinking 3amast cells 0aFcεRI 0atransphosphorylation1 aSil, Dwaipayan1 aTorigoe, Chikako1 aBaird, Barbara0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 June, v. 217, no. 1 p.269-279dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00517.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01992naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002700161245005800188300001800246500002400264520096500288650001401253650002101267650001601288650001901304650001901323650002601342650002601368650001101394651001801405651001801423700002101441773011401462852000901576856004501585655001201630IND4411711620221121062537.0081017e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441171162DNAL7 a186838182pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2007002642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPucciarelli, Deanna L.14aThe Medicinal Use of Chocolate in Early North America  ap. 1215-1227.  aIncludes references  aThe medicinal use of chocolate has a long history in North America dating back to the 16th century. From Mesoamerican Codices and European Treatises scholars have determined that for hundreds of years the beverage called chocolate was administered to the sick and prescribed homeopathically to prevent illness. Yet, little scholarship exists that focuses on medicinal chocolate usage in early North America (18th-19th century). This paper examines medical practices during this era and associated medicinal norms with special attention given to chocolate/cocoa usage. Given the current scientific attention on the relationship between dark chocolate consumption and heart disease attenuation it is timely to investigate and chronicle America's medical forebears' understanding of, and practices related to, the medicinal use of chocolate. Indeed, there is a significant amount of literature to suggest that chocolate was used for wellness and to treat illness. 3achocolate 3acocoa (beverage) 3acocoa beans 3aheart diseases 2aCacaoxhistory 2aHistory, 18th Century 2aHistory, 19th Century 2aHumans 3aNorth America 0aNorth America1 aGrivetti, Louis.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2008 Oct., v. 52, no. 10 p.1215-1227dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700264 7aarticle02140naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245005500143300001400198500013200212520101100344650002301355650001301378650001901391650002301410700001601433700001401449700001501463700001301478700001501491700001801506700001201524700001401536700001801550773009401568852000901662930003301671945002501704946001301729655001201742IND4385203620221121052108.0061114e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438520362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

If the inhibitory effect of lignin can be significantly reduced, softwoods may become a more useful feedstock for the bioconversion processes. Moreover, strategies developed to reduce problems with softwood lignin may also provide a means to enhance the processing of other lignocellulosic substrates. The Forest Products Biotechnology Group at the University of British Columbia has been developing softwood-to-ethanol processes with SO2-catalyzed steam explosion and ethanol organosolv pretreatments. Lignin from the steam explosion process has relatively low reactivity and, consequently, low product value, compared with the high-value coproduct that can be obtained through organosolv. The technical and economic challenges of both processes are presented, together with suggestions for future process development. 3aethanol production 3asoftwood 3alignocellulose 3aorganosolv pulping1 aGregg, D.J.1 aArato, C.1 aBerlin, A.1 aBura, R.1 aGilkes, N.1 aMirochnik, O.1 aPan, X.1 aPye, E.K.1 aSaddler, J.N.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2006 Spring, v. 129-132 p.55-70x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle02563naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245010900154300002000263520145400283650002201737650002401759650002401783650000901807650001601816650001501832650002001847650001801867650000901885650002701894653001301921653002101934700001901955700002501974773009801999852000902097930003302106945001302139946001302152655001202165IND2054549620221121051929.0961219e199606  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205454962DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamuels, S.E.10aSkeletal and cardiac muscle protein turnover during short-term cold exposure and rewarming in young rats  ap. R1231-R1239.  aYoung animals exposed to cold environmental temperatures typically have decreased skeletal muscle accretion but increased heart masses. To explore these phenomena, we measured protein synthesis and degradation in vivo in cardiac and skeletal muscle in weanling rats during short-term cold exposure and rewarming. Control rats were housed at 25 degrees C throughout the experiment. Ad libitum-fed and pair-fed (to the intake of controls) rats were housed at 5 degrees (cold) for 5 days and then at 25 degrees C (rewarmed) for another 5 days. Cold exposure decreased rates of protein accretion and synthesis in skeletal muscle, whereas degradation did not differ. The effects of cold exposure on skeletal muscle were similar in both pair-fed and ad libitum-fed rats, except growth was lower in pair-fed rats. In cardiac muscle, cold exposure increased rates of protein synthesis and degradation and resulted in increased cardiac mass. Results in pair-fed animals generally fell between those of control and ad libitum-fed cold rats. During rewarming, growth rates were not higher in skeletal muscle in ad libitum-fed rewarmed rats, although protein turnover returned toward control values; in pair-fed rats, it remained lower. In heart, growth rates of ad libitum-fed and pair-fed rewarmed rats decreased due to lower protein synthesis rates. These alterations appear to be consistent with a strategy designed to improve survival in cold environments. 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein degradation 3aambient temperature 3acold 3afood intake 3amyocardium 3askeletal muscle 3ayoung animals 3arats 3aenvironmental exposure 0arecovery 0aprotein turnover1 aThompson, J.R.1 aChristopherson, R.J.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1996 June, v. 270, no. 6:pt.2 p.R1231-R1239x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03149naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002600147245014000173300001600313500002400329500001500353520172400368650002802092650001002120650002402130650003302154650001402187650002202201650002102223650001502244650001102259650002602270650002102296650001302317650001102330650002402341651001202365651001502377651001102392653002402403653001502427700002402442700002302466700002302489773008402512852000902596856005002605655001202655IND4442527920221121041210.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444252792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2010.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakušić, Branislava10aHabitat-related adaptations in morphology and anatomy of Teucrium (Lamiaceae) species from the Balkan peninsula (Serbia and Montenegro)  ap. 633-646.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this paper adaptive morpho-anatomical traits are described of the species Teucrium fruticans, T. arduini, T. scordium, T. botrys, T. chamaedrys, T. flavum, T. montanum and T. polium in Serbia and Montenegro (Balkan peninsula). These characters of leaves and stems were related with chorology and ecology of the species. The research is based on 63 populations sampled across the region, from Eu-Mediterranean coastal areas up to the mountains and to temperate deciduous forest regions of Serbia. Descriptive statistics were calculated for 22 quantitative characters and multivariate analyses were performed to describe the structure of variability (PCA), to identify the significance of differences between the species studied (MANOVA), and to measure distances between them (CDA). In contrast to the widely distributed species Teucrium chamaedrys, T. montanum and T. polium, the species T. fruticans, T. arduini, T. scordium, T. botrys and T. flavum have narrow ecological ranges. Morpho-anatomical analysis gives evidence that all species except T. scordium are xerophytes with distinctly xeromorphic structures. But each of them is characterized by specific structural adaptations to the more or less arid environmental conditions. The perennial herbaceous T. scordium, from the humid habitats, belongs to the mesophytic plant type. The results show that structures of the analyzed species are only partially related with the phylogenetic position of the respective taxa. Multivariate analysis indicates that the morpho-anatomical similarity of some species with each other can be characterized as convergently developed rather in adaptation to xeric ecological conditions that as based on phylogenetic relations. 3ainterspecific variation 3astems 3aTeucrium chamaedrys 3adry environmental conditions 3amountains 3atemperate forests 3aplant adaptation 3axerophytes 3acoasts 3amultivariate analysis 3aplant morphology 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3aquantitative traits 3aBalkans 3aMontenegro 3aSerbia 0aspecies differences 0aadaptation1 aStevanović, Branka1 aJančić, Radiša.1 aLakušić, Dmitar.0 tFlora.g2010 Oct., v. 205, no. 10 p.633-646dG.

The patients with NIDDM were studied twice, once while in poor glycemic control (fasting blood glucose concentration 267 mg/dl, urinary glucose excretion 28.9 g/24 hours) and again after modest glycemic improvement following 2 months of fiber treatment (fasting blood glucose 227 mg/dl, urinary glucose excretion 10.7 g/24 hours). Basal carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation rates were normal in patients with NIDDM before and after fiber treatment. However, in patients before fiber treatment the rise in CHO oxidation rates, the reciprocal fall in lipid oxidation rates, and the rise in serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations after the breakfast were all severely blunted. In addition, storage of ingested CHO was significantly reduced (from 55% to 32%). After fiber treatment, postbreakfast CHO oxidation rates had improved and were no longer significantly lower than control values. In contrast, CHO storage remained suppressed. We conclude that (1) basal CHO oxidation remained normal but that postbreakfast CHO oxidation was impaired in our obese patients with NIDDM. This impairment, however, appeared to be a relatively late event, occurring only during severely uncontrolled NIDDM. (2) Inability to dispose of CHO by storage appeared to be an earlier defect with a greater impact on glucose tolerance than the impairment of CHO oxidation.

The large divergence in ion homeostasis between the salt-tolerant FL478 and salt-sensitive IR29 rice varieties can be exploited to understand mechanisms of salinity tolerance. Physiological studies indicate that FL478 shows a lower Na⁺ influx, a reduced Na⁺ translocation to the shoot, and maintains a lower Na⁺:K⁺ ratio. To understand the basis of these differences, a comparative investigation of transcript regulation in roots of the two cultivars was undertaken. This analysis revealed that genes encoding aquaporins, a silicon transporter, and N transporters are induced in both cultivars. However, transcripts for cation transport proteins including OsCHX11, OsCNGC1, OsCAX, and OsTPC1 showed differential regulation between the cultivars. The encoded proteins are likely to participate in reducing Na⁺ influx, lowering the tissue Na⁺:K⁺ ratio and limiting the apoplastic bypass flow in roots of FL478 and are therefore important new targets to improve salt tolerance in rice.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acations 3acultivars 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3apreferential flow 3arice 3aroots 3asalt tolerance 3ashoots 3asilicon 3atransporters 2aCation Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOryzaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aSalt Tolerance. 2aSodiumxmetabolism1 aSingh, R.K.1 aMaathuis, Frans J.M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2009 July, v. 60, no. 9 p.2553-2563dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp0993Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02084naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011100169300001600280500002400296520098600320650002301306650001801329650002901347650003001376650001101406650001001417650002201427650002201449650002201471700001801493700002001511700002501531773010901556852000901665856004801674655001201722IND4401558420221120121612.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440155842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-007-9288-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurrini, Alessandra10aIn situ collection of endangered arbuscular mychorrhizal fungi in a Mediterranean UNESCO Biosphere Reserve  ap. 643-657.  aIncludes references  aWe report the establishment of the first in situ collection of beneficial symbiotic microorganisms (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) in the world, located in an integrally protected area of coastal sand dunes, within the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve “Selva Pisana”, in Tuscany, Italy.

Here, the multiple-level regulation of expression of the pca-qui operon encoding the enzymes for protocatechuate and quinate degradation was studied. It is shown that both activities of the IclR-type regulator protein PcaU at the structural gene promoter pcaIp, namely protocatechuate-dependent activation of pca-qui operon expression as well as repression in the absence of protocatechuate, can be observed in a different cellular background (Escherichia coli) and therefore are intrinsic to PcaU. The regulation of PcaU expression is demonstrated to be carbon source dependent according to the same pattern as the pca-qui operon. The increase of the pcaU gene copy number leads to a decrease of the basal expression at pcaIp, indicating that the occupancy of the PcaU binding site is well balanced and depends on the concentration of PcaU in the cell. Luciferase is used as a reporter to demonstrate strong repression of pcaIp when benzoate, a substrate of the catechol branch of the pathway, is present in addition to substrates of the protocatechuate branch (cross-regulation). The same repression pattern was observed for promoter pcaUp. Thus, three promoters involved in gene expression of enzymes of the protocatechuate branch (pobAp upstream of pobA, pcaIp, and pcaUp) are strongly repressed in the presence of benzoate. The negative effect of protocatechuate on pobA expression is not based on a direct sensing of the metabolite by PobR, the specific regulator of pobA expression.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astructural genes 3abenzoates 3aluciferase 3agene expression 3acarbon 3aoperon 3abinding sites 3astructural proteins 3aAcinetobacter 3aEscherichia coli 2aAcinetobacterxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCulture Media 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenes, Reporter 2aHydroxybenzoatesxmetabolism 2aLuciferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOperon 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aQuinic Acidxmetabolism 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aaromatic compounds1 aDal, Süreyya1 aFischer, Rita1 aPatz, Patricia1 aGerischer, Ulrike0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.232-242dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01608-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02587naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245008700135300001300222520153900235650002001774650001801794650002501812650001101837650001401848650001801862650001601880650002301896650001901919650001501938650001001953700001601963700002001979773006501999852000902064856009402073939003302167946001302200655001202213IND4482686120221120091542.0140627s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448268612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlderman, Stephen C.10aOccurrence and trends in weed seed contaminants in fine fescue seed lots in Oregon  ap. 7-21.  aFine fescues are highly valued cool-season turf species. Nearly all of the U.S. fine fescue seed is produced in Oregon, although little is known about the occurrence of weed seed contaminants in fine fescue seed lots. This study was conducted to assess the diversity and frequency of occurrence of weed seed in chewings [Festuca rubra L. subsp. commutata Gaudin], red [Festuca rubra L. subsp. rubra], and hard fescue [Festuca trachyphylla (Hack.) Krajina] samples submitted to the Oregon State University Seed Laboratory. The samples represent seed lots from seed production fields. Weed seed data from 1986-1995 and 2002-2006 were collected from the purity analysis reports of certified seed samples of chewings, creeping red and hard fescue. Ninety-five weed seed contaminants were identified to species, with an additional 30 identified to genus. No weed seeds contaminants were found in 30-50% of the seed lots, depending on the year. Typically, fewer than three different weed species were detected within a sample. The most common contaminates, occurring annually, were rattail fescue [Vulpia myuros L.], annual bluegrass [Poa annua L.], and downy brome [Bromus tectorum L.]. Among these, rattail fescue was the most common, occurring in 30-61% of seed samples, depending on the year. The number of weed species varied among years and increased as the number of seed lots tested per year increased. During the past decade, the number of new weed species contaminants detected increased at a rate of approximately three per year. 3aBromus tectorum 3aFestuca rubra 3aFestuca trachyphylla 3aOregon 3aPoa annua 3aVulpia myuros 3acold season 3adisease-free seeds 3alawns and turf 3atechnology 3aweeds1 aElias,Sabry1 aHulting, Andrew0 tSeed technology.g2011, v. 33, no. 1 p.7-21x1096-07247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.seedtechnology.net/journal/ST_V33_No1.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140627  aOther US 7aarticle02353naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004600126300001400172520132800186650003401514650001001548650001001558650002301568650001701591650001401608650001201622650002801634650002101662650000901683650001901692650002101711651001301732653002801745653001701773700001901790773006601809852000901875930003301884945001301917946001301930655001201943IND2180452420221120081411.0981014s1997    ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218045242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElias, S.G.10aEvaluation of seed vigor tests for canola  ap. 78-87.  aField emergence and several seed vigor tests were used to evaluate the quality of different canola seed lots. Four seed lots representing two winter and two spring cultivars were aged at 42 degrees C at various time intervals to provide six sub-lots with a range of seed vigor. The six sub-lots were evaluated for seed quality using the following tests: cold, cold soil, conductivity, first count germination, standard germination and field emergence. Aging seeds for 48 h at 42 degrees C followed by germination for 7 d at 22 C was the best method for the accelerated aging test. Soaking 200 uninjured, untreated seeds for 16 h at 22 degrees C in 50 ml of distilled water was suitable for the conductivity test. The cold soil test was most successful in separating seed lots of different quality when seeds were planted on moist blotter paper, covered with soil and pre-treated for 5 d at 5 degrees C before germinating at 22 degrees C for 5 d. Incubation for 5 d at 5 degrees C without soil provided the best pre-germination treatment for the cold test. Temperatures of 22, 25 or 20/30 degrees C (alternating) in the standard germination test did not significantly differ in influencing germination results. Significant correlations were found between the results of all vigor tests and field emergence for all seed lots. 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3aseeds 3avigor 3aseedling emergence 3aseed quality 3acultivars 3astorage 3aelectrical conductivity 3aseed germination 3acold 3aseed treatment 3asoil temperature 3aMichigan 0aspring and winter habit 0aseed testing1 aCopeland, L.O.0 tSeed technology.g1997, v. 19, no. 1 p.78-87x1096-07247nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03435naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245008900169300001600258500010500274520190100379650001502280650001702295650001802312650002402330650001202354650002302366650001802389650001602407650001902423650001102442650001602453650001802469650002402487650002002511650001302531650001002544650002202554650001502576650002202591650002002613650001402633650001702647650001502664650001402679700001502693773014502708856005502853852000902908655001202917IND60596900020221120060010.0180621e20180331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059690002DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1195.272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKursun, E.10aDried persimmons: bioactive components, health aspects and current drying techniques  ap. 169-176.  aProceedings of the VI International Symposium on Persimmon held October 16-20, 2016, Valencia, Spain  aConsumer demand for natural and naturally processed food products is increasing worldwide. From this point of view, fruits and vegetables and their products are one of the most important food groups. Persimmons and products manufactured with this fruit are attractive to many people due to their unique flavor and aroma. Thanks to its valuable components with high antioxidant characteristics, persimmon has many beneficial effects mainly on digestive and cardiovascular systems. Persimmon is rich in carbohydrates, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, such as condensed tannins, vitamins A and C, minerals, and dietary fiber. This climacteric fruit ripens and softens in a very short time resulting in a jelly-like flesh. In this state, it is very vulnerable to physical and microbiological deterioration and thus cannot be stored for a long period. Persimmon can be processed into jam, marmalade or can be preserved by canning or drying techniques. Dried persimmons can be an alternative to fresh persimmons when fresh fruit are not available. Carbohydrate, protein, dietary fiber and mineral contents of the fruit increase as a result of drying process and a low moisture product with high energy content is obtained. On the other hand, reductions in the contents of vitamins, especially vitamin C, can be observed during drying. Persimmons can be dried as whole fruit or slices. Conventional techniques such as sun or solar drying and hot air drying in a cabinet dryer are the most common methods used for dried persimmon production. Alternative techniques such as microwave and freeze-drying or osmotic dehydration are also employed in scientific research. In this study, the bioactive components of fresh and dried persimmons are compared and their potential health effects are evaluated. Moreover, current techniques used for persimmon drying are evaluated in terms of product quality control. 3aair drying 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abioactive compounds 3acanning 3aclimacteric fruits 3adietary fiber 3adried fruit 3aenergy content 3aflavor 3afood groups 3afreeze drying 3amicrowave treatment 3amineral content 3aminerals 3aodors 3aosmotic treatment 3apersimmons 3aproanthocyanidins 3aquality control 3araw fruit 3asolar drying 3avegetables 3avitamin A1 aKaraca, H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Mar. 31, , no. 1195 p.169-176dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1195.27  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001200193245021500205300001600420520120400436650001801640653000801658653002901666653000901695700001601704700001701720700001801737700001401755700001801769700001401787773013401801852000901935856009201944930003302036946001102069655001202080IND4437971720221120060101.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443797172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04141.x2doi7 aPMC29401562pmcid7 a204088622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, S.10aCould a loss of memory T cells limit responses to hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigens in blood leucocytes from patients chronically infected with HCV before and during pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin therapy  ap. 118-126.  aThe proportions and activation status of T cells may influence responses to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and treatment outcome in patients receiving pegylated interferon (IFN)-α/ribavirin therapy. We confirmed that IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) responses to HCV are poor in HCV patients and showed that responses to HCV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens decrease during therapy. This was most apparent in patients with sustained virological response (SVR). Baseline frequencies of CD4⁺ effector memory (TEM) T cells were lower in SVR than non-SVR. Proportions of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ TEM and terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) T cells declined on therapy in SVR, as did proportions of Fas⁺ CD8⁺ TEMRA T cells. Baseline frequencies of programmed death (PD)-1-expressing CD4⁺ TEM and TEMRA T-cells were higher in SVR. Therapy increased percentages of PD-1⁺ CD4⁺ central memory (TCM) T cells and PD-1⁺ CD8⁺ TEM and TEMRA T cells in SVR. We conclude that successful therapy depletes circulating antigen-specific CD4⁺ T cell responses. This paralleled decreases in proportions of effector memory T cells and higher percentages of CD4⁺ TCM T cells expressing PD-1. 3aT-lymphocytes 0aHCV 0ainterferon-based therapy 0aPD-11 aHammond, T.1 aWatson, M.W.1 aFlexman, J.P.1 aCheng, W.1 aFernandez, S.1 aPrice, P.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2010 July, v. 161, no. 1 p.118-126dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04141.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02855naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245008100188300001600269520110200285650001601387650001701403650001601420650001201436650001301448650001901461650001901480650001101499650001801510650001101528650001101539650002201550650001401572650001401586650002401600650006201624650003401686650004101720650002701761650002301788650002301811651002201834653003001856653002301886700001801909700001501927700001701942700002001959700001301979773012801992852000902120856009202129930003302221946001102254655001202265IND4431084720221120042923.0100111e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443108472DNAL7 a199438832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02766.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTapilatu, Y.10aIsolation of alkane-degrading bacteria from deep-sea Mediterranean sediments  ap. 234-236.  aTo isolate and identify alkane-degrading bacteria from deep-sea superficial sediments sampled at a north-western Mediterranean station. Sediments from the water/sediment interface at a 2400 m depth were sampled with a multicorer at the ANTARES site off the French Mediterranean coast and were promptly enriched with Maya crude oil as the sole source of carbon and energy. Alkane-degrading bacteria belonging to the genera Alcanivorax, Pseudomonas, Marinobacter, Rhodococcus and Clavibacter-like were isolated, indicating that the same groups were potentially involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation in deep sea as in coastal waters. These results confirm that members of Alcanivorax are important obligate alkane degraders in deep-sea environments and coexist with other degrading bacteria inhabiting the deep-subsurface sediment of the Mediterranean. The results suggest that the isolates obtained have potential applications in bioremediation strategies in deep-sea environments and highlight the need to identify specific piezophilic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HCB) from these environments. 3aAlcanivorax 3aMarinobacter 3aPseudomonas 3aalkanes 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3aenergy 3ahexachlorobenzene 3apetroleum 3asediments 2aAlkanesxmetabolism 2aBacteriaxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aPetroleumxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Purification 0aMediterranean Sea 0aAlkane-degrading bacteria 0adeep-sea sediments1 aAcquaviva, M.1 aGuigue, C.1 aMiralles, G.1 aBertrand, J.-C.1 aCuny, P.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2010 Feb., v. 50, no. 2 p.234-236dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02766.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100111b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01905naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245013100159300001600290520085100306650003201157650002401189700001501213700001501228700001601243700001301259700001701272700001501289700002001304700001601324700001501340773009601355852000901451930003301460945002501493946001301518655001201531IND4372787020221120043028.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437278702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, the high costs for delignification and enzymatic hydrolysis currently deter commercialization of softwood bioconversion processes. This study evaluates the abilities of two novel fungal preparations (MSUBC1 and MSUBC2) and two commercial cellulase preparations (TR1 and TR2) to hydrolyze cellulose in Douglas-fir pretreated by steam explosion or ethanol organosolv process. MSUBC1 showed significantly better performance than the other preparations on both lignocellulosic substrates. In particular, MSUBC1 achieved >76% cellulose conversion for hydrolysis of steam-exploded Douglas-fir (approximately 44% lignin) after 72 h at low enzyme loading (10 filter paper units/g of cellulose) and without beta-glucosidase supplementation. 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3aenzymatic treatment1 aBerlin, A.1 aGilkes, N.1 aKilburn, D.1 aBura, R.1 aRobinson, J.1 aMarkov, A.1 aSkomarovsky, A.1 aGusakov, A.1 aOkunev, O.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.219-230x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060417b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/17  aOther US 7aarticle01787naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007200092040001800164100001500182245004800197300001600245520094600261650001301207773012301220852000901343856012201352930003301474945001301507946001301520655001201533IND2055470720221120035345.0970219e199703  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205547072DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199703)231:3<287::AID-JMOR7>3.0.CO;2-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBout, R.G.10aPostures of the avian craniocervical column  ap. 287-295.  aThe avian cervical column comprises a large number of vertebrae and has far more degrees of freedom than necessary to position and orient the head. The large number of joints makes the avian neck a very suitable model for the study of coordination and movement strategies in kinematically redundant chains. A static optimization model that finds a solution for the configuration of cervical vertebrae is proposed and tested in a series of neck postures of a chicken. As inputs, the model uses length of the vertebrae, orientation of the articulation facies, and the position and orientation of the head with respect to the body. The model demonstrates that an even distribution of rotation over the whole chain is sufficient to explain all the essential characteristics of neck postures. It is shown that the model not only predicts static postures but also minimizes the change in angle needed to go through a series of successive postures. 3achickens0 tJournal of morphology.g1997 Mar., v. 231, no. 3 p.287-295aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199703)231:3<287::AID-JMOR7>3.0.CO;2-83Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02818naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002200127245010900149300001600258520201500274650001702289650001402306650001902320700002502339773009602364852000902460930003302469945002502502946001302527655001202540IND4372786720221120035312.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437278672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSilva-Jimenez, H.10aIntracellular fate of hydrocarbons: possible existence of specific compartments for their biodegradation  ap. 205-218.  aIn previous work, purification procedures and zymogram analysis conducted with supernatants of crude extracts from aerobic mycelium of the YR-1 strain of Mucor circinelloides isolated from petroleum-contaminated soils indicated the existence of only one soluble alcohol oxidase (sAO) activity. In the present work enzymatic activity of alcohol oxidase (AO) was also detected in the mixed membrane fraction (MMF) of a high-speed centrifugation procedure after drastic ballistic cellular homogenization to break the mycelium from strain YR-1. When mycelial cells were gently broken by freezing the mycelium with liquid nitrogen, smashing in a mortar, and submitting the samples to an isopycnic sucrose gradients (10-60% sucrose), AO activity was detected in particular and discrete fractions of the gradient, showing specific density values quite different from the density of peroxisomes. The results suggest that there could be a different intracellular pattern of distribution of the microsomal fraction in aerobically grown mycelium depending on the carbon source used in the culture media, including alcohols and hydrocarbons, but not in glucose. In working with particulate fractions, we found two AO activities: a new membrane alcohol oxidase (mAO) activity and the sAO. Both activities appear to be located in the inner of the cells in specific compartments different from the peroxisomes, so mAO could be in the membrane of these compartments and sAO in the lumen of the vesicles. We also assayed other enzymatic activities involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation to establish its intracellular location and other enzymatic activities such as peroxidase to use them as intracellular markers of different organelles. In the case of monooxygenase, the first enzymatic step in the hydrocarbon biodegradation pathway, its location was in the same fractions where AOs were located, suggesting the existance of a specific organelle that contains the enzymatic activities involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation. 3ahydrocarbons 3apetroleum 3abiodegradation1 aZazueta-Sandoval, R.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.205-218x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060415b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle02165naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010700161300001600268520110900284653002501393653002401418653001601442653002801458653000801486653001401494700002401508700002101532700002001553773011401573852000901687856008501696930003301781946001301814655001201827IND4437464820221120035222.0100522e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443746482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10571-009-9483-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Asha 14aThe Cdk5 Kinase Downregulates ATP-Gated Ionotropic P2X₃ Receptor Function Via Serine Phosphorylation  ap. 505-509.  aCdk5 is an endogenous kinase activated by the neuronal-specific protein p35 and implicated in multiple neuronal functions, including modulation of certain pain responses. We investigated whether Cdk5 could regulate ATP-gated P2X₃ receptors that are members of the family of membrane proteins expressed by sensory neurons to transduce nociception in baseline and chronic pain. To study the potential P2X₃ receptor modulation by Cdk5, we co-transfected rat P2X₃ receptors and Cdk5 into HEK cells and observed increased P2X₃ receptor serine phosphorylation together with downregulation of receptor currents only when these genes were transfected together with the gene of the Cdk5 activator p35. The changes in receptor responses were limited to depressed current amplitude as desensitization and recovery were not altered. Transfection of p35 with P2X₃ similarly downregulated receptor responses, suggesting that this phenomenon could be observed even with constitutive Cdk5. The present data indicate a novel target to express the action of Cdk5 on membrane proteins involved in pain perception. 0aPurinergic receptors 0aReceptor modulation 0aPatch clamp 0aSerine/threonine kinase 0ap35 0aHEK cells1 aSimonetti, Manuela 1 aFabbretti, Elsa 1 aNistri, Andrea 0 tCellular and molecular neurobiology.g2010 May, v. 30, no. 4 p.505-509dBoston : Springer USx0272-43407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10571-009-9483-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02275naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245009900173300001800272520107500290650001801365650002001383650001501403650001301418650001701431650001601448650001101464650001201475650002701487650002701514700001801541700002001559700002301579700001901602773011101621852000901732856009201741930003301833946001101866655001201877IND4404905420221120035212.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06382.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Nicole.10aActivity of soluble OX40 ligand is enhanced by oligomerization and cell surface immobilization  ap. 2296-2304.  aOX40 ligand (OX40L) and OX40 are typical members of the tumor necrosis factor ligand family and the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, respectively, and are involved in the costimulation and differentiation of T cells. Like other tumor necrosis factor ligands, OX40L is a type II transmembrane protein. Recombinant soluble human OX40L assembles into trimers and is practically inactive despite binding to OX40. However, oligomerization of soluble OX40L trimers by cross-linking with antibodies or by expression as a hexameric fusion protein strongly increased the activity of the ligand. Moreover, a fusion protein of OX40L with a single chain fragment recognizing the tumor stroma antigen fibroblast activation protein showed a cell surface antigen-dependent increase in the activity of the ligand domain of the molecule and thus mimicked the activity of membrane OX40L upon antigen binding. Trimeric single chain OX40L fusion proteins therefore represent a novel type of OX40L-derived immunostimulatory molecule with potentially reduced systemic side effects. 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadverse effects 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3acrosslinking 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3aligands 3atransmembrane proteins 3atumor necrosis factors1 aWyzgol, Agnes1 aMünkel, Sabine1 aPfizenmaier, Klaus1 aWajant, Harald0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 9 p.2296-2304dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06382.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02429naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013200164300001800296520100100314650001901315650003201334650001001366650002201376650001501398650001801413650001001431650001501441650001201456650001701468650001501485650001401500650002001514650001901534653000901553653001901562653000901581700002101590700002301611700001901634700002201653773013401675852000901809856008501818930003301903946001101936655001201947IND4439170720221123042020.0100625e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443917072DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-010-0350-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThamm, Markus 10aCharacterization of the 5-HT₁A receptor of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and involvement of serotonin in phototactic behavior  ap. 2467-2479.  aSerotonin plays a key role in modulating various physiological and behavioral processes in both protostomes and deuterostomes. The vast majority of serotonin receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. We report the cloning of a cDNA from the honeybee (Am5-ht1A) sharing high similarity with members of the 5-HT₁ receptor class. Activation of Am5-HT₁A by serotonin inhibited the production of cAMP in a dose-dependent manner (EC₅₀ = 16.9 nM). Am5-HT₁A was highly expressed in brain regions known to be involved in visual information processing. Using in vivo pharmacology, we could demonstrate that Am5-HT₁A receptor ligands had a strong impact on the phototactic behavior of individual bees. The data presented here mark the first comprehensive study—from gene to behavior—of a 5-HT₁A receptor in the honeybee, paving the way for the eventual elucidation of additional roles of this receptor subtype in the physiology and behavior of this social insect. 3aApis mellifera 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3abrain 3acomplementary DNA 3acyclic AMP 3adose response 3agenes 3ahoney bees 3aligands 3apharmacology 3aphototaxis 3aserotonin 3asocial behavior 3asocial insects 0a5-HT 0aBiogenic amine 0aGPCR1 aBalfanz, Sabine 1 aScheiner, Ricarda 1 aBaumann, Arnd 1 aBlenau, Wolfgang 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 July, v. 67, no. 14 p.2467-2479dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-010-0350-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100628b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02670naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009400169300001800263520155100281650002601832650002601858650003101884650001001915650000901925650001801934650001201952650002401964650002001988700002402008700002002032773011102052852000902163856009202172930003302264946001102297655001202308IND4404903520221123042106.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06359.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Tae-Eun10aChanges in acetylcholine receptor function induce shifts in muscle fiber type composition  ap. 2042-2054.  aAChRε⁻/⁻ mice lack ε-subunits of the acetylcholine receptor and thus fail to express adult-type receptors. The expression of fetal-type receptors throughout postnatal life alters postsynaptic signal transduction and causes a fast-to-slow fiber type transition, both in slow-twitch soleus muscle and in fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus muscle. In comparison to wild-type muscle, the proportion of type 1 slow fibers is significantly increased (6%), whereas the proportion of fast fibers is reduced (in soleus, type 2A by 12%, and in extensor digitorum longus, type 2B/2D by 10%). The increased levels of troponin Islow transcripts clearly support a fast-to-slow fiber type transition. Shifts of protein and transcript levels are not restricted to 'myogenic' genes but also affect 'synaptogenic' genes. Clear increases are observed for acetylcholine receptor α-subunits and the postsynaptically located utrophin. Although the fast-to-slow fiber type transition appears to occur in a coordinated manner in both muscle types, muscle-specific differences are retained. Most prominently, the differential expression level of the synaptic regulator MuSK is significantly lower in extensor digitorum muscle than in soleus muscle. The results show a new quality in muscle plasticity, in that changes in the functional properties of endplate receptors modulate the contractile properties of skeletal muscles. Muscle thus represents a self-matching system that adjusts contractile properties and synaptic function to variable functional demands. 3acholinergic receptors 3afunctional properties 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amice 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3asignal transduction 3askeletal muscle1 aWernig, A.q(Anton)1 aWitzemann, Veit0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 9 p.2042-2054dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06359.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02136naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008500125300001600210500001500226520075200241650001600993650001401009650002001023650001301043650002101056650001101077650002101088650001801109650002701127650002301154650001401177650000901191650001801200650001601218650001801234650001401252650002401266650003201290650001201322650001801334653001601352653003101368700001901399700001501418700001701433773009001450852000901540930003301549945001301582946001101595655001201606IND2207514320221123042458.0001026s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220751432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatt, M.P.10aIn vitro storage of Eucalyptus grandis germplasm under minimal growth conditions  ap. 161-164.  a2019-12-05  aSlow growth-storage, for up to 10 months, has been achieved for Eucalyptus grandis shoot cultures by either the addition of 10 mg l-1 abscisic acid to the growth medium or by the halving of nutrient supply (half MS) and removal of exogenous plant growth regulators.

Glover.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo primary approaches to perennial biofuel crop production studied so far are fertilized grass monocultures and low-input high-diversity grasslands. While high-yielding perennial grass varieties are being developed in fertilized monocultures, breeding for yield in low-input high-diversity systems would be difficult. Before initiating breeding for low-input systems, it is therefore important to know the minimum number of functional groups and species required for maximum biomass harvest from low-input grasslands. We controlled the number of perennial grassland species in 168 plots in Minnesota, USA. Species were selected at random from a pool of 18, and 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 were planted in each plot. Aboveground biomass was measured annually, and the plots were burned each spring. We found a strongly positive log-linear relationship between average annual aboveground biomass and planted species number, but a large proportion of plot-to-plot variability remained unexplained. We performed a conditional analysis of the aboveground biomass data to determine whether considering species identity would reduce the minimum number of species necessary in order to achieve yields similar to the highest diversity treatments. A model that accounted for the presence of legumes in general, and for the presence of the legume species Lupinus perennis in particular, showed no increase in biomass yield with increased species number. Over 11 years, average yields of L. perennis/C₄ grass bicultures were similar to those of 16-species (maximum diversity) plots, and both were >200% greater than the average of monocultures. Thus, under low-input conditions, the choice of the appropriate few perennial plant species for each location might result in systems with biomass yields similar to those from high-diversity systems. Because breeding biofuel crops in diverse mixtures would introduce complexity that is unwarranted in terms of maximum biomass yield, the first biofuel crop breeding programs for low-input systems are likely to accelerate progress by focusing on grass-legume bicultures. 3afunctional diversity 3agrasses 3aplant breeding 3aC4 plants 3aperennials 3aenergy crops 3aLupinus 3adry matter accumulation 3acrop yield 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3abiofuels 3aindigenous species 3alow input agriculture 3aspatial variation 3abiomass 3agrasslands 3aMinnesota 0aLupinus perennis 0aFabaceae1 aWeisberg, Sanford1 aTilman, David1 aFornara, Dario0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.33-38dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.10.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20100614b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03130naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100002600173245010900199300001600308500002400324500001500348520136500363650001501728650001901743650001401762650001401776650002501790650001201815650002201827650001201849650002301861650002001884650001901904650002301923650002201946650001001968650002201978650001702000650002002017650001602037650001702053650001502070650001702085653001702102653001702119653003202136700001902168700002102187700002102208773011102229852000902340856008602349930003302435945002502468946001102493655001202504IND4435187220140725000000.0100409e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443518722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2010.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aJ710 0aJ1001 aDiekötter, T.q(Tim)10aLandscape and management effects on structure and function of soil arthropod communities in winter wheat  ap. 108-112.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study evaluates the impact of agricultural management (organic vs. conventional) and landscape context on species richness and abundance of five soil arthropod taxa (ground beetles, spiders, springtails, millipedes, woodlice) and associated ecosystem functions (soil biological activity, weed seed predation, litter decomposition). A significant interaction between management type and landscape context was revealed in several cases. Activity density of millipedes and wood lice and species richness of ground beetles were higher in fields where local and regional management types were complementary, indicating a beneficial effect of environmental heterogeneity. In addition, seed predation on arable weeds was higher in organically than conventionally managed fields. It is concluded that the effect of agricultural management on soil arthropod biodiversity and functioning is often context dependent. The diversity of functionally important taxa such as ground beetles and decomposers may be enhanced by increasing environmental heterogeneity, a measure that is also beneficial for other components of agrobiodiversity. Thus, in a conventional agricultural context even managing only a fraction of fields organically may help to increase environmental heterogeneity and thereby promote soil arthropod diversity and the associated ecosystem functions. 3aCollembola 3aseed predation 3aCarabidae 3aDiplopoda 3afunctional diversity 3aIsopoda 3aTriticum aestivum 3aAraneae 3aorganic production 3asoil arthropods 3aagroecosystems 3aecosystem services 3aspecies diversity 3aweeds 3aspatial variation 3awinter wheat 3acrop management 3agrain crops 3aplant litter 3alandscapes 3adetritivores 0asoil biology 0abiodiversity 0aenvironmental heterogeneity1 aWamser, Sabine1 aWolters, Volkmar1 aBirkhofer, Klaus0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.108-112dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2010.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100614b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03584naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100001500173245008900188300001600277500002400293500001500317520189800332650001602230650001002246650002902256650001502285650001702300650002202317650002102339650001202360650002302372650002302395650001202418650002602430650001702456650001802473650001802491650002602509650001102535650002202546650002602568650002402594650002402618651001102642653001702653700002102670700001602691773011102707852000902818856008602827930003302913945002502946946001102971655001202982IND4435188120221123020254.0100409e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443518812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2010.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aF130 0aJ2001 aYassir, I.10aSecondary succession after fire in Imperata grasslands of East Kalimantan, Indonesia  ap. 172-182.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRegeneration of grassland areas is becoming increasingly important, not only to create new secondary forest and recover the original biodiversity, but also recover for agriculture. We studied an early succession in Imperata grasslands in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, using plots that last burned 3 years, 4 years and 9 years previously on, secondary and primary forest. The species coverage data were analyzed using CANOCO. While Imperata decreases, the average percentage of shrubs and young trees clearly increases with time. In the burned plots, Melastoma malabathricum, Eupatorium inulaefolium, Ficus sp., and Vitex pinnata L. strongly increase with the age of regeneration, but these species were rare in the secondary forest. Texture strongly influenced regeneration: soils with more than 50% sand had a slower development towards secondary forest. The number of species was lower in the more sandy soils. The latter showed a stronger increase with time of Pteridium aquilinum L., which appears to slow down the subsequent vegetation development. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of the environmental gradient and vegetation showed that pH, bulk density, sand and clay are the factors influencing the distribution of species. CCA showed also that soil properties had a strong influence on vegetation composition. M. malabathricum, V. pinnata L., Lycopodium cernum, Vernonia arborea Buch.-Ham., Dicranopteris linearis are all species associated with high levels of exchangeable Al and low pH. Imperata grasslands are not a final and stable stage of land degradation, but, when not maintained by frequent fires and human disturbances, regenerate spontaneously and rapidly to secondary forest. The introduction of native shrubs and trees will speed up this process. Recovery for agriculture has not been studied but should not pose major problems under management system without fire. 3asandy soils 3atrees 3aanthropogenic activities 3agrasslands 3abulk density 3asecondary forests 3aland restoration 3asoil pH 3aprescribed burning 3atemporal variation 3agrasses 3abotanical composition 3asoil texture 3asand fraction 3aclay fraction 3aexchangeable aluminum 3ashrubs 3aplant communities 3aecological succession 3aPteridium aquilinum 3aImperata cylindrica 3aBorneo 0abiodiversity1 avan der Kamp, J.1 aBuurman, P.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.172-182dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2010.02.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100614b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02392naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008300130300001500213500001500228520084300243650001601086650001401102650001801116650001801134650002101152650001001173650001101183650001801194650001301212650002701225650001601252650001701268650001801285650002301303650001801326650000901344650002401353650001801377650001301395650002201408650001501430650002101445653002501466653002501491653001901516653003101535653002101566653002301587653002301610700001401633773008901647852000901736930003301745945001301778946001101791655001201802IND2207513620221123020434.0001026s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220751362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomalavalli, N.10aIn vitro micropropagation of Gymnema sylvestre--a multipurpose medicinal plant  ap. 97-105.  a2019-12-05  aThe nature of the explant, seedling age, medium type, plant growth regulators, complex extracts (casein hydrolysate, coconut milk, malt extract and yeast extract) and antioxidants (activated charcoal, ascorbic acid, citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone) markedly influenced in vitro propagation of Gymnema sylvestre.

We evaluated the recovery of native rangeland vegetation and soils subjected to summer patch burns in continuously and rotationally grazed pastures in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Each year, 12% of each treatment replicate was burned as a single patch in a different, non-adjacent area under continuous grazing, and as a single paddock of a rotationally grazed 8-pasture-1-herd system. Recovery of vegetation and soils on burned patches were measured annually until the summer of 2006 and compared to those in immediately adjacent unburned areas in both grazing treatments. Herbaceous cover and biomass took 2 years to recover to control levels on soils with greater mesquite cover and more C₃ grasses, and 3 years on soils with more C₄ grasses. The rotational grazing treatment had less bare ground and lower soil temperatures on both unburned and burned areas than the continuously grazed treatment, which has significant implications for infiltration rates, runoff and erosion in favor of the rotational management. Soil C and C to N ratios were also higher with rotational grazing. Soil physical parameters were not affected by either the burn or grazing treatments but the presence of trees reduced soil temperature, improved soil physical parameters and infiltration rate relative to open grassland. 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil temperature 3afire ecology 3avegetation cover 3aseasonal variation 3aC3 plants 3asoil chemical properties 3adry matter accumulation 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aprescribed burning 3arunoff 3arange management 3aC4 plants 3abotanical composition 3arotational grazing 3agrazing management 3ashrubs 3arangelands 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3asoil erosion 3aTexas 0agrazing 0asoil physical properties 0avegetation1 aDowhower, S.L.1 aBaker, Sa.1 aAnsley, R.J.1 aKreuter, U.P.1 aConover, D.M.1 aWaggoner, J.A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.113-123dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2010.01.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02049naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245008400154300002000238520123000258650002601488650002501514650002001539700001901559700001501578773009801593852000901691930003301700945001301733946001301746655001201759IND2056636520221123003430.0970421e199611  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205663652DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, N.G.10aEnhanced thermogenesis during recovery from diet-induced weight gain in the rat  ap. R1380-R1387.  aThe present study examined the contribution of energy expenditure to the recovery of body weight after a period of overfeeding. Three groups of 2-mo-old female rats (n = 24) were fed, respectively, a 10% (wt/wt)-fat diet (control), a 35% (wt/wt)-fat diet (high fat) or were force fed 130% of the control diet (tube fed). After 30 days, all groups received the control diet for 18 days of recovery. Both overfeeding protocols significantly increased weight above control levels. This difference disappeared after 7 days of recovery. Increases in resting oxygen consumption, serum 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and the thermogenic response to norepinephrine were observed at the end of overfeeding. Serum T3 and resting oxygen consumption returned to control levels by day 3 of recovery from overfeeding, whereas the thermogenic response to norepinephrine required 9 days to recover. Whereas total energy expenditure was not significantly elevated during overfeeding, significant increases of 9.6 and 13.9% were observed in the formerly high-fat and tube-fed animals respectively, during recovery. These data indicate that changes in energy expenditure play an important role in maintaining the stability of body weight. 3adiet-related diseases 3anutrition physiology 3ahuman nutrition1 aLevitsky, D.A.1 aStrupp, B.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1996 Nov., v. 271, no. 5:pt.2 p.R1380-R1387x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03523naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245014300173300001600316500025600332520182400588650001002412650001802422650001802440650001202458650001102470650001302481650001302494650002202507650001502529650001802544650001202562650002302574650001702597650001802614650001102632650001402643650001902657650001602676650001402692650001102706650002002717700001502737700002402752700001902776773013702795856005502932961000902987852000902996655001203005IND60698312520221123003243.0200612s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069831252DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1257.182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurtana, G.

In this research, the effects of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide on ion contents and lipid peroxidation levels of pepper callus tissues under salt stress were investigated. Hypocotyl explants from 4- week-old pepper seedlings were cultivated with 1:1 mg L‑1 2,4-D: Kinetin to form callus. Afterward, 100 μM H(2)O(2), 100 μM SNP (NO donor) and their combinations with 150 mM NaCl were applied for 48 h. Changes in ion and MDA (lipid peroxidation) contents were examined in calluses. In salt treated callus, while Na+ contents of tissues were induced, Ca2+ and K+ levels were lowered. Na+ intake was less in H(2)O(2)+150 mM NaCl, SNP+150 mM NaCl, and H(2)O(2)+SNP+150 mM NaCl treatments when compared with only salt treatment while there was no significant difference in K+ contents. The lowest Na+ content was found in SNP+150 mM NaCl when these 3 groups were compared with each other. The lipid peroxidation levels of pepper calli was increased under salt stress conditions. For the groups that had H(2)O(2) and NO applied, one by one or in combination, it was seen that lipid peroxidation level decreased when compared to the groups that were treated only with salt. When H(2)O(2)+150 mM NaCl, SNP+150 mM NaCl, and H(2)O(2)+SNP+150 mM NaCl treatments were compared with each other, the lowest MDA content was found in H(2)O(2)+SNP+150 mM NaCl treatment. The derived data shows that hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide is given together with salt have healing effects when applied even one by one or together. 3a2,4-D 3aabscisic acid 3abiotic stress 3acalcium 3acallus 3aethylene 3aexplants 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypocotyls 3ajasmonic acid 3akinetin 3alipid peroxidation 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3apepper 3apotassium 3asalicylic acid 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3asodium 3asodium chloride1 aSonmez, K.1 aEllialtioglu, S.

In this research ‘Meridien F1’ and ‘San Moreno F1’ cultivars and Hoagland nutrient solution as a hydroponic growing system were used. Salt applications have been started from the period which plants have 4-5 true leaves and continued to harvested time. The salinity of the nutrient solution in the containers has been set up as EC = Control (1.4), 6, 8 and 10 dS m(‑1). Trial coincidence plots were established with 3 replications and at each repetition including 2 cultivars (‘Meridien F1’ and ‘San Moreno F1’) and 4 different salt concentrations (EC = control, 6, 8 and 10 dS m(‑1)) were applied. A total of 24 experimental plots in all, a total of 384 plants were grown in 16 plants in each plot and the entire trial. Spinach leaf color measurements were performed using the Hunter Lab D25LT instrument. Color parameters measured with the instrument; color (darkness-aperture) brightness (L*) and color coordinates (a* and b*). The measurements were carried out in 3 replicates using 3 different plants in each plot and choosing the most advanced leaf from each plant. According to obtained results; while the differences between the values of brightness (L*) and b values of leaves of the ‘Meridian F1’ and ‘San Moreno F1’ cultivars against salt stress were found to be significant with respect to 1%, a* values were statistically insignificant. It was determined that the mean L* value (24,37) of the ‘Meridien F1’ leaves was closer to the dark than the one of ‘San Moreno F1’ (24,99). Leaf color of the cultivars was determined as green (-a). ‘Meridien F1’ (-5,82) was found to be greener than ‘San Moreno F1’ (-5,71). The leaf color b* value of the cultivars was measured as yellow (b+) and the b + (yellow) values (6.20) of the leaves of the ‘San Moreno F1’ cultivars were higher. The color brightness (L*) and color coordinates (a* and b*) were statistically significant at 1% level against increasing salt addition to the control application. According to this, with respect to the control application (1.4 dS m(‑1)), the increase of the salt concentration and the brightness values of the leaves (L*) were found to be colored. With salt application, green color values (-a) of leaves were lower than control, while yellow color value (b+) was increased. 3aadverse effects 3aclimate 3acolor 3acontainers 3acultivars 3ahumidity 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3anutrient solutions 3asalinity 3asalt concentration 3asalt stress 3aspinach 3atemperature1 aArin, L.1 aCabi, E.1 aTugrul, B.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1257 p.109-114dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1257.16  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245007300185300001400258520132800272650001601600650001001616650002101626650001101647650001501658650001901673650001401692650001801706650002101724650002701745650002401772651002101796653002001817653001501837653001201852773013201864852000901996856008502005930003302090946001102123655001202134IND4433935720221122194136.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443393572DNAL7 a192663012pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0813-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarabork, Hakan 10aSelection of appropriate sampling stations in a lake through mapping  ap. 27-40.  aMuch valuable information is obtained from water quality measurements and monitoring of lakes around the world. A powerful tool is the use of mapping techniques, as it offers potential use in water quality research. Both remote sensing techniques and traditional water quality monitoring are required to collect data at sampling stations. This study suggests another approach to determine the most appropriate distribution of sampling stations in water reservoirs that will be mapped for water quality parameters. Tests were conducted for the proposed approach for Secchi disc depth (SDD), chlorophyll-a, turbidity and suspended solids parameters in Lake Beysehir, Turkey. Results of analysis are available for a total of 30 sampling stations in August 2006. Ten sampling stations were used to model Lake Beysehir while the others were used for validation of the model. Sampling stations that offered the best representation of the lake for each parameter were determined. Then, the best representative sampling stations for all parameters in the study were determined. Moreover, in order to confirm the accuracy of these re-determined sampling stations, modelling was performed on the results of the analysis of June 2006, and it was found that the values obtained from the re-determined sampling stations were acceptable. 3achlorophyll 3alakes 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aModels, Theoretical 3aTurkey (country) 0aSampling method 0aLake water 0aMapping0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Apr., v. 163, no. 1-4 p.27-40dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0813-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01553naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245008000170300001600250520055900266650001400825650000900839650000900848650001000857650001600867650001100883651001200894653001400906653001500920700002500935773010500960852000901065856008501074930003301159946001101192655001201203IND4436372420221122194122.0100430e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443637242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-009-0149-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Jørgen G. 12aA new, dwarf species of Grammonus (Teleostei: Bythitidae) found off Vietnam  ap. 189-192.  aA new species of the viviparous fish genus Grammonus (Ophidiiformes: Bythitidae) is described, based on two ripe males, 32-55 mm SL.

A comparison with the nine hitherto described Grammonus species shows them to be clearly distinct from other species. Except for G. ater, G. minutus differs from all other species by having either more or fewer dorsal (75-76) and anal (54-55) fin rays.

  1 aNoah, K.S.10aSurfactin production from potato process effluent by Bacillus subtilis in a chemostat  ap. 465-474.  aThe biosurfactant surfactin has potential to aid in the recovery of energy resources (oil recovery) or subsurface organic contaminants (environmental remediation). However, high medium and purification costs limit its use in these high-volume applications. In previous work, we showed that surfactin could be produced from an inexpensive low-solids potato process effluent with minimal amendments or pretreatments. Previous research has also shown that surfactin can be both produced in Bacillus subtilis cultures and recovered by foam fractionation in an airlift reactor. Results using both purified potato starch and unamended low-solids potato process effluent as substrates for surfactin production indicate that the process is oxygen limited and that recalcitrant indigenous bacteria in the potato process effluent hamper continuous surfactin production. The research reported here features the use of a chemostat operated in batch mode for producing surfactin with concomitant use of antifoam to prevent surfactant loss. The antifoam did not interfere with surfactin recovery by acid precipitation or its efficacy. Initial trials took about 48 h to produce 0.9 g/L of surfactin from potato process effluent. Increasing the oxygen mass transfer by increasing the stirring speed and adding a baffle decreased production time to 12-24 h and produced about 0.6 g/L of surfactin from two different potato-processing facilities. 3asurfactants 3abiological production1 aBruhn, D.F.1 aBala, G.A.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.465-474x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060415b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle03102naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001600143245009300159300001400252500001500266520199500281650001902276650001202295650001002307650001502317650001902332653002702351700001502378700002402393700001602417773012102433852000902554856008302563930003302646945001302679946001302692990002302705655001202728IND2046145720221122093442.0950522e199504  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204614572DNAL7 a10.1002/jmor.10522401102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyuela, M.10aUltrastructurally different muscle cell types in Eisenia foetida (Annelida, Oligochaeta)  ap. 87-96.  a2019-12-04  aMuscles in the body wall, intestinal wall, and contractile hemolymphatic vessels (pseudohearts) of an oligochaete annelid (Eisenia foetida) were studied by electron microscopy. The muscle cells in all locations, except for the outer layer of the pseudohearts, are variants of obliquely striated muscle cells. Cells comprising the circular layer of the body wall possess single, peripherally located myofibrils that occupy most of the cytoplasm and surround other cytoplasmic organelles. The nuclei of the cells lie peripherally to the myofibrils. The sarcomeres consist of thin and thick myofilaments that are arranged in parallel arrays. In one plane of view, the filaments appear to be oriented obliquely to Z bands. Thin myofilaments measure 5-6 nm in diameter. Thick myofilaments are fusiform in shape and their width decreases from their centers (40-45 nm) to their tips (23-25 nm). The thin/thick filament ratio in the A bands is 10. The Z bands consist of Z bars alternating with tubules of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Subsarcolemmal electron-dense plaques are found frequently. The cells forming the longitudinal layer of the body wall musculature are smaller than the cells in the circular layer and their thick filaments are smaller (31-33 nm centrally and 21-23 nm at the tips). Subsarcolemmal plaques are less numerous. The cells forming the heart wall inner layer, the large hemolymphatic vessels, and the intestinal wall are characterized by their large thick myofilaments (50-52 nm centrally and 27-28 nm at the tips) and abundance of mitochondria. The cells forming the outer muscular layer of the pseudohearts are smooth muscle cells. These cells are richer in thick filaments than vertebrate smooth muscle cells. They differ from obliquely striated muscle cells by possessing irregularly distributed electron-dense bodies for filament anchorage rather than sarcomeres and Z bands and by displaying tubules of smooth endoplasmic reticulum among the bundles of myofilaments. 3aEisenia fetida 3amuscles 3acells 3aearthworms 3aultrastructure 0aanatomy and morphology1 aFraile, B.1 aGarcia Anchuelo, R.1 aPanigua, R.0 tJournal of morphology.g1995 Apr., v. 224, no. 1 p.87-96aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmor.10522401103Available from publisher's Web site  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02520naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010500124300001400229500001500243520119900258650002801457650001801485650001801503650001301521650002001534650001801554650001601572650001101588650002301599650001801622650002501640650002301665650001301688650000701701650002101708650001001729650001301739650001101752653003101763653001601794700001501810700001601825700001901841773008801860852000901948930003301957945001301990946001102003655001202014IND2279277520221122093456.0010410s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND227927752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEymar, E.10aEffect of activated charcoal and 6-benzyladenine on in vitro nitrogen uptake by Lagerstroemia indica  ap. 57-65.  a2019-12-05  aA sterile hydroponic culture system suitable for studying nitrogen (N) uptake of Lagerstroemia indica L. in vitro was developed. Four different treatments were assayed: with and without activated charcoal (AC and NAC, respectively), with and without 50 micromolar of 6-benzyladenine (+BA and -BA, respectively). Medium pH, electrical conductivity (EC), NO3(-) and NH4(+) concentrations were measured weekly. At the end of the culture, propagules were sampled and SPAD indices, and shoot and root fresh weights were determined. Explants grown in media with activated charcoal were able to take up both NO3(-) and NH4(+), although NH4(+) uptake was lower. Subsequently the pH of the media was maintained between 5.5-6.0. In treatments with no addition of activated charcoal, NH4(+) uptake was preferential and the pH dropped to 3.1. Explants in these conditions were unable to raise the pH by taking up NO3(-), especially when root morphogenesis was inhibited by addition of BA. Supply of this PGR produced root growth inhibition, which was almost complete in the treatment without activated charcoal. This component significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of 50 micromolar BA on root growth. 3aelectrical conductivity 3adose response 3amorphogenesis 3aexplants 3anutrient uptake 3aculture media 3ahydroponics 3adosage 3aammonium compounds 3abenzyladenine 3aLagerstroemia indica 3anutrient solutions 3acharcoal 3apH 3amicropropagation 3aroots 3anitrates 3ashoots 0amurashige and skoog medium 0amethodology1 aAlegre, J.1 aToribio, M.1 aLopez-Vela, D.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 63, no. 1 p.57-65x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02308naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002300127245011300150300001800263520132200281650001601603650001801619650001101637650002001648650001701668650002301685650002301708700001701731700001701748700001501765773009801780852000901878930003301887945002501920946001301945655001201958IND4372793820221122095218.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437279382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLaureano-Perez, L.10aUnderstanding factors that limit enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass: characterization of pretreated corn stover  ap. 1081-1100.  aSpectroscopic characterization of both untreated and treated material is being performed in order to determine changes in the biomass and the effects of pretreatment on crystallinity, lignin content, selected chemical bonds, and depolymerization of hemicellulose and lignin. The methods used are X-ray diffraction for determination of cellulose crystallinity (CrI); diffusive reflectance infrared (DRIFT) for changes in C-C and C-O bonds; and fluorescence to determine lignin content. Changes in spectral characteristics and crystallinity are statistically correlated with enzymatic hydrolysis results to identify and better understand the fundamental features of biomass that govern its enzymatic conversion to monomeric sugars. Models of the hydrolysis initial rate and 72 h extent of conversion were developed and evaluated. Results show that the hydrolysis initial rate is most influenced by the cellulose crystallinity, while lignin content most influences the extent of hydrolysis at 72 h. However, it should be noted that in this study only crystallinity, lignin, and selected chemical bonds were used as inputs to the models. The incorporation of additional parameters that affect the hydrolysis, like pore volume and size and surface area accessibility, would improve the predictive capability of the models. 3acorn stover 3abioprocessing 3alignin 3acrystallization 3apretreatment 3aethanol production 3astatistical models1 aTeymouri, F.1 aAlizadeh, H.1 aDale, B.E.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.1081-1100x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060415b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle02960naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011600125300001400241500001500255520155000270650001801820650001801838650002001856650001801876650001601894650002501910650002601935650001501961650002101976650001101997650001602008650001402024650002102038650002502059650001002084650001802094650001902112650001102131653002502142653000902167653002702176653001802203700001802221700001802239700001902257773008802276852000902364930003302373945001302406946001102419655001202430IND2279277220221122095228.0010410s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND227927722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorini, S.10aEffect of 2,4-d and light quality on callus production and differentiation from in vitro cultured quince leaves  ap. 47-55.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) concentration, length of induction period and light quality on leaf regeneration of quince clone BA 29 were investigated. After 2, 4 or 6 days of induction with 2.5 mg l-1 or 5.0 mg l-1 2,4-D, leaves were cultured under red, blue, red+blue, far-red+blue, white, far-red light or darkness conditions. Leaves thereby treated showed different responses, with respect to somatic embryogenesis, callus, red-nodular structures or roots. Callus production increased with increasing 2,4-D concentration and induction period, although it was not influenced by light quality; the only exception was far-red+blue light, which reduced callusing response. This result suggested involvement of the blue-absorbing photoreceptor system in the callus formation processes. A high regeneration of red-nodular structures with a meristematic appearance was also observed; from some histological characterizations, we presumed they were adventitious buds that were arrested at an early developmental stage. Red-nodular structures increased with decreasing 2,4-D concentration and induction period. In the regeneration of such structures, the blue-absorbing photoreceptor system appeared to have a negative effect but only at a low photoequilibrium value. In contrast, light quality which activated phytochrome induced an increment in regeneration, but the response did not vary for photoequilibrium values ranging from 0.43 to 0.86. For root regeneration, phytochrome seemed to be the only photoreceptor involved. 3afar-red light 3adose response 3aCydonia oblonga 3amorphogenesis 3awhite light 3adevelopmental stages 3asomatic embryogenesis 3ablue light 3aplant morphology 3aleaves 3amethodology 3ared light 3amicropropagation 3acell differentiation 3a2,4-D 3aculture media 3aphotoreceptors 3acallus 0aregenerative ability 0adark 0ared-nodular structures 0aplant anatomy1 aD'Onofrio, C.1 aBellocchi, G.1 aFisichella, M.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 63, no. 1 p.47-55x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02124naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001200127245010000139300001800239520133600257650002001593650002301613700001401636700001801650773009801668852000901766930003301775945002501808946001301833655001201846IND4372793520221122072612.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437279352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhu, Y.10aOptimization of dilute-acid pretreatment of corn stover using a high-solids percolation reactor  ap. 1045-1054.  aWe have previously demonstrated that pretreatment of corn stover with dilute sulfuric acid can achieve high digestibility and efficient recovery of hemicellulose sugars with high yield and concentration. Further improvement of this process was sought in this work. A modification was made in the operation of the percolation reactor that the reactor is preheated under atmospheric pressure to remove moisture that causes autohydrolysis. This eliminated sugar decomposition during the preheating stage and led to a considerable improvement in overall sugar yield. In addition, liquid throughput was minimized to the extent that only one reactor void volume of liquid was collected. This was done to attain a high xylose concentration in the hydrolyzate. The optimum reaction and operating conditions were identified wherein near quantitative enzymatic digestibilities are obtained with enzyme loading of 15 FPU/g glucan. With a reduced enzyme loading of 5 FPU/g glucan, the enzymatic digestibility was decreased, but still reached a level of 92%. Decomposition of carbohydrates was extremely low as indicated by the measured glucan and xylan mass closures (recovered sugar plus unreacted) which were 98% and 94%, respectively. The data obtained in this work indicate that the digestibility is related to the extent of xylan removal. 3aacid hydrolysis 3aethanol production1 aLee, Y.Y.1 aElander, R.T.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.1045-1054x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060415b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle02279naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245008900167300001600256500001500272520088900287650003101176650001801207650001101225650001601236650002301252650002401275650001801299650002101317650001401338653002301352653002201375653002101397653002701418653002601445653004301471653001901514700001501533700001601548773011201564852000901676856009201685930003301777946001101810655001201821IND4436583120221122072637.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443658312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02277.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowkiw, A.10aPotential of Eurasian poplar rust to overcome a major quantitative resistance factor  ap. 523-534.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of RUS, a major quantitative resistance (QR) factor inherited from Populus trichocarpa, was assessed in two Populus deltoides x P. trichocarpa F₁ progenies against eight isolates of Melampsora larici-populina, the causal agent of Eurasian poplar rust. Six isolates were identified on which RUS had no significant effect. The first RUS-defeating isolate identified suggested a pre-existing potential to overcome RUS in the pathogen's populations. The P. deltoides genetic background made no difference either to the ability of a given isolate to overcome RUS or to the relative and absolute aggressiveness of the isolates. This study illustrates how extreme the isolate-specificity of QR can be. It also yields insights into the relationship between size of uredinia and sporulation rate, discussing the epidemiological significance of spore production per mm² uredinium. 3aMelampsora larici-populina 3arust diseases 3aspores 3asporulation 3agenetic background 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3apathogenicity 3aPopulus generosa 3apathogens 0aresistance erosion 0aparasitic fitness 0asporulation rate 0aPopulus interamericana 0aresistance durability 0aPopulus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa 0apre-adaptation1 aVoisin, E.1 aBastien, C.0 tPlant pathology.g2010 June, v. 59, no. 3 p.523-534dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02277.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02475naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001200143245022100155300001600376500001500392520125900407650001801666650002301684650000901707650001401716650002601730653002701756700001601783700001701799773012301816852000901939856008301948930003302031945001302064946001302077990002302090655001202113IND2049300620221122043532.0951221e199512  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204930062DNAL7 a10.1002/jmor.10522603102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Y.10aMorphology of the tibial organs of acrididae: comparison of subgenual and distal organs in fore-, mid-, and hindlegs of Schistocerca gregaria (Acrididae, Catantophinae) and Locusta migratoria (Acrididae, Oedipodinae)  ap. 351-360.  a2019-12-04  aThe structure of the complex tibial organs in the fore-, mid-, and hindlegs of two grasshopper species, Schistocerca gregaria (Acrididae, Catantopinae) and Locusta migratoria (Acrididae, Oedipodinae), is described. In each leg the tibial organs consist of two scolopale organs: the subgenual organ and the distal organ. Both organs are located in the hemolymph channel. The subgenual organ has a sail-like structure, and its scolopidia are oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the leg. The number of scolopidia in the subgenual organs is lower in Locusta migratoria than in Schistocerca gregaria. The scolopidia of the distal organ are clearly separated from those of the subgenual organ and lie parallel with the long axis of the legs. They insert distally on an attachment plate that lies in the hemolymph channel. The subgenual organs and the distal organs are smaller in the hindlegs than in the fore- and midlegs, and this difference is especially pronounced in Locusta migratoria. The complex tibial organ of Locusta and Schistocerca is very similar in structure and cellular composition with that of Periplaneta (Blattidae). In tettigoniids and gryllids the distal organ is differentiated into an intermediate organ and the crista acoustica. 3aanimal organs 3aLocusta migratoria 3alegs 3areceptors 3aSchistocerca gregaria 0aanatomy and morphology1 aRossler, W.1 aKalmring, L.0 tJournal of morphology.g1995 Dec., v. 226, no. 3 p.351-360aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmor.10522603103Available from publisher's Web site  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02054naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014800129300001600277500001500293520090300308650001901211650001701230650001601247650001501263650001301278650001601291650001201307650002101319650001801340650002801358650001201386653001601398700001601414700001601430700001401446700001601460773009001476852000901566930003301575945001301608946001101621655001201632IND2207036320221122043421.0001003s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220703632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdullah, M.A.10aStrategies to overcome foaming and wall-growth during the cultivation of Morinda elliptica cell suspension culture in a stirred-tank bioreactor  ap. 205-212.  a2019-12-05  aStrategies to overcome foaming and wall-growth during the cultivation of Morinda elliptica (Rubiaceae) cell suspension cultures in a stirred-tank bioreactor are described. Of all the strategies applied, only bubble-free aeration was successful in eliminating foaming by 100%. Despite the foaming effect of around 40% in G medium strategy with 0.012% (v/v) antifoam, the maximum dry cell weight attained (19.2 g l-1) and anthraquinone (AQ) content (4.0 mg g-1 DW) was nearly three times higher than that achieved in cultivation using 0.025% (v/v) antifoam. For continuous cell growth, the effect of inoculum age should also be considered when anti-foam is to be added. P medium strategy, without antifoam addition, not only promoted both growth (18 g l-1) and AQ production (9.8 mg g-1 DW), but also resulted in lower foaming and wall-growth (below 30% level), and higher foaming reduction (30-40%). 3aanthraquinones 3abiosynthesis 3acell growth 3acell walls 3aaeration 3abioreactors 3aMorinda 3amicropropagation 3aculture media 3acell suspension culture 3afoaming 0amethodology1 aAriff, A.B.1 aMarziah, M.1 aAli, A.M.1 aLajis, N.H.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 60, no. 3 p.205-212x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03416naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012400173300001800297520170700315650002602022650002102048650002702069650002602096650002602122650002702148650002602175650002902201650002902230650002602259650001002285650001202295650001102307650001002318650002402328650001102352650001602363650001402379650002602393650001602419650003302435650002302468650002002491700002302511700002402534700002802558700002002586773011102606852000902717856009202726930003302818946001102851655001202862IND4404903220221122012027.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06355.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranger, Kévin14aThe antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function  ap. 2008-2020.  aTrappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. Secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. We found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 μ m, has significant activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, in addition to P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. A similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 A62D/M63L, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. Furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to NaCl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. This enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. Thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms. 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aCandida albicans 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aMoraxella catarrhalis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3afungi 3aheparin 3ahumans 3alungs 3amechanism of action 3amucosa 3aneutrophils 3apathogens 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aserine proteinases 3asodium chloride1 aZani, Marie-Louise1 aChandenier, Jacques1 aDallet-Choisy, Sandrine1 aMoreau, Thierry0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 9 p.2008-2020dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06355.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02950naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245016200170300001800332520153800350650002401888650000801912650002901920650002301949650001401972650002101986650001502007650002302022650001202045650003902057650003302096700002102129700002202150700002202172700002002194700002102214700002502235773011102260852000902371856009202380930003302472946001102505655001202516IND4404903420221122012346.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06357.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshii, Satomi10aInteraction between Lim15/Dmc1 and the homologue of the large subunit of CAF-1 - a molecular link between recombination and chromatin assembly during meiosis  ap. 2032-2041.  aIn eukaryotes, meiosis leads to genetically variable gametes through recombination between homologous chromosomes of maternal and paternal origin. Chromatin organization following meiotic recombination is critical to ensure the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes into gametes. However, the mechanism of chromatin organization after meiotic recombination is unknown. In this study we report that the meiosis-specific recombinase Lim15/Dmc1 interacts with the homologue of the largest subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) in the basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea (Coprinus cinereus). Using C. cinerea LIM15/DMC1 (CcLIM15) as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have isolated the C. cinerea homologue of Cac1, the largest subunit of CAF-1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and named it C. cinerea Cac1-like (CcCac1L). Two-hybrid assays confirmed that CcCac1L binds CcLim15 in vivo. β-Galactosidase assays revealed that the N-terminus of CcCac1L preferentially interacts with CcLim15. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that these proteins also interact in the crude extract of meiotic cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, during meiosis, CcCac1L interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a component of the DNA synthesis machinery recently reported as an interacting partner of Lim15/Dmc1. Taken together, these results suggest a novel role of the CAF-1-PCNA complex in meiotic events. We propose that the CAF-1-PCNA complex modulates chromatin assembly following meiotic recombination. 3aCoprinopsis cinerea 3aDNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abeta-galactosidase 3achromatin 3aeukaryotic cells 3agerm cells 3alinkage (genetics) 3ameiosis 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aKoshiyama, Akiyo1 aHamada, Fumika N.1 aNara, Takayuki Y.1 aIwabata, Kazuki1 aSakaguchi, Kengo1 aNamekawa, Satoshi H.0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 9 p.2032-2041dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06357.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01862naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001200127245013600139300001500275520101100290650003201301650001701333650002101350700001301371700001301384773009501397852000901492930003301501945002501534946001301559655001201572IND4372785020221122012633.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437278502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

T. reesei produced a high total cellulase titer (1.7 filter paper units [FPU]/mL, filter paper activity) in medium containing 10 g/L of manure (dry basis [w/w]), 2 g/L KH2PO4, 2 mL/L of Tween-80, and 2mg/L of CoCl2. However, beta-glucosidase activity in the T. reesei-enzyme system was very low. T. reesei was then cocultured with A. phoenicis to enhance the beta-glucosidase level. The mixed culture resulted in a relatively high level of total cellulase (1.54 FPU/mL) and beta-glucosidase (0.64 IU/mL). The ratio of beta-glucosidase activity to filter paper activity was 0.41, suitable for hydrolyzing manure cellulose. The crude enzyme broth from the mixed culture was used for hydrolyzing the manure cellulose, and the produced glucose was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than levels obtained by using the commercial enzyme or the enzyme broth of the pure culture T. reesei. 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3adairy manure 3abeta-glucosidase1 aLiao, W.1 aChen, S.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.93-104x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060415b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle03018naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245010500176300001800281520188500299650001202184650003102196650001902227650001102246650002302257650002202280650001702302700002302319700002002342700002002362700001802382773011102400852000902511856009202520930003302612946001102645655001202656IND4404903320221122012119.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490332DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06356.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Moustaine, Driss10aFull-length prion protein aggregates to amyloid fibrils and spherical particles by distinct pathways  ap. 2021-2031.  aAs limited structural information is available on prion protein (PrP) misfolding and aggregation, a causative link between the specific (supra)molecular structure of PrP and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies remains to be elucidated. In this study, high pressure was utilized, as an approach to perturb protein structure, to characterize different morphological and structural PrP aggregates. It was shown that full-length recombinant PrP undergoes β-sheet aggregation on high-pressure-induced destabilization. By tuning the physicochemical conditions, the assembly process evolves through two distinct pathways leading to the irreversible formation of spherical particles or amyloid fibrils, respectively. When the PrP aggregation propensity is enhanced, high pressure induces the formation of a partially unfolded aggregated protein, AggHP, which relaxes at ambient pressure to form amorphous aggregates. The latter largely retain the native secondary structure. On prolonged incubation at high pressure, followed by depressurization, AggHP transforms to a monodisperse population of spherical particles of about 20 nm in diameter, characterized by an essentially β-sheet secondary structure. When the PrP aggregation propensity is decreased, an oligomeric reaction intermediate, IHP, is formed under high pressure. After pressure release, IHP relaxes to the original native structure. However, on prolonged incubation at high pressure and subsequent depressurization, it transforms to amyloid fibrils. Structural evaluation, using optical spectroscopic methods, demonstrates that the conformation adopted by the subfibrillar oligomeric intermediate, IHP, constitutes a necessary prerequisite for the formation of amyloids. The use of high-pressure perturbation thus provides an insight into the molecular mechanism of the first stages of PrP misfolding into amyloids. 3aamyloid 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprion diseases 3aprions 3aprotein aggregates 3aprotein structure 3aspectroscopy1 aPerrier, Veronique1 aSmeller, Laszlo1 aLange, Reinhard1 aTorrent, Joan0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 9 p.2021-2031dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06356.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01591naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009600169300001800265520063200283650002000915650003700935650002600972700002900998700001701027773011201044852000901156856009201165930003301257946001101290655001201301IND4404901620221122000212.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06405.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarner, Neil10aAnalysis of EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase substrate specificity using peptide-based arrays  ap. 2561-2573.  aEph receptor tyrosine kinases regulate many important biological processes.

In urban economics in particular, this increasing interest stems mainly from the fact that QoL affects urban competitiveness and urban growth: research shows that when households and businesses decide where to locate, QoL considerations can play a very important role. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the way economic literature and urban economic literature in particular, have adopted QoL considerations in the economic thinking. Moreover, it presents the ways various studies have attempted to capture the multidimensional nature of the concept, and quantify it for the purposes of empirical research. Conclusions are drawn on the state of affairs regarding the study of QoL in economics, as well as the problems of measurement arising mainly from the complex nature of the concept. 3aquality of life 3aurban economics1 aBiagi, Bianca 1 aRoyuela Mora, Vicente.0 tSocial indicators research.g2007 Oct., v. 84, no. 1 p.1-25dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0303-83007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-006-9071-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100101b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02264naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024007200110040001800182100001900200245010200219300001600321500001500337520073900352650002801091650001101119650001101130650002001141650001901161650001501180650001201195650003601207650002101243650001101264650001101275650002501286650001901311653002401330653002001354653002701374700001601401700001601417773012401433852000901557856012201566930003301688945001301721946001301734990002301747655001201770IND2053348920221122000833.0961002e199609  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205334892DNAL7 a87658092pmid7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199609)229:3<309::AID-JMOR5>3.0.CO;2-T2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu Plessis, L.10aUltrastructure of buffalo, Syncerus caffer, platelets: comparison with bovine and human platelets  ap. 309-314.  a2019-12-04  aPlatelets are found in the blood of all mammals and serve the same basic hemostatic functions in all.

Reduction in the number of hardwoods in the stand (hardwood density reduction) was greater with the pellet on soils with more than 60% sand, while the liquid formulation was most efficacious for finely textured soils. Hardwood density reduction with the pellet was negatively correlated with percent silt, clay, soil organic matter, and cation exchange capacity, and positively correlated with percent sand. With foliar sprays, hardwood density reduction was positively correlated with hexazinone rate and negatively correlated with soil pH. Pine mortality was positively correlated to percent sand with the pellet and negatively correlated to soil pH with broadcast sprays. Regression models incorporating pine height, herbicide rate, soil texture, cation exchange capacity, soil organic matter, and acidity could explain up to 78% of the variation in hardwood density change and 77% of the variation in pine mortality. Selective control of hardwoods in young loblolly pine stands is a function of hexazinone rate, formulation, and various soil factors. 3aPinus taeda 3ahexazinone 3apesticide application 3aphysicochemical properties 3ahardwood 3aAlabama 3aVirginia 3aNorth Carolina 3aTexas 3aMississippi 3aGeorgia 0aherbicide formulations1 aZutter, B.R.1 aGjerstad, D.H.0 tWeed science.g1988 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.399-405x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880701c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02310naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245013300178300001600311500001500327520116800342650001401510650001301524650001701537650001501554650002601569650002101595650001501616650002201631650001601653650002601669651001301695653001501708653002501723700001601748773006901764852000901833930003301842946001301875655001201888IND8802234420221121230734.0880701e198805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880223442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

'Centurk 78' suppressed barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv. #3 ECHCG] more than 'Bennett' and 'Eagle' in the growing wheat and after wheat harvest in July, but there were no differences in weed yield among cultivars in corn planted 11 months later. Herbicides applied to the tillering wheat in early April improved weed control in wheat and the subsequent corn crop. Also, herbicides were applied 5, 25, 45, and 300 days after wheat harvest. Weed growth increased and soil water decreased as spraying dates were delayed. Herbicides applied 5 days after harvest did not maintain adequate weed control in the corn planted 11 months after wheat harvest and low corn yield resulted. Plots receiving herbicides 300 days after wheat harvest had the least soil water in the fall after wheat harvest but the best weed control in corn and highest corn yields because of better weed control in corn. 3acultivars 3aZea mays 3aweed control 3ano-tillage 3apesticide application 3acultural control 3ametribuzin 3aTriticum aestivum 3ametolachlor 3acrop-weed competition 3aNebraska 0aecofarming 0aconservation tillage1 aWicks, G.A.0 tWeed science.g1988 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.394-398x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a20110803b20110902c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02806naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245019600124300001600320500001500336520138100351650001601732650002101748650002601769650001601795650002001811650002401831650001701855650001201872650001801884650001601902650002101918650001601939650001101955650001901966650001001985650001601995650001802011650001102029650001102040653001602051653000902067700001502076700002602091700001502117773009002132852000902222930003302231945001302264946001102277655001202288IND2279261520221121220609.0010410s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND227926152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Y.Y.10aNumber of air exchanges, sucrose concentration, photosynthetic photon flux, and differences in photoperiod and dark period temperatures affect growth of Rehmannia glutinosa plantlets in vitro  ap. 219-226.  a2019-12-05  aRehmannia glutinosa plantlets were cultured for 4 weeks under different culture conditions to determine the optimum environment for in vitro growth and ex vitro survival. Plantlet growth increased with an increasing number of air exchanges of the culture vessel, exhibiting greatest shoot weight, total fresh weight, leaf area, and chlorophyll content at 4.4 h-1 of air exchanges. High sucrose concentration (30 g l-1) increased root weight but reduced shoot growth. Net photosynthetic rates of the plantlets were greatest when sucrose was not added to the medium. On the other hand, ex vitro survival of the plantlets was not influenced by sucrose concentration. In the experiment on difference in photoperiod and dark period temperatures (DIF) and photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), plantlet growth increased as DIF and PPF levels increased. Particularly, increasing PPF level had a more distinctive effect on plantlet growth than increasing DIF level. The interaction of DIF x PPF was also significant, showing the greatest plantlet growth in positive DIF (+8 DIF) and a high PPF (210 micromol m-2 s-1). In conclusion, the results of this experiment suggest that increased number of air exchanges of the culture vessel, decreased sucrose concentration, and positive DIF in combination with high PPF level enhanced growth and acclimatization of Rehmannia glutinosa plantlets. 3atemperature 3ain vitro culture 3aquantitative analysis 3acell growth 3areducing sugars 3aRehmannia glutinosa 3agas exchange 3asucrose 3adose response 3aacclimation 3amicropropagation 3aphotoperiod 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3alight 3achlorophyll 3aculture media 3aleaves 3ashoots 0amethodology 0adark1 aHahn, E.J.1 aKozai, Toyoki,d1943-1 aPaek, K.Y.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 62, no. 3 p.219-226x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01424naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009700172300001600269500002400285520055300309650001100862650001200873650001400885650001100899700002100910700002400931773009400955852000901049856007601058655001201134IND4380988820221121220715.0060613s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438098882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00162.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuVal, Emily H.10aLaughing Falcon (Herpetotheres cachinnans) Predation on Coral Snakes (Micrurus nigrocinctus)  ap. 566-568.  aIncludes references  aLaughing falcon (Herpetotheres cachinnans) predation on coral snakes (Micrurus nigrocinctus) was recorded in two incidents that illustrate previously unreported variation in predatory behavior.

The surface topography of the ground over mining excavations plays a key role in the mechanism of subsidence. When a mining operation is performed beneath mountainous or hilly terrain, it may trigger landslides. This study, therefore, aims to analyse the impacts of underground mining on the stability of slopes by using numerical modelling. A coal mining induced landslide at Nattai North, Australia, is investigated as a typical case study. In this area, mining operations beneath the Sydney Basin escarpments initiated the largest contemporary landslide and mass movement known in Australia (Cunningham, 1988). Discontinuous numerical modelling is employed to analyse the mechanisms of the ground movements leading to this landslide. The role of geological and geotechnical factors, such as rock mass characteristics, bedding, and joints, are discussed through the numerical modelling. The outcomes of the analyses reveal that mining induced stresses lead to the shear and compressive failure of weak strata at the escarpment base, particularly around its toe. The failure of the base materials as well as the caving of the overlaying bedded rocks into the extracted panel, facilitated the detachment of the massive sandstone. This rock column ahead of the escarpment, was overlaying the weak strata. The numerical results also indicate that the aforementioned rock column remained almost unaffected during mining. However, the failure of the weak strata at the toe of the escarpment initiated the simultaneous forward sliding and toppling of the rock column. This mode of failure which is known as ski jump type of failure, was previously observed and explained by Pells et al. (1987).  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3acoal 3aengineering 3alandscapes 3alandslides 3amathematical models 3amountains 3asandstone 3asubsidence 3atopography 3aunderground mining 3aAustralia 0aCoal mining 0aMining subsidence 0aLandslide 0aDEM 0aNattai North1 aNazem, M.1 aKarakus, M.0 tEngineering geology.g2017 Jan. 30, v. 217 p.141-152dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245008700202506007600289520158100365592002801946506003701974650001002011650001502021650001102036650001602047650001102063650002302074650001402097650001602111650001902127650001902146651001102165651000902176651001402185651001502199651001602214651001402230653001802244653002602262653001202288653001402300653002202314773011802336856007302454852000902527655001202536IND60690326120221207095546.0200426e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069032612DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.258512doi7 aPMC40910642pmcid7 a239215452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLev-Yadun, Simcha10aTheoretical and functional complexity of white variegation of unripe fleshy fruits  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn many plant species, the bright colors of ripe fruit serve to attract frugivores to enable efficient seed dispersal. Here I show that the fleshy fruit of several dozens of species originating from Asia (southeastern, eastern and central), the Middle East, Africa, America (South, Central and North), Australia, Polynesia and Micronesia, with fruit usually larger than 1 cm, have white or light green spots while they are still unripe. In many of these species, while the spots are conspicuous, the unripe fruit is known to be poisonous, bitter or sour. I propose that this fruit syndrome may signal frugivores that the fruit is still unripe. Similarly to the succulent leaves of window-plants, these spots form windows that enable light to penetrate deeper into the photosynthetic layers in the developing fruit. This seems to be a solution to overcome the limitations of light harvest because of the high volume to surface ratio of developing fleshy fruits. The white or whitish variegation in these unripe fleshy fruits may serve at least five functions: 1) Windows for photosynthesis, 2) camouflage, 3) signaling to frugivores that they are not ripe (possibly sometimes a type of mutualism with frugivores), 4) signaling to frugivores that they are poisonous - aposematism, and 5) mimicking insect eggs to reduce egg laying. All these functions may be partly or fully simultaneous. Because these white spots appear in plants of diverse geographical and taxonomic origin, it is probably an old adaptation, and such a syndrome has appeared and been selected for many times.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acolor 3afrugivores 3afruits 3ainsect eggs 3aleaves 3amimicry (behavior) 3amutualism 3aoviposition 3aphotosynthesis 3aseed dispersal 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aMicronesia 3aMiddle East 3aPolynesia 0aadvertisement 0aaposematic coloration 0amimicry 0aherbivory 0awhite variegation0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 8, no. 10 p.e25851-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.258513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010100171300001500272520168800287592002801975650001602003650002602019650001402045650001702059650001602076650001502092650002202107650001602129650003102145651001102176653000802187653000902195653000902204653000902213653001302222700001902235700002002254700001802274700002102292700002102313700001802334773008802352856008602440852000902526655001202535IND60547382720221116141900.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054738272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Sheng-Po10aInter-comparison of network measurements of non-methane organic compounds with model simulations  ap. 94-102.  aAmbient levels of total non-methane organic carbons (NMOCs) at air quality stations (AQSs, called AQS NMOCs) are compared with the summed concentrations of 56 NMHCs obtained from the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (called total PAMS). For mutual validation of the two networks, the total PAMS were compared with the AQS NMOCs at four sites on the island of Taiwan for the period 2007–2012. The inter-comparison of total PAMS and AQS NMOCs has been discussed previously, which reported that the total PAMS accounted for approximately 30% of the AQS NMOCs on average (Chen et al., 2014b). In this study, both the observed total PAMS and AQS NMOCs were further compared with the emissions and model simulations for mutual validation.A three-dimensional Eulerian air quality model was used to simulate total PAMS and total VOCs, which were then inter-compared with the observed total PAMS and AQS NMOCs, respectively. We found closely agreeing results between the observed and simulated total PAMS, affirming that the treatment of meteorology and VOC emissions in the model was sufficiently robust. Further, although the modeled VOC data agreed with the AQS NMOC observations for the sites in urban settings, a significant discrepancy existed for the industrial sites, particularly at the concentration spikes. Such a discrepancy was presumably attributed to high emissions of OVOCs from industrial complexes compounded by the lower sensitivity of AQS measurements for OVOCs compared with hydrocarbons. Consequently, using AQS NMOCs to represent ambient VOC levels should be limited to environments where the amounts of OVOCs are relatively small relative to total VOCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aemissions 3ahydrocarbons 3ameteorology 3amonitoring 3asimulation models 3aurban areas 3avolatile organic compounds 3aTaiwan 0aVOC 0aNMOC 0aOVOC 0aPAMS 0aPAMS-AQM1 aSu, Yuan-Chang1 aChiu, Ching-Jui1 aLin, Ching-Ho1 aChang, Julius S.1 aZhang, Zhizhong,1 aWang, Jia-Lin0 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 Dec., v. 122 p.94-102dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010300168300001600271520186200287592002802149650002702177650001702204650001602221650001002237650001202247650001302259650001502272650001002287650001602297650001102313650002202324650002202346650001802368650001102386651001202397700001902409773010902428856008102537852000902618655001202627IND60580367520221120042540.0170916e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058036752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-017-0539-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanks, Lauren K.10aBiomass loss and nutrient release from decomposing aquatic macrophytes: effects of detrital mixing  ap. 881-890.  aAquatic plant decomposition is typically studied on species held separately, whereas diverse plant communities are usually found in lake littoral zones and decomposition occurs as mixtures of multiple species. Here, we examined whether detrital mixing affects the rate of aquatic macrophyte decomposition. Specifically, we measured decomposition rates of detritus from four species (Myriophyllum heterophyllum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Typha × glauca, and Potamogeton robinsii) in single, double, triple, and quadruple species mixtures held over two summer months in a mesotrophic lake in southern Ontario, Canada. We measured detrital mass loss after different time periods for all combinations. There were limited effects of mixing on decomposition rates with inhibitory effects observed in only two of the eleven multi-species mixtures. Decomposition rates of single and mixed species detritus varied with initial C:N and C:P ratios with faster rates seen for more nutrient-rich detritus. Overall, there was no effect of detrital species richness on macrophyte decomposition rates other than smaller differences among the averages of more species-rich mixtures. Our results were inconsistent with interactive effects of mixing on decomposition rates of multiple aquatic plant taxa. Instead, we found decomposition rates of mixed species communities were largely predicted by biomass composition and single-species decomposition estimates. There were also no apparent effects of species mixing on N- or P-specific fluxes or the ratio of these fluxes that resulted during decomposition during our experiment. Our results indicate that future changes in aquatic plant biodiversity may affect rates of decomposition in these ecosystems, but these should be largely predictable based on changes in plant communities and their biomass-weighted stoichiometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratophyllum demersum 3aMyriophyllum 3aPotamogeton 3aTypha 3abiomass 3adetritus 3aecosystems 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3amixing 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3astoichiometry 3asummer 3aOntario1 aFrost, Paul C.0 tAquatic sciences.g2017 Oct., v. 79, no. 4 p.881-890dSpringer International Publishingx1015-16217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-017-0539-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011300171300001400284520145900298592002801757650002501785650001601810650001201826650002001838650001201858650001501870650000901885650001201894650001201906650001201918650001601930650001401946650001401960650000901974650002001983651001702003653001902020653001802039653002002057653001902077653002002096653001802116653001702134653002202151700002402173700002202197773010102219856008502320852000902405655001202414IND60607015120221119143237.0190403e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060701512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2016.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCombrink, Xander10aNest predation and maternal care in the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) at Lake St Lucia, South Africa  ap. 31-36.  aInformation regarding nest predation, nest abandonment, and maternal care in the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is largely restricted to anecdotal observations, and has not been studied quantitatively. Consequently, we investigated their nesting biology using camera-traps over four years at Lake St Lucia, South Africa. We obtained 4305 photographs (daylight captures=90.1%, nocturnal=9.9%) of 19 nest-guarding females. Of 19 monitored nests, 37% were raided by predators (mean=12.1±6.2days subsequent to camera placement). All females returned to their nests following first predation, and on average returned three times between predator raids before nest abandonment. Water monitors (Varanus niloticus) and marsh mongoose (Atilax paludinosus) were the main egg predators. Nesting raids lasted 5.9±1.6days. Diurnally females were seldom on the nest, except during cool/cloudy weather or rain, preferring to guard from nearby shade. Females defended nests aggressively against non-human intruders. Five Nile crocodile females were observed liberating their hatchlings from nests. A detailed sequence of a mother excavating and transporting hatchlings revealed 13 excursions between nest and water over 32.5h. This, after months of continual nest attendance and defence, is illustrative of the high level of maternal care in Nile crocodiles. Camera-trapping is an effective, non-invasive method for further crocodile nesting behaviour research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocodylus niloticus 3aHerpestidae 3aVaranus 3acamera trapping 3acameras 3acrocodiles 3aeggs 3afemales 3amarshes 3anesting 3aphotographs 3apredation 3apredators 3arain 3asolar radiation 3aSouth Africa 0aNile crocodile 0aMaternal care 0aNesting biology 0aNest predation 0aNest liberation 0aNest guarding 0aCamera traps 0aRemote monitoring1 aWarner, Jonathan K.1 aDowns, Colleen T.0 tBehavioural processes.g2016 Dec., v. 133 p.31-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2016.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03667naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001600295500001500311520200300326592002802329650003102357650001502388650001102403650001702414650002202431650002302453650001202476650001002488650002002498650001702518650001602535650001602551650001402567650001502581650001302596650001902609650002602628650001302654650001102667650002202678650000902700650001802709650001902727651001202746653001302758700002102771700002402792700002502816700001802841700001902859773010902878856008102987852000903068655001203077IND60580367620221120053332.0170916e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058036762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-017-0540-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPisani, Oliva10aMolecular composition and bioavailability of dissolved organic nitrogen in a lake flow-influenced river in south Florida, USA  ap. 891-908.  a2019-12-06  aDissolved organic nitrogen (DON) represents a large percentage of the total nitrogen in rivers and estuaries, and can contribute to coastal eutrophication and hypoxia. This study reports on the composition and bioavailability of DON along the Caloosahatchee River (Florida), a heavily managed system receiving inputs from Lake Okeechobee as well as agricultural and urban runoff from the surrounding watershed. Water samples were collected bimonthly for 1 year beginning December 2014 at three stations along the river. Treatments included 28-day dark incubations with and without prior photo-irradiation. Concentrations of DON, ammonium, nitrate–nitrite, total hydrolyzable amino acids (THAA), and urea, as well as bacterial numbers, leucine aminopeptidase activity, and fluorescent optical properties were measured. Ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) was used to characterize the molecular composition of DON before and after incubation for selective samples. The total dissolved N pool was dominated by DON (61–99%), with low inorganic N (1–39%), and small amounts of THAA-N (0.1–23%) and urea-N (0.6–3.2%). The mean percentage of biologically available DON (BDON) for the study was 15% (−12–61% range) with highest values occurring when water inputs from Lake Okeechobee were the most dominant freshwater source. FT-ICR MS analysis revealed the presence of a wide range of N-containing formulas and the generation of aliphatic and ‘peptide-like’ structures likely due to microbial alteration of the carbon skeleton of DON compounds. Effects of light exposure prior to incubation did not have a measurable effect on %BDON but did affect bacterial biomass and DON composition. These findings may help predict nutrient loading effects to the Caloosahatchee River estuary and may aid in understanding wetland potential as a treatment technology for removing N in this and other freshwater systems sensitive to N loading.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3awatersheds 3acarbon 3aurban runoff 3amass spectrometry 3aoptical properties 3ahypoxia 3alakes 3abioavailability 3afluorescence 3aamino acids 3airradiation 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3aammonium 3aeutrophication 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3awetlands 3arivers 3amicrobial biomass 3aurea 3aurea nitrogen 3apollution load 3aFlorida 0anitrogen1 aBoyer, Joseph N.1 aPodgorski, David C.1 aThomas, Cassondra R.1 aColey, Teresa1 aJaffé, Rudolf0 tAquatic sciences.g2017 Oct., v. 79, no. 4 p.891-908dSpringer International Publishingx1015-16217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-017-0540-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013100170520095300301592002801254650002201282650002001304650001301324650001701337650001901354650002701373650001301400650001701413653001501430653002701445653003101472653001901503653002001522653001901542700002401561700002401585700002101609700001401630700002001644700001901664700002201683700002101705700002201726700002001748700001801768773010001786856008701886852000901973655001201982IND60747167520221116183628.0220205e20220130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074716752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zichen10aUV excited fluorescence image-based non-destructive method for early detection of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) spoilage  aThe soon spoiled strawberries need to be classified from healthy fruits in an early stage. In this research, a machine vision system is proposed for inspecting the quality of strawberries using ultraviolet (UV) light based on the excitation-emission matrix (EEM) results. Among the 100 fruits which were harvested and stored under 10 °C condition for 7 days, 7 fruits were confirmed to be spoiled by using a firmness meter. The EEM results show the fluorescence compound contributes to a whitish surface on the spoiled fruits. Based on the EEM results, UV fluorescence images from the bottom view of strawberries were used to classify the spoiled fruits and healthy fruits within 1 day after harvest. These results demonstrate the UV fluorescence imaging can be a fast, non-destructive, and low-cost method for inspecting the soon spoiled fruits. The proposed index related to the spoiling time can be a new indicator for qualifying strawberry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3acomputer vision 3afirmness 3afluorescence 3afood chemistry 3anondestructive methods 3aspoilage 3astrawberries 0aStrawberry 0aFragaria × ananassa 0aExcitation-emission matrix 0aMachine vision 0aNon-destructive 0aSpoiled fruits1 aOmwange, Ken Abamba1 aTsay, Lok Wai Jacky1 aSaitō, Yoshito,1 aMaai, Eri1 aYamazaki, Akira1 aNakano, Ryohei1 aNakazaki, Tetsuya1 aKuramoto, Makoto1 aSuzuki, Tetsuhito1 aOgawa, Yūichi,1 aKondo, Naoshi0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 368 p.130776-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012700155300001800282520136300300592002801663650001301691650002801704650001101732650001801743650001101761700001901772773012501791856007501916852000901991655001202000IND60534370720221119113409.0160802e20120605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053437072DNAL7 a10.1021/es30083582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Jujun10aApproaches To Improve Separation Efficiency of Eddy Current Separation for Recovering Aluminum from Waste Toner Cartridges  ap. 6214-6221.  aSeparation efficiency of eddy current separation (ECS) is low (about 85%) in industrial application for recovering aluminum from crushed waste toner cartridges. Influencing factors of ECS were studied to improve the separation efficiency. Operation factors were researched by orthogonal experiment of ECS on investigating the separation distance between aluminum and plastic flakes. The results indicated the difference (ωR-v) between feeding speed (v) and rotation speed (ω) of magnetic drum (radius: R) was critical factor of influencing the separation efficiency, feeding speed (v) was general factor, and collecting position (H) was subordinate factor. Separation efficiency decreased as the increasing of v, and increased as the increasing of (ωR-v). 0.9 m was the optimal value of H in the orthogonal experiment. Influencing factors of particle characteristics and machine structure were studied by newly established models for computing the separation distance between aluminum and plastic flake in ECS. The results indicated changing of particle size would influence the separation efficiency greater than ω and particle shape. Separation efficiency will increase as the increasing of particle size and ω. Shape of circle is beneficial to improve separation efficiency. Finally, approaches to improve separation efficiency of ECS were presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aindustrial applications 3amodels 3aparticle size 3awastes1 aHsu, Chen-Min,0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 June 05, v. 46, no. 11 p.6214-6221dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes30083583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001900117040001800136100002100154245013800175300001600313520070200329592002801031650004401059650001301103650001501116650001401131650001001145650001201155650003201167650001401199650001301213650001101226651001301237700002101250700002101271700002501292773013701317856006901454852000901523655001201532IND60597645220221117233024.0180625e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059764522DNAL7 a10.1645/16-712doi4 apara-103-01-06  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerri, Angela R.10aEarliest Evidence of Toxocara sp. in a 1.2-Million-Yr-Old Extinct Hyena (Pachycrocuta brevirostris) Coprolite from Northwest Pakistan  ap. 138-141.  aThe study of fossil parasites can provide insight into the antiquity of host–parasite relationships and the origins and evolution of these paleoparasites.

The trophic magnification factor (TMF) for D5 was determined and compared with TMFs of several legacy contaminants: polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners 153 and 180, polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners 47 and 99, and p,p′-DDE. D5 showed TMF significantly greater than 1, implying food web biomagnification (TMF = 2.28, CI: 1.22–4.29). This contrasts with two studies that reported TMF < 1, which may reflect variability in TMF between food webs. The Lake Mjøsa D5 TMF was sensitive to the species included at the higher trophic level; whole food web TMF differed from TMF excluding smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) or brown trout (Salmo trutta) (TMF–SMELT = 1.62, CI: 0.96–2.72; TMF–TROUT = 3.58, CI: 1.82–7.03). For legacy contaminants (e.g., PCB-153 and PCB-180), the TMFs were less sensitive to the food web composition, and a better model fit was obtained compared to D5. The differences in biomagnification behavior between D5 and the legacy contaminants suggest that the biomagnification of D5 is being governed by species-specific properties such as biotransformation rate or tissue distribution that differ from those of legacy contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMysis 3aOsmerus eperlanus 3aSalmo trutta 3abioaccumulation 3abiotransformation 3afish 3alakes 3amodels 3apiscivores 3aplanktivores 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asiloxanes 3atissue distribution 3atrophic levels 3azooplankton 3aNorway1 aFjeld, Eirik1 aKierkegaard, Amelie1 aMcLachlan, Michael

Among the numerous kinds of these materials the conductive polymers/zeolite (nano-)composites represent a new class of materials system due to their novel physicochemical properties and potential for various practical and technological applications such as sensors, cathodes of the cells, anticorrosive, membranes, and selective removal of heavy metal ions from sea water and industrial waste water. However, these materials were under-exploited and there were only a few studies conducted for the preparation and application of conductive polymer/zeolite hybrids. This review provides a snapshot of recent progress in the synthesis, materials properties, and applications of conductive polymers/zeolite (nano-)composites reported until March 2014.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aheavy metals 3aindustrial wastewater 3ametal ions 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3aseawater 3azeolites0 tRSC advances.g2014 Aug. 06, v. 4, no. 64 p.33935-33954dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03067b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245012400170300001600294520120900310592002801519650001701547650000801564650002301572650002301595650004001618650001801658650002001676650002601696650001701722650001401739650001401753650001401767650000901781650003001790650001501820650002801835651001101863653001801874653001601892653001501908653001301923700002801936700003301964700003501997700004302032700002802075700003102103700004002134773013302174856007502307852000902382655001202391IND60687519620221118025114.0200401e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068751962DNAL7 a10.7589/2019-06-1712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, Michelli Lopes10aSalmonella spp. infection in psittacidae at a wildlife rehabilitation center in the state of mato grosso do sul, brazil  ap. 288-293.  aThe growing interest in wild birds as pets and the increasingly complex interspecific relationships due to human activities in wild environments underscore the need for better knowledge about the health of these animals. Salmonella stands out among the infectious agents of considerable importance to both animal and human health. The importance of these enterobacteria to the health of humans and livestock animals has long been known. In wild birds in countries such as Brazil, however, little is known regarding the frequency of infection and the main serotypes of occurrence. In the present study, the frequency of infection and the main serotypes of Salmonella spp. were investigated in 258 birds at a wild animal rehabilitation center using conventional microbiological methods and molecular diagnostic techniques. Four birds infected with Salmonella enterica were identified using PCR. The birds were of the species Brotogeris chiriri, Ara ararauna, and Eupsittula aurea. Sequencing of DNA revealed identity with the Javiana, Newport, and Arizonae serotypes. These results are of considerable importance to the implementation of management and control measures directed at human and animal health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAra ararauna 3aDNA 3aSalmonella Javiana 3aSalmonella Newport 3aSalmonella enterica subsp. arizonae 3abird diseases 3acontrol methods 3adiagnostic techniques 3ahuman health 3alivestock 3aparakeets 3apathogens 3apets 3apolymerase chain reaction 3awild birds 3awildlife rehabilitation 3aBrazil 0aAnimal health 0aPsittacidae 0aSalmonella 0azoonosis1 aCoelho, Mateus Lotério1 ada Silva, Angélica Oliveira1 ada Silva Azuaga, Lucas Bezerra1 aMacedo Coutinho Netto, Cláudia Regina1 aGalhardo, Juliana Arena1 aBrito Leal, Cássia Rejane1 ado Nascimento Ramos, Carlos Alberto0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 56, no. 2 p.288-293dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2019-06-1713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010200169300001600271520207600287592002802363650002202391650002402413650001202437650002602449650001802475650001602493650001502509650001502524650001102539650001202550650001802562650001002580700002702590700002502617773010902642856008102751852000902832655001202841IND60580367920221120064320.0170916e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058036792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-017-0541-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeio, Maria João10aFunctional associations between microalgae, macrophytes and invertebrates distinguish river types  ap. 909-923.  aContemporary large-scale river ecology is grounded on the existence of patterns in the distribution of aquatic communities, structured by prevailing abiotic conditions. Here, we investigated the existence of functional consistent associations of traits (i.e., traits appearing consistently together at different sites and the same river type) between different biological elements of the aquatic community, assuming that species traits confer them advantages for certain environmental conditions but also within the aquatic community. If this is true, these trait associations should be consistently found in water bodies with similar characteristics (river types), defining different types of ecosystem functioning. To test this, 79 least-disturbed sites, belonging to five well-defined Portuguese river types and covering the longitudinal river gradient were used: headwaters of semi-arid streams, mountainous streams and northern-Atlantic climate streams, middle reaches and lowland large rivers. For each river type, we analyzed the strongest associations (via the Bray–Curtis coefficient) between diatoms, benthic invertebrates and macrophytes and traits that could be relevant to their interactions (e.g., invertebrate trophic groups, mobility/fixation ability of diatoms, macrophyte affinity to water) against a priori predictions. The strongest associations of traits changed over the river continuum with an increase in their complexity (number of associations) from headwaters to middle reaches and a decrease in lowland large rivers. These changes were not related to total richness, which was similar for all river types and over the continuum (ca. 100 taxa). In the three types of headwaters, there were also clear differences in associations among aquatic elements. The importance of riparian trees in small streams was not as high as expected while instream macrophytes were more relevant than predicted. This study revealed the existence of predictable functional associations that could serve as a basis for the functional assessment of running waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aaquatic communities 3aclimate 3aenvironmental factors 3ainvertebrates 3amacrophytes 3amicroalgae 3aprediction 3arivers 3astreams 3asurface water 3atrees1 aAlmeida, Salomé F.

Headspace samples were pumped past the gas sensors array for 10 s every five minutes and the voltage changes of the sensors were measured. For the calibration procedure no off-line sampling was used. Instead, a theoretical model of the process has been applied to simulate the ethanol production at any given time. However, the kinetic parameters of the simulation model are unknown at the beginning of the calibration. It is demonstrated that these kinetic parameters of the theoretical process model can be acquired from the response of the gas sensor array alone. The calculated parameters result in a simulation model that is at least as accurate as a model whose parameters have been acquired by least squares fitting to off-line measurements. The root mean square error of calibration as well as the percentage error for validation sets were below 0.2 g L⁻¹ and 7%, respectively.The obtained results indicate that the model-based calibrated gas sensor array can be a cheap alternative to other tools, such as spectroscopy-based methods, that are used for monitoring yeast cultivations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aelectric potential difference 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aheadspace analysis 3aleast squares 3amonitoring 3asimulation models 3atheoretical models 3ayeasts 0aGas sensor array 0aModel-based calibration 0aEthanol prediction 0aYeast cultivation1 aBabor, Majharulislam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5440-75731 aPaquet-Durand, Olivier1 aHitzmann, Bernd0 tBiosystems engineering.g2020 Oct., v. 198 p.198-209dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2020.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001900117040001800136100002000154245018400174300001600358520206400374592002802438650002002466650001802486650002402504650001902528650002702547650001502574650002502589650003102614650001202645650001002657650002302667650001002690650001902700650003302719650001002752650001402762650001002776650001702786650001602803650001802819650001402837650002202851650000902873650001302882700002502895700003402920700002002954773013702974856006903111852000903180655001203189IND60597645420221117232920.0180625e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059764542DNAL7 a10.1645/16-752doi4 apara-103-05-11  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyziel, Anna M.10aInterrelationships of Dictyocaulus spp. in Wild Ruminants with Morphological Description of Dictyocaulus cervi n. sp.

In this study we investigated the interrelationships of Dictyocaulus spp. from European bison (Bison bonasus L.), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and red deer (Cervus elaphus) by nucleotide sequence analysis spanning the 18S RNA gene (small subunit [SSU]) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions of the ribosomal gene array as well as the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1). Molecular analyses of sequence data obtained partly with novel primers from between 10 and 50 specimens from each host were carried out. Bayesian inference analysis revealed that each host species was infected with different genotypes. Analysis of cox1 sequence data showed a diverse genetic background and high evolutionary potential of Dictyocaulus taxa. Data from lungworms of European bison revealed a distinct genotype of Dictyocaulus viviparus, whereas Dictyocaulus capreolus was only found in roe deer. In contrast, red deer were infected with a taxon with unique SSU, ITS2, and cox1 sequences. These results indicate the occurrence of a novel genotype from red deer, which differs significantly from the National Center for Biotechnology Information reference sequence of Dictyocaulus eckerti. The molecular evidence was consistent with a morphological study with description and imaging of Dictyocaulus cervi n. sp. recovered from red deer. Dictyocaulus cervi n. sp. can be distinguished from D. eckerti on the basis of the absence of cervical papillae, the occurrence of a single ring of 4 symmetrical submedian cephalic papillae, length of the tail in females, morphometry of the female reproductive system, and measurements of gubernacula in males. In conclusion, our findings further strengthen the idea that the genetic complexity and diversity among Dictyocaulus lungworms infecting wildlife ruminants is larger than previously believed and warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aBison bonasus 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aCervus elaphus 3aDictyocaulus viviparus 3abronchitis 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afemale reproductive system 3afemales 3agenes 3agenetic background 3ahosts 3aimage analysis 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alungs 3alungworms 3amales 3amitochondria 3amorphometry 3aribosomal RNA 3aruminants 3asequence analysis 3atail 3awildlife1 aLaskowski, Zdzisław1 aDemiaszkiewicz, Aleksander W.1 aHöglund, Johan0 tJournal of parasitology.g2017 Oct., v. 103, no. 5 p.506-518dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/16-753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009900152300002000251520172700271592002801998650003602026650001802062650001702080650001302097650002702110650001102137650001702148650001602165700001502181700001602196700001602212700001402228773012402242856007402366852000902440655001202449IND60665030920221120053454.0190912e20140724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066503092DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03074e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wei10aEvolution of transient cluster/droplet size distribution in a heterogeneous nucleation process  ap. 31692-31699.  aThe transient nucleation size distribution model was introduced into a water vapor condensation system to investigate the kinetics of the initial condensation stage. It was proven that the growth/decay of clusters was significantly affected by cluster size and contact angles of the condensation surface. As the cluster size increased, the cluster surface area exposed to vapor was also increased, and the attachment/detachment frequencies increased accordingly. As the contact angle decreased to a certain value, the attachment frequency became larger than the detachment frequency, which is beneficial for the growth of clusters. The evolution of cluster/droplet size distribution was also investigated. The results indicated that the transient cluster size distribution of the heterogeneous process translates from a monotonic decreasing to a unimodal distribution with time. Peak value of cluster/droplet population can be observed for a sufficiently long time, and the size distribution curve is found to be close to a lognormal distribution, which is distinctly different from the homogeneous equilibrium distribution. The peak value in the size distribution curve shifts to larger cluster sizes with time, and the absolute value decreases accordingly. It is very similar to the reported experimental results of micron scale droplets, revealing that the subsequent experimental phenomenon at macroscopic scale was the direct result of the further development of the initial cluster/droplet size distribution. The present study investigated the effect of contact angle on the growth/decay of clusters and analyzed the mechanism of the evolution of the cluster/droplet size distribution from the viewpoint of kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensation (phase transition) 3acontact angle 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3alognormal distribution 3amodels 3asurface area 3awater vapor1 aLan, Zhong1 aPeng, Benli1 aWen, Rongfu1 aMa, Xuehu0 tRSC advances.g2014 July 24, v. 4, no. 60 p.31692-31699dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03074e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245009200176300001400268520246600282592002802748650001902776650001102795650001402806650001102820650002102831650001702852650001402869650001802883650003502901650000902936650001402945650001202959650001702971650001302988651001803001700002603019700002403045700002103069773009103090856008403181852000903265655001203274IND60086849020221120160324.0141102e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008684902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2012.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlosterhaus, Susan L.10aBrominated and chlorinated flame retardants in San Francisco Bay sediments and wildlife  ap. 56-65.  aRestrictions on the use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have resulted in the use of alternative flame retardants in consumer products to comply with flammability standards. In contrast to PBDEs, information on the occurrence and fate of these alternative compounds in the environment is limited, particularly in the United States. In this study, a survey of flame retardants in San Francisco Bay was conducted to evaluate whether PBDE replacement chemicals and other current use flame retardants were accumulating in the Bay food web. In addition to PBDEs, brominated and chlorinated flame retardants (hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and Dechlorane Plus (DP)) were detected in Bay sediments and wildlife. Median concentrations of PBDEs, HBCD, and DP, respectively, were 4.3, 0.3, and 0.2ngg⁻¹ dry weight (dw) in sediments; 1670, <6.0, and 0.5ngg⁻¹ lipid weight (lw) in white croaker (Genyonemus lineatus); 1860, 6.5, and 1.3ngg⁻¹ lw in shiner surfperch (Cymatogaster aggregata); 5500, 37.4, and 0.9ngg⁻¹ lw in eggs of double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus); 770, 7.1, and 0.9ngg⁻¹ lw in harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) adults; and 330, 3.5, and <0.1ngg⁻¹ lw in harbor seal (P. vitulina) pups. Two additional flame retardants, pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) and 1,2-bis(2,4,6 tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) were detected in sediments but with less frequency and at lower concentrations (median concentrations of 0.01 and 0.02ngg⁻¹ dw, respectively) compared to the other flame retardants. PBEB was also detected in each of the adult harbor seals and in 83% of the pups (median concentrations 0.2 and 0.07ngg⁻¹ lw, respectively). The flame retardants hexabromobenzene (HBB), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), bis(2-ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), and 2-ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB), were not detected in sediments and BTBPE, HBB and TBB were not detected in wildlife samples. Elevated concentrations of some flame retardants were likely associated with urbanization and Bay hydrodynamics. Compared to other locations, concentrations of PBDEs in Bay wildlife were comparable or higher, while concentrations of the alternatives were generally lower. This study is the first to determine concentrations of PBDE replacement products and other flame retardants in San Francisco Bay, providing some of the first data on the food web occurrence of these flame retardants in a North American urbanized estuary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoca vitulina 3aadults 3aestuaries 3aethane 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3afood webs 3ahydrodynamics 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apups 3asediments 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3awildlife 3aUnited States1 aStapleton, Heather M.1 aLa Guardia, Mark J.1 aGreig, Denise J.0 tEnvironment international.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 47 p.56-65dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2012.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245017500199506007600374520118100450592002801631506003701659650002501696650003801721650001701759650001201776650001301788650001301801650002201814650001501836650002601851653002101877653002101898653002101919653001401940653002501954653002801979700002002007700002402027773011802051856007302169852000902242655001202251IND60690326820221207111720.0200426e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069032682DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.259752doi7 aPMC40910892pmcid7 a242706312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Wataru14aThe evolutionary events necessary for the emergence of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes may involve a loss of nitrate responsiveness of the NIN transcription factor  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNODULE INCEPTION (NIN) is a key regulator of the symbiotic nitrogen fixation pathway in legumes including Lotus japonicus. NIN-like proteins (NLPs), which are presumably present in all land plants, were recently identified as key transcription factors in nitrate signaling and responses in Arabidopsis thaliana, a non-leguminous plant. Here we show that both NIN and NLP1 of L. japonicus (LjNLP1) can bind to the nitrate-responsive cis-element (NRE) and promote transcription from an NRE-containing promoter as did the NLPs of A. thaliana (AtNLPs). However, differing from LjNLP1 and the AtNLPs that are activated by nitrate signaling through their N-terminal regions, the N-terminal region of NIN did not respond to nitrate. Thus, in the course of the evolution of NIN into a transcription factor that functions in nodulation in legumes, some mutations might arise that converted it to a nitrate-insensitive transcription factor. Because nodule formation is induced under nitrogen-deficient conditions, we speculate that the loss of the nitrate-responsiveness of NIN may be one of the evolutionary events necessary for the emergence of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aembryophytes 3alegumes 3amutation 3anitrates 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3atranscription factors 0aNIN-like protein 0aNODULE INCEPTION 0anitrate response 0asymbiosis 0atranscription factor 0atranscriptional control1 aKonishi, Mineko1 aYanagisawa, Shuichi0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 8, no. 10 p.e25975-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.259753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04864naa a2200949 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100005900189245013300248300001900381506007600400520196000476592002802436506003702464650001102501650001402512650001102526650002102537650001302558650002502571650001802596650001002614650001402624650001502638650001302653650002802666650001102694650001502705650003402720650001602754650001702770650002102787650000902808650001102817650001102828650001502839650002502854650001002879650000902889650002202898650001902920650001202939650001902951650001302970650002202983650001503005650002203020651001803042653000903060653002103069653002503090653001803115653002703133700002303160700002303183700001903206700002103225700002403246700005803270700002103328700002403349700001803373700002203391700002103413700001903434700001703453700002203470700002003492700002203512700001703534700005903551700001803610773018203628856008303810852000903893655001203902IND60565284920221207122343.0190417e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056528492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2017.01.0162doi7 aPMC54469282pmcid7 a283205972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBodnar, Lisa M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9427-546710aRacial or Ethnic and Socioeconomic Inequalities in Adherence to National Dietary Guidance in a Large Cohort of US Pregnant Women  ap. 867-877.e3.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe significance of periconceptional nutrition for optimizing offspring and maternal health and reducing social inequalities warrants greater understanding of diet quality among US women.Our objective was to evaluate racial or ethnic and education inequalities in periconceptional diet quality and sources of energy and micronutrients.Cross-sectional analysis of data from the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be cohort.Nulliparous women (N=7,511) were enrolled across eight US medical centers from 2010 to 2013.A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire assessing usual dietary intake during the 3 months around conception was self-administered during the first trimester. Diet quality, measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010), and sources of energy and micronutrients were the outcomes.Differences in diet quality were tested across maternal racial or ethnic and education groups using F tests associated with analysis of variance and χ2 tests.HEI-2010 score increased with higher education, but the increase among non-Hispanic black women was smaller than among non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics (interaction P value <0.0001). For all groups, average scores for HEI-2010 components were below recommendations. Top sources of energy were sugar-sweetened beverages, pasta dishes, and grain desserts, but sources varied by race or ethnicity and education. Approximately 34% of energy consumed was from empty calories (the sum of energy from added sugars, solid fats, and alcohol beyond moderate levels). The primary sources of iron, folate, and vitamin C were juices and enriched breads.Diet quality is suboptimal around conception, particularly among women who are non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or who had less than a college degree. Diet quality could be improved by substituting intakes of refined grains and foods empty in calories with vegetables, peas and beans (legumes), seafood, and whole grains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBlacks 3aHispanics 3aWhites 3aacademic degrees 3aalcohols 3aanalysis of variance 3aascorbic acid 3abeans 3abeverages 3aconception 3adesserts 3adietary recommendations 3aenergy 3afolic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3ahealthy diet 3ahigher education 3airon 3ajuices 3alipids 3amonitoring 3anutritional adequacy 3apasta 3apeas 3apregnancy outcome 3apregnant women 3aprogeny 3arefined grains 3aseafoods 3asocial inequality 3avegetables 3awhole grain foods 3aUnited States 0aDiet 0aDietary guidance 0aHealthy Eating Index 0aPreconception 0aPregnancy inequalities1 aSimhan, Hyagriv N.1 aParker, Corette B.1 aMeier, Heather1 aMercer, Brian M.1 aGrobman, William A.1 aHaas, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8379-07431 aWing, Deborah A.1 aHoffman, Matthew K.1 aParry, Samuel1 aSilver, Robert M.1 aSaade, George R.1 aWapner, Ronald1 aIams, Jay D.1 aWadhwa, Pathik D.1 aElovitz, Michal1 aPeaceman, Alan M.1 aEsplin, Sean1 aBarnes, Shannon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0207-45191 aReddy, Uma M.0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2017 June, v. 117, no. 6 p.867-877.e3dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2017.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011300155300001800268520146200286592002801748650004401776650002101820650001501841650003101856650001201887650001501899650001701914650001601931650001501947650001301962650002001975700001801995773012502013856007502138852000902213655001202222IND60534371220221119113331.0160802e20120605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053437122DNAL7 a10.1021/es300964d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadian, Adi10aEffect of Humic Acid on Pyrene Removal from Water by Polycation-Clay Mineral Composites and Activated Carbon  ap. 6228-6235.  aPyrene removal by polycation-montmorillonite (MMT) composites and granulated activated carbon (GAC) in the presence of humic acid (HA) was examined. Pyrene, HA, and sorbent interactions were characterized by FTIR, fluorescence and zeta measurements, adsorption, and column filtration experiments. Pyrene binding coefficients to the macromolecules were in the order of PVPcoS (poly-4-vinylpiridine-co-styrene) > HA > PDADMAC (poly diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium-chloride), correlating to pyrene-macromolecules compatibility. Electrostatic interactions explained the high adsorption of HA to both composites (∼100%), whereas HA adsorption by GAC was low. Pyrene removal by the composites, unlike GAC, was enhanced in the presence of HA; removal by PDADMAC-MMT increased from ∼50 (kd = 2.2 × 10³ kg/L) to ∼70% (kd = 2.4 × 10³ kg/L) in the presence of HA. This improvement was attributed to the adsorption of pyrene-HA complexes. PVPcoS-MMT was most efficient in removing pyrene (kd = 1.1 × 10⁴ kg/L, >95% removal) which was explained in terms of specific π donor−π acceptor interactions. Pyrene uptake by column filters of GAC reached ∼50% and decreased to ∼30% in the presence of HA. Pyrene removal by the PVPcoS-MMT filter was significantly higher (100–85% removal), exhibiting only a small decrease in the presence of HA. The utilization of HA as an enhancing agent in pollutant removal is novel and of major importance in water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afilters 3afiltration 3afluorescence 3ahumic acids 3apollutants 3asorbents 3awater treatment1 aMishael, Yael0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 June 05, v. 46, no. 11 p.6228-6235dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes300964d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245015000184300001800334520080900352592002801161650002901189650002701218650001001245650001801255650003001273650002601303650002501329650003601354650004401390650001701434650001801451650004501469650003701514650004001551650002401591650003101615650007301646650005201719650004801771700001501819700002601834700002601860773009801886856004801984852000902032655001202041IND4479151020221121214248.0121003e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447915102DNAL7 a214520132pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-011-0603-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaudano, Enrico10aIdentification of reference genes suitable for normalization of RT-qPCR expression data in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during alcoholic fermentation  ap. 1593-1599.  aExpression data from RT-qPCR (reverse transcription quantitative PCR) needs to be normalized to account for experimental variability among samples caused by differential yields of the transcripts in RNA extraction or in the reverse transcription. The most common method is to normalize against one or more reference genes (RG). We have selected RGs suitable for normalization of RT-qPCR raw data in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during alcoholic fermentation. The RGs were evaluated by three different statistical methods. The suitability of the selected RG sets was compared with ACT1, a commonly used non-validated single RG, by normalizing the expression of two target genes. Expression profiles of the target genes revealed the risk of misleading interpretation of expression data due to an unreliable RG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcoholic fermentation 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription 3astatistical analysis 2aAlcohol Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxanalysisxgenetics. 2aFermentation 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aRNA, Fungalxanalysisxgenetics. 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxgenetics. 2aReference Standards 2aReproducibility of Results 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxstandards. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgenetics1 aNoti, Olta1 aCostantini, Antonella1 aGarcia-Moruno, Emilia0 tBiotechnology letters.g2011 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.1593-1599dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-011-0603-y  aDNAL 7aarticle04427naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245017800214300001100392506007600403520264000479592002803119596003203147506003703179650002303216650002003239650001903259650001003278650001403288650001403302650001403316650001103330650001103341650001003352650001303362650000903375650002203384650002303406650001603429650002603445650001303471651001103484651000903495651001503504651001803519651001803537700001903555700002603574700001603600700002003616773011003636856008203746852000903828655001203837IND60548586220221207110729.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054858622DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1366-z2doi7 aPMC47503032pmcid7 a268640702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreppel, Katharina S.10aEffect of temperature and relative humidity on the development times and survival of Synopsyllus fonquerniei and Xenopsylla cheopis, the flea vectors of plague in Madagascar  ap. 82.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Plague, a zoonosis caused by Yersinia pestis, is found in Asia, the Americas but mainly in Africa, with the island of Madagascar reporting almost one third of human cases worldwide. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague is transmitted predominantly by two flea species which coexist on the island, but differ in their distribution. The endemic flea, Synopsyllus fonquerniei, dominates flea communities on rats caught outdoors, while the cosmopolitan flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is found mostly on rats caught in houses. Additionally S. fonquerniei seems restricted to areas above 800 m. Climatic constraints on the development of the two main vectors of plague could explain the differences in their distribution and the seasonal changes in their abundance. Here we present the first study on effects of temperature and relative humidity on the immature stages of both vector species. METHODS: We examined the two species’ temperature and humidity requirements under experimental conditions at five different temperatures and two relative humidities. By employing multivariate and survival analysis we established the impact of temperature and relative humidity on development times and survival for both species. Using degree-day analysis we then predicted the average developmental threshold for larvae to reach pupation and for pupae to complete development under each treatment. This analysis was undertaken separately for the two relative humidities and for the two species. RESULTS: Development times and time to death differed significantly, with the endemic S. fonquerniei taking on average 1.79 times longer to complete development and having a shorter time to death than X. cheopis under adverse conditions with high temperature and low humidity. Temperature had a significant effect on the development times of flea larvae and pupae. While humidity did not affect the development times of either species, it did influence the time of death of S. fonquerniei. Using degree-day analysis we estimated an average developmental threshold of 9 °C for S. fonquerniei, and 12.5 °C for X. cheopis. CONCLUSIONS: While many vector-borne diseases are limited to warm, low-lying regions, plague in Madagascar is unusual in being most prevalent in the cool, highland regions of the country. Our results point towards the possibility that this is because the endemic flea vector, S. fonquerniei, is better adapted to cool temperatures than the exotic flea vector, X. cheopis. Future warming caused by climate change might reduce the area suitable for S. fonquerniei and may thus reduce the incidence of plague in Madagascar.  aPublisher supplied data  aF/0025/ACcLeverhulme Trust0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aXenopsylla cheopis 3aYersinia pestis 3aclimate change 3adeath 3aheat sums 3ahighlands 3aimmatures 3alarvae 3aplague 3apupae 3apupation 3arats 3arelative humidity 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3avector-borne diseases 3azoonoses 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aMadagascar 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aTelfer, Sandra1 aRajerison, Minoarisoa1 aMorse, Andy1 aBaylis, Matthew0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.82-82dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1366-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001600163245012000179300001400299520108800313592002801401650000901429650001901438650001701457650001501474650001001489650001001499650001601509650002701525650001001552650001201562650001001574650001501584650001401599650002101613650001401634650002501648650002501673650001201698650002801710650005301738650002801791650003901819650004001858650003701898650003201935650002201967650003501989650001902024650003702043650002602080700001702106700002502123773010502148856008402253852000902337655001202346IND4472953620221121052018.0120503e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447295362DNAL7 a220255032pmid7 a10.1177/07482337114031912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsnas, Musa10aEffects of omethoate on certain oxidative biomarkers in various tissues of frogs (Rana ridibunda) at acute exposure  ap. 27-34.  aThe study aimed mainly to assess effects of omethoate on certain oxidative stress biomarkers in various tissues of frogs (Rana ridibunda). Biomarkers selected for stress monitoring were malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant defense system (ADS) constituent such as reduced glutathione (GSH) level, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the liver, brain, heart and kidney tissues of frogs exposed to 10 and 20 ppm dosages of omethoate for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Results showed that the administrations of omethoate promote MDA content in the tissues of the frogs treated with both dosages of omethoate. With regard to the ADS, GSH-Px, GST, SOD activities and GSH levels decreased after 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours in the tissues of treatment groups compared with controls. Collective results demonstrated that the exposures to omethoate of frogs induced an increase in MDA joined with fluctuated ADS. This may reflect the potential role of these parameters as useful biomarkers for assessment of aquatic pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRana 3aacute exposure 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3afrogs 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheart 3akidneys 3aliver 3amonitoring 3aomethoate 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aDimethoatexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Transferasexmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aOrgan Specificity 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRana ridibunda 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aToxicity Tests, Acute1 aYegin, Esref1 aCelik, I.q(Ismail),0 tToxicology & industrial health.g2012 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.27-34dSAGE Publicationsx0748-23377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/07482337114031913Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001900117040001800136100002200154245010400176300001200280520121200292592002801504650001601532650001601548650002101564650002201585650001001607650002101617650000901638650001401647650002301661650001801684650001801702650001501720650001101735650001101746650001101757700002301768700002501791700002501816773013301841856006901974852000902043655001202052IND60597645920221117233050.0180625e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059764592DNAL7 a10.1645/16-852doi4 apara-103-01-04  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffin, Shane L.10aMicrohabitat Selection and Eyefluke Infection Levels in the Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis)  ap. 1-5.  aSeveral trematode species infect the eyes of fish as second intermediate hosts. In most cases the definitive host is a piscivorous bird. Studies of a few species have shown an increase in transmission due to decreased visual acuity of the fish host. However, this may vary depending on trematode microhabitat choice within the eye. Some trematode species are found in the lens, some are found in the vitreous humor, and others have been reported from the retina. Here we report 3 genera of eyeflukes in 3 locations of the eye in the intermediate fish host, Gambusia affinis. Clinostomum metacercariae were found attached to the outer sclera within the eye orbit, and Diplostomum metacercariae were found in the lens. Posthodiplostomum metacercariae were confirmed by histology to reside between the choroid and pigmented retina. Posthodiplostomum metacercariae were found in both eyes of all 20 fish examined and in high intensities (up to 27 metacercariae per eye).

To that end, Arabidopsis plants were transformed with AGP6 gene sequence fused with Sirius fluorescent protein. Fluorescent blue light emission could be detected in the vegetative cell wall only. This result supports the model by which AGP6 and other pollen AGPs are probably important signaling molecules at the pollen tube apex.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aarabinogalactan proteins 3ablue light 3acell walls 3afluorescence 3afluorescent proteins 3agametogenesis 3amales 3amodels 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3atranscriptome 0aAGP6 0apollen tube 0aSirius fluorescent protein1 aCosta, Mario,1 aCoimbra, Sílvia0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 8, no. 10 p.e25998-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.259983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245004700183300001800230500001500248520144000263592002801703650002101731650002401752650001701776650001501793650002601808650003701834650001601871650001001887650007701897650003601974650002702010650002802037650007302065650001102138650004102149650004002190653002402230653001202254700002202266700002202288700002102310773011502331856004802446852000902494655001202503IND50064564620221119165404.0130404e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006456462DNAL7 a234632462pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-4761-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmri, Tamás10aEchinocandins: production and applications  ap. 3267-3284.  a2019-12-06  aThe first echinocandin-type antimycotic (echinocandin B) was discovered in the 1970s. It was followed by the isolation of more than 20 natural echinocandins. These cyclic lipo-hexapeptides are biosynthesized on non-ribosomal peptide synthase complexes by different ascomycota fungi. They have a unique mechanism of action; as non-competitive inhibitors of β-1,3-glucan synthase complex they target the fungal cell wall. Results of the structure–activity relationship experiments let us develop semisynthetic derivatives with improved properties. Three cyclic lipohiexapeptides (caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin) are currently approved for use in clinics. As they show good fungicidal (Candida spp.) or fungistatic (Aspergillus spp.) activity against the most important human pathogenic fungi including azole-resistant strains, they are an important addition to the antifungal armamentarium. Some evidence of acquired resistance against echinocandins has been detected among Candida glabrata strains in recent years, which enhanced the importance of data collected on the mechanism of acquired resistance developing against the echinocandins. In this review, we show the structural diversity of natural echinocandins, and we summarize the emerging data on their mode of action, biosynthesis and industrial production. Their clinical significance as well as the mechanism of natural and acquired resistance is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida glabrata 3amechanism of action 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3aresistance mechanisms 3astructure-activity relationships 3aAspergillus 3afungi 2aAntifungal Agentsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBiosynthetic Pathwaysxgenetics 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aDrug Resistance, Fungal 2aEchinocandinsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aMycosesxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aTechnology, Pharmaceuticalxmethods 0aTorulopsis glabrata 0aCandida1 aMajoros, László1 aTóth, Viktória,1 aPócsi, István,0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2013 Apr., v. 97, no. 8 p.3267-3284dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-4761-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009200174300001400266520150400280592002801784650002301812650001001835650001401845650002201859650002001881650002101901650000901922650001901931650001901950650002101969650001101990650002702001650001002028650002302038650001202061651000902073653001402082653001302096653001802109653002002127653001602147653001502163653001302178700002102191773009302212856008302305852000902388655001202397IND60565285120221120114944.0190417e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056528512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2017.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehbahani, Mona Sadat10aStabilization of flixweed seeds (Descurainia sophia L.) drink: Persian refreshing drink  ap. 22-27.  aFlixweed (Descurainia sophia L.) and London rocket (Sysyimbrium irio L.) seeds contain quite a number of nutraceuticals and are often used as herbal medicines. In addition, in Iran, they are used to prepare a type of Persian refreshing drink (sharbat-e-khakeshir). Despite their medicinal and nutritious advantages, the precipitation of seeds, is one of the major issues, restricts its commercialization. Therefore, in this study, the effect of different concentrations of native gums [Persian gum (PG) and gum Tragacanth (GT)] as well as their soluble and insoluble fractions on the stabilization, rheological and sensory properties of Persian refreshing drink [Flixweed or London rocket seeds (5%wt), basil seeds (0.50%wt), and sucrose (10%wt)] was investigated. Moreover, the effect of heat treatment and FeCl3 was studied on the aforementioned characteristics as well as the production of reversible gels. Our findings indicated that PG (1.20%wt), insoluble fraction of PG (0.80%wt), GT (0.30%wt), soluble fraction of GT (0.05%wt), and insoluble fraction of GT (0.14%wt) were able to stabilize Flixweed or London rocket seeds in drinks. Furthermore, the presence of FeCl3 (0.0025mol/L) led to a reversible gel in the presence of soluble fraction of GT. The rheological properties of stabilized drinks also showed proper fitting with Hershel–Bulkley model. In terms of sensory characteristics, the drink stabilized with soluble fraction of GT (0.05%wt) showed the highest similarity to control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDescurainia sophia 3abasil 3abeverages 3acommercialization 3aferric chloride 3afunctional foods 3agels 3agum tragacanth 3aheat treatment 3aherbal medicines 3amodels 3arheological properties 3aseeds 3asensory properties 3asucrose 3aIran 0aKhakeshir 0aFlixweed 0aLondon rocket 0aReversible gels 0aPersian gum 0aTragacanth 0aRheology1 aAbbasi, Soleiman0 tFood bioscience.g2017 June, v. 18 p.22-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2017.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245010300169300001600272520071500288592002801003650001501031650001101046650001101057650002201068650001201090650001001102650001001112650001101122651001201133653001601145653001501161653001601176653001601192653001501208653001901223773015001242856007601392852000901468655001201477IND60687520320221122032725.0200401e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068752032DNAL7 a10.11158/saa.25.3.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhaustov, Alexander A.10aContribution to systematics of the family Cunaxidae (Acari: Bdelloidea) of Western Siberia, Russia  ap. 548-568.  aMites of the family Cunaxidae of Western Siberia, Russia are reviewed.

The device consisted of a compartment for incorporating the hydrogel, a flow channel and an indicating liquid chamber with colored solution, and a dense and elastic polyethylene (PE) membrane to separate the hydrogel and the colored solution. The device works like a mercury thermometer, in which the P(NIPAM-co-B18C6Am) hydrogel and the PE membrane act as the Pb²⁺ sensor and actuator and the colored liquid column in the flow channel acts as the indicator. The volume of P(NIPAM-co-B18C6Am) hydrogel changes in response to Pb²⁺ concentration at a certain temperature due to the formation of B18C6Am/Pb²⁺ host–guest complexes, and the volume change of the hydrogel causes elastic deformation of the PE diaphragm, which pushes out the colored solution from the liquid chamber into the flow channel to form a liquid column. Therefore, the Pb²⁺ concentration can be detected quantitatively by simply and easily measuring of the liquid column length. The device shows excellent sensitivity towards Pb²⁺ ions. The detection performances of the proposed devices are satisfactorily stable and repeatable. This simple and portable device enables visual detection of Pb²⁺ concentration without the help of electrical amplification or spectroscopic measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3adiaphragm 3aelastic deformation 3ahydrogels 3aions 3alead 3aliquids 3amercury 3apolyethylene 3aportable equipment 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3athermometers1 aYu, Hai-Rong1 aJu, Xiao-Jie1 aXie, Rui1 aWang, Wei1 aChu, Liang-Yin0 tRSC advances.g2014 June 17, v. 4, no. 50 p.26030-26037dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03085k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012600163300001800289520141400307592002801721650002501749650002201774650002201796650003701818650002501855650001501880650001601895650003901911650001701950650002301967650001701990650001202007650001902019650002202038650001002060700001202070700001402082700001602096700001702112700001502129773010702144856008102251852000902332655001202341IND60580368820221120145235.0170916e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058036882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-017-2173-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPartier, A.10aMolecular and FISH analyses of a 53-kbp intact DNA fragment inserted by biolistics in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome  ap. 1547-1559.  aKEY MESSAGE: A large, 53-kbp, intact DNA fragment was inserted into the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome. FISH analyses of individual transgenic events revealed multiple insertions of intact fragments. Transferring large intact DNA fragments containing clusters of resistance genes or complete metabolic pathways into the wheat genome remains a challenge. In a previous work, we showed that the use of dephosphorylated cassettes for wheat transformation enabled the production of simple integration patterns. Here, we used the same technology to produce a cassette containing a 44-kb Arabidopsis thaliana BAC, flanked by one selection gene and one reporter gene. This 53-kb linear cassette was integrated in the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome by biolistic transformation. Our results showed that transgenic plants harboring the entire cassette were generated. The inheritability of the cassette was demonstrated in the T1 and T2 generation. Surprisingly, FISH analysis performed on T1 progeny of independent events identified double genomic insertions of intact fragments in non-homoeologous positions. Inheritability of these double insertions was demonstrated by FISH analysis of the T1 generation. Relative conclusions that can be drawn from molecular or FISH analysis are discussed along with future prospects of the engineering of large fragments for wheat transformation or genome editing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA fragmentation 3aTriticum aestivum 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abiochemical pathways 3abiolistics 3aengineering 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agene editing 3agenetic resistance 3aheritability 3aprogeny 3areporter genes 3atransgenic plants 3awheat1 aGay, G.1 aTassy, C.1 aBeckert, M.1 aFeuillet, C.1 aBarret, P.0 tPlant cell reports.g2017 Oct., v. 36, no. 10 p.1547-1559dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-017-2173-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014900163300001600312520131900328592002801647650001401675650001701689650003001706650000901736650002401745650001301769650001301782650002101795650001001816650001001826650002601836651002401862651001801886700001801904773009101922856004802013852000902061655001202070IND4479045720221119165340.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447904572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-011-0163-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBednar, D.

The Asian needle ant, Pachycondyla chinensis, native throughout Australasia was introduced to the southeastern US where it has become established in woodland habitats, nests in close proximity to and consumes subterranean termites (Rhinotermitidae). P. chinensis do not occur in habitats lacking Rhinotermitidae. We suggest that subterranean termites are critical for P. chinensis success in new habitats. We demonstrate that P. chinensis is a general termite feeder, retrieving Reticulitermes virginicus five times more often than other potential prey near P. chinensis colonies. Odors produced by R. virginicus workers, as well as other potential prey, attract P. chinensis. Furthermore, P. chinensis occupy R. virginicus nests in the lab and field and display behaviors that facilitate capture of R. virginicus workers and soldiers. Termites are an abundant, high quality, renewable food supply, in many ways similar to the hemipteran honeydew exploited by most other invasive ant species. We conclude that the behavior of P. chinensis in the presence of termites increases their competitive abilities in natural areas where they have been introduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHemiptera 3aPachycondyla 3aReticulitermes virginicus 3adiet 3aecological invasion 3ahabitats 3ahoneydew 3ainvasive species 3anests 3aodors 3asubterranean termites 3aAustralasian region 3aUnited States1 aSilverman, J.0 tInsectes sociaux.g2011 Nov., v. 58, no. 4 p.459-467dSpringer-Verlagx0020-18127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00040-011-0163-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245013100181300001600312520099500328592002801323650002101351650003501372650001001407650001601417650002201433650001201455650001201467650001001479650001201489650002101501650000701522650003901529650001301568650002101581650006901602650002201671650002301693650004101716650004001757650002101797650003101818650002001849650002901869650003101898650002801929650002101957650002401978650002702002650002202029650001602051650005502067700001702122700001802139700001702157700002002174773011302194856004802307852000902355655001202364IND4473903920221120094547.0121003e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447390392DNAL7 a222497212pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3861-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Lin-Hu10aEnzymatic biotransformation of ginsenoside Rb1 to 20(S)-Rg3 by recombinant β-glucosidase from Microbacterium esteraromaticum   ap. 377-384.  aMicrobacterium esteraromaticum was isolated from ginseng field. The β-glucosidase gene (bgp1) from M. esteraromaticum was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The bgp1 gene consists of 2,496 bp encoding 831 amino acids which have homology to the glycosyl hydrolase family 3 protein domain. The recombinant β-glucosidase enzyme (Bgp1) was purified and characterized. The molecular mass of purified Bgp1 was 87.5 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Using 0.1 mg ml−1 enzyme in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at 37°C and pH 7.0, 1.0 mg ml−1 ginsenoside Rb1 was transformed into 0.444 mg ml−1 ginsenoside Rg3 within 6 h. The Bgp1 sequentially hydrolyzed the outer and inner glucose attached to the C-20 position of ginsenosides Rb1. Bgp1 hydrolyzed the ginsenoside Rb1 along the following pathway: Rb1 → Rd → 20(S)-Rg3. This is the first report of the biotransformation of ginsenoside Rb1 to ginsenoside 20(S)-Rg3 using the recombinant β-glucosidase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMicrobacterium esteraromaticum 3aPanax 3aamino acids 3abiotransformation 3abuffers 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aglucose 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3asodium phosphate 2aActinomycetalesxenzymologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBiotransformation 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme Stability 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGinsenosidesxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPanaxxmicrobiology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTemperature 2abeta-Glucosidasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aMin, Jin-Woo1 aYang, Dong-Uk1 aKim, Yeon-Ju1 aYang, Deok-Chun0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Apr., v. 94, no. 2 p.377-384dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3861-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245013400211520145400345592002801799650001101827650002001838650001701858650001901875650001501894650001101909650003101920650001301951650001301964650001001977650001601987653001602003653001402019653001302033700005402046700002302100773011402123856008602237852000902323655001202332IND60742323620221116215030.0210911e20210910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074232362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1280522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Himanshu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8075-428010aApplication of clean gaseous fuels in compression ignition engine under dual fuel mode: A technical review and Indian perspective  aThe rapid increase in energy demand and the fast depleting environment stresses the exploration of renewable and clean energy sources. Both biogas and hydrogen are considered clean and renewable fuels, and their effective utilisation in engines could reduce harmful emissions. The present review comprehensively investigates the influences of biogas and hydrogen on the performance, combustion, and emission of the compression ignition engine operating under dual fuel mode. In addition, Indian governmental policies related to biofuels are also discussed briefly. The present review showed that biogas utilisation reduces brake thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency, and exhaust gas temperature, whereas brake-specific fuel consumption increases. Biogas introduction also reduces nitrogen oxides and smoke emissions with an increase in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. The review shows that hydrogen supplementation results in better performance at high and moderate loads due to suitable fuel characteristics of hydrogen. The zero-carbon nature of hydrogen reduces all the carbon-based emissions from the climate change perspective. The increase in hydrogen proportion results in the escalated emission of oxides of nitrogen (approximately 30–60%) contrasting to diesel mode by virtue of higher in-cylinder temperature. Additionally, a detailed study is also presented on the bottlenecks in hydrogen application for dual fuel mode.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acarbon monoxide 3aclean energy 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen 3asmoke 3atemperature 0aPerformance 0aEmissions 0aKnocking1 aDhir, Amit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6705-58881 aMahla, Sunil Kumar0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 314 p.128052-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1280523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010400172300001600276520141300292592002801705653001701733653001701750653001401767653001101781653002601792700001901818700001301837700001801850700002701868700001801895700002201913700002201935773010201957856008202059852000902141655001202150IND60564058520221121005745.0170320e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056405852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphs.2017.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsukura, Suchitra10aCharacterization of microminipigs as an in vivo experimental model for cardiac safety pharmacology  ap. 103-109.  aWe pharmacologically characterized microminipigs as an in vivo experimental model by assessing cardiovascular effects of pilsicainide, verapamil and E-4031, which can preferentially inhibit cardiac Na+, Ca2+ and K+ channels, respectively. Intravenous infusion of 1 mg/kg of pilsicainide (n = 4), 0.1 mg/kg of verapamil (n = 4) and 0.01 followed by 0.1 mg/kg of E-4031 (n = 5) over 10 min decreased the heart rate, mean blood pressure and ventricular contractility. Moreover, pilsicainide prolonged the PR interval, QRS width and QTc; verapamil prolonged the PR interval, but shortened the QRS width and QTc; and E-4031 prolonged the QTc, whereas no substantial change was detected in the PR interval or QRS width. Peak plasma concentrations of pilsicainide, verapamil and E-4031 in microminipigs were 1.7–4.8 times higher than those expected in humans and dogs, possibly due to smaller effective volume of drug distribution. The extent of the drug-induced cardiovascular responses was generally greater in microminipigs than in humans and dogs, which could be explained by the following possibilities; namely unique pharmacokinetic profile, less great reflex-mediated increase of sympathetic tone and/or smaller repolarization reserve in microminipigs. These information may make it feasible to apply this new-type animal to a tool for assessing cardiac safety profiles of new chemical entities.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMicrominipig 0aPilsicainide 0aVerapamil 0aE-4031 0aCardiovascular effect1 aNakamura, Yuji1 aCao, Xin1 aWada, Takeshi1 aIzumi-Nakaseko, Hiroko1 aAndo, Kentaro1 aYamazaki, Hiroshi1 aSugiyama, Atsushi0 tJournal of Pharmacological Sciences.g2017 Feb., v. 133 p.103-109dElsevier B.V.x1347-86137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphs.2017.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245012100161300001800282520060500300592002800905650002300933650002600956650002200982650002201004650001401026650001301040650001801053700001401071700001801085700005501103700005901158773013301217856007901350852000901429655001201438IND60604731720221119081414.0180717e20180517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060473172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b008582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Ya-Xun10aCopper-Catalyzed Sulfenylation, Sulfonylation, and Selenylation of 2,3-Allenoic Acids with Disulfides or Diselenides  ap. 6101-6109.  aThe efficient copper-catalyzed sulfenylation and selenylation of 2,3-allenoic acids with disulfides or diselenides were developed, respectively.

Although the individual effects of ECO₂ and cadmium (Cd) on AMF have been widely reported, the response of AMF to ECO₂ + Cd receives little attention. We evaluated the combined effects of ECO₂ and Cd on AMF in the rhizosphere soil and roots of Robinia pseudoacacia L. seedlings. Under ECO₂ + Cd relative to Cd, AMF gene copies and richness in rhizosphere soils increased (p < 0.05) and the diversity reduced (p < 0.05) at 4.5 mg Cd kg⁻¹ dry soil; whereas root AMF abundance at 4.5 mg Cd kg⁻¹ dry soil and the diversity and richness reduced (p < 0.05). Elevated CO₂ caused obvious differences in the dominant genera abundance between rhizosphere soils and roots upon Cd exposure. Responses of C, water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON), pH, and diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA)-Cd in rhizosphere soils and root N to ECO₂ shaped dominant genera in Cd-polluted rhizosphere soils. Levels of DTPA-Cd, WSON, C and pH in rhizosphere soils and C/N ratio, N, and Cd in roots to ECO₂ affected (p < 0.05) dominant genera in roots under Cd exposure. AMF richness and diversity were lower in roots than in rhizosphere soils. Elevated CO₂ altered AMF communities in rhizosphere soils and roots of R. pseudoacacia seedlings exposed to Cd. AMF associated with R. pseudoacacia may be useful/interesting to be used for improving the phytoremediation of Cd under ECO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3acadmium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aenvironment 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3aorganic nitrogen 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3arhizosphere 3asymbionts 3atoxicity 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater solubility 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aAbundance 0aCommunity structure 0aElevated CO2 0aCadmium-contaminated soils 0aPhytoremediation1 aJia, Xia1 aZhao, Yonghua1 aZhang, Chunyan,1 aGao, Yunfen1 aLi, Xiaodi1 aCao, Kemeng1 aZhang, Ningjing0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 May 10, v. 768 p.144453-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1444533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245010800212300001600320520120700336592002801543650002501571650001601596650001301612650001701625650001001642650001901652650001901671650001101690650002501701650001801726650001301744650001301757650001601770650001201786700002501798700002701823700001601850700002601866700002401892700001501916700002101931773011101952856008402063852000902147655001202156IND60681155020221117084537.0200114e20191212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068115502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b034102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiletska, Elena V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0122-176410aProbing Peptide Sequences on Their Ability to Generate Affinity Sites in Molecularly Imprinted Polymers  ap. 279-283.  aAn array of 4000 defined and addressable tripeptides on a polymer-coated glass slide is used to synthesize molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles. This work is undertaken to systematically probe the impact of the peptide sequence on the ability to generate affinity MIPs. The polymer affinity is assessed by measuring the fluorescence of bound MIP nanoparticles at each peptide spot on the surface after washing the array to remove any low-affinity polymer. The generic composition commonly used in the preparation of MIPs against proteins seems to be equally suitable for imprinting hydrophobic and hydrophilic tripeptides. The amino acids frequently contributing to the formation of high-affinity MIPs include T, F, D, N, Y, W, and P. The amino acids that rarely contribute to the formation of high-affinity interactions with MIPs are G, V, A, L, I, and M. These observations are confirmed by computational modeling. The basic technique proposed here may be applicable in optimizing polymer compositions for the production of high-affinity MIPs or, more specifically, for the selection of appropriate amino acid sequences when peptide epitopes are used instead of whole protein imprinting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aepitopes 3afluorescence 3aglass 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amolecular imprinting 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3aproteins 3atripeptides 3awashing1 aGuerreiro, António,1 aMersiyanova, Margarita1 aCowen, Todd1 aCanfarotta, Francesco1 aPiletsky, Stanislav1 aKarim, Kal1 aPiletsky, Sergey0 tLangmuir.g2019 Dec. 12, v. 36, no. 1 p.279-283dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b034103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245017800178520106500356592002801421650002001449650001401469650001401483650001101497650001801508650001601526650002101542650001301563650001401576650001901590653001701609653002401626653001901650653002101669653002701690653002801717700002901745700002001774700002201794700001801816700002001834773010601854856008801960852000902048655001202057IND60745073220221118080310.0211001e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074507322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1127372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThummasan, Montaphat10aPhysiological responses (Hsps 60 and 32, caspase 3, H2O2 scavenging, and photosynthetic activity) of the coral Pocillopora damicornis under thermal and high nitrate stresses  aThis study explored the physiological responses of the coral Pocillopora damicornis to high nitrate concentrations and thermal stresses. The expression of heat shock proteins Hsp60 and Hsp32, Symbiodiniaceae density, Chl a concentration, Fv/Fm, H₂O₂ scavenging, and caspase 3 activity varied during 60 h incubations at 28 °C or 32 °C, ambient or high nitrate (~10 μM) concentrations, and their combinations. In combined stresses, corals showed a rapid and high oxidation level negatively affecting the Symbiodiniaceae density and Chl a concentration at 12 h, followed by caspase 3 and Hsps upregulations that induced apoptosis, bleaching and tissue detachment. Corals under thermal stress showed the highest oxidation and upregulation of Hsps and caspase 3 resulting in coral discoloration. High nitrate treatment alone did not seriously affect the coral function. Results showed that combined stress treatment severely affected coral physiology and, judging from the condition of detached tissues, these corals might have lower chances to recover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSymbiodiniaceae 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acorals 3adiscoloration 3aheat stress 3amarine pollution 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3aphotosynthesis 0aHsp60 and 32 0aHigh nitrate stress 0aThermal stress 0aOxidative stress 0aPocillopora damicornis 0aCaspase 3 and apoptosis1 aCasareto, Beatriz Estela1 aRamphul, Chitra1 aSuzuki, Toshiyuki1 aToyoda, Keita1 aSuzuki, Yoshimi0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Oct., v. 171 p.112737-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1127373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009200155300002000247520153000267592002801797650001301825650001001838650002801848650002501876650001601901650001401917650001101931650001201942650001401954650001201968650002801980650001402008650001402022650000702036650001702043700001602060700002202076700001202098773012502110856007502235852000902310655001202319IND60785806120221120224323.0220728e20220719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078580612DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra04120k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Qiyue10aGeneration of liquid metal double emulsion droplets using gravity-induced microfluidics  ap. 20686-20695.  aSeveral microfluidic applications are available for liquid metal droplet generation, but the surface oxidation of liquid metal has placed limitations on its application. Multiphase microfluidics makes it possible to protect the inner droplets by producing the structure of double emulsion droplets. Thus, the generation of liquid metal double emulsion droplets has been developed to prevent the surface oxidation of Galinstan. However, the generation using common methods faces considerable challenges due to the gravity effect introduced from the high density of liquid metal, making it difficult for the shell phase to wrap the inner phase. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce an innovative method – a gravity-induced microfluidic device – to creatively generate controllable liquid metal double emulsion droplets, achieved by altering the measurable inclination angle of the plane. It is found that when the inclination angle ranges from 30° to 45°, the device manages to generate liquid metal double emulsion droplets with perfect double sphere-type configuration. Additionally, the core–shell liquid metal hydrogel capsules present potential applications as multifunctional materials for controlled release systems in drug delivery and biomedical applications. By regulating pH or imposing mechanical force, the hydrogel shell can be dissolved to recover the electrical conductivity of Galinstan for applications in flexible electronics, self-healing conductors, elastomer electronic skin, and tumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3adrugs 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronics 3aemulsions 3aforces 3agravity 3ahydrogels 3aliquids 3amicrofluidic technology 3aneoplasms 3aoxidation 3apH 3atherapeutics1 aGuo, Yaohao1 aZhao, Shuangliang1 aBao, Bo0 tRSC advances.g2022 July 19, v. 12, no. 32 p.20686-20695dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra04120k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016900169520226800338592002802606650002302634650001602657650001702673650001602690650001102706650001702717650002802734653002402762653002102786653002002807653002702827653002402854700002202878700002302900700002302923700002302946700002402969700002002993773014003013856008503153961001203238852000903250655001203259IND60756925720221116164836.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075692572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1065552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaagsma, Marja10aModel selection and timing of acquisition date impacts classification accuracy: A case study using hyperspectral imaging to detect white pine blister rust over time  aHyperspectral imaging is useful in identifying plant stress over large areas or with large numbers of individuals. The vast data sets make machine learning indispensable, but the choice of machine-learning model, the accuracy of models in extrapolation over time (dynamic data), and timing of measurements require further elucidation. We assessed two metrics of performance for selection of classification model: the predicted accuracy (PA); and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), both from a 10-fold cross-validation. These metrics were calculated for 22 models that were trained to track white pine blister rust disease in seedlings of southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis) on 16 dates. In static data (training and testing data are randomly picked from all dates) PA was comparable with AUC at ranking the models for tested accuracy (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, hereafter referred to as Spearman’s ρ, were 0.58 and 0.54, respectively). However, for dynamic data (training and testing data came from different dates) AUC was more successful at ranking the models for tested accuracy compared to PA (Spearman’s ρ were 0.37 and 0.31, respectively). Classification accuracies were 74.3 % and 75.8 % for the top PA and AUC models when applied to dynamic data. However, using a heterogeneous ensemble output, the accuracies increased to 77.3% (PA) and 77.6% (AUC). In comparison, if we selected the models based on the tested accuracies (which would not be possible in a real-life application), the best accuracy was 77.7% for a support-vector machine with a linear kernel. Classification accuracy was affected by the size of the time gap between training and testing dates as well as the timing of training and test date. The decline in accuracy with time lag was asymmetric, being more pronounced in classifying retrospectively, i.e., when the testing date came before the training date, than vice versa. Thus, for this system training a model on an early date resulted in higher accuracies than training a model on a later date. As for the timing, the highest average accuracies were obtained with a classifier trained on data acquired during the onset of the disease, which in this study was on DOY 116.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus strobiformis 3aagriculture 3acase studies 3aelectronics 3amodels 3aplant stress 3awhite pine blister rust 0aDigital phenotyping 0aMachine learning 0aModel selection 0aHeterogeneous ensemble 0aPhenological change1 aPage, Gerald F.M.1 aJohnson, Jeremy S.1 aStill, Christopher1 aWaring, Kristen M.1 aSniezko, Richard A.1 aSelker, John S.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 Dec., v. 191 p.106555-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1065553Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006600168520130800234592002801542650002201570650001201592650001501604650001001619650001201629650003001641650001501671650001201686650002001698650002101718650001701739650001601756651001001772651001101782653001701793653001501810653001601825653002901841653001301870773013401883856008502017852000902102655001202111IND60745073420221118080010.0220726e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074507342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.1105682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadomski, Tom10aRapoport effects are inconsistently demonstrated through time  aA Rapoport effect is a pattern in which species' geographic range sizes increase toward the poles. Previous work suggested that Pleistocene glaciation caused the extinction of small-ranging species at higher latitudes, resulting in a Rapoport effect among North American mammals. If caused by glaciation, Rapoport effects should be apparent in Pleistocene Europe, where glaciers advanced relatively far south, but not in Asia, where glacial advance was much more limited. Variation in geographic range size in the fossil record of Cenozoic mammals of Europe was quantified, binning fossils into European land mammal ages. Next, the same was done for Cenozoic mammals of Asia, binning by Asian land mammal ages and China faunal ages. By requiring a minimum sample size of ten points to estimate range size, most time bins on either continent were too insufficiently sampled to assess Rapoport effects. A Rapoport effect was found for four of twelve European land mammal ages, but cooling was associated with only one Rapoport effect. A Rapoport effect was never recovered in Asia. After scrutinizing the evidence for North American Rapoport effects among fossil mammals, the overall evidence for glaciation driving Rapoport effects is scant. Support for glaciation causing Rapoport effects is questioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleistocene epoch 3acooling 3aextinction 3afauna 3afossils 3ageographical distribution 3aglaciation 3amammals 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3asample size 3aChina 3aEurope 0aMacroecology 0aGlaciation 0aNull models 0aPaleolatitude calculator 0aCenozoic0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 577 p.110568-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.1105683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245010700164520109100271592002801362650001201390650001701402650001001419650002401429650003101453650002101484650001701505650001701522700002701539700002401566700002201590773012701612856007801739852000901817655001201826IND60751458920221121094147.0210925e20210916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075145892DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100914792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamagno, Elena 10aOxidative Stress and Beta Amyloid in Alzheimer’s Disease. Which Comes First: The Chicken or the Egg?  aThe pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease involves β amyloid (Aβ) accumulation known to induce synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The brain’s vulnerability to oxidative stress (OS) is considered a crucial detrimental factor in Alzheimer’s disease. OS and Aβ are linked to each other because Aβ induces OS, and OS increases the Aβ deposition. Thus, the answer to the question “which comes first: the chicken or the egg?” remains extremely difficult. In any case, the evidence for the primary occurrence of oxidative stress in AD is attractive. Thus, evidence indicates that a long period of gradual oxidative damage accumulation precedes and results in the appearance of clinical and pathological AD symptoms, including Aβ deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, metabolic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Moreover, oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many risk factors for AD. Alzheimer’s disease begins many years before its symptoms, and antioxidant treatment can be an important therapeutic target for attacking the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aantioxidants 3abrain 3acognitive disorders 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3atherapeutics1 aGuglielmotto, Michela 1 aVasciaveo, Valeria 1 aTabaton, Massimo 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Sept. 16, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100914793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010000170520127700270592002801547650001201575650001901587650001101606650001601617650001601633650001301649650000901662650001501671651001101686651002001697651001501717651001101732651001201743651001101755651001001766653001601776653001801792653002801810653003401838653002501872700001701897773011901914856008802033852000902121655001202130IND60752446720221117231600.0211129e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075244672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1505802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, A.10aClimate change impacts on wind energy resources in North America based on the CMIP6 projections  aThe mid- and long-term evolution of wind energy resources in North America is investigated by means of a multi-model ensemble selected from 18 global climate models. The most recent scenarios of greenhouse gases emissions and land use, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), are considered – more specifically, the SSP5-8.5 (intensive emissions) and SSP2-4.5 (moderate emissions). In both scenarios, onshore wind power density in the US and Canada is predicted to drop. Under SSP5-8.5, the reduction is of the order of 15% overall, reaching as much as 40% in certain northern regions – Quebec and Nunavut in Canada and Alaska in the US. Conversely, significant increases in wind power density are predicted in Hudson Bay (up to 25%), Texas and northern Mexico (up to 15%), southern Mexico and Central America (up to 30%). As for the intra-annual variability, it is poised to rise drastically, with monthly average wind power densities increasing up to 120% in certain months and decreasing up to 60% in others. These changes in both the mean value and the intra-annual variability of wind power density are of consequence for the Levelised Cost of Energy from wind, the planning of future investments and, more generally, the contribution of wind to the energy mix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3agreenhouses 3aland use 3awind 3awind power 3aAlaska 3aCentral America 3aHudson Bay 3aMexico 3aNunavut 3aQuebec 3aTexas 0aWind energy 0aOffshore wind 0aMarine renewable energy 0aShared socioeconomic pathways 0aMulti-model ensemble1 aIglesias, G.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.150580-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1505803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100002500185245008300210506007600293506003100369520138400400592002801784596007001812596008301882596007001965596004502035506003702080650000802117650001802125650001802143650001702161650001002178650001602188650001602204650000902220650002302229650001302252650002602265653002702291653001702318653001302335653001002348653001902358700001702377700002402394700005702418773012502475856008202600961001302682852000902695655001202704IND60755064720221207074649.0220222e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075506472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1126862chorus7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1126862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassmann, Camille M.14aThe effects of fungal bioprocessing on air-classified pea protein concentrates  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aYellow peas are a high-protein pulse crop with many potential food applications. Air-classified protein products are gaining popularity for their conserved native functionality and environmental benefits. However, air-classification of yellow peas has a few challenges preventing products from entering food markets, including fiber contamination and off-flavors/smells. A commonly recognized source of these off-flavor is due to the presence of saponins, compounds produced as secondary metabolites as a response to pathogens or environmental stress. Fungal fermentation has the potential to improve quality and broaden the applications of air-classified pea proteins in food markets. This study included a 120 h fermentation of air classified pea proteins (0.52 g/g protein) using 6 fungal organisms. Fermented material was analyzed for total phenolic content (TPC), saponin profile, mass balance, soluble and insoluble dietary fibers, and crude protein. Results indicate that fermentation can alter functional characteristics of air classified pea proteins. These alterations include potential increases in TPC, protein content, protein solubility, saponin content, and fiber fractions. Overall, these results demonstrate potential benefits of microbial fermentation processes for new and improved plant protein sources, specifically in underutilized crops like yellow peas.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cSouth Dakota State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008213  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3abioprocessing 3acrude protein 3afermentation 3afungi 3aoff flavors 3apea protein 3apeas 3aprotein solubility 3asaponins 3asecondary metabolites 0aTotal phenolic content 0aFermentation 0aSaponins 0aFiber 0aPlant proteins1 aBerhow, Mark1 aGibbons, William R.1 aKarki, Bishnu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9220-01030 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 154 p.112686-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1126863Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245007600208520172600284592002802010650004402038650001502082650001202097650001502109650001102124650001102135650002202146650001202168650001202180650001002192650001102202650001402213650001302227650001102240650001502251650001402266653002702280653001902307653002602326653000902352653001802361653001402379700002302393773011402416856008602530852000902616655001202625IND60742324320221120181819.0210911e20210910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074232432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1280652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemida, Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8651-553610aGuayule resin: An innovative bioresource for asphalt cement replacement  aNovel resources can contribute to replacing asphalt with sustainable, flexible pavement options. In this study, asphalt was replaced by guayule resin as a bioresource by-product extracted during guayule natural rubber production. Crumb rubber modifier (CRM) was used as an asphalt enhancer. According to the Superpave criteria, the designated binders were exposed to tests covering the construction process (mixing and compaction requirements), rutting, fatigue, and thermal cracking resistances through viscosity, high-, intermediate-, and low-temperature measurements, respectively. The original, short-term aging, and long-term aging conditions were simulated using tank, rolling thin film oven, and pressure aging vessel materials, respectively. Additionally, component analysis using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was performed to link the rheological properties with the chemical changes. Outcomes showed a relatively lower viscosity for guayule resin than asphalt at the same high-temperature grade, thus indicating savings in plant energy consumption and environmental emissions. The CRM enhanced guayule, but not as much as asphalt, as proven by polymeric component migration through the liquid binder. This enhancement was reflected in the rheological performance in addition to other factors. The as-received guayule resin had a high oxygen content confirmed by strong absorption peak intensities of oxidative bonds (e.g., Carbonyl and sulfoxide). Such pre-oxidation was negatively reflected in the intermediate- and low-temperature performances of guayule resin and guayule-based binders. However, the investigated guayule resin compensated for asphalt replacement by 23–42% of the blend's weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3abitumen 3abyproducts 3acement 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3aguayule 3aliquids 3aovens 3aoxygen 3apavements 3apolymers 3arubber 3asulfoxides 3aviscosity 0aAsphalt sustainability 0aAsphalt rubber 0aCrumb rubber modifier 0aFTIR 0aGuayule resin 0aSuperpave1 aAbdelrahman, Magdy0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 314 p.128065-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1280653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009500170300001600265520116700281592002801448650001601476650002201492650001501514650001301529650001001542650002201552650000901574650001701583650001601600650001501616650001801631650001401649650002801663650001401691650001401705650002301719700001801742700002201760700002201782700002101804700002001825700002101845700001801866773011301884856008201997852000902079655001202088IND60112296820221121045532.0141110e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011229682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2011.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMezaki, Yoshihiro10aCharacterization of a cellular retinol-binding protein from lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum  ap. 233-239.  aLampreys are ancestral representatives of vertebrates known as jawless fish. The Japanese lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum, is a parasitic member of the lampreys known to store large amounts of vitamin A within its body. How this storage is achieved, however, is wholly unknown. Within the body, the absorption, transfer and metabolism of vitamin A are regulated by a family of proteins called retinoid-binding proteins. Here we have cloned a cDNA for cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) from the Japanese lamprey, and phylogenetic analysis suggests that lamprey CRBP is an ancestor of both CRBP I and II. The lamprey CRBP protein was expressed in bacteria and purified. Binding of the lamprey CRBP to retinol (Kd of 13.2nM) was identified by fluorimetric titration. However, results obtained with the protein fluorescence quenching technique indicated that lamprey CRBP does not bind to retinal. Northern blot analysis showed that lamprey CRBP mRNA was ubiquitously expressed, although expression was most abundant in the intestine. Together, these results suggest that lamprey CRBP has an important role in absorbing vitamin A from the blood of host animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLethenteron 3aNorthern blotting 3aabsorption 3abacteria 3ablood 3acomplementary DNA 3afish 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3aintestines 3amessenger RNA 3aphylogeny 3aretinol-binding protein 3atitration 3avitamin A 3avitamin metabolism1 aMorii, Mayako1 aYoshikawa, Kiwamu1 aYamaguchi, Noriko1 aMiura, Mitsutaka1 aImai, Katsuyuki1 aYoshino, Hiroaki1 aSenoo, Haruki0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2012 Mar., v. 161, no. 3 p.233-239dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2011.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245016100174520115600335592002801491650002101519650002401540650001401564650001801578650001801596650001701614650001101631650002101642650001601663650001501679650001401694650001201708650001901720650002601739650001501765650001701780650001701797650001101814653001701825653001701842653002301859653003001882653002301912700001701935700001601952700002201968773010001990856008702090852000902177655001202186IND60699739120221120031001.0200809e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069973912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1273062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarag, Mohamed A.10aSweet and bitter oranges: An updated comparative review of their bioactives, nutrition, food quality, therapeutic merits and biowaste valorization practices  aSweet and bitter oranges are two of the most commercially-important fruit with a total world production of 75.4 Mt, well-recognized for their unique sensory characters in addition to multiple nutritive and therapeutic attributes due to their highly-valued bioactive ingredients. Hence, their differential qualitative/quantitative phytochemical make-ups are presented for better utilization as therapeutic agents. Sweet orange exhibits therapeutic applications as being effective anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and hypocholesterolemic agents. Whereas, for anti-osteoporotic products and intestinal dysbiosis treatment, bitter orange is more preferred. Moreover, the review recapitulates on different valorization practices of citrus bio-wastes and utilization of their bioactives as therapeutic agents and in functional food industry. Sweet orange waste functions as a fat replacer and preservative to increase food shelf life with better organoleptic attributes than bitter orange. The detailed action mechanism and safety of Citrus bioactives, as well as processing technologies to further improve its effects are posed as future research perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus aurantium 3abioactive compounds 3adysbiosis 3afat replacers 3afood industry 3afood quality 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3aingredients 3aintestines 3anutrition 3aoranges 3aphytochemicals 3aprocessing technology 3ashelf life 3asour oranges 3atherapeutics 3awastes 0aC. sinensis. 0aSweet orange 0aBitter/sour orange 0aPhytochemical composition 0aWaste valorization1 aAbib, Bishoy1 aAyad, Laila1 aKhattab, Amira R.0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Nov. 30, v. 331 p.127306-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1273063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245013900202300001800341500002000359520176200379592002802141596004502169596004502214650001302259650002202272650001602294650001702310650001002327650001602337650001802353650001802371650002302389650001602412650001402428650000702442650001502449650001302464650001002477650002302487650001602510650001802526700002602544700002502570700005702595700005802652773015202710856007302862852000902935655001202944IND60620607820221117213119.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062060782DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.129892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherdthong, Anusorn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8719-440410aEffect of beta‐glucan supplementation on feed intake, digestibility of nutrients and ruminal fermentation in Thai native beef cattle  ap. 1509-1514.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ß‐glucan on feed intake, digestibility of nutrients and ruminal fermentation in Thai native beef cattle that were fed low‐quality roughage. Four, Thai native beef cattle with initial body weight (BW) of 100 ± 20.0 kg were randomly assigned according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design to receive four treatment by ß‐glucan at 0, 1.6, 3.1 and 4.7 g/day respectively. Supplementation of ß‐glucan at 0–4.7 g in cattle did not affect the intake of DM, OM, CP, NDF or ADF. However, supplementation with ß‐glucan significantly improved rice straw intake (g/kg BW⁰.⁷⁵), compared to the nonsupplemented group (p < 0.05), so rice straw intake was higher than in the group without ß‐glucan supplementation. In addition, total feed intake increased with the higher level of ß‐glucan supplementation. The estimated energy intake was not altered by ß‐glucan supplementation (p > 0.05). The experimental diet had no effect (p > 0.05) on the apparent digestibility of DM, OM, NDF or ADF. However, the digestibility of CP was significantly different among treatment and supplementation at 4.7 g/day ß‐glucan which was the highest level (63.2%) among all diets. ß‐glucan supplementation did not affect rumen pH, temperature or ruminal NH₃‐N concentration. In addition, blood urea‐N levels were similar among experimental groups. The population of protozoa at 4 hr post‐feeding increased along with ß‐glucan supplementation and was highest at 4.7 g of ß‐glucan. Based on this experiment, it could be concluded that supplementation of ß‐glucan at 4.7 g improved rice straw intake, as well as total intake and digestibility of CP in Thai native beef cattle.  aPublisher supplied data  aIRN57W0002cThailand Research Fund (TRF)  aIRG5980010cThailand Research Fund (TRF) 3aProtozoa 3aammonium nitrogen 3abeef cattle 3abeta-glucans 3ablood 3abody weight 3adigestibility 3aenergy intake 3aexperimental diets 3afeed intake 3anutrients 3apH 3arice straw 3aroughage 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3atemperature 3aurea nitrogen1 aSeankamsorn, Anuthida1 aSuriyapha, Chaichana1 aChanjula, Pin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3507-390X1 aWanapat, Metha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7633-052X0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2018 Dec., v. 102, no. 6 p.1509-1514dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.129893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01796naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009100157300001800248520076300266592002801029650001301057650001601070650002301086650002301109650002201132650001401154700001601168700002001184700002701204700002301231773012001254856007501374852000901449655001201458IND60550031220221122043542.0160909e20130906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055003122DNAL7 a10.1021/jo400852z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaes, Pieter10aPalladium(II)-Catalyzed Synthesis of 2H,3′H-Spiro[benzofuran-3,2′-naphthoquinones]  ap. 8330-8339.  a2H,3′H-Spiro[benzofuran-3,2′-naphthoquinones], constituting a new spiroheterocyclic skeleton, were synthesized starting from 2-aryloxymethyl-1,4-naphthoquinones by means of a palladium(II)-catalyzed reaction, which is a new spirocyclic transformation.

Nevertheless, the impact of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on nerve regeneration regulated by macrophage polarization has not been well studied, and it is also not clear whether the introduction of the magnetic field has a further effect. Therefore, mesoporous hollow Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles (MHFPs) were synthesized. We selected an alternating magnetic field (AMF) because it may confer a stronger effect on MHFPs as compared to a static magnetic field, and then explored the field's ability to induce macrophage polarization. Furthermore, the effects of this regulation on other neuro-associated cells were also explored. Our results suggest that MHFPs can efficiently induce polarization of macrophages at the concentration of 40 μg mL⁻¹, upregulate the expression of related genes and cytokines, and further promote the proliferation of neural stem cells and the subsequent migration of vascular endothelial cells. These effects were significantly enhanced after the application of an AMF. This work also showed that the internalization of particles is the starting point for polarization regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3acytokines 3airon oxides 3amacrophages 3amagnetic fields 3anerve regeneration 3aporous media1 aWu, Xiaopei1 aWei, Wenying1 aWang, Youfa1 aDai, Honglian0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 July 27, v. 10, no. 29 p.5633-5643dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2tb00527a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245013700163520119300300592002801493650003601521650001401557650002001571650001401591650002001605650001701625650001701642650003701659650002101696650002801717700001501745700001901760700002001779700001801799700001901817700001801836773012701854856007801981852000902059655001202068IND60751459420221121094158.0210925e20210917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075145942DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100914862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hee-Weon 10aGlyoxal-Lysine Dimer, an Advanced Glycation End Product, Induces Oxidative Damage and Inflammatory Response by Interacting with RAGE  aThe glyoxal-lysine dimer (GOLD), which is a glyoxal (GO)-derived advanced glycation end product (AGE), is produced by the glycation reaction. In this study, we evaluated the effect of GOLD on the oxidative damage and inflammatory response in SV40 MES 13 mesangial cells. GOLD significantly increased the linkage with the V-type immunoglobulin domain of RAGE, a specific receptor of AGE. We found that GOLD treatment increased RAGE expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mesangial cells. GOLD remarkably regulated the protein and mRNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and glyoxalase 1 (GLO1). In addition, mitochondrial deterioration and inflammation occurred via GOLD-induced oxidative stress in mesangial cells. GOLD regulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the release of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the inflammatory mechanism of mesangial cells. Furthermore, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses triggered by GOLD were suppressed through RAGE inhibition using RAGE siRNA. These results demonstrate that the interaction of GOLD and RAGE plays an important role in the function of mesangial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced glycation end products 3acytokines 3agene expression 3aglycation 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainflammation 3amitochondria 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species1 aGu, Min Ji1 aKim, Yoonsook 1 aLee, Jee-Young 1 aLee, Seungju 1 aChoi, In-Wook 1 aHa, Sang Keun0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Sept. 17, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100914863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01481naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010300166300001800269520038000287592002800667650002300695650002800718650002200746650002200768650001200790700002000802700006200822700006200884773013300946856007901079852000901158655001201167IND60604732520221119081409.0180717e20180518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060473252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b008902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshioka, Shohei10aCascade Multiple Diels–Alder Reactions of Styrene Derivatives with Maleimide or Maleic Anhydride  ap. 6599-6606.  aWe developed novel one-pot multiple Diels–Alder reactions, which are frequently used in the construction of six-membered rings in functional molecular synthesis.

Herein, the dynamic change of volatile profiles of green tea under different temperature gradients and duration were analyzed by using gas phase electronic nose (GC-E-Nose) and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) combined with multivariate statistical analysis. A total of 33 compounds were identified. Three drying stages could be clearly discriminated from the samples with different drying time, and 20-min-drying was a key transition point. 3-Methylbutanal, isopropyl alcohol, methyl benzoate, and heptanal were found to play an important role in discrimination of the above three stages, basing on variable importance in projection ＞1.2 and p＜0.01. The volatile profiles changed dynamically with increasing drying temperature, and the significant change occurred under the temperature of 105 °C. In addition, the GC-E-Nose could quickly and effectively characterize the dynamic changes under different drying conditions, and verified and complemented the GC-IMS analysis results. This study provides comprehensive insight into variation in the volatile metabolite profile during the drying process of green tea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic nose 3agreen tea 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amultivariate analysis 3aodors 3aspectroscopy 3avolatile compounds 0aDrying 0aGreen tea 0aGC-IMS 0aGC-E-Nose 0aMultivariate statistical analysis 0a3-Methylbutanal (PubChem CID: 11552) 0aIsopropyl alcohol (PubChem CID: 3776) 0aMethyl benzoate (PubChem CID: 7150) 0aHeptanal (PubChem CID: 8130) 0a2-Pentylfuran (PubChem CID: 19602)1 aChen, Jiayu1 aJiang, Yongwen1 aQian, Michael,1 aDeng, Yuliang1 aXie, Jialing1 aLi, Jia1 aWang, Jinjin1 aDong, Chunwang1 aYuan, Haibo0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 154 p.112691-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1126913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245014000165520170100305592002802006650001102034650003102045650001702076650001002093650001902103650001302122650001302135650001502148650004202163650001702205650001602222650001802238650001002256650002002266650001402286650001702300650003402317650002202351650002502373650002102398700002902419700002302448700002402471700002702495700002802522773012702550856007802677852000902755655001202764IND60751459620221121094238.0210925e20210917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075145962DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100914872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeephat, Sariya 10aDiosmetin Ameliorates Vascular Dysfunction and Remodeling by Modulation of Nrf2/HO-1 and p-JNK/p-NF-κB Expression in Hypertensive Rats  aDiosmetin is a citrus flavonoid that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study examined the effect of diosmetin on blood pressure and vascular alterations and its underlying mechanisms in experimentally hypertensive rats. Male Sprague rats were administered Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester L-NAME for five weeks and were given diosmetin at doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg or captopril (5 mg/kg) for two weeks. Diosmetin alleviated hypertension, improved endothelial dysfunction, and suppressed the overactivity of sympathetic nerve-mediated vasoconstriction in aorta and mesentery hypertensive rats (p < 0.05). Increases in plasma and aortic tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and carotid superoxide generations and reductions of plasma superoxide dismutase, catalase, and nitric oxide in hypertensive rats were ameliorated by diosmetin (p < 0.05). Diosmetin increased the protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in hypertensive rats. Furthermore, diosmetin mitigated hypertrophy and collagen accumulation of the aortic wall in L-NAME rats. It exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing interleukin-6 (IL-6) accumulation and by overexpressing the phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinases (p-JNK) and the phospho-nuclear factor-kappaB (p-NF-κB) proteins in the aorta (p < 0.05). Captopril was a positive control substance and had similar effects to diosmetin. In summary, diosmetin reduced blood pressure and alleviated vascular abnormalities in L-NAME-treated rats. These effects might be related to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well as to the modulation of the expression of the Nrf2/HO1 and p-JNK/NF-κB proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aaorta 3ablood pressure 3acatalase 3acollagen 3aflavonoids 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahypertension 3ahypertrophy 3ainterleukin-6 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amesentery 3anitric oxide 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aprotein synthesis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avasoconstriction1 aPrasatthong, Patoomporn 1 aPotue, Prapassorn 1 aBunbupha, Sarawoot 1 aPakdeechote, Poungrat 1 aManeesai, Putcharawipa 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Sept. 17, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100914873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245019500208300001400403520136300417592002801780650001401808650001301822650002101835650002601856650001201882650002501894650001601919650001101935650001701946650001401963650001501977650000901992650002202001650001302023650002302036651001102059653001202070653001402082653001102096653004002107653000902147653001702156653001002173700001502183700001502198700001802213700001402231700001602245700001502261700001502276700001302291700001302304700001502317700001402332773010202346856008702448852000902535655001202544IND60564059620221121031938.0180904e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056405962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetit, J.-E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1516-592710aCharacterising an intense PM pollution episode in March 2015 in France from multi-site approach and near real time data: Climatology, variabilities, geographical origins and model evaluation  ap. 68-84.  aDuring March 2015, a severe and large-scale particulate matter (PM) pollution episode occurred in France. Measurements in near real-time of the major chemical composition at four different urban background sites across the country (Paris, Creil, Metz and Lyon) allowed the investigation of spatiotemporal variabilities during this episode. A climatology approach showed that all sites experienced clear unusual rain shortage, a pattern that is also found on a longer timescale, highlighting the role of synoptic conditions over Wester-Europe. This episode is characterized by a strong predominance of secondary pollution, and more particularly of ammonium nitrate, which accounted for more than 50% of submicron aerosols at all sites during the most intense period of the episode. Pollution advection is illustrated by similar variabilities in Paris and Creil (distant of around 100 km), as well as trajectory analyses applied on nitrate and sulphate. Local sources, especially wood burning, are however found to contribute to local/regional sub-episodes, notably in Metz. Finally, simulated concentrations from Chemistry-Transport model CHIMERE were compared to observed ones. Results highlighted different patterns depending on the chemical components and the measuring site, reinforcing the need of such exercises over other pollution episodes and sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aaerosols 3aammonium nitrate 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aburning 3achemical composition 3aclimatology 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollution 3aprovenance 3arain 3aspatial variation 3asulfates 3atemporal variation 3aFrance 0aAerosol 0aPollution 0aFrance 0aAerosol chemical speciation monitor 0aACSM 0aAethalometer 0aModel1 aAmodeo, T.1 aMeleux, F.1 aBessagnet, B.1 aMenut, L.1 aGrenier, D.1 aPellan, Y.1 aOckler, A.1 aRocq, B.1 aGros, V.1 aSciare, J.1 aFavez, O.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Apr., v. 155 p.68-84dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245014000177300001600317520133200333592002801665650001601693650001101709650001101720650002201731650001301753650000901766650002001775650003101795650001001826650002401836650002301860650002101883650004301904650001401947650002001961650004201981650002002023650002902043650001602072650001402088700002602102700003102128773011302159856008202272852000902354655001202363IND60112297320221121071614.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011229732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2012.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasibhushan, Sirigineedi10aDiapause specific gene expression in the eggs of multivoltine silkworm Bombyx mori, identified by suppressive subtractive hybridization  ap. 371-379.  aMolecular mechanism controlling egg diapause remains obscure in silkworm, Bombyx mori. An attempt is made to decipher various molecular events occurring during embryonic diapause in multivoltine silkworm, B. mori. Using suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH), 186 cDNA clones isolated from both diapause and nondiapause eggs were sequenced. Of the sequenced clones, 29 matched with silkbase entries and these identified putative genes were classified into six functional groups such as regulatory, food utilization, stress response, metabolic, ribosomal and transposable elements. Among these genes, twelve belonged to regulatory group while, one taste receptor type 2 member 117 gene was related to food utilization. One heat shock cognate 70kDa protein and 3 of the ubiquitin family were identified under stress response category. Similarly, four genes were identified as metabolic genes, 3 belonging to chitin family and one propanediol utilization protein. Of the seven genes identified in ribosomal groups, most of them were 60s ribosomal protein subunits. However, one negative regulation of transcription gene identified was a transposable element. The qPCR analysis confirmed the expression of 21 of the above genes, wherein, 6 were upregulated during diapause, 12 during non-diapause, while, 3 remained unchanged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3achitin 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3adiapause 3aeggs 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3amultivoltine habit 3aprotein subunits 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asilkworms 3astress response 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3ataste receptors 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransposons 3aubiquitin1 aPonnuvel, Kangayam M.1 aVijayaprakash, Nanjappa B.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2012 Apr., v. 161, no. 4 p.371-379dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2012.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245017000210520129900380592002801679650002201707650002201729650002501751650001101776650002701787650002501814650001701839650001901856650001001875650002301885650002101908650001801929650001601947650003201963650001201995650001202007650003902019650001202058650000902070650001702079650001902096653001702115653002202132653001902154653003902173653001602212700006602228700002802294700006102322700006902383700006102452700002402513700006502537773012502602856008102727852000902808655001202817IND60755065220221120113631.0220222e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075506522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1126922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomjai, Chalermkwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0347-497910aEffect of drying process and long-term storage on characterization of Longan pulps and their biological aspects: Antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibition activities  aImpacts of the drying process (DP) and long-term storage (LTS) of longan pulp products were evaluated for fresh longan pulp (FLP), golden dried longan pulp (GDLP), dried whole longan pulp (DWLP) and dried whole longan pulp after one-year storage (DWLP_1Y) by assessing physicochemical properties against glycosylation reaction and bioactivities. All dried longan pulp products were defined as intermediate moisture food (IMF). GDLP containing sulfur dioxide had a lower browning index, whereas DWLP attained light brown to intense brown color after the storage period. Interestingly, DWLP_1Y exhibited a remarkable increase in rare sugars and monosaccharides especially d-allose, d-allulose and d-mannose. Reduction of total amino acid content and free α-amino groups in DWLP_1Y and SDS-PAGE results confirmed the occurrence of glycosylation (Maillard reaction) between amino acids and reducing sugars in pulps after DP and LTS. DWLP_1Y had the highest potential for antioxidative capacity and inhibition activity on acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes, with potential use as a functional food and/or bioactive ingredient for treating Alzheimer's disease. This research paved the way for increasing the economic value of longan pulp products containing potent bioactivities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aMaillard reaction 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aallose 3aamino acid composition 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acholinesterase 3acolor 3aeconomic valuation 3afunctional foods 3aglycosylation 3aingredients 3aintermediate moisture foods 3alongans 3amannose 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apsicose 3apulp 3astorage time 3asulfur dioxide 0aLongan pulps 0aLong-term storage 0aDrying process 0aCholinesterase inhibition activity 0aAntioxidant1 aSiriwoharn, Thanyaporn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9060-36621 aKulprachakarn, Kanokwan1 aChaipoot, Supakit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9817-306X1 aPhongphisutthinant, Rewat1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1038-176X1 aChaiyana, Wantida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2868-70491 aSrinuanpan, Sirasit1 aWiriyacharee, Pairote1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7052-07790 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 154 p.112692-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1126923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245015300156300001800309500002000327520178600347592002802133596004702161596003002208650002602238650001302264650001202277650001302289650001502302650002002317650001102337650002102348650002102369650001202390650001902402650002202421650001302443650002702456650001402483650002302497650002302520650001402543650001602557700001902573700002402592700002302616700002102639700001802660700005902678773015202737856007302889852000902962655001202971IND60620608220221117213116.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062060822DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.129722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shaopu10aEffect of immune modulators on in vitro activation and proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multiparous Holstein cows peripartum  ap. 1515-1520.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis in vitro study examined the ability of important immune modulators [β‐hydroxybutyrate (BHB), cortisol, prolactin, isoproterenol and insulin] to influence the responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from multiparous dairy cows 29 ± 2 days before and 14 ± 3 days after calving. The activation and proliferation of PBMC in response to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin was estimated by the oxygen consumption rate after 24 hr and the MTT (3‐[4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl]‐2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method after 72 hr respectively. In early lactation, the presence of 2 compared to 0.5 mmol/L BHB reduced PBMC activation (p < 0.05) and proliferation (p < 0.10), and the presence of 0.7 compared to 0.2 ng/ml insulin enhanced (p < 0.10) PBMC proliferation. In dry cows, the presence of low concentrations of BHB and insulin and both concentrations of prolactin (20 vs. 300 ng/ml) and isoproterenol (70 vs. 130 ng/L) enhanced activation (p < 0.10), but not proliferation (p ≥ 0.10) compared to cultures with no modulator addition. The presence or absence of high or low concentrations of hydrocortisone (20 vs. 45 nmol/L) did not (p ≥ 0.10) influence the activation and proliferation of PBMC from dry and early lactating cows. It is tempting to speculate that in antepartum PBMC the modulators represented an energy source or positive extrinsic signals to use nutrients for the activation process. On the other hand, PBMC from postpartum cows are known to be exposed to a metabolic challenging endocrine background. Under such conditions, high BHB concentrations and high insulin concentrations seem to act as negative and positive signals for PBMC, respectively, to utilize nutrients for activation and proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data  aSCHW1485/3‐1cGerman Research Foundation  cChina Scholarship Council 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aHolstein 3acalving 3acortisol 3adairy cows 3aearly lactation 3aenergy 3aimmunomodulators 3ain vitro studies 3ainsulin 3aisoproterenols 3alactating females 3amitogens 3amononuclear leukocytes 3anutrients 3aoxygen consumption 3aphytohemagglutinin 3aprolactin 3atetrazolium1 aMeese, Susanne1 aUlbrich, Susanne E.1 aBollwein, Heinrich1 aRöntgen, Monika1 aGimsa, Ulrike1 aSchwarm, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5750-21110 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2018 Dec., v. 102, no. 6 p.1515-1520dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.129723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245007800164520111500242592002801357650001101385650001301396650001601409650002201425650001601447650002501463650001001488653002901498653002201527653001601549700001901565773010601584856008601690852000901776655001201785IND60745074420221118084752.0210911e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074507442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.1135292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCima, M.10aSalivary cortisol patterns in psychopathic and non-psychopathic offenders  aPrevious research has described diverse biological correlates of the psychopathic personality. Efforts to understand the underpinnings of low fear responses in psychopathic individuals have drawn attention to the possible role of abnormalities in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, but studies to date have been largely limited to youth or to adult community samples. The current study therefore examined morning basal cortisol levels and responses to a psychosocial stress task in a forensic clinical sample of psychopathic offenders (n = 14), non-psychopathic offenders (n = 22), and non-offender controls (n = 14). Morning cortisol levels were similar in all three groups. Throughout the stress task, psychopathic offenders showed significantly lower cortisol than controls; non-psychopathic offenders showed a similar but non-significant trend towards lower cortisol. The three groups did not differ, however, in cortisol response slopes. Implications of these findings are discussed in the framework of current theories about biological mechanisms underlying psychopathic personality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acortisol 3afearfulness 3aforensic sciences 3apersonality 3apsychological stress 3ayouth 0aPsychopathic personality 0aStress reactivity 0aStress test1 aNicolson, N.A.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 239 p.113529-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.1135293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012700163300001800290520049000308592002800798650001600826650002300842650002300865650002300888650001400911650001100925650001100936650001100947650002200958650001400980650001700994700002601011773012001037856007501157852000901232655001201241IND60550031820221122015014.0160909e20130906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055003182DNAL7 a10.1021/jo400974k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCormick, Lucas

This work examines the feasibility of using soil gas data collected at some distance from the source zone for the application of the Rn deficit technique for the identification and quantification of NAPL contamination. To this end, we used a steady-state 1-D analytical solution that is based on a 3-layer model that allows to simulate the transport and distribution of Rn in the source zone, capillary fringe and overlying unsaturated soil. The analytical solution was first validated against a more detailed numerical model available in the literature. Then, a series of simulations were carried out to evaluate the vertical concentration profiles of Rn in soil gas above the source zone and in background location not impacted by NAPL. Simulation results showed that the parameters that most influence the migration and distribution of Rn in the subsurface are the distance of the soil gas probe from the source zone and, to a lower extent, the type of contamination (e.g. diesel or gasoline) and the soil type. On the basis of these results, we developed some easy-to-use nomographs to estimate the residual NAPL phase based on the observed radon deficit in soil gas and on the probe to source distance and soil and NAPL characteristics. According to the obtained results, the radon deficit technique results a feasible method for a qualitative identification of residual NAPL when radon in soil gas is measured at distances lower than 2 m from the contaminated zone. However, for an accurate quantitative estimation of the NAPL phase content, soil gas probes should be preferably located at distances lower than 1 m from the source zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary fringe 3aenvironment 3agasoline 3amathematical models 3anomogram 3aradon 3asoil air 3asoil types 0aRadon deficit technique 0aSoil gas monitoring 0aNAPL delineation 0aReactive transport modeling1 aVerginelli, Iason1 aBaciocchi, Renato0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.150593-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1505933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01430naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009800156300001800254520042400272592002800696650002300724650002100747650002500768650001500793650002200808650001400830700002200844700001700866700001700883773012000900856007501020852000901095655001201104IND60550031920221122015259.0160909e20130906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055003192DNAL7 a10.1021/jo401032r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yaguang10aOxidative Heck Reaction of Glycals and Aryl Hydrazines: A Palladium-Catalyzed C-Glycosylation  ap. 8821-8825.  aAn efficient Heck-type C-glycosylation of glycals via the C–N bond cleavage of aryl hydrazines has been developed.

HMT decreased glycemic index and pasting viscosity, but increased pasting temperature and onset temperature relative to non-treated rice flour. High-amylose rice flour exhibited significantly higher pasting temperature and lower glycemic index than that with low amylose content. Rice flour dumplings prepared with 0, 40, 50, or 60% w/w HMT flour demonstrated differing texture profiles and sensory characteristics. Pearson's correlation showed that the amylose content of the rice flour used to make the dumplings was positively correlated (p < 0.01) with their hardness and negatively correlated (p < 0.01) with their adhesiveness, cohesiveness, and overall acceptance score. In addition, the glycemic index decreased with increasing HMT flour proportion. It was therefore concluded that HMT of rice flour could be used to achieve product acceptance with a lower glycemic index by compromising between physicochemical properties and sensory quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aamylose 3acohesion 3acultivars 3aglycemic index 3ahardness 3aheat 3arice 3arice flour 3asensory properties 3atemperature 3atexture 3aviscosity 0aHeat moisture treatment 0aRice flour 0aRice dumpling 0aLower glycemic index1 aLuangsakul, Naphatrapi0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 154 p.112694-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1126943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008700154300001800241520094700259592002801206650001401234650002501248650001201273650001101285650001301296700001701309700001901326700001901345700001601364773014301380856007501523852000901598655001201607IND60785807320221120224341.0220728e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078580732DNAL7 a10.1039/d2tb00922f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xinyu10aEnzyme-activated prodrugs and their release mechanisms for the treatment of cancer  ap. 5504-5519.  aEnzyme-activated prodrugs have received a lot of attention in recent years. These prodrugs have low toxicity to cells before they are activated; when they interact with specific enzymes, they can effectively release anticancer drugs, thereby achieving the effect of treating cancer. At the same time, compared with other thiol-activated prodrugs, reactive oxygen species-activated prodrugs, and acid-activated prodrugs, the specificity of enzyme-activated prodrugs is stronger; therefore, these prodrugs have greater development potential. In this review, we summarize the different release mechanisms of prodrugs on the basis of enzyme-activated prodrugs, such as enzyme reduction, enzymatic hydrolysis, enzyme-activated and light-radiation-assisted release, and enzymatic-activated and nanoparticle-assisted release mechanisms. A profound understanding of these release mechanisms will contribute to the design of enzyme-activated prodrugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymes 3aoxygen 3atoxicity1 aHuo, Fangjun1 aZhang, Yongbin1 aCheng, Fangqin1 aYin, Caixia0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 July 27, v. 10, no. 29 p.5504-5519dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2tb00922f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245016100172300001800333520132700351592002801678650001101706650002301717650002301740650001101763650001101774650002201785650001301807650001401820650002101834700001901855700006301874773013301937856007902070852000902149655001202158IND60604732920221119081531.0180717e20180510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060473292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b009002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Siripuram Vijay10aSynthesis of 2,4,5-Trisubstituted Oxazoles with Complementary Regioselectivity from α-Oxoketene Dithioacetals and β-(Methylthio)-β-(het)aryl-2-propenones  ap. 6607-6622.  aAn efficient protocol for the synthesis of 2,5-substituted 4-acyloxazoles and the related 2,4-substituted 5-acyloxazoles with complementary regioselectivity from the corresponding α-oxoketene dithioacetals or β-(het)aryl/(methylthio)enone precursors has been reported. In the first protocol, the α-oxoketene dithioacetals or β-(methylthio)enones were converted to the corresponding α-bromo-β-(methylthio)enones followed by copper catalyzed inter/intramolecular annulation of these intermediates with various primary amides affording 2-(het)aryl/alkyl-4-(het)aroyl-5-(methylthio)/(het)aryloxazoles via concomitant formation of the C4–N and C5–O bond via enamide intermediates. In the second approach, the starting α-oxoketene dithioacetals or β-(methylthio)-β-(het)arylenones were subjected to base induced conjugate addition–elimination with various primary amides to furnish β-aroylenamides, which, on subsequent iodine catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C–H functionalization/C–O bond formation, afforded the corresponding regioisomeric 2-(het)aryl/alkyl-4-(methylthio)/(het)aryl-5-(het)aroyloxazoles in excellent yields. The methodology has also been extended for the synthesis of regioisomeric 4- or 5-aminooxazoles and 4- or 5-(n-butyl)oxazoles from the corresponding 4- or 5-(methylthio)oxazoles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acopper 3aiodine 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxazoles 3aprotocols 3aregioselectivity1 aAcharya, Anand1 aIla, Hiriyakkanavar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6971-83740 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2018 May 10, v. 83, no. 12 p.6607-6622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b009003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01418naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013100169300001600300520055800316592002800874650002100902650002100923650001900944773011000963856008201073852000901155655001201164IND60619375620221121235227.0181031e196306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061937562DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517563033006012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichie, R.

In this study, the effect of CO₂ on nucleation and spherulite growth of PLA crystals was in situ investigated separately. During saturation, sorption of CO₂ in PLA diluted the molecular chain density, thus increasing molecular chain mobility and weakening the interchain interaction, which reduced the amount of crystal nuclei in PLA. On the other hand, the spherulite growth rate reduced at high temperature and increased at low temperature attributed to the enhanced chain mobility under CO₂. Thus, overall crystallization was controlled by the spherulite growth rate at low temperature and crystalline nucleation at high temperature under CO₂. Besides, CO₂ restricted lamella branching, resulting in an increased lamella thickness and z axis size. Current results revealed the effect of tunable molecular chain mobility and the interchain interaction adjusted by CO₂ on nucleation and spherulite growth of PLA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3afoaming 3apolylactic acid 3asorption 3atemperature1 aChen, Taoyi1 aLiao, Xia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4093-05071 aHan, Weiqiang1 aYan, Zhihui1 aLi, Junsong1 aLi, Guangxian0 tMacromolecules.g2019 Dec. 18, v. 53, no. 1 p.312-322dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b016013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245007000212300001600282506007600298520173700374592002802111506003702139650000802176650002502184650001302209650002102222650001902243650001402262650002002276650001102296650002102307650002602328700002502354773009902379856008902478852000902567655001202576IND4488219120221207102810.0120423e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448821912DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bts0092doi7 aPMC33395112pmcid7 a222626742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD. Chikina, Maria13aAn effective statistical evaluation of ChIPseq dataset similarity  ap. 607-613.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMOTIVATION: ChIPseq is rapidly becoming a common technique for investigating protein–DNA interactions. However, results from individual experiments provide a limited understanding of chromatin structure, as various chromatin factors cooperate in complex ways to orchestrate transcription. In order to quantify chromtain interactions, it is thus necessary to devise a robust similarity metric applicable to ChIPseq data. Unfortunately, moving past simple overlap calculations to give statistically rigorous comparisons of ChIPseq datasets often involves arbitrary choices of distance metrics, with significance being estimated by computationally intensive permutation tests whose statistical power may be sensitive to non-biological experimental and post-processing variation. RESULTS: We show that it is in fact possible to compare ChIPseq datasets through the efficient computation of exact P-values for proximity. Our method is insensitive to non-biological variation in datasets such as peak width, and can rigorously model peak location biases by evaluating similarity conditioned on a restricted set of genomic regions (such as mappable genome or promoter regions). Applying our method to the well-studied dataset of Chen et al. (2008), we elucidate novel interactions which conform well with our biological understanding. By comparing ChIPseq data in an asymmetric way, we are able to observe clear interaction differences between cofactors such as p300 and factors that bind DNA directly.

These grafted copolymers were used for the removal of metal ions from their aqueous solutions. Flocculation performances of the synthesized graft copolymers were evaluated in 1.0wt% silica suspensions. A comparative study of the flocculation performances of the synthetic graft copolymers was also made. The different factors affecting metal ion absorption, namely pH, treatment time, temperature and polymer dose were studied. A comparative study of the metal ion removal capacity of the two synthetic graft copolymers was also made in five metal ions namely Ni(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Pb(II) and Hg(II). The metal ion removal capacity follows the order Hg(II)>Cu(II)>Zn(II)>Ni(II)>Pb(II) in both the two synthetic polymers. Between the two graft copolymers, graft copolymer based on AM shows better performance than that based on DMA in all the metal solutions. But the flocculation performance of DMA based graft copolymer showed better performances than that AM based graft copolymer. The former also performed best when compared to the commercial flocculants in the same suspension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacrylamides 3aaqueous solutions 3acomposite polymers 3acopper 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3alead 3amercury 3ametal ions 3anickel 3apH 3asilica 3astarch 3atemperature 3azinc 0aGraft copolymerization 0aFlocculation 0aMetal ion removal 0aN,N-dimethyl acrylamide 0aHydroxyethyl starch1 aTripathy, Tridib0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2013 Nov., v. 62 p.557-564dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245010800214520174900322592002802071653001302099653001202112653001702124653001702141653002202158653001302180653001002193700002102203700002102224700002102245700006002266700001802326700002202344700001902366700002302385700002002408700006102428700002602489700005502515700006102570773009902631856008502730852000902815655001202824IND60675694820221120045720.0200106e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067569482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1050122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa-Ortega, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3290-392810aShould emergence models for Lolium rigidum be changed throughout climatic conditions? The case of Spain  aLolium rigidum Gaudin is a troublesome weed worldwide, and its distribution may increase due to climate change. It has become resistant to several herbicides and, therefore, its control is problematic. On the other hand, its seed biology, with little dormancy and short-term viability, can play a major role in reducing its seed bank, which would improve control of this weed. For this reason, knowledge of the emergence patterns of this species entails improvements for its management. In this work seeds from one population of L. rigidum, collected in Northeastern Spain, were distributed and sown in 11 sites across Spain, and its emergence was followed every 2–7 days for two growing seasons (2016-17 and 2017–18). These emergence sequences were compared with previously published thermal time and hydrothermal time based models, and new models were developed afterwards. The hydrothermal time based model did not significantly improve models based solely on thermal time. The accuracy of these newly developed models varied from site to site, but in general, they worked better for Northern locations than for Southern locations. Thus, the experimental sites were split between North and South, and specific models for each region were developed. The model developed for Northern sites worked very well, but the one for Southern sites needs improvement. This works reveals that, with regard to this weed species, probably different models should be developed for different climatic conditions. The model developed with data from Northern sites should be validated with local populations, while the one developed with data from Southern sites will probably need to be revised or newly developed with data from more Southern populations.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGompertz 0aWeibull 0aLog-logistic 0aThermal time 0aHydrothermal time 0aRyegrass 0aLOLRI1 aChamber, Enrique1 aUrbano, José M.1 aIzquierdo, Jordi1 aLoureiro, Iñigo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3022-20021 aMarí, Ana I.1 aCordero, Fernando1 aVargas, Manuel1 aSaavedra, Milagros1 aLezaun, Juan A.1 aParamio, José A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5020-57821 aFernández, José L.,1 aTorra, Joel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8666-67801 aRoyo-Esnal, Aritz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2534-83720 tCrop protection.g2020 Feb., v. 128 p.105012-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1050123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002100173245010200194300001600296520068900312592002801001650002501029650001801054650002101072650002401093650001001117650002201127650002401149650002401173650004701197650001801244650003501262650004201297650001701339650002101356650003401377650004501411650002801456650003901484650002701523650003401550700002101584773011301605856005501718852000901773655001201782IND50068717020221118090530.0130821e199903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006871702DNAL7 a101967752pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00491.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnerton, P.

The nucleotide sequence of the entire genomic insert revealed six open reading frames, all but one of which have sequence homologues in the complete genome sequence of Helicobacter pylori. The gene encoding the immuno‐reactive protein was further identified by independent expression of these reading frames in Escherichia coli.

The results show that losses to irrigated agriculture under a median climate change scenario are modest, but under a ‘modified 2030 dry extreme scenario’ there would be substantial reductions in water use, irrigated land use and profits. Nevertheless, the Basin-wide proportional economic impacts would be less than the percentage decline in water use. A comparison of model results with and without inter-regional water trade shows that inter-regional water trade in periods of much reduced water availability mitigates the on-farm impacts of climate change. Given that agricultural production in the Basin is likely to be affected by climate change, the development of drought-tolerant crops and cultivars along with learning and extension of best farming practices to reduced water use could also assist irrigated agriculture adapt to climate change within the Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrops 3acultivars 3adrought tolerance 3aeconomic impact 3airrigated farming 3aland use 3alearning 3amodels 3aprofits and margins 3asurface water 3atrade 3atrade shows 3aAustralia1 aGrafton, R.

The complete degradation of AMO in Fe-AC/PS system was attained within 10 min. The AMO degradation efficiency increased as the initial catalyst dosage and PS concentration increased but was not affected by the initial pH. AMO degradation fitted the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and the apparent activation energy was calculated to be 28.11 kJ⋅mol⁻¹ using the Arrhenius Equation. Both hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical were identified during AMO degradation by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and radical scavenger tests. The surface-adsorbed hydroxyl radicals played significant roles in AMO degradation. In addition, tests using ADP1_recA_lux bioreporter were performed to assess the degrees to which the solutions containing degraded AMO were toxic. The Fe-AC/PS system markedly decreased microorganism growth inhibition and genotoxicity caused by the solution containing degraded AMO, providing important information for applying Fe-AC/PS technology to application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aactivation energy 3aamoxicillin 3acatalysts 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenvironmental technology 3aequations 3agenotoxicity 3agrowth retardation 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3akinetics 3apH 3asulfates 0aDegradation 0aAmoxicillin 0aPersulfate 0aGenotoxicity 0aActivated carbon1 aSun, Yujiao1 aZhang, Yang1 aZhang, Bo-Tao1 aYin, Meng1 aChen, Long0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Feb., v. 21 p.101259-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2020.1012593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04250naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013900167520262500306592002802931650002202959650001702981650001902998650002603017650002903043650002703072650003003099650001003129650001103139650001103150650001903161650002203180650001303202650001203215650002203227650002403249650001903273651002003292653001303312653002803325653003003353653003603383653002803419700001903447700002503466700001603491700001803507773010303525856008303628852000903711655001203720IND60747165920221116190654.0210904e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074716592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2021.1032422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudolf, Katrin10aImproving economic and environmental outcomes in oil palm smallholdings: The relationship between mulching, soil properties and yields  aThe area under oil palm cultivation has expanded importantly in South-East Asia. The resulting land-use transformations are associated with environmental degradation such as substantial carbon dioxide emissions. Soil conservation practices can contribute to more sustainable oil palm systems by increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and yields. One soil conservation practice in oil palm plantations is the mulching with empty fruit bunches (EFB).We estimated the relationship between EFB mulching and, respectively, yields, SOC and total nitrogen contents, the carbon‑nitrogen ratio and the average bulk density in smallholder oil palm plantations. We further analyzed the determinants of smallholders' EFB application taking into account regional market, farm, and plot level aspects, as well as farmers' perceptions.We estimated the relationship between mulching and yields with panel data, and between mulching and soil properties with cross-sectional data. We accounted for the possible selection bias of the decision to apply EFB mulching with instrumental variable estimations. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the determinants of smallholder EFB use.Our results indicated that in particular the regional supply in EFB and farmers' wealth levels were correlated with smallholder EFB mulching. EFB mulching was associated with 39% higher yields and 19% higher SOC contents. We attribute the higher yields to potentially improved soil chemical functions linked to higher SOC contents, such cation exchange capacity effects, and to an increased K and potentially Mg availability. Since EFB is not available in sufficient quantity to be applied to all plantations, policy makers could identify user groups with the greatest potentials for environmental and income improvements. Site-specific life cycle assessments and yield effects can help to inform such identification.Despite their growing importance in the oil palm sector, evidence on the effect of EFB mulching was missing for smallholder farmers. Because of associated higher SOC contents and yields, our findings indicate that the promotion of EFB mulching as best management practice could potentially contribute to more sustainable oil palm systems. Strengthening inclusive value chains for smallholders, information provision and investments in road infrastructure represent potential policy instruments to increase smallholder EFB application. The identification and promotion of best management practices are important with view to the still ongoing oil palm expansion in South-East Asia, and progressively in other parts of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3abulk density 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acation exchange capacity 3aconservation practices 3aenvironmental degradation 3afarms 3afruits 3aincome 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amarkets 3asoil conservation 3asoil organic carbon 3atotal nitrogen 3aSouth East Asia 0aOil palm 0aSustainable agriculture 0aBest management practices 0aSoil organic carbon restoration 0aSoil ecosystem services1 aHennings, Nina1 aDippold, Michaela A.1 aEdison, Edi1 aWollni, Meike0 tAgricultural systems.g2021 Oct., v. 193 p.103242-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.1032423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245013200166300001600298520131100314592002801625650001901653650001101672650001201683650001101695650001701706650000901723650000901732650001001741650001401751650001401765650001201779650000901791650001001800650001301810650001301823650001701836650000901853651001601862651002301878653001701901653001601918653001701934653001501951653001901966700002301985700002102008700002302029700002202052773013302074856007502207852000902282655001202291IND60687517720221120222641.0200401e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068751772DNAL7 a10.7589/2019-04-0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshley, Elizabeth A.10aTrace Element Concentrations in Livers of Pacific Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) from San Juan County, Washington, USA  ap. 429-436.  aApproximately 5,000 Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) reside year-round in San Juan County (SJC), Washington (US) in the center of the binational Salish Sea. We retrospectively analyzed total cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) in livers of dead stranded harbor seals (n=57) collected in SJC between 2009 and 2012 to identify age-related and regional patterns of trace element exposure. Consistent with prior studies of contaminants in pinnipeds, Hg, Cd, and Se concentrations increased with age, and Se:Hg molar ratios approached 1:1 in adult seals. Concentrations of Cd and Hg were below putative marine mammal toxicity thresholds. Mercury concentrations were comparable among Salish Sea populations. Although SJC is less urbanized with fewer industrial inputs than South Puget Sound (SPS), SJC nonpups had greater concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Zn, and pups had greater concentrations of Zn compared to SPS seals. We hypothesize these regional differences could be due to prey preference and availability or to natural geochemical processes. Reported concentrations inform future sampling protocols and can assist in tracking long-term temporal and spatial trends of trace elements in marine organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoca vitulina 3aadults 3acadmium 3acopper 3ageochemistry 3airon 3alead 3aliver 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amercury 3apups 3aseals 3aselenium 3atoxicity 3aurbanization 3azinc 3aPuget Sound 3aWashington (state) 0aContaminants 0aharbor seal 0aheavy metals 0aSalish Sea 0atrace elements1 aOlson, Jennifer K.1 aRaverty, Stephen1 aWilkinson, Kristin1 aGaydos, Joseph K.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 56, no. 2 p.429-436dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2019-04-0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011100166300001400277520128200291592002801573650003101601650001601632650002301648650002101671650001501692650002401707650002001731700001901751700001901770700001901789700001901808700002001827700001701847700001701864773010401881856008201985852000902067655001202076IND50060208220221119165416.0150812e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006020822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2012.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeres, Andrea10aSpatio-temporal dynamics of Orius spp. (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) abundance in the agricultural landscape  ap. 45-51.  aPredators of the genus Orius are widely released as control agents against Frankliniella occidentalis, however they can also colonize crops spontaneously, and conservation biological control can potentially take advantage of the presence of semi-natural areas in the agricultural landscape. A three-year study was conducted in Hungary in order to evaluate the Orius species spatial pattern at landscape scale, and to link their eventual aggregation, i.e. higher abundance, to the presence of semi-natural areas, which has been shown to benefit conservation biological control in general. Results show that Orius species population size and spatial pattern are related to semi-natural areas, and that influences with other agro-environmental factors exist. Orius niger abundance is likely to be associated with semi-natural areas, where it can successfully overwinter, but also with other resources in the landscape, especially in warm years. As a consequence of O. niger being a habitat generalist we suggest that at landscape scale its abundance pattern is driven by resource patterns and availability of both semi-natural and cultivated areas. Furthermore, their population dynamics is influenced by crop management intensity rather than crop composition of cropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aOrius niger 3abiological control 3acropping systems 3alandscapes 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size1 aTóth, Ferenc,1 aKiss, József,1 aFetykó, Kinga1 aOrosz, Szilvia1 aLavigne, Claire1 aOtto, Stefan1 aBohan, David0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 162 p.45-51dElsevier B.V.x0167-88097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011600167300001400283520147600297592002801773650001601801650001501817650001801832650001801850650002001868650000901888650001101897650002801908650002101936650001501957653001601972653002001988653002902008653001102037653001502048653002302063700001902086700005202105700001302157700001902170773010202189856008402291852000902375655001202384IND60609222220221120092111.0180822e20170130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060922222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhenlei10aRainfall threshold for initiation of channelized debris flows in a small catchment based on in-site measurement  ap. 23-34.  aThe peak runoff discharge plays an important role in triggering channelized debris flows, especially for small catchments, due to the features of a small area and short channels. In small catchments, intense rainfall can trigger a flood within a short period of time. But currently, there are few rainfall threshold models that address the runoff from short-duration (<2h) rainfall. In this context, 37 short–duration rainfall events were analyzed, and field measurements were made for a partially-modified landscape in order to compare the variation in the amount of runoff. The grey relational analysis allowed us to rank the influence of the various factors that affected variations in the runoff. The results indicated that the intensity of rainfall was the most important factor, having a greater effect than other factors, such as the depth of the rainfall and its duration. Then, we trained a runoff prediction model based on these factors and verified its accuracy using the moving least squares (MLS) method, the genetic back-propagation neural network (GABP) method and the genetic support vector machine (GASVM) method. This analysis indicated that the MLS method had the best predictive capability. The assessment of the debris-flow hazard based on the predicted runoff and intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves is discussed in the study area. It was indicated that even a rainfall event of a two-year return period was dangerous for this specific case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3alandscapes 3aleast squares 3amass movement 3aneural networks 3arain 3arunoff 3asupport vector machines 3athreshold models 3awatersheds 0aDebris flow 0aSmall catchment 0aRainfall characteristics 0aRunoff 0aPrediction 0aRainfall threshold1 aShang, Yuequan1 aZhao, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0453-19601 aPan-Pan,1 aJiang, Yuanjun0 tEngineering geology.g2017 Jan. 30, v. 217 p.23-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245007600199300001800275500002000293506007600313520170800389592002802097506003702125650001302162650002902175650002202204650002102226650001402247650002402261650002102285650001002306650001002316650004202326650001602368650001602384650001802400650002002418700002302438773010902461856007302570852000902643655001202652IND60580365720221207134813.0170915e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058036572DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.124662doi7 aPMC66382392pmcid7 a275784492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonaire, Livia10aDeep sequencing of mycovirus‐derived small RNAs from Botrytis species  ap. 1127-1137.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRNA silencing is an ancient regulatory mechanism operating in all eukaryotic cells. In fungi, it was first discovered in Neurospora crassa, although its potential as a defence mechanism against mycoviruses was first reported in Cryphonectria parasitica and, later, in several fungal species. There is little evidence of the antiviral potential of RNA silencing in the phytopathogenic species of the fungal genus Botrytis. Moreover, little is known about the RNA silencing components in these fungi, although the analysis of public genome databases identified two Dicer‐like genes in B. cinerea, as in most of the ascomycetes sequenced to date. In this work, we used deep sequencing to study the virus‐derived small RNA (vsiRNA) populations from different mycoviruses infecting field isolates of Botrytis spp. The mycoviruses under study belong to different genera and species, and have different types of genome [double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA), (+)single‐stranded RNA (ssRNA) and (–)ssRNA]. In general, vsiRNAs derived from mycoviruses are mostly of 21, 20 and 22 nucleotides in length, possess sense or antisense orientation, either in a similar ratio or with a predominance of sense polarity depending on the virus species, have predominantly U at their 5′ end, and are unevenly distributed along the viral genome, showing conspicuous hotspots of vsiRNA accumulation. These characteristics reveal striking similarities with vsiRNAs produced by plant viruses, suggesting similar pathways of viral targeting in plants and fungi. We have shown that the fungal RNA silencing machinery acts against the mycoviruses used in this work in a similar manner independent of their viral or fungal origin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBotrytis 3aCryphonectria parasitica 3aNeurospora crassa 3aRNA interference 3adatabases 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amycoviruses 3anucleotides 3aplant viruses 3aplants (botany)1 aAyllón, María A.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2017 Oct., v. 18, no. 8 p.1127-1137dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.124663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245009600164300001600260520128900276592002801565650001801593650001501611650002801626650003201654650001501686650002601701650001701727650001301744650001001757650000901767650001001776650001901786650001401805650001401819650001601833651001001849653000901859653002401868700002101892700001701913700002001930700001901950700001901969700002101988700002102009700001802030700002102048773013302069856007502202852000902277655001202286IND60687517820221120212523.0200401e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068751782DNAL7 a10.7589/2019-04-0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Tatsuki10aPrevalence of yersinia among wild sika deer (cervus nippon) and boars (sus scrofa) in japan  ap. 270-277.  aWe examined the prevalence of Yersinia, including pathogenic species such as Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, among wild sika deer (Cervus nippon) and boars (Sus scrofa) captured in Japan. The prevalence of Yersinia in the wild deer was 75% (207/277) and in the boars was 74% (40/54). A total of 417 isolates of nine Yersinia species were isolated from the animals examined: the largest number of isolates (48%, 200/417) were Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A. Pathogenic Y. enterocolitica 1B/O:8 were also isolated from two deer, and Y. pseudotuberculosis serogroups 3 and 4 were isolated from two boars and a deer, respectively. The pathogenic Y. enterocolitica 1B/O:8 isolates carried four virulence genes (ail, ystA, yadA, and virF), and Y. pseudotuberculosis serogroups 3 and 4 isolates carried three virulence genes (inv, yadA, and lcrF). Although the Y. enterocolitica 1B/O:8 and Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates were sensitive to almost all the antimicrobials tested, the two Y. enterocolitica 1B/O:8 isolates were resistant to azithromycin and ampicillin, and the three Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates were resistant only to azithromycin. These findings suggested that wild deer and boars might be important reservoirs for the agent causing human yersiniosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus nippon 3aSus scrofa 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3aYersinia pseudotuberculosis 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aazithromycin 3abiotypes 3aboars 3adeer 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3aserotypes 3avirulence 3ayersiniosis 3aJapan 0aBoar 0afood-borne diseases1 aKabeya, Hidenori1 aSato, Shingo1 aYamazaki, Akiko1 aKamata, Yoichi1 aTaira, Kensuke1 aAsakura, Hiroshi1 aSugiyama, Hiromu1 aTakai, Shinji1 aMaruyama, Soichi0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 56, no. 2 p.270-277dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2019-04-0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245010600196506007600302520088800378592002801266506003701294650001101331650001801342650001501360650001301375650001801388650001401406650001101420650002001431650001501451650001901466650002701485650002601512650001301538650001501551650001101566650001301577653001001590653002601600653000901626653001001635653001101645700002301656700002301679700002201702700002001724773011801744856007301862852000901935655001201944IND60690324320221207104759.0200426e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069032432DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.256472doi7 aPMC40910722pmcid7 a238573612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagar, Maha10aUnder-expression of the Auxin Response Factor Sl-ARF4 improves post-harvest behavior of tomato fruits  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAuxin is one of the most prominent phytohormones regulating many aspects of fleshy fruit development including fruit set, fruit size through the control of cell division and cell expansion, and fruit ripening. To shed light on the role of auxin fruit ripening, we have previously shown that Sl-ARF4 is a major player in mediating the auxin control of sugar metabolism in tomato fruit (cv MicroTom). Further extending this study, we show here that down-regulation of Sl-ARF4 in tomato alters some ripening-related fruit quality traits including enhanced fruit density at mature stage, increased firmness, prolonged shelf-life and reduced water (weight) loss at red ripe stage. These findings suggest that Sl-ARF4 plays a role in determining fruit cell wall architecture and thus providing a potential genetic marker for improving post-harvest handling and shelf life of tomato fruits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aauxins 3acell division 3acell walls 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruit set 3afruits 3agenetic markers 3ametabolism 3aplant hormones 3apostharvest physiology 3apostharvest treatment 3aripening 3ashelf life 3asugars 3atomatoes 0aauxin 0aauxin response factor 0aARF4 0afruit 0atomato1 aChervin, Christian1 aRoustan, Jean-Paul1 aBouzayen, Mondher1 aZouine, Mohamed0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 8, no. 10 p.e25647-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.256473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011300172300001600285500001900301520106000320592002801380650001601408650001101424650001401435650001501449650001301464650001301477650001601490650001101506650002301517650001101540650001701551650002101568650001301589650001301602650001501615653000701630653000801637653000801645653000801653653000901661653000701670653000901677653000701686653000801693653002301701653001801724653001501742700001601757773009301773856008401866852000901950655001201959IND60693659820221123013928.0200508s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069365982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2015.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNellore, Jayshree10aParaquat exposure induces behavioral deficits in larval zebrafish during the window of dopamine neurogenesis  ap. 950-956.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExposure to environmental risk factors such as herbicides in early life has been proposed to play important roles in the development of neurodegenerative disorders in adult life. To test this hypothesis, we used a zebrafish model to link the herbicide paraquat (PQ) to disease etiology. Strikingly, treatment of 18hpf embryonic zebrafish with low-dose PQ treatment (0.04ppm, lower than the accepted human daily exposure) resulted in 50% display of neurodegenerative phenotypes and motor deficits at various developmental stages (segmentation to larval stage). Wide arrays of biomarkers have been employed to delineate the toxic responses which include lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) and apoptosis studies. A decrease in the GSH levels, increase in lipid peroxidation and apoptosis, respectively, were observed at various developmental stages. Unexpectedly, we show that the exposure to paraquat during the window of dopamine neurogenesis causes Parkinsonian like motor defects in later life by perturbing cholinergic system due to oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3adopamine 3aetiology 3aglutathione 3ahumans 3alipid peroxidation 3amodels 3aneurogenesis 3aoxidative stress 3aparaquat 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aPQ 0ahpf 0aLPO 0aGSH 0aADHD 0aPD 0aDTNB 0aEM 0appm 0aCholinergic system 0aMotor defects 0aEarly life1 aP., Nandita0 tToxicology reports.g2015, v. 2 p.950-956dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2015.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008000172300001600252500001900268520144800287592002801735650005001763650001301813650001401826650001601840650000901856650002101865650002901886650002201915650001401937650002201951650001101973650000701984650001401991650001202005650000902017650001702026650001902043650001502062651001202077653000802089653001002097653001302107653002902120653003002149700002702179773009302206856008402299852000902383655001202392IND60693659920221123030414.0200508s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069365992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2015.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwumi, Solomon E.10aDetermination of metal ion contents of two antiemetic clays use in Geophagy  ap. 928-932.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNausea is usually associated with early to late stages of pregnancy. Geophagy-deliberate consumption of soil is a common method of managing gravidae-induced discomfort. To control nausea, pregnant women in Nigeria commonly eat baked clay called “Eko” and another type of clay that induces buccal constriction called “Omumu”.The metal contents in Eko and Omumu, digested under different pH conditions (acidic, alkaline and neutral), were investigated using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICPS-OES). We identified and quantitate the elements present and speculate on their potential impact on maternal and fetal health upon gestational exposure beyond the acceptable exposure levels and the Millennium Contaminant Level Goals (MCLG) set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).Specifically, our result indicates unacceptably high levels of aluminum in Eko and Omumu (>10-fold greater than the highest desirable levels set by the USEPA). The aluminum concentrations were influenced by the pH condition in which the samples were digested. Dietary exposure to aluminum at such high levels may be deleterious to maternal health and fetal development. Therefore consumption of Eko and Omumu as an antidote to reduce nausea during pregnancy should be discouraged. Future studies are planned to investigate specific impacts on fetal and maternal health and likely teratogenicity in rodent models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aaluminum 3aantidotes 3aantiemetics 3aclay 3adietary exposure 3aenvironmental protection 3afetal development 3ageophagia 3amaternal exposure 3anausea 3apH 3apregnancy 3arodents 3asoil 3aspectroscopy 3ateratogenicity 3atoxicology 3aNigeria 0aEko 0aOmumu 0aGeophagy 0aTrace element and metals 0aMaternal and fetal health1 aOyelere, Adegboyega K.0 tToxicology reports.g2015, v. 2 p.928-932dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2015.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245017500182520105300357592002801410650001601438650001701454650001401471650001901485650002101504650001801525650001901543650003301562650002201595650001801617650001701635650002101652653002301673653001301696653001201709653000801721653001701729700002601746700002701772700002601799700003401825773010001859856008701959852000902046655001202055IND60747166320221116190736.0220205e20220130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074716632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1306752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Vanessa Jorge10aProof-of-concept on the effect of human milk storage time: Lipid degradation and spectroscopic characterization using portable near-infrared spectrometer and chemometrics  aHuman milk (HM) modifications over time represent an important issue. This work proposed to evaluate the changes in HM during one-year storage through total lipids (TL) degradation and portable near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer combined with chemometrics. Colostrum, transition, and mature stages were obtained from donors and considered in the raw and pasteurized forms. Principal component analysis in TL content showed changes in the mature stages for both forms after 75 days. Multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares in NIR spectral data reveals a decrease in protein and triacylglycerol contents while an increase in free fatty acids (palmitic acid) contents were observed through the storage after around 5–6 months. Therefore, more than 5–6 months of storage suggest possible biochemical changes in the HM nutritional composition. Moreover, the chemometrics investigation was crucial in extracting information, bringing coherent results, and helping to understand the chemical changes in human milk during storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast milk 3achemometrics 3acolostrum 3afood chemistry 3anutrient content 3apalmitic acid 3apasteurization 3aprincipal component analysis 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3astorage time 3atriacylglycerols 0aHuman milk storage 0aMicroNIR 0aMCR-ALS 0aPCA 0aTotal lipids1 aBaqueta, Michel Rocha1 aMarço, Paulo Henrique1 aValderrama, Patrícia1 aVisentainer, Jesuí Vergílio0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 368 p.130675-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1306753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03945naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002900188245016200217300001100379506007600390520234600466592002802812506003702840650001702877650002602894650001302920650001602933650001602949650001102965650002602976650002903002650001503031650003003046650001403076650001103090650001303101650001503114651001103129700003103140700002503171700001803196700003603214773011003250856008203360852000903442655001203451IND60548584420221207100106.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054858442DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1332-92doi7 aPMC47409872pmcid7 a268423842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParedes-Trujillo, Amelia10aGeographical distribution of protozoan and metazoan parasites of farmed Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) (Perciformes: Cichlidae) in Yucatán, México  ap. 66.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In Yucatán State, southern México, as in many other parts of the world where tilapia has been introduced for aquaculture, the deficient application of management measures has led to the establishment of non-native parasites. The aims of this study were to describe the geographical distribution of protozoan and helminth parasites of farmed Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) throughout the Yucatán and to examine the potential statistical associations of the prevalence and mean abundance of these parasites with management and environmental variables. METHODS: All 29 Nile tilapia farms currently operating in Yucatán were surveyed. Maps were created to describe the geographical location of the parasites infecting Nile tilapia at each farm. We evaluated the statistical associations of management and environmental variables with the mean abundance values of each parasite species using a multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA) and generalized additive models (GAM). We also used Ripley’s K to determine whether there were significant clusters of the mean abundance of particular parasite species in specific regions of the Yucatán State. RESULTS: A total of 580 O. niloticus were examined, and 11 species of parasites were recorded. Cichlidogyrus sclerosus was the most frequent and abundant parasite at all 29 farms, whereas Gyrodactylus cichlidarum was found in 26 of the 29 farms. The RDA showed that the most important predictors were the concentration of nitrites and ammonium and the water exchange rate. The GAM showed the significant effect of the tank capacity, no use of quarantine area and no use of prophylactic treatments on the mean abundance of G. cichlidarum. The geographical distribution patterns of the mean abundance of most parasite species exhibited clustering near to the coast of Yucatán. CONCLUSION: Two groups of farms were distinguished: (i) farms with medium to high technology, where the most frequent and abundant parasite was G. cichlidarum, and (ii) farms with low technology, where the most frequent and abundant parasite was C. sclerosus. Good biosecurity practices such as the use of quarantine and prophylactic treatments prior to the introduction of infected Nile tilapia to the farms are recommended to avoid the establishment of parasites such as G. cichlidarum in farms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGyrodactylus 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aProtozoa 3aaquaculture 3abiosecurity 3acoasts 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental management 3afish farms 3ageographical distribution 3ahelminths 3amodels 3anitrites 3aquarantine 3aMexico1 aVelázquez-Abunader, Iván1 aTorres-Irineo, Edgar1 aRomero, David1 aVidal-Martínez, Víctor Manuel0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.66-66dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1332-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011200165300001600277520149100293592002801784650001301812650001101825650002501836650001401861650001201875650001201887650001801899650002601917650001901943650002101962650001001983650002101993650003402014650001902048650002302067650002002090651001002110653001602120653002002136653001902156653001202175653002102187653001002208700001402218773009302232856008602325852000902411655001202420IND60607013220221119142725.0190402e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060701322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Peng10aFood scandals, media exposure, and citizens’ safety concerns: A multilevel analysis across Chinese cities  ap. 102-111.  aIt is both theoretically and socially imperative to understand what drives citizens’ concerns over food safety, as outbreaks of food related health hazards have become increasingly rampant in developing countries like China. In this paper we combine recent national survey data and media reports to quantitatively examine the effects of food scandals and media exposure on food safety risk. We find that media reported food scandals are not significantly related to public concern about food safety risk, suggesting that food risk perceptions may be nationwide rather than region specific. We also find out that more educated citizens with more media exposure are more concerned about food safety risk, and the amplification effect of food scandals is more prominent among residents with higher levels of education. In contrast to our expectation, family income is not significantly related to food safety concern. We also find that females, the elderly, and urban dwellers perceive higher levels of food risk than males, youngsters, and rural residents. The government should pay more attention to public perceptions of food safety, and strengthen its risk communication capacity to mitigate media amplification effects of food safety concern. The regulatory authorities can work with other entities (e.g., food industry and NGOs) to advance food safety education to equip the public with essential knowledge to mitigate the framing and spillover effects of food scandals and rumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3acities 3adeveloping countries 3aeducation 3aelderly 3afemales 3afood industry 3afood safety education 3ahealth hazards 3ahousehold income 3amales 3anational surveys 3anongovernmental organizations 3apublic opinion 3arisk communication 3arisk perception 3aChina 0aFood safety 0aRisk perception 0aMedia exposure 0aScandal 0aMultilevel model 0aChina1 aMa, Liang0 tFood policy.g2016 Aug., v. 63 p.102-111dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245008700209300001600296506007600312520191200388592002802300506003702328650000802365650001802373650001602391650002102407650002602428650002902454650003002483650003102513650001502544651001802559700001702577700001802594700002202612773009402634856008402728852000902812655001202821IND60086847320221207133448.0141102e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008684732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2012.04.0032doi7 aPMC37742772pmcid7 a225840822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAustin, Elena12aA framework for identifying distinct multipollutant profiles in air pollution data  ap. 112-121.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The importance of describing, understanding and regulating multi-pollutant mixtures has been highlighted by the US National Academy of Science and the Environmental Protection Agency. Furthering our understanding of the health effects associated with exposure to mixtures of pollutants will lead to the development of new multi-pollutant National Air Quality Standards. OBJECTIVES: Introduce a framework within which diagnostic methods that are based on our understanding of air pollution mixtures are used to validate the distinct air pollutant mixtures identified using cluster analysis. METHODS: Six years of daily gaseous and particulate air pollution data collected in Boston, MA were classified solely on their concentration profiles. Classification was performed using k-means partitioning and hierarchical clustering. Diagnostic strategies were developed to identify the most optimal clustering. RESULTS: The optimal solution used k-means analysis and contained five distinct groups of days. Pollutant concentrations and elemental ratios were computed in order to characterize the differences between clusters. Time-series regression confirmed that the groups differed in their chemical compositions. The mean values of meteorological parameters were estimated for each group and air mass origin between clusters was examined using back-trajectory analysis. This allowed us to link the distinct physico-chemical characteristics of each cluster to characteristic weather patterns and show that different clusters were associated with distinct air mass origins. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis yielded a solution that was robust to outlier points and interpretable based on chemical, physical and meteorological characteristics. This novel method provides an exciting tool with which to identify and further investigate multi-pollutant mixtures and link them directly to health effects studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acluster analysis 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenvironmental protection 3ameteorological parameters 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollutants 3aMassachusetts1 aCoull, Brent1 aThomas, Dylan1 aKoutrakis, Petros0 tEnvironment international.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 45 p.112-121dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2012.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011900163520124100282592002801523650001701551650001601568650001201584650002001596650002001616650002201636650001801658650001401676650001701690650002301707650000901730650001001739650001401749650002001763650002201783653002501805653001801830653003101848653002101879700001201900700001801912700002101930700001501951700001301966700001601979700001401995700001402009700001902023700001902042700001802061700001302079700001702092700001802109773010902127856008202236852000902318655001202327IND60698366320221119211318.0201202e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069836632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1030232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lihui10aCharacteristics of grain quality and starch fine structure of japonica rice kernels following preharvest sprouting  aPreharvest sprouting (PHS) is one of the most serious defects that impacts rice production and grain quality. Knowledge about the effects of PHS on the eating and cooking quality (ECQ) of milled rice is limited. Here, we selected four japonica rice varieties to study the influences of PHS on grain quality. The results showed that PHS strongly led to poor grain appearance and the development of small starch granules whose surfaces were eroded. Analysis of starch fine structure revealed that PHS resulted in amylose (AM) degradation; in particular, PHS caused a decrease in the content of long AM chains. Moreover, PHS led to a decrease in the content of short amylopectin (AP) chains in the varieties Yandao 815 (YD815), Wuyugeng 27 (WY27) and Yangeng 13 (YG13), while the variety Sidao 785 (SD785) displayed the opposite trend. We propose that the main reasons for the decrease in starch crystallinity and the pasting profiles of the germinated rice were due to both the tendency of the AM content to decrease and the degree of this decrease in the content of the different AM chains along with changes in AP and other major components. All these changes caused by PHS led to a decrease in both ECQ and palatability of milled rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acooking quality 3acrop production 3acrystal structure 3agrain quality 3aingestion 3apalatability 3apasting properties 3arice 3aseeds 3asprouting 3astarch granules 3avivipary (plants) 0aPreharvest sprouting 0aGrain quality 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aStarch structure1 aLu, Yan1 aZhang, Yadong1 aZhang, Changquan1 aZhao, Ling1 aYao, Shu1 aSun, Xuchao1 aChen, Tao1 aZhu, Zhen1 aZhao, Qingyong1 aZhao, Chunfang1 aLiang, Wenhua1 aLu, Gai,1 aWang, Cailin1 aLiu, Qiaoquan0 tJournal of cereal science.g2020 Sept., v. 95 p.103023-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1030233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245015700185300001600342520129800358592002801656650002501684650002901709650001901738650001201757650001501769650001301784650001501797650001801812650004701830650001401877650001101891700002001902700002601922773009901948856004802047852000902095655001202104IND50067429220221117231013.0130628e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006742922DNAL7 a236742412pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-013-0064-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShapira, Aviad10aCombining Analytical Hierarchy Process and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering in Search of Expert Consensus in Green Corridors Development Management  ap. 123-135.  aEnvironmental management and planning are instrumental in resolving conflicts arising between societal needs for economic development on the one hand and for open green landscapes on the other hand. Allocating green corridors between fragmented core green areas may provide a partial solution to these conflicts. Decisions regarding green corridor development require the assessment of alternative allocations based on multiple criteria evaluations. Analytical Hierarchy Process provides a methodology for both a structured and consistent extraction of such evaluations and for the search for consensus among experts regarding weights assigned to the different criteria. Implementing this methodology using 15 Israeli experts—landscape architects, regional planners, and geographers—revealed inherent differences in expert opinions in this field beyond professional divisions. The use of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering allowed to identify clusters representing common decisions regarding criterion weights. Aggregating the evaluations of these clusters revealed an important dichotomy between a pragmatist approach that emphasizes the weight of statutory criteria and an ecological approach that emphasizes the role of the natural conditions in allocating green landscape corridors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental management 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3alandscapes 3aplanning 2aAlgorithms 2aCity Planning 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aHumans1 aShoshany, Maxim1 aNir-Goldenberg, Sigal0 tEnvironmental management.g2013 July, v. 52, no. 1 p.123-135dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-013-0064-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245012600183300001600309520108600325592002801411650002501439650002301464650002001487650001001507650001701517650002401534650001001558650001101568650001501579651001101594651001301605653002001618653002301638653001701661653001901678700002801697700002301725700003001748773011501778856008501893852000901978655001201987IND60565282820221123030746.0190416e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056528282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Vanessa do Nascimento10aAmbush behavior of the tick Amblyomma sculptum (Amblyomma cajennense complex) (Acari: Ixodidae) in the Brazilian Pantanal  ap. 506-510.  aWe herein describe the ambush behavior of Amblyomma sculptum (Berlese 1888), a widespread and epidemiologically important tick in Brazil. Along two years of sampling by visual search in the Brazilian Pantanal, A. sculptum ticks were observed on the vegetation and in the leaf litter. Most of the ticks were observed between 10 and 50cm above ground level and less than five percent of the total were positioned below 10cm, indicating that they are seeking for middle or large-sized hosts. In both seasons, vapor saturation deficit was low during the morning. No significant relationship was found between questing ticks and daytime interval of observation or saturation deficit. However, questing tick numbers seem be higher in the end of the morning, when saturation deficit reaches its peak. Behavioral patterns of A. sculptum ticks observed in Pantanal underscore the occurrence of this tick and human contact at green anthropogenic sites. Considering A. sculptum questing behavior, inferences on human behavioral patterns that enhance or avoid contact with ticks are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma cajennense 3aAmblyomma sculptum 3aanimal behavior 3ahosts 3aplant litter 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3avapors 3avegetation 3aBrazil 3aPantanal 0aQuesting height 0aSaturation deficit 0aHost-seeking 0aTick-bite risk1 aOsava, Carolina Fonseca1 aPiovezan, Ubiratan1 aSzabó, Matias Pablo Juan0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2017 June, v. 8, no. 4 p.506-510dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04034naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011800174300001600292520219700308592002802505650001902533650002502552650001702577650001602594650002402610650002202634650002902656650001402685650002502699650001902724650001202743650001002755651001202765651001102777651001202788651001602800651001102816651001102827651001302838651001002851651001902861653001102880653002702891653001802918653001402936653001102950653001202961700001802973700001502991700001803006700001703024700002003041700002303061700001703084700002303101700001603124700001503140700001703155773009303172856008603265852000903351655001203360IND60607013420221119142808.0190402e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060701342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart-Knox, B.J.10aMaking personalised nutrition the easy choice: Creating policies to break down the barriers and reap the benefits  ap. 134-144.  aPersonalised diets based on people’s existing food choices, and/or phenotypic, and/or genetic information hold potential to improve public dietary-related health. The aim of this analysis, therefore, has been to examine the degree to which factors which determine uptake of personalised nutrition vary between EU countries to better target policies to encourage uptake, and optimise the health benefits of personalised nutrition technology. A questionnaire developed from previous qualitative research was used to survey nationally representative samples from 9 EU countries (N=9381). Perceived barriers to the uptake of personalised nutrition comprised three factors (data protection; the eating context; and, societal acceptance). Trust in sources of information comprised four factors (commerce and media; practitioners; government; family and, friends). Benefits comprised a single factor. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to compare differences in responses between the United Kingdom; Ireland; Portugal; Poland; Norway; the Netherlands; Germany; and, Spain. The results indicated that respondents in Greece, Poland, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, rated the benefits of personalised nutrition highest, suggesting a particular readiness in these countries to adopt personalised nutrition interventions. Greek participants were more likely to perceive the social context of eating as a barrier to adoption of personalised nutrition, implying a need for support in negotiating social situations while on a prescribed diet. Those in Spain, Germany, Portugal and Poland scored highest on perceived barriers related to data protection. Government was more trusted than commerce to deliver and provide information on personalised nutrition overall. This was particularly the case in Ireland, Portugal and Greece, indicating an imperative to build trust, particularly in the ability of commercial service providers to deliver personalised dietary regimes effectively in these countries. These findings, obtained from a nationally representative sample of EU citizens, imply that a parallel, integrated, public-private delivery system would capture the needs of most potential consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanalysis of variance 3afood choices 3afood intake 3ainformation sources 3aissues and policy 3anutritional intervention 3aphenotype 3aqualitative analysis 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3atrade 3aGermany 3aGreece 3aIreland 3aNetherlands 3aNorway 3aPoland 3aPortugal 3aSpain 3aUnited Kingdom 0aSurvey 0aPersonalised nutrition 0aNutrigenomics 0aAttitudes 0aEurope 0aFood4me1 aMarkovina, J.1 aRankin, A.1 aBunting, B.P.1 aKuznesof, S.1 aFischer, A.R.H.1 avan der Lans, I.A.1 aPoínhos, R.1 ade Almeida, M.D.V.1 aPanzone, L.1 aGibney, M.1 aFrewer, L.J.0 tFood policy.g2016 Aug., v. 63 p.134-144dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245016600199300001800365500002000383506007600403520187500479592002802354506003702382650001902419650002202438650001502460650001002475650002402485650001002509650001302519650001102532650002202543650001702565650001002582700002702592700002202619700001802641700002002659700002002679700002002699700002002719700003202739773010902771856007302880852000902953655001202962IND60580366320221207134116.0170915e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058036632DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.124642doi7 aPMC66382812pmcid7 a274748992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGervais, Julie10aDifferent waves of effector genes with contrasted genomic location are expressed by Leptosphaeria maculans during cotyledon and stem colonization of oilseed rape  ap. 1113-1126.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeptosphaeria maculans, the causal agent of stem canker disease, colonizes oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in two stages: a short and early colonization stage corresponding to cotyledon or leaf colonization, and a late colonization stage during which the fungus colonizes systemically and symptomlessly the plant during several months before stem canker appears. To date, the determinants of the late colonization stage are poorly understood; L. maculans may either successfully escape plant defences, leading to stem canker development, or the plant may develop an ‘adult‐stage’ resistance reducing canker incidence. To obtain an insight into these determinants, we performed an RNA‐sequencing (RNA‐seq) pilot project comparing fungal gene expression in infected cotyledons and in symptomless or necrotic stems. Despite the low fraction of fungal material in infected stems, sufficient fungal transcripts were detected and a large number of fungal genes were expressed, thus validating the feasibility of the approach. Our analysis showed that all avirulence genes previously identified are under‐expressed during stem colonization compared with cotyledon colonization. A validation RNA‐seq experiment was then performed to investigate the expression of candidate effector genes during systemic colonization. Three hundred and seven ‘late’ effector candidates, under‐expressed in the early colonization stage and over‐expressed in the infected stems, were identified. Finally, our analysis revealed a link between the regulation of expression of effectors and their genomic location: the ‘late’ effector candidates, putatively involved in systemic colonization, are located in gene‐rich genomic regions, whereas the ‘early’ effector genes, over‐expressed in the early colonization stage, are located in gene‐poor regions of the genome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica napus 3aPlenodomus lingam 3acotyledons 3afungi 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenomics 3aleaves 3asequence analysis 3astem cankers 3astems1 aPlissonneau, Clémence1 aLinglin, Juliette1 aMeyer, Michel1 aLabadie, Karine1 aCruaud, Corinne1 aFudal, Isabelle1 aRouxel, Thierry1 aBalesdent, Marie‐Hélène0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2017 Oct., v. 18, no. 8 p.1113-1126dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.124643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024001800121040001800139100002200157245006300179300001400242520082200256592002801078650002001106650001501126650001101141650000901152650001201161650001301173650001001186651001101196653001401207653002201221653002401243653002401267700002101291700002901312700002801341700003101369773017101400856007301571852000901644655001201653IND60597644020221117233009.0180625e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059764402DNAL7 a10.2987/16-6615.12doi4 amoco-33-01-03  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlencar, Jeronimo10aBiology of Psorophora albigenu Under Laboratory Conditions  ap. 64-66.  aThe present study investigates the effect of multiple immersions on Psorophora albigenu eggs and their development cycle under laboratory conditions.

Psorophora albigenu eggs (n = 1274) were subjected to immersion, with a hatching rate between 49% and 73%. The Williams average showed a peak of 29% hatched eggs in the 3rd immersion; after 4–5 immersions, the effect of additional immersions was generally negligible. The average cycle for both males and females was 5.68 ± 1.00 days. This short development time from the egg stage to adult emergence followed the pattern seen in other species of the genus Psorophora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCDC light traps 3aPsorophora 3aadults 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahatching 3amales 3aBrazil 0aCulicidae 0adevelopment cycle 0amultiple immersions 0aPsorophora albigenu1 aPacheco, Juliana1 aDos Santos Silva, Júlia1 aMello, Cecilia Ferreira1 aGuimarães, Anthony Érico0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2017 Mar., v. 33, no. 1 p.64-66dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Inc.wJournal:jnl46567x8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987/16-6615.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245014400164520107500308592002801383650001601411650001401427650001401441650001101455650001901466650002601485650002301511650001701534650002701551650002401578650001201602650001501614653002401629653002801653653002301681700001301704700001701717700001801734700001901752700001601771773010001787856008701887852000901974655001201983IND60747166620221116190609.0210918e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074716662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xue14aThe effect of caspase-3 in mitochondrial apoptosis activation on degradation of structure proteins of Esox lucius during postmortem storage  aThis study aimed to investigate the effect of caspase-3 inhibitor in mitochondrial apoptosis activation on structure protein degradation during postmortem storage. Mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptotic factors, structure protein degradation and the myofibrillar rupture index between the control and caspase-3 inhibitor groups were determined. The results show caspase-3 inhibitor repressed the mitochondrial membrane permeability and mitochondrial swelling, as well as increased mitochondrial membrane potential, causing a decrease in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm and caspase-9/3 activities (P < 0.05). Subsequently, small myofibrillar proteins (desmin and troponin-T) were susceptible to degradation, initiating texture deterioration. By contrast, giant structure proteins (titin and nebulin) were degraded during later postmortem storage, predominantly contributing to fish softening. The results further suggest that caspase-3 is involved in degradation of structure proteins during postmortem through mitochondrial apoptosis pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEsox lucius 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3adesmin 3afood chemistry 3amembrane permeability 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aprotein degradation 3atexture 3atroponin T 0aCaspase 3 inhibitor 0aMitochondrial apoptosis 0aPostmortem storage1 aHu, Ling1 aZhu, Xinrong1 aGuo, Xiaobing1 aDeng, Xiaorong1 aZhang, Jian0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 367 p.130767-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009900167300001400266520126000280592002801540650002601568650001301594650001801607650001501625650001001640651001001650653002001660653001901680653001601699653001801715700001701733700001701750773009101767856008601858852000901944655001201953IND60607013620221119142839.0190402e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060701362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLentz, Erin10aDoes peer monitoring influence choices between cash and food? Findings from a field experiment  ap. 21-31.  aTo explore whether choices for transfers are influenced by peer monitoring, we examine private versus public choices among monetarily equivalent values of cash and food in northern Kenya. Many northern Kenyan communities face high-levels of chronic food insecurity and are tightly-knit, often sharing food aid transfers. Yet, humanitarian cash transfers are relatively new to the area. Whether cash will be subject to the same sharing norms is not well understood. Utilizing a randomized block experiment, we find that assigning a respondent to choose in front of peers decreases the likelihood of choosing a cash transfer relative to at least some food. We argue that peer monitoring decreases the value of cash relative to food in two inter-related ways. Choosing food in public, first, provides an opportunity for respondents to publicly demonstrate a commitment to local food aid sharing norms. Second, choosing cash in public may be riskier since cash does not yet have established sharing norms. A critical implication is that transfer choices and retargeting of resources within the community can be influenced by use of public or private discussions when eliciting community views, especially in communities where sharing is a salient social norm.  aPublisher supplied data 3afield experimentation 3afood aid 3afood security 3amonitoring 3apeers 3aKenya 0aFood assistance 0aCash transfers 0aPreferences 0aSharing norms1 aOuma, Robert1 aMude, Andrew0 tFood policy.g2016 Dec., v. 65 p.21-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012400174300001600298520219500314592002802509650001202537650001202549650001302561650001302574650001102587650002102598650002202619650001402641650000902655650001402664650002202678650000902700650000902709650001402718700002102732700002002753700002002773773009402793856008402887852000902971655001202980IND60086847620221120210329.0141102e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008684762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2012.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlorennec, Philippe10aFrench children's exposure to metals via ingestion of indoor dust, outdoor playground dust and soil: Contamination data  ap. 129-134.  aIn addition to dietary exposure, children are exposed to metals via ingestion of soils and indoor dust, contaminated by natural or anthropogenic outdoor and indoor sources. The objective of this nationwide study was to assess metal contamination of soils and dust which young French children are exposed to. A sample of 484 children (6months to 6years) was constituted in order to obtain representative results for young French children. In each home indoor settled dust was sampled by a wipe in up to five rooms. Outdoor playgrounds were sampled with a soil sample ring (n=315) or with a wipe in case of hard surfaces (n=53). As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Sb, Sr, and V were measured because of their potential health concern due to soil and dust ingestion. The samples were digested with hydrochloric acid, and afterwards aqua regia in order to determine both leachable and total metal concentrations and loadings by mass spectrometry with a quadrupole ICP-MS. In indoor settled dust most (total) loadings were below the Limit of Quantification (LOQ), except for Pb and Sr, whose median loadings were respectively 9 and 10μg/m². The 95th percentile of loadings were 2μg/m² for As, <0.8 for Cd, 18 for Cr, 49 for Cu, <64 for Mn, 63 for Pb, 2 for Sb, 56 for Sr, and <8 for V. Median/95th percentile of loadings in settled dust on outdoor playgrounds were 2/16, <0.8/1.3, 17/53, 49/330, 99/424, 32/393, 2/13, 86/661 and 10/37μg/m² for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Sb, Sr, and V respectively. In outdoor playground soil median/95th percentile of concentrations (μg/g) were 8/26, <0.65/1, 25/52, <26/53,391/956, 27/254, 0.7/4, 54/295, 23/57 for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Sb, Sr, and V respectively. These results are comparable with those observed in other countries. Because of their representative nature, we can assess children's exposures to these metals via soil and dust and the associated risks in urban and rural environments. Ratios of leachable/total concentrations and loadings, calculated on >LOQ measurements, differed among metals. To a lesser extent, they were also affected by type of matrix, with (except for Cd) a greater leachability of dust (especially indoor) compared to soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achildren 3achromium 3acopper 3adietary exposure 3ahydrochloric acid 3aingestion 3alead 3amanganese 3amass spectrometry 3arisk 3asoil 3astrontium1 aLucas, Jean-Paul1 aMandin, Corinne1 aLe Bot, Barbara0 tEnvironment international.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 45 p.129-134dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2012.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009900168300001300267520149400280592002801774650001601802650001501818650001401833650000901847650001901856650001001875650001401885650001401899650001301913650001901926650001201945650002901957650001501986651001402001651001002015653001502025653002802040653001302068653000802081653001002089653002802099700002402127700002202151700002802173700002002201700002202221700001902243700001602262773010102278856008402379852000902463655001202472IND60609223120221122065444.0180822e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060922312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaneras, Marc10aMulti-technique approach to rockfall monitoring in the Montserrat massif (Catalonia, NE Spain)  ap. 4-20.  aMontserrat Mountain is located near Barcelona in Catalonia, in the northeast of Spain, and its massif is formed by conglomerate interleaved by siltstone/sandstone with steep slopes very prone to rockfalls. The increasing number of visitors in the monastery area, reaching 2.4 million per year, has highlighted the risk derived from rockfalls for this building area and also for the terrestrial accesses, both roads and the rack railway. A risk mitigation plan has been launched, and its first phase during 2014–2016 has been focused largely on testing several monitoring techniques for their later implementation. The results of the pilot tests, performed as a development from previous sparse experiences and data, are presented together with the first insights obtained. These tests combine four monitoring techniques under different conditions of continuity in space and time domains, which are: displacement monitoring with Ground-based Synthetic Aperture Radar and characterization at slope scale, with an extremely non-uniform atmospheric phase screen due to the stepped topography and atmosphere stratification; Terrestrial Laser Scanner surveys quantifying the frequency of small or even previously unnoticed rockfalls, and monitoring rock block centimetre scale displacements; the monitoring of rock joints implemented through a wireless sensor network with an ad hoc design of ZigBee loggers developed by ICGC; and, finally, monitoring singular rock needles with Total Station.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3amonitoring 3arailroads 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aroads 3arockfalls 3asandstone 3ascanners 3aspace and time 3asurveys 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atopography 3aCaribbean 3aSpain 0aMonitoring 0aPrecursory displacement 0aRockfall 0aTLS 0aGBSAR 0aWireless sensor network1 aJara, José-Antonio1 aRoyán, Manuel J.1 aVilaplana, Joan Manuel,1 aAguasca, Albert1 aFàbregas, Xavier1 aGili, Josep A.1 aBuxó, Pere0 tEngineering geology.g2017 Mar. 09, v. 219 p.4-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014400170520105900314592002801373650002701401650001401428650001401442650001201456650001301468650002101481650001701502650002601519650001901545650001601564650002701580650002601607653002401633653002201657653003301679700001401712700001801726700001801744700001701762700001801779700001601797700001901813773010001832856008701932852000902019655001202028IND60747166720221116190632.0220205e20220130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074716672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Zhi-Feng10aInhibition of ultraviolet-induced sea cucumber (Stichopus japonicus) autolysis by maintaining coelomocyte intracellular calcium homeostasis  aApoptosis plays a critical role in sea cucumber autolysis. To investigate the ultraviolet (UV)-induced apoptosis, sea cucumbers with and without injection of BAPTA-AM (cytosolic calcium chelator) were exposed to UV (15 W/m²) for 30 min. The results showed that UV irradiation caused several changes in sea cucumber coelomocytes, including calcium imbalance, abnormal morphology of endoplasmic reticulum, upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins CRT, CHOP, and caspases 9 and 3, and downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. A comparison between the two groups showed that injection of the calcium chelator into sea cucumbers helped maintain coelomocyte intracellular calcium homeostasis and suppressed other abnormal changes caused by ER stress, indicating apoptosis in sea cucumbers is mediated by calcium imbalance and follows the activation of the ER stress pathway. Therefore, this study broadens understanding of the apoptotic mechanism involved in sea cucumber autolysis, which is helpful in developing preservative agents for sea cucumbers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aapoptosis 3aautolysis 3acalcium 3acaspases 3achelating agents 3acoelomocytes 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afood chemistry 3ahomeostasis 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aultraviolet radiation 0aStichopus japonicus 0aCalcium imbalance 0aEndoplasmic reticulum stress1 aDing, Yue1 aTian, Jing-Yu1 aLiu, Zi-Qiang1 aBi, Jing-Ran1 aZhou, Da-Yong1 aSong, Liang1 aChen, Gui-Bing0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 368 p.130768-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1307683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04167naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011900176300001600295520225000311592002802561650002102589650002802610650001102638650001602649650001502665650001302680650001302693650001702706650001102723650002002734650001302754650001302767650002102780650001502801650001502816650001102831650001602842650002402858650001602882650002102898650001702919650001502936650001302951650001402964650001602978650001802994650001503012650002303027650002203050650000903072651001103081700002203092700001503114700002003129700002503149700002003174700002303194700002003217700001903237700002603256773009403282856008403376852000903460655001203469IND60086847720221120210258.0141102e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008684772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2012.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNougadère, Alexandre10aTotal diet study on pesticide residues in France: Levels in food as consumed and chronic dietary risk to consumers  ap. 135-150.  aChronic dietary exposure to pesticide residues was assessed for the French population using a total diet study (TDS) to take into account realistic levels in foods as consumed at home (table-ready). Three hundred and twenty-five pesticides and their transformation products, grouped into 283 pesticides according to their residue definition, were sought in 1235 composite samples corresponding to 194 individual food items that cover 90% of the adult and child diet. To make up the composite samples, about 19,000 food products were bought during different seasons from 2007 to 2009 in 36 French cities and prepared according to the food preparation practices recorded in the individual and national consumption survey (INCA2). The results showed that 37% of the samples contained one or more residues. Seventy-three pesticides were detected and 55 quantified at levels ranging from 0.003 to 8.7mg/kg. The most frequently detected pesticides, identified as monitoring priorities in 2006, were the post-harvest insecticides pirimiphos-methyl and chlorpyrifos-methyl—particularly in wheat-based products—together with chlorpyrifos, iprodione, carbendazim and imazalil, mainly in fruit and fruit juices. Dietary intakes were estimated for each subject of INCA2 survey, under two contamination scenarios to handle left-censored data: lower-bound scenario (LB) where undetected results were set to zero, and upper-bound (UB) scenario where undetected results were set to the detection limit. For 90% of the pesticides, exposure levels were below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) under the two scenarios. Under the LB scenario, which tends to underestimate exposure levels, only dimethoate intakes exceeded the ADI for high level consumers of cherry (0.6% of children and 0.4% of adults). This pesticide, authorised in Europe, and its metabolite were detected in both cherries and endives. Under the UB scenario, that overestimates exposure, a chronic risk could not be excluded for nine other pesticides (dithiocarbamates, ethoprophos, carbofuran, diazinon, methamidophos, disulfoton, dieldrin, endrin and heptachlor). For these pesticides, more sensitive analyses of the main food contributors are needed in order to refine exposure assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTotal Diet Study 3aacceptable daily intake 3aadults 3acarbendazim 3acarbofuran 3acherries 3achildren 3achlorpyrifos 3acities 3adetection limit 3adiazinon 3adieldrin 3adietary exposure 3adimethoate 3adisulfoton 3aendrin 3aethoprophos 3aexposure assessment 3afood intake 3afood preparation 3afruit juices 3aheptachlor 3aimazalil 3aiprodione 3ametabolites 3amethamidophos 3amonitoring 3apesticide residues 3apirimiphos-methyl 3arisk 3aFrance1 aSirot, Véronique1 aKadar, Ali1 aFastier, Antony1 aTruchot, E.q(Eric),1 aVergnet, Claude1 aHommet, Frédéric1 aBaylé, Joëlle1 aGros, Philippe1 aLeblanc, Jean-Charles0 tEnvironment international.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 45 p.135-150dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2012.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010900208300001500317520180100332592002802133650001702161650000902178650002202187650001602209650001602225650002402241650002602265650001502291650001002306650002202316650001502338650002302353651001002376653003302386653001402419653002202433653002202455653000902477700001502486700001902501700001702520700001302537773010302550856008402653852000902737655001202746IND60609223320221122065501.0180822e20170130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060922332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sheng-Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1493-613612aA case study on large deformation failure mechanism of deep soft rock roadway in Xin'An coal mine, China  ap. 89-101.  aLarge deformation of soft rock roadway has always been a major difficulty in deep mining practices. This paper describes a case study of the failure mechanisms and stability control technology of deep roadway with soft rock mass in Xin'an coal mine in Gansu Province, China. Rock mass properties around the roadway are evaluated using geological strength index (GSI) based on the field data and the mechanical properties of intact rock specimens. The Universal Discrete Element Code (UDEC) software program is adopted to establish the numerical model of a ventilation roadway in Xin'an coal mine, and the micro-parameter calibration is conducted with the rock mass properties. The failure process of roadway under unsupported and primary support conditions is simulated; the deformation, stress and crack evolution characteristics were clearly illustrated. Failure first appears around the roadway surface because there is a high stress concentration around the roadway surface after excavation; the failure area propagates further into the deep surrounding rock as the stresses applied on the surface gradually decreases, finally resulting in a large zone of stress relaxation. There exists a large scale of tensile failure in the shallow rock, which leads to swelling and fracturing around the roadway. The primary support is low in strength with no support in the floor, which results in serious floor heave, side shrinking and roof subsidence. A new “bolt-cable-mesh-shotcrete+shell” combined support is proposed to support the ventilation roadway. The monitoring data in the experiment section show that the new support design successfully controls the large deformation of the roadway, which can provide helpful references for support designing of engineering in deep soft rock roadway.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoal 3acomputer software 3adeformation 3aengineering 3amathematical models 3amechanical properties 3amonitoring 3aroads 3astress relaxation 3asubsidence 3aunderground mining 3aChina 0aDeep underground engineering 0aSoft rock 0aLarge deformation 0aFailure mechanism 0aUDEC1 aChen, Miao1 aJing, Hong-Wen1 aChen, Kun-Fu1 aMeng, Bo0 tEngineering geology.g2017 Jan. 30, v. 217 p.89-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245006900173300001600242520133900258592002801597650001201625650002001637650001601657650002201673650002501695650002901720650001401749650001601763650001801779650002101797650001701818650001701835650001601852650001501868651001101883653003301894653001901927653002001946653002301966700002501989700002402014700002302038773007802061856008302139852000902222655001202231IND60546238920221120051457.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054623892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, João M.L.10aSustainability deterioration of electricity generation in Brazil  ap. 334-346.  aThe power generation sector in Brazil is usually considered to have a high level of sustainability because of its large share of hydropower, about 70%. The annual growth rate of the Brazilian power sector is about 4%/year with a growing capacity addition of fossil fuels, which indicates a deterioration regarding sustainability. This work utilizes multi-criteria analysis coupled with composite indicators to infer the sustainability evolution of the power generation sector in Brazil from 2010 to 2016. Seven criteria were considered: emission of greenhouse gases, immobilized area, use of fuel resources, water use, morbidity, energy generation reliability and energy efficiency. The assessment evidenced wind power and nuclear power plants as the most sustainable options for capacity addition after hydropower. Co-generation and combined cycle technologies should be encouraged in natural gas and biomass projects in order to reduce impacts on sustainability. The assessment is interdisciplinary and admits tradeoffs amongst different impacts and benefits, for instance, environmental impacts versus energy generation reliability. It is proposed that sustainability assessments be incorporated to the formal process of decision making in order to reduce opposition and facilitate obtaining consensus among different stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amorbidity 3anatural gas 3anuclear power 3apower generation 3apower plants 3astakeholders 3awater power 3awind power 3aBrazil 0aBrazilian electricity sector 0aSustainability 0aEnergy planning 0aProject indicators1 aCesaretti, Marcos A.1 aCarajilescov, Pedro1 aMaiorino, José R.0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 Dec., v. 87 p.334-346dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014500168300001600313520131400329536035101643592002801994596004802022596005202070596002602122650002202148650002602170650003102196650001402227650001202241650001202253650001102265650002102276650001802297650001902315650001602334650001302350650001302363650002202376650000802398650001902406651001302425700002102438700002302459700001702482700001802499773011702517856008602634852000902720655001202729IND60627664820221119084339.0190312e20180818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062766482DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2018.14916072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyeonji10aInduction of ER Stress-Mediated Apoptosis by the Major Component 5,7,4′-Trimethoxyflavone Isolated from Kaempferia parviflora Tea Infusion  ap. 984-996.  aKaempferia parviflora (KP) is a famous medicinal plant from Thailand, and is a rich source of various kinds of methoxyflavones (MFs). Many kinds of food products such as tea, capsule, and liquor are manufactured from the rhizomes of KP. In this study, KP infusions were prepared with different brewing conditions, and the amounts of three major methoxylflavones, 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF), 5,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone (TMF), and 3,5,7,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF), were analyzed. The antiproliferative activities of DMF, TMF, and PMF isolated from the brewed tea samples were evaluated. TMF was discovered to be significantly effective at inhibiting proliferation of SNU-16 human gastric cancer cells in a concentration dependent manner. TMF induced apoptosis, as evidenced by increments of sub-G1 phase, DNA fragmentation, annexin-V/PI staining, the Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, proteolytic activation of caspase-3,-7,-8, and degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein. Furthermore, it was found that TMF induced apoptosis via ER stress, verified by an increase in the level of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α), activating transcription factor-4 (ATF-4), and the splice isoform of X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1) mRNA.  aThis research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (2016R1A2B4016005) and by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2016R1A6A1A03012862).  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)  a005cMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning  cMinistry of Education 3aDNA fragmentation 3aKaempferia parviflora 3aNAD ADP-ribosyltransferase 3aapoptosis 3abrewing 3aglucose 3ahumans 3amedicinal plants 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteolysis 3arhizomes 3astaining 3astomach neoplasms 3atea 3atea (beverage) 3aThailand1 aMoon, Jeong Yong1 aBurapan, Supawadee1 aHan, Jaehong1 aCho, Somi Kim0 tNutrition and cancer.g2018 Aug. 18, v. 70, no. 6 p.984-996dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2018.14916073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007300165300001600238520112700254592002801381650001601409650000901425650001401434650001301448650001001461650001601471650001401487700001901501700001701520773011301537856008201650990002301732852000901755655001201764IND60095139020221120195708.0141104e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009513902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2010.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmmann, M.W.10aFerrous iron diffusion in ferro-periclase across the spin transition  ap. 393-402.  aWe present first-principle calculations on absolute diffusion rates of high- and low-spin ferrous iron in ferro-periclase. The diffusivity of high- and low-spin iron depends on the physical conditions (pressure and temperature), iron concentration and the value of the chosen Hubbard U. We also find that low-spin iron swaps back to high-spin during migration. Our results show that throughout the Earth's lower mantle, iron diffuses at a faster rate than magnesium (up to an order of magnitude). Thus, the effect of the spin transition only has a small impact on the rheology of periclase in the Earth's mantle. Using reasonable vacancy concentrations, we find that ferro-periclase is much weaker than MgSiO₃-perovskite throughout the mantle. We conclude, therefore, that ferro-periclase controls the viscosity of the mantle in regions where it becomes interconnected, such as regions of high strain around slabs or near plumes. At very high pressures, such as in Super-Earths, low-spin iron diffusion is expected to become much slower than magnesium, eventually making ferro-periclase more viscous than pure periclase.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3airon 3amagnesium 3arheology 3aslabs 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aBrodholt, J.P.1 aDobson, D.P.0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 302, no. 3-4 p.393-402dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2010.12.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04310naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002400179245011900203300001800322500001500340506007600355520215500431592002802586506003702614650003802651650001802689650001602707650002202723650001402745650002102759650002202780650001702802650002302819650001302842650002802855650002302883650002202906650001902928650001302947650001802960650003002978650002403008650001603032650002403048650001003072650002303082650002503105650001903130650004203149650004103191650002203232650005003254650002003304650001703324650003803341653001103379700002603390700001903416773010203435856007803537852000903615655001203624IND4465349220221207144148.0120419e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446534922DNAL7 a216854312pmid7 aPMC31898362pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcr1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertheloot, Jessica10aNEMA, a functional–structural model of nitrogen economy within wheat culms after flowering. I. Model description  ap. 1085-1096.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Models simulating nitrogen use by plants are potentially efficient tools to optimize the use of fertilizers in agriculture. Most crop models assume that a target nitrogen concentration can be defined for plant tissues and formalize a demand for nitrogen, depending on the difference between the target and actual nitrogen concentrations. However, the teleonomic nature of the approach has been criticized. This paper proposes a mechanistic model of nitrogen economy, NEMA (Nitrogen Economy Model within plant Architecture), which links nitrogen fluxes to nitrogen concentration and physiological processes. METHODS: A functional–structural approach is used: plant aerial parts are described in a botanically realistic way and physiological processes are expressed at the scale of each aerial organ or root compartment as a function of local conditions (light and resources). KEY RESULTS: NEMA was developed for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) after flowering. The model simulates the nitrogen (N) content of each photosynthetic organ as regulated by Rubisco turnover, which depends on intercepted light and a mobile N pool shared by all organs. This pool is enriched by N acquisition from the soil and N release from vegetative organs, and is depleted by grain uptake and protein synthesis in vegetative organs; NEMA accounts for the negative feedback from circulating N on N acquisition from the soil, which is supposed to follow the activities of nitrate transport systems. Organ N content and intercepted light determine dry matter production via photosynthesis, which is distributed between organs according to a demand-driven approach. CONCLUSIONS: NEMA integrates the main feedbacks known to regulate plant N economy. Other novel features are the simulation of N for all photosynthetic tissues and the use of an explicit description of the plant that allows how the local environment of tissues regulates their N content to be taken into account. We believe this represents an appropriate frame for modelling nitrogen in functional–structural plant models. A companion paper will present model evaluation and analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aplant tissues 3acrop models 3asimulation models 3aflowering 3anitrogen content 3aprotein synthesis 3awinter wheat 3aplant architecture 3anitrogen 3adry matter accumulation 3amechanistic models 3aTriticum aestivum 3aphotosynthesis 3anitrates 3agrain protein 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aComputer Simulation 2aDesiccation 2aFlowersxphysiology 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aProtein Transport 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aSoilxchemistry 2aTime Factors 2aTriticumxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aplants1 aCournède, Paul-Henry1 aAndrieu, Bruno0 tAnnals of botany.g2011 Oct., v. 108, no. 6 p.1085-1096dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcr1193Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011300175300001600288520139700304536012201701592002801823596003001851650001101881650001501892650001901907650001101926650001901937650001901956650002001975650002601995650001502021650001002036651001802046700002102064700002002085700001802105700003002123773011702153856008602270852000902356655001202365IND60627664920221119084605.0190312e20180818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062766492DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2018.14916082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNomura, Sarah J.

The Black Women’s Health Study is a prospective cohort study (analytic cohort = 46,889) among Black women between the ages 21 and 69 at baseline (1995). Fruit and vegetable intake and smoking history were ascertained via questionnaires at baseline and during follow-up. Associations between fruit and vegetable intake, smoking and lung cancer incidence (N = 306 incident cases through 2013) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Among women in this cohort, 6.1% and 5.6% reported consuming at least three servings/d of fruit or vegetables, respectively. Smoking history was associated with increased lung cancer incidence. Being a current smoker of ≥15 cigarettes/d was associated with higher lung cancer incidence compared to never smokers (HR = 17.4, 95% CI: 11.5, 26.4). Fruit and vegetable was not associated with lung cancer incidence intake (≥5 vs. <3 servings/d, adjusted HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.36). Associations between fruit and vegetable intake and lung cancer incidence did not differ by smoking history. Fruit and vegetable intake was low in this study population, but results do not support an association between fruit and vegetable intake and lung cancer incidence, regardless of smoking history.  aThis work was funded by National Cancer Institute grants R01 CA058420 (L.

The biodegradation efficiency was determined by LC/MS/MS analysis. The most active bacterial strain was B. subtilis, where it showed the highest biodegradation capacity (71.8% to 100%) of eight azo dyes. Bacterial strain B. brevis came next to it. However, the consortium of the five bacterial strains gave lower degradation percentages. On the other hand, the fungal strains and their consortium were more potent in biodegradation of all tested azo dyes, where ten azo dyes were completely (100%) degraded by the consortium. Two of widely used azo dyes, direct violet and methyl red, were further studied in relation to the intermediate biodegradation products by each of the tested fungi and bacteria as well as the bacterial and fungal consortia using GC/MS/MS. The major biodegradation product of methyl red was 2-amino benzoic acid by all of the tested bacterial strains and A. niger, while the major biodegradation products of direct violet by both bacteria and fungi were ethanol, 2(2-butyxyethoxy), followed by 4- methyl benzoic acid and phenol, 2,4-bis (1,1-dimethyl ethyl). The results of this study suggest the successful use of the four fungal consortium for the biodegradation of the azo dyes.

The first criterion, the proportion of cases followedâPCFâ(q), is the proportion of individuals who will develop disease who are included in the proportionâqâof individuals in the population at highest risk. The second criterion is the proportion needed to followâup,âPNFâ(p), namely the proportion of the general population at highest risk that one needs to follow in order that a proportionâpâof those destined to become cases will be followed.âPCFâ(q)âassesses the effectiveness of a program that followsâ100q% of the population at highest risk.âPNFâ(p)âassess the feasibility of coveringâ100p% of cases by indicating how much of the population at highest risk must be followed. We show the relationship of those two criteria to the Lorenz curve and its inverse, and present distribution theory for estimates ofâPCFâandâPNF. We develop new methods, based on influence functions, for inference for a single risk model, and also for comparing theâPCFs andâPNFs of two risk models, both of which were evaluated in the same validation data.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiometry 3adisease diagnosis 3adisease incidence 3amodels 3aprediction 3arisk 3ascreening1 aGail, M.

Measurements were conducted during three summer days by mobile traverses. Air temperature differences between the built-up area and the park were in the range of 0.5–0.8 °C during the day and reached a maximum of 2 °C at sunset. The thermal stratification of the air was mainly stable in the park and unstable in the built-up area. Inverse air temperature profiles in the park were less stable in open than in shady areas, and close to neutral at midday. The most unstable air was found in the north–south orientated canyons in the early afternoon. Possible heat advection from the surroundings, and thus uncoupling between the surface and the air, was identified through temperature gradients pointing at different directions within the 2.47 m profile. Examples at midday indicated that warm air advected as far as 150 m into the park.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aair 3aair temperature 3acanyons 3aclimate 3aheat 3asummer 3atemperature profiles 3aSweden1 aJansson, P.-E.1 aGustafsson, D.0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2007 July, v. 89, no. 3-4 p.185-193dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-006-0259-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011700168300001600285520132500301592002801626650002401654650002201678650002201700650002401722651001001746653002601756653002401782653002201806653003801828700001901866700001401885700001701899773007801916856008301994852000902077655001202086IND60546239020221121021006.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054623902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yue-Jun10aDirect energy rebound effect for road passenger transport in China: A dynamic panel quantile regression approach  ap. 303-313.  aThe transport sector appears a main energy consumer in China and plays a significant role in energy conservation. Improving energy efficiency proves an effective way to reduce energy consumption in transport sector, whereas its effectiveness may be affected by the rebound effect. This paper proposes a dynamic panel quantile regression model to estimate the direct energy rebound effect for road passenger transport in the whole country, eastern, central and western China, respectively, based on the data of 30 provinces from 2003 to 2012. The empirical results reveal that, first of all, the direct rebound effect does exist for road passenger transport and on the whole country, the short-term and long-term direct rebound effects are 25.53% and 26.56% on average, respectively. Second, the direct rebound effect for road passenger transport in central and eastern China tends to decrease, increase and then decrease again, whereas that in western China decreases and then increases, with the increasing passenger kilometers. Finally, when implementing energy efficiency policy in road passenger transport sector, the effectiveness of energy conservation in western China proves much better than that in central China overall, while the effectiveness in central China is relatively better than that in eastern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aissues and policy 3aregression analysis 3aChina 0aDirect rebound effect 0aPassenger transport 0aEnergy efficiency 0aDynamic panel quantile regression1 aPeng, Hua-Rong1 aLiu, Zhao1 aTan, Weiping0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 Dec., v. 87 p.303-313dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245005700169300001600226506011700242506007600359520080000435592002801235506003701263650001501300650001401315650002401329650002201353650002101375650001401396650001101410650001301421650001901434650001301453650001301466650002301479653001401502653002501516653001101541653001801552653001901570653002001589700001901609700001601628700001701644773014701661856008301808852000901891655001201900IND60745275320221207091502.0220824e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074527532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejar.2021.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEldeeb, Tarek M.10aNovel bio-nanocomposite for efficient copper removal  ap. 261-267.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlginate multiwall carbon nanotubes dialdehyde cellulose (ALg/MWCNTs/DAC) nanocomposite was prepared.

In the eastern Indian Ocean during the 2010/11 summer, sea surface temperatures 4–5 °C above average and an unseasonal, anomalously strong, Leeuwin Current (LC) triggered a “marine heatwave” along the west coast of Australia, with elevated water temperatures persisting for a further two years. Peak LC flows in summer/autumn transported pelagic early life history stages of summer-spawning coastal subtropical and tropical fishes southwards. This study examined whether the heatwave enabled the arrival, persistence and reproduction of such species in waters ≥∼32°S using a range of available datasets. Juveniles of Chaetodon assarius, Trachinotus botla, T. baillonii, Polydactylus plebeius, Psammoperca waigiensis and Siganus sp. recruited into nearshore waters at ≥∼32°S in 2011. Polydactylus plebeius survived until the summer of 2012/13. Trachinotus spp., P. waigiensis and Siganus sp. survived over consecutive winters, with Siganus sp. establishing a self-recruiting, breeding population two years later. A return to more typical summer water temperatures by 2013/14 was associated with an apparent recruitment failure of Siganus sp. This is a rare example of a tropical vagrant surviving to breed in temperate regions. Confirmation of range extension beyond existing limits of this and other tropical species will be primarily dependent on either continuous or intermittent recruitment from this recently established southern breeding population. Commercial fisheries catch and effort data were of limited use in this study because they were not designed to record small catches of unusual and/or non-target species. In contrast, fisheries-independent recruitment surveys recorded tropical juveniles and validated amateur observations provided important information on unusual species. The study confirmed the emerging contribution of ‘citizen scientists’ working with researchers to document climate related impacts in the marine environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetodon 3aPolydactylus 3aPsammoperca waigiensis 3aSiganus 3aTrachinotus 3aautumn 3abreeding 3acoasts 3adata collection 3afisheries 3ajuveniles 3amarine environment 3amarine science 3anontarget organisms 3asummer 3asurveys 3atemperate zones 3atropical fish 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aAustralia 3aIndian Ocean 0aClimate change 0aLeeuwin Current 0aWestern Australia 0aSea level 0aRedmap 0aCitizen science1 aDowling, C.E.1 aSmith, K.A.1 aFairclough, D.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9620-50641 aJackson, G.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2017 May, v. 13 p.19-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2017.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011900162300001600281520143900297592002801736650001401764650000801778650002001786650001901806650001801825650001501843650000901858650001801867650001501885650000901900651001101909651001201920700001801932700001901950700001501969700001401984773011201998856008102110852000902191655001202200IND60572814420221119033323.0170718e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057281442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-006-0252-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauder, M.10aSurface energy balance measurements at a tropical site in West Africa during the transition from dry to wet season  ap. 171-183.  aIn one of the first micrometeorological experiments at a tropical site in West Africa, direct measurements of all surface energy balance components were carried out. The experiment NIMEX-1 in Ile-Ife, Nigeria (7°33′ N, 4°33′ E), was conducted from February 19, 2004 to March 9, 2004, during the transition from the dry to the wet season. Three typical weather situations could be observed: firstly, monsoonal winds from the southwest blew over desiccated soils. Almost 100% of the available energy at the surface was transformed into sensible heat flux. Secondly, after several thundershowers, monsoonal winds swept over soils of increased water content, which led to a partitioning of the available energy corresponding to Bowen ratios between 0.3 and 0.5. Thirdly, harmattan winds advected dry dusty air from northern directions, which reduced the incoming shortwave radiation. Again, Bowen ratios range from 0.3 to 0.5 during daytime, whereas latent heat fluxes are still high during the night due to the advection of very dry air. No systematic non-closure of the surface energy balance could be found for the NIMEX-1 dataset. Unlike other experiments in Europe, most of the ogives for the sensible and latent heat flux were found to be convergent during NIMEX-1 in Ile-Ife. This can be attributed to the homogeneity of the surrounding bush, which lacks the defined borders found in agriculturally cultivated landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aair 3adata collection 3aenergy balance 3aheat transfer 3alandscapes 3asoil 3awater content 3awet season 3awind 3aEurope 3aNigeria1 aJegede, O.

Such liposome-GOx after intravenous injection with effective tumor retention is able to exhaust glucose and oxygen within the tumor, producing cytotoxic H2O2 and enhancing hypoxia, as vividly visualized by non-invasive in vivo photoacoustic imaging. By further combination treatment with stealth liposomes loaded with banoxantrone dihydrochloride (AQ4N), a hypoxia-activated pro-drug, a synergistically enhanced tumor growth inhibition effect is achieved in the mouse model of 4T1 tumor. Hence, by combining starvation therapy and hypoxia-activated therapy tactfully utilizing liposomal nanocarriers to co-deliver both enzymes and prodrugs, an innovative strategy is presented in this study for effective cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy 3agluconic acid 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypoxia 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasms 3aoxygen 0aAQ4N 0aGlucose oxidase 0aLiposome 0aStarvation therapy 0aTumor hypoxia-activated therapy1 aFeng, Liangzhu1 aDong, Ziliang1 aWang, Li1 aLiang, Chao1 aChen, Jiawen1 aMa, Qingxi1 aZhang, Rui1 aChen, Qian1 aWang, Yucai1 aLiu, Zhuang0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Apr., v. 162 p.123-131dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010400164300001600268520130200284592002801586650001101614650001201625650001101637650001401648650001501662650003301677650001101710650001401721650001401735650001601749651001701765651001001782700001801792700001901810700001701829700001701846700001901863700001301882700001301895773011301908856008202021990002302103852000902126655001202135IND60095139520221120195634.0141104e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009513952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2010.12.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Zihua10aLate Cenozoic central Asian drying inferred from a palynological record from the northern Tian Shan  ap. 439-447.  aSediments contained in basins adjacent to great mountains provide opportunities to reconstruct the aridification history of central Asia. Here we use a palynological record from the fluviolucustrine Jingou River section collected from the northern Tian Shan, NW China, to reconstruct aridification in central Asia during the late Cenozoic. Biogeomagnetic results show that the section was continuously deposited through the interval 28–4.2Ma. The palynological record, with the auxiliary of the principal component analysis and the diversity index, indicates that a late Oligocene wet condition existed in central Asia and shifted to dry conditions at 23.8–23.3Ma. The dry condition remained until 17.3Ma and subsequently ameliorated to a relatively wet stage to 16.2Ma, but then began to increase once again and reached a peak at 13.5Ma that last throughout the late Miocene and the early Pliocene. Comparing the aridification process to the global temperature trend and history of tectonics, we suggest that the long-term drying trend in central Asia is dominated by late Cenozoic cooling, while the dry events that occurred at 23.8–23.3Ma and 16.2–13.5Ma are more likely associated with regional mountain building. The land–sea redistribution further complicated the drying processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acooling 3adrying 3amountains 3apalynology 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asediments 3atectonics 3atemperature 3aCentral Asia 3aChina1 aDing, Zhongli1 aWhite, Paul D.1 aDong, Xinxin1 aJi, Junliang1 aJiang, Hanchao1 aLuo, Pan1 aWang, Xu0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 302, no. 3-4 p.439-447dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2010.12.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245012700163300001600290520074000306592002801046506003701074650002801111650001701139650002401156700001701180700001901197700002101216773012601237852000901363856008301372655001201455IND2035573320221207114019.0220422e199107  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203557332DNAL7 a10.1177/0261192991019003072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalle, Willi10aCorrelation between In Vitro Cytotoxicity and Octanol/Water Partition Coefficient of 29 Substances from the MEIC Programme  ap. 338-343.  aSingle linear regression analysis was used for chemicals of the MEIC (multicentre evaluation of in vitro cytotoxicity) project, to obtain a correlation between in vitro cytotoxicity determined in various test systems, according to data from the literature, and their lipophilicity.

Short term practices conducted annually and approximately every five years. Annual assessment reviews groundwater level from production and monitoring wells along with the flow data to examine well performance consistency. Step tests conducted either upon recommendation of annual assessment or approximately every 5 years to identify need for rehabilitation. Long term asset management procedure developed to identify wells in need of replacement or major modification over a 20-year horizon. In this procedure a prioritization matrix was developed which considers well age, average number of rehabilitations per 10 years, history of well condition and chloride concentration status. As a result, 33 wells were identified to be in good condition and replacement was not considered likely. Seven wells were identified as likely and 1 needed replacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3achlorides 3agroundwater 3amonitoring 3aprioritization 3apublic water supply 3asustainable development 3awater table 3awells 3aOntario0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2017 Sept., v. 5 p.14-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2017.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03811naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007800171300001600249500001500265520179600280592002802076650003902104650002102143650001302164650001002177650002802187650002102215650003002236650002002266650001302286650003802299650001602337650002002353650002602373650002702399650002102426650001102447650001102458650001102469650002002480650001402500650003002514650002102544650001302565650002202578650001502600650002702615650000802642653003902650653001302689653002902702653002102731653001802752653002402770653002202794700002802816700001802844700002102862700002402883773012502907856008403032852000903116655001203125IND60121865620221120041159.0150325e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012186562DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2013.8034802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsgari, Mishaneh10aPRODUCTION OF HUMAN TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR (tPA) IN Cucumis sativus  ap. 182-192.  a2019-12-04  aTissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as a serine protease with 72 kD molecular mass and 527 amino acids plays an important role in the fibrinolytic system and the dissolution of fibrin clots in human body. The collective production of this drug in plants such as cucumber, one of the most important vegetables in the world, could reduce its production costs. In this study, after scrutiny of the appropriate regeneration of cucumber plant (Isfahan variety) on MS medium with naphthalene acetic acid hormone (NAA; 0/1 mg L ⁻¹) and benzyl amino purine hormone (BAP; 3 mg L ⁻¹) hormones, the cloned human tPA gene under the CaMV 35S promoter and NOS terminator into pBI121 plasmid was transferred into cotyledon explants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA ₄₄₀₄. Subsequent to the regeneration of inoculated explants on the selective medium, the persistence of tPA gene in recombinant plants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers. To evaluate the tPA gene expression in transgenic plants, RNA was extracted and the tPA gene transcription was confirmed by reverse-transcription (RT) PCR. Followed the extraction of protein from the leaves of transgenic plants, the presence of tPA protein was confirmed by dot blot and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis in order to survey the production of recombinant tPA protein. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was used for recombinant tPA protein level in transgenic cucumber plants. It was counted between 0.8 and 1%, and based on this, it was concluded that the presence of three expressions of regulatory factors (CaMV 35S, Kozak, NOS) and KDEL signal in the construct caused the increase of the tPA gene expression in cucumber plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3amedicinal plants 3aplasmids 3agenes 3at-plasminogen activator 3apromoter regions 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aselective media 3aexplants 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aamino acids 3agene expression 3areverse transcription 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3amolecular weight 3afibrin 3aleaves 3ahumans 3aCucumis sativus 3acucumbers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproduction costs 3ahormones 3atransgenic plants 3acotyledons 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aRNA 0atissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 0acucumber 0atranscription (genetics) 0aprotein analysis 0agene transfer 0arecombinant protein 0amolecular farming1 aJavaran, Mokhtar Jalali1 aMoieni, Ahmad1 aMasoumiasl, Asad1 aAbdolinasab, Maryam0 tPreparative biochemistry & biotechnology.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 44, no. 2 p.182-192dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-22977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2013.8034803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245008100178300001600259500001500275520184200290592002802132650001402160650001102174650001902185650002002204650001702224651001002241653001802251700001902269700002202288700002302310773011302333856008202446990002302528852000902551655001202560IND60095139620221120195527.0141104e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009513962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2010.10.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgostinetti, Nicola Piana10aFluid migration in continental subduction: The Northern Apennines case study  ap. 267-278.  a2019-12-06  aSubduction zones are the place in the world where fluids are transported from the foredeep to the mantle and back-to-the-surface in the back-arc. The subduction of an oceanic plate implies the transportation of the oceanic crust to depth and its methamorphization. Oceanic sediments release water in the (relatively) shallower part of the subduction zone, while dehydration of the subducted basaltic crust allows fluid circulation at larger depths. While the water budget in oceanic subduction has been deeply investigated, less attention has been given to the fluids implied in the subduction of a continental margin (i.e. in continental subduction). In this study, we use teleseismic receiver function (RF) analysis to image the process of water migration at depth, from the subducting plate to the mantle wedge, under the Northern Apennines (NAP, Italy). Harmonic decomposition of the RF data-set is used to constrain both isotropic and anisotropic structures. Isotropic structures highlight the subduction of the Adriatic lower crust under the NAP orogens, from 35–40km to 65km depth, as a dipping low S-velocity layer. Anisotropic structures indicate the presence of a broad anisotropic zone (anisotropy as high as 7%). This zone develops in the subducted Adriatic lower crust and mantle wedge, between 45 and 65km depth, directly beneath the orogens and the more recent back-arc extensional basin. The anisotropy is related to the metamorphism of the Adriatic lower crust (gabbro to blueschists) and its consequent eclogitization (blueschists to eclogite). The second metamorphic phase releases water directly in the mantle wedge, hydrating the back-arc upper mantle. The fluid migration process imaged in this study below the northern Apennines could be a proxy for understanding other regions of ongoing continental subduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3abasins 3aimage analysis 3adata collection 3acase studies 3aItaly 0awater balance1 aBianchi, Irene1 aAmato, Alessandro1 aChiarabba, Claudio0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 302, no. 3-4 p.267-278dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2010.10.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245010800174300001400282520133500296592002801631650001801659650002901677650001801706650001301724650002301737650002001760650002101780650001801801650001201819650001601831650001601847650003001863650003101893650001401924650002701938650003201965653001001997653001202007653001502019653001402034653002202048700001702070700002102087700001702108773009102125856009102216852000902307655001202316IND60590485020221120085231.0190131e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059048502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Gyeonghui10aComparative evaluation of cell- and serum-derived exosomes to deliver immune stimulators to lymph nodes  ap. 71-81.  aTo determine whether exosomes are efficient carriers for immune stimulating molecules into lymph nodes, comparative studies of exosomes (EXOs) derived from different origins (cells and serums) in terms of physicochemical properties and delivery efficiency were performed. Serum-derived EXOs were of a preferable size and generated higher yields than RAW264.7 cell-derived exosomes (RAW-EXO). In particular, fetal bovine serum-derived exosomes (bo-EXO), with a size below 50 nm, were delivered not only to surface zones (subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophage zone) but also to inner paracortex zones (T cell zone) of lymph nodes, which allowed an efficient delivery of immune stimulating molecules to antigen presenting cells and T cells. The encapsulation of immune stimulating biomolecules (monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN)) within EXOs greatly increased intracellular delivery to macrophages via phagocytic pathways, which induced higher TNF-α and IL-6 secretion than free MPLA and free CpG ODN.

Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using goal programming is a popular and widely used technique to study decision problems in the face of multiple conflicting objectives. MCDA assists policy makers by providing clarity in choosing between alternatives for strategic planning and investments. In this paper, we propose a weighted goal programming model that integrates efficient allocation of resources to simultaneously achieve sustainability related goals on GDP growth, electricity consumption and GHG emissions. We validate the model with application to key economic sectors of the United Arab Emirates to achieve sustainable development goals by the year 2030. The model solution provides a quantitative justification and a basis for comparison in planning future energy requirements and an indispensable requirement to include renewable sources to satisfy long-term energy requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aplanning 3aresource allocation 3asustainable development 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aSustainability 0aMulti-criteria analysis 0aWeighted goal programming model 0aEnergy consumption 0aGHG emissions1 aColapinto, Cinzia1 aTorre, Davide La1 aMalik, Tufail0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 Dec., v. 87 p.447-454dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014500173520212800318592002802446650001902474650001602493650001802509650002002527650002302547650002402570650002602594650001302620650001002633650001102643650001302654650002002667650001202687650001502699650000902714653001702723653001502740653001702755653002602772653001902798773009202817856008502909852000902994655001203003IND60745275820221122130304.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074527582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenwood, Paul L.10aReview: An overview of beef production from pasture and feedlot globally, as demand for beef and the need for sustainable practices increase  aBeef is a high-quality source of protein that also can provide highly desirable eating experiences, and demand is increasing globally. Sustainability of beef industries requires high on-farm efficiency and productivity, and efficient value-chains that reward achievement of target-market specifications. These factors also contribute to reduced environmental and animal welfare impacts necessary for provenance and social licence to operate. This review provides an overview of beef industries, beef production, and beef production systems globally, including more productive and efficient industries, systems and practices. Extensive beef production systems typically include pasture-based cow-calf and stocker-backgrounding or grow-out systems, and pasture or feedlot finishing. Cattle in pasture-based systems are subject to high levels of environmental variation to which specific genotypes are better suited. Strategic nutritional supplementation can be provided within these systems to overcome deficiencies in the amount and quality of pasture- or forage-based feed for the breeding herd and for younger offspring prior to a finishing period. More intensive systems can maintain more control over nutrition and the environment and are more typically used for beef and veal from dairy breeds, crosses between beef and dairy breeds, and during finishing of beef cattle to assure product quality and specifications. Cull cows and heifers from beef seedstock and cow-calf operations and dairy enterprises that are mostly sent directly to abattoirs are also important in beef production. Beef production systems that use beef breeds should target appropriate genotypes and high productivity relative to maintenance for the breeding herd and for growing and finishing cattle. This maximizes income and limits input costs particularly feed costs which may be 60% or more of production costs. Digital and other technologies that enable rapid capture and use of environmental and cattle performance data, even within extensive systems, should enhance beef industry productivity, efficiency, animal welfare and sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3abeef cattle 3abeef industry 3abeef production 3aconsumers (people) 3adietary supplements 3aenvironmental factors 3afeedlots 3aherds 3aincome 3apastures 3aproduct quality 3aprogeny 3aprovenance 3aveal 0aBeef quality 0aEfficiency 0aProductivity 0aSupplementary feeding 0aSustainability0 tAnimal.g2021 Dec., v. 15 p.100295-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245005700169300001600226520119900242592002801441650000901469650001101478650002201489650001101511650001101522650002101533650001701554651001301571653001701584653002401601653001401625653001701639653002101656653001801677700001601695773007801711856008301789852000901872655001201881IND60546239620221121021049.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054623962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImran, Muhammad12aA short-run solution to the power crisis of Pakistan  ap. 382-391.  aPakistan is in a deep power crisis since 2008 which the government is trying to control by adding new generation capacity. This strategy, however, will not be helpful in the short-run. The only way, the power crisis can be controlled or mitigated in the short-run, is to efficiently utilize the available resources. Government lacks such a strategy at this point. The paper provides such a strategy by setting up a power sector model with multiple modules of generation, transmission and distribution. The model provides an efficient way of utilizing the available resources and can be used to perform simulations at different stages of the supply-chain. The results of model show that, if the given resources are utilized efficiently, the power generation increases by 3222GWh or 5 percent of the current output and the revenue increases by $945million or 12 percent. The extra generated power decrease the cost of power production by 0.52¢/KWh cents and reduces the power load-shedding for 2–3h. These outcomes can significantly relieve the sector and the people of Pakistan. The results of the model have important policy implications on working of the sector and circular debt reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3adebt 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apeople 3apower generation 3asupply chain 3aPakistan 0aPower crisis 0aGeneration capacity 0aShort-run 0aSupply-chain 0aPower generation 0aCircular debt1 aAmir, Namra0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 Dec., v. 87 p.382-391dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014300170500001900313520147900332592002801811650005301839650001301892650001001905650002001915653010201935653004802037653003402085653002302119653003002142653003202172700001902204700005702223700002102280700002002301700006702321700005902388700001902447773011502466856008502581852000902666655001202675IND60701470820221121060944.0210401e20200913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070147082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4613962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStilo, Federico12aA step forward in the equivalence between thermal and differential-flow modulated comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography methods  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aComprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) based on flow-modulation (FM) is gaining increasing attention as an alternative to thermal modulation (TM), the recognized GC×GC benchmark, thanks to its lower operational cost and rugged performance. An accessible, rational procedure to perform method translation between the two platforms would be highly valuable to facilitate compatibility and consequently extend the flexibility and applicability of GC×GC. To enable an effective transfer, the methodology needs to ensure preservation of the elution pattern, separation power, and sensitivity. Here, a loop-type thermal modulation system with dual detection (TM-GC×GC-MS/FID) used for the targeted analysis of allergens in fragrances is selected as reference method. Initially, six different columns configurations are systematically evaluated for the flow-modulated counterpart. The set-up providing the most consistent chromatographic separation (20 m x 0.18 mm dc x 0.18 μm df + 1.8 m x 0.18 mm dc x 0.18 μm df) is further evaluated to assess its overall performance in terms of sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, and pattern reliability. The experimental results convincingly show that the method translation procedure is effective and allows successful transfer of the target template metadata. Additionally, the FM-GC×GC-MS/FID system is suitable for challenging applications such as the quantitative profiling of complex fragrance materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3ametadata 3aodors 3aoperating costs 0aTwo-dimensional comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and flame ionization detection 0aReverse-inject differential flow modulation 0aSuspected fragrance allergens 0aMethod translation 0aMethod limit of detection 0aRepeatability and precision1 aGabetti, Elena1 aBicchi, Carlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1782-73571 aCarretta, Andrea1 aPeroni, Daniela1 aReichenbach, Stephen E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8615-07951 aCordero, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3201-07751 aMcCurry, James0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Sept. 13, v. 1627 p.461396-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4613963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009100178300001800269520105300287592002801340650001301368650002301381650002101404650001801425650001401443650001201457650001801469650001501487650002701502650001701529650001501546650001001561650001901571651001301590653001201603653001201615653001601627653001501643653003101658700002501689700002701714700002301741700002501764700003201789773012601821856008601947852000902033655001202042IND60627665520221119084744.0190722e20181126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062766552DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2018.15105122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassaye, Kassu Tadesse10aInfluence of phosphorus application on yield, yield components, and quality of linseed  ap. 2525-2535.  aSoil fertility depletion coupled with improper fertilization is one of the major constraints limiting linseed production in Ethiopia. Experiment was conducted in 2014/2015 on Nitisol in southeastern Ethiopian highlands to study the effect of phosphorus (P) fertilizer rate on yield, yield components, and oil content of linseed. It comprised of six levels of P fertilizer (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kg P ha⁻¹) arranged in randomized complete block design with three replications. Results revealed that P fertilization brought significant effect on biomass yield, harvest index, plant height, number of capsules per plant, and kernel size. However, it didn’t significantly increase seed yield and oil content on linseed. Considering its influence on increasing biomass yield and improving yield components, application of 5 kg P ha⁻¹ has been recommended for replenishing the extracted P, maintaining soil fertility and improving linseed production on Nitisols of southeastern Ethiopian highlands and other similar agro-ecologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitisols 3abiomass production 3afertilizer rates 3aharvest index 3ahighlands 3alinseed 3alipid content 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplant height 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3asoil fertility 3aEthiopia 0alinseed 0anitisol 0aoil content 0aphosphorus 0ayield and yield components1 aTirfe, Almaz Admassu1 aYilm, Wubengeda Admasu1 aHaile, Dawit Habte1 aTeto, Asrat Mekonnen1 aWeldegebriel, Amare Tadesse0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2018 Nov. 26, v. 41, no. 19 p.2525-2535dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2018.15105123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024005100112040001800163100001700181245007400198300001800272500000900290520150100299592002801800650002301828650001801851650002501869650001801894650001901912650001601931650001101947650001101958650001501969650001601984650001802000650001702018650002102035650002002056650002502076650001802101651001902119700002102138700001702159773012502176852000902301856011102310856009802421961001302519655001202532IND2037900920221118145019.0191122e199309  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203790092DNAL7 a10113/95132hdl7 a10.2134/agronj1993.000219620085000500012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, P.

This study was conducted to determine the N supplying capacity of crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), Austrian winter pea [Pisum sativum subsp, arvense (L.) Poir.], and rye (Secale cereale L.) to cotton and their influence on cotton yield and fiber properties. Green manure treatments (and a fallow check) with fertilizer N levels of 0, 56, 112, and 168 kg ha⁻¹ were compared for 3 yr on a Norfolk loamy sand (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Typic Kandiudult). Soil moisture at planting was similar among the four green manuretr eatments. At the 0 N level, the legumes generally had higher soil NO₃-N than rye or fallow. Cotton grown following clover and pea with 0 kg ha⁻¹ added N had petiole NO₃-N levels similar to those of rye and fallow with 56 kg N ha⁻¹. Fertilizer N had no influence on cotton yield in the pea winter cover treatment. A quadratic regression equation best described the lint yield response following clover. for both rye and fallow treatments, yield plateaued at 56 kg N ha⁻¹. Green manures had little influence on fiber properties. The results indicate that legumes supply adequate but not excessive N for modern cotton production and that incorporation of rye into the production system does not affect N fertilization requirements.

In some cases, this meant the adoption of stricter regulations such as for the co‐existence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and conventional crops. In other cases, harmonisation with EU rules entailed the need to give up more restrictive national regulation, for example: to allow the cultivation of a limited number of GMOs. This article examines why some Central and Eastern European states joined the group of Western European countries that instituted bans on the commercial cultivation of GMOs in the EU. This study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it contends that the prohibition of the commercial cultivation of GMOs in some Central and Eastern European member states must be interpreted in light of the EU‐wide public and political contestation of GMOs. Second, this piece of research shows that the ideological composition of governments matters in explaining the regulation of agricultural biotechnology. This second contribution allows for going beyond the predominant focus on public opinion when analysing the regulation of GMOs in the EU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aagricultural biotechnology 3aagricultural law 3acrops 3agenetically modified organisms 3apolitics 3apublic opinion 3aEastern European region 3aWestern European region0 tSociologia ruralis.g2014 July, v. 54, no. 3 p.362-381dVan Gorcumx0038-01997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soru.120463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009900160300001400259500001500273520120300288592002801491650002601519650002001545650001201565650001701577650001501594650002601609650002001635650001501655650001801670650002401688650001401712650002001726650001701746650001001763650001001773650001201783650002101795650001701816653001801833700001601851700001301867700001601880700001501896773009101911856004802002852000902050655001202059IND50072022620221117104807.0140118e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007202262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-013-0364-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzri, W.10aTranscriptome profiling the basal region of poplar stems during the early gravitropic response  ap. 55-63.  a2019-12-06  aStems of angiosperm trees are affected by gravity. Young poplar stems show primary growth in the top internodes and differential cambium activity in the basal internodes after inclination with some tension wood formed after 45 min. This study was conducted in order to characterize the early changes in poplar gene expression during the early stages of the gravitropic response. Using microarray technology, the expression of 15 000 genes was examined. Approximately 3.1 % of these genes exhibited significant expression changes within the first 45 min of gravity stimulation. Approximately 73 % of the identified genes were found to have a known or predicted molecular function. Many of these genes were involved in secondary wall formation (cellulose synthesis and lignification), cytoskeleton development, signaling, and stress response. Some identified genes seem to play a role in sensing gravitational signals during tension wood formation. A large number of the identified arabinogalactan (AGP) and transcription factor genes were involved in cell wall biosynthesis suggesting that these genes are particularly active in the first phases of signal transduction during tension wood formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3acambium 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3amicroarray technology 3astress response 3ainternodes 3alignification 3asignal transduction 3acellulose 3agene expression 3atension wood 3atrees 3agenes 3agravity 3aarabinogalactans 3aAngiospermae 0aMagnoliophyta1 aEnnajah, A.1 aNasr, Z.1 aWoo, S. -Y.1 aKhaldi, A.0 tBiologia plantarum.g2014 Mar., v. 58, no. 1 p.55-63dSpringer-Verlagx0006-31347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10535-013-0364-7  aDNAL 7aarticle01441naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007900164300001600243520036600259592002800625650001400653650001000667650001200677650001100689650001600700650001900716650001000735651001100745653001400756653001400770653001400784653000800798653001100806653001500817700001400832773010400846856008400950852000901034655001201043IND60479548820221119082746.0160122e20021101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047954882DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.44.2002.3-4.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorhidi, A.10aUna Hoffmannia nueva (Rubiaceae) en la flora del Estado Guerrero (México)  ap. 281-284.  aA new species of the genus Hoffmannia Sw.

The optimum pH for the adsorption by, and desorption of porcine trypsin from the rEBTI-Sepharose CL-4B column were 8 and 3.5, respectively. The rEBTI-Sepharose CL-4B was applied to purify trypsin from grass carp hepatopancreas to verify its practical utility. The enzyme was purified by one-step chromatography and migrated as a single band with molecular mass of 27 kDa from sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The optimal temperature and pH of the purified enzyme were 60 °C and 9.5, respectively, and it was stable within pH 6.0–12.0. The apparent Kₘ value of the purified enzyme was determined as 3.4 × 10⁻⁵ M using N-benzoyl-dl-arginine-nitroanilide as substrate. The trypsin was activated by Ba²⁺ and Mg²⁺, but was inhibited by Zn²⁺, EDTA and vitamin C. The novel trypsin affinity material rEBTI-Sepharose CL-4B could obtain grass carp trypsin of high purify by one-step purification, which is less tedious and more cost-effective than most current methods. The process can produce the enzyme in high purity to meet high-end biotechnological applications in the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aadsorption 3aagarose 3aascorbic acid 3abuckwheat 3achromatography 3acost effectiveness 3adesorption 3ahepatopancreas 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aswine 3atemperature 3atrypsin 3atrypsin inhibitors 0aAffinity purification 0aBuckwheat trypsin inhibitor mutant 0aCarp trypsin1 aHan, Yuhang1 aGao, Liufang1 aZhang, Yi1 aSimpson, Benjamin Kofi0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 July, v. 146 p.111382-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1113823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04299naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100004000155245016200195300001600357520252300373592002802896650002402924650001102948650001502959650001302974650001602987650002603003650000903029650003803038650001403076650002603090650001703116650001803133650002003151650001003171650001303181651001103194653002003205653001403225653001203239653001403251653002703265653001103292700007503303700002503378700003703403700006503440700002603505700001803531773009703549856009003646852000903736655001203745IND60592933620221119081901.0200419e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059293362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBezerra, Fernando Schemelzer Moraes10aEvaluating a point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen test (POC-CCA) to detect Schistosoma mansoni infections in a low endemic area in north-eastern Brazil  ap. 264-270.  aSchistosomiasis is still a public health problem in Brazil. The Kato-Katz test is the most frequently used diagnostic method for Schistosoma mansoni infection. However, it lacks sensitivity in areas of low prevalence. We have assessed the positivity rate of S. mansoni infection in Bananeiras, a village on Capistrano, Ceara, Brazil by performing a point-of-care test in urine to determine the circulating cathodic antigens (POC-CCA), and we compared the findings with those of the Kato-Katz technique for egg detection in stool and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for specific antibodies against adult worms (SWAP-ELISA) in serum before treatment (baseline). Additionally, the POC-CCA and Kato-Katz test results were compared at one and two years post-treatment, and only POC-CCA strips were utilised for follow-up testing on urine samples at 3–6 weeks. Only one sample of stool and urine was collected per event. Overall, 258 individuals were investigated at the baseline. The POC-CCA test detected 10 (3.9%) positive cases; however, this amount increased to 30 (11.6%) when considering trace readings as positive (t +), whereas the Kato-Katz method found only 4 (1.6%) positive cases and the SWAP-ELISA detected 105 (40.7%) positive cases. The consistency observed between a single POC-CCA (t +) or (t-) and the Kato-Katz (three slides) was poor (Kappa indexes <0.20). The highest positivity rate as determined by CCA and Kato-Katz was found in adults. At the baseline, a praziquantel treatment was administered to all individuals regardless of their infection status. According to the POC-CCA test, 93% of the previous positive cases became negative by the third week after the treatment; this rate reached 100% at the sixth week assessment. The follow-up showed that of the 175 individuals evaluated at one year post-treatment, only one (0.6%) showed ‘trace’ results, and all the individuals were negative for eggs in the stool. At two years, all 185 examined individuals were negative by the Kato-Katz method, and 11 (5.9%) presented traces by POC-CCA. Our results indicate that a single POC-CCA test reveals a significantly higher number of positive cases than the Kato-Katz technique for diagnosing S. mansoni in a low endemic setting, when trace results are considered as positive cases. Nevertheless, the true significance of the trace is not clear. These findings reinforce the need to associate different tools for improved schistosomiasis diagnosis in individuals with low parasite burdens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aadults 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3adiagnostic techniques 3aeggs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aparasites 3apoint-of-care systems 3apraziquantel 3apublic health 3aschistosomiasis 3aurine 3avillages 3aBrazil 0aSchistosomiasis 0aDiagnosis 0aPOC-CCA 0aKato-Katz 0aLow endemicity setting 0aBrazil1 aLeal, Joames Kauffimann Freitas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8069-54951 aSousa, Mariana Silva1 aPinheiro, Marta Cristhiany Cunha1 aRamos, Alberto Novaes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7982-17571 aSilva-Moraes, Vanessa1 aKatz, Naftale0 tActa tropica.g2018 June, v. 182 p.264-270dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245008700164300001800251520153000269592002801799650001901827650002901846650001201875650001501887650001001902650001401912650001101926650002001937650001701957650002001974650001401994650001602008650004402024650001702068650000902085700002502094700001802119700002002137700002302157700005602180773011802236856008302354852000902437655001202446IND60638579220221120025102.0190430e20190408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063857922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.9b001232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qian10aCa(II) and Zn(II) Cooperate To Modulate the Structure and Self-Assembly of S100A12  ap. 2269-2281.  aS100A12 is a member of the Ca²⁺ binding S100 family of proteins that functions within the human innate immune system. Zinc sequestration by S100A12 confers antimicrobial activity when the protein is secreted by neutrophils. Here, we demonstrate that Ca²⁺ binding to S100A12’s EF-hand motifs and Zn²⁺ binding to its dimeric interface cooperate to induce reversible self-assembly of the protein. Solution and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on apo-, Ca²⁺-, Zn²⁺-, and Ca²⁺,Zn²⁺-S100A12 shows that significant metal binding-induced chemical shift perturbations, indicative of conformational changes, occur throughout the polypeptide chain. These perturbations do not originate from changes in the secondary structure of the protein, which remains largely preserved. While the overall structure of S100A12 is dominated by Ca²⁺ binding, Zn²⁺ binding to Ca²⁺-S100A12 introduces additional structural changes to helix II and the hinge domain (residues 38–53). The hinge domain of S100A12 is involved in the molecular interactions that promote chemotaxis for human monocyte, acute inflammatory responses and generates edema. In Ca²⁺-S100A12, helix II and the hinge domain participate in binding with the C-type immunoglobulin domain of the receptor for advanced glycation products (RAGE). We discuss how the additional conformational changes introduced to these domains upon Zn²⁺ binding may also impact the interaction of S100A12 and target proteins such as RAGE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEF hand motifs 3aantimicrobial properties 3acalcium 3achemotaxis 3aedema 3aglycation 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3amonocytes 3aneutrophils 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolypeptides 3azinc1 aAleshintsev, Aleksey1 aBolton, David1 aZhuang, Jianqin1 aBrenowitz, Michael1 aGupta, Rupal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8637-61290 tBiochemistry.g2019 Apr. 08, v. 58, no. 17 p.2269-2281dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b001233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014300169520131800312592002801630650001901658650003101677650001801708650001401726650001301740650001301753650001301766650001101779650002701790650001401817650002101831653002401852653002101876653001901897653002901916653002201945700002001967700002001987700002302007700002202030700006302052773010602115856008702221852000902308655001202317IND60747418920221118184814.0211003e20211105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074741892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1272682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Mukul10aMixed Micellization of drug-excipients and its application to enhance the binding and encapsulation efficacy of ibuprofen in aqueous media  aDrug–excipients interactions would have to be identified to increase the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs and design better pharmaceutical formulations. This study focused on the use of chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM), an amphiphilic antihistamine drug, to optimise the encapsulation and binding of poorly water-soluble ibuprofen (IBF) in the aqueous medium. CPM was also utilised to make mixed micelles using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT). The mixed micelles of CPM-AOT and CPM-SDS revealed that CPM and AOT/SDS have a strong synergistic interaction. The objective of the mixed micelle formulation was to improve IBF binding (LogKb) and encapsulation efficiency (EE %) by increasing the αCPM 0.0–1.0 in the aqueous medium. At very high mole fraction αCPM 0.99, the maximum LogKb was 3.7 and 2.87, and the EE% was 87.08% and 78.96%, respectively. Furthermore, the molecular docking study was used to predict the position of IBF in micelles and mixed micelles, as well as its interactive features. According to the docking results, the IBF was more bind in the CPM-AOT mixture than in the CPM-SDS mixture due to electrostatic interaction. Finally, amphiphilic drugs could be employed to reduce the overuse of excipients like AOT and SDS in medicine formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantihistamines 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3aibuprofen 3amaleates 3amedicine 3amicelles 3asodium 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asynergism 3awater solubility 0aMixed micellization 0aBinding constant 0aSolubilisation 0aEncapsulation efficiency 0aMolecular docking1 aSingh, Vaishali1 aChoudhary, Riya1 akumar deb, Debojit1 aSingh, Sandeepika1 aSrivastava, Anirudh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0297-51060 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Nov. 05, v. 628 p.127268-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1272683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245012600170300001400296520186200310592002802172650001502200650001102215650001002226650000902236650001802245650002002263650003102283650001102314650001302325650001102338650002402349650001702373650001902390650001802409650001202427653001902439653001502458653002002473653001602493653001802509653001802527700001602545700002902561700002202590700002002612773011002632856008802742852000902830655001202839IND60529694020221122222803.0161019e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052969402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2016.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTydén, Eva10aDifferential expression of β-tubulin isotypes in different life stages of Parascaris spp after exposure to thiabendazole  ap. 22-28.  aAnthelmintic resistance (AR) to macrocyclic lactones (ML) has been described in Parascaris of horses world-wide. In contrast, benzimidazoles (BZ) are still effective, although reduced efficacy to this drug class was recently reported. The mode of action of BZ is binding to β-tubulin, which prevents polymerisation of microtubules. In this study, β-tubulin gene expression of isotypes 1 and 2 was investigated at seven time points (0, 6, 24, 72, 96 and 120h) during embryogenesis and in adult worms. In addition, an in ovo larval developmental test was developed to study β-tubulin gene expression of both isotypes in parasacaris eggs after exposure to different concentrations of thiabendazole (TBZ) for five days at 25°C. A strong pattern of differential expression of β-tubulin and isotype 1 was observed in all stages, while isotype 2 expression was mainly found at an early phase of the embryogenesis. For isotype 1, a 5-fold increase was observed during the first 48h, but gene expression gradually decreased after 72, 96 and 120h. Isotype 2 was only expressed during the first 24h, followed by a 130-fold decrease at (time points) 72, 96 and 120h. The in ovo larval developmental test, in which we exposed initially unembryonated eggs to increased concentrations of TBZ, did affect isotype 1 gene expression but not isotype 2. This assumes that each isotype has specific functions in different life stages. This is in agreement with the ‘multi-tubulin’ hypothesis, which states that different tubulin isotypes are required for specialised microtubule functions. Isotype 1 is the most likely drug target for BZs, as isotype 2 was only expressed at very low levels later in development. Increasing concentrations of TBZ altered β-tubulin isotype 1 gene expression after exposure of the eggs for five days, but this was not seen for isotype 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParascaris 3aadults 3adrugs 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahorses 3alactones 3alarvae 3amechanism of action 3amicrotubules 3apolymerization 3athiabendazole 3atubulin 0aParascaris spp 0aβ-tubulin 0aGene expression 0aLife stages 0aEmbryogenesis 0aThiabendazole1 aSkarin, Moa1 aAndersson-Franko, Mikael1 aSjöblom, Matilda1 aHöglund, Johan0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2016 Jan.,  Feb., v. 205 p.22-28dElsevier B.V.x0166-68517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2016.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245010500165300001500270520203600285592002802321650001602349650001602365650001002381650001302391650002202404650001702426650001102443650001302454650001602467650002102483650002202504650001302526650001602539700002002555700001802575773010302593856007902696852000902775655001202784IND60132591520221122065254.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013259152DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.122972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Simon R.10aColour in a new light: a spectral perspective on the quantitative genetics of carotenoid colouration  ap. 96-103.  aCarotenoid‐based colours are model traits for research on animal signalling and sexual selection but, whereas the consequences of variable expression have been extensively studied, its causes are rarely quantified. This issue is complicated by the composite nature of carotenoid‐based colour patches, which combine pigments and a reflective background. Ultimately, the evolution of such colours will be determined by the processes that govern variable expression of these mechanisms. We present a novel approach to assessing the quantitative genetics of colour expression, in which reflectance spectra are analysed directly, thereby avoiding the data loss and inherent subjectivity of summary colour variables. Further, the influence of the component mechanisms can be distinguished in spectral analyses due to their contrasting wavelength‐dependencies. Using data from a 6‐year study of carotenoid‐based plumage reflectance in wild great tits (Parus major), we employ a multi‐parallel ‘animal modelling’ approach to estimate sources of variance for narrow (2 nm) wavebands across the visible spectrum. Moderate heritability estimates were limited to the violet‐blue region of the spectrum, diagnostic of the carotenoid content of plumage being heritable. The natal environment effect was limited entirely to the violet‐blue, again indicating that it relates to variation in carotenoid content of feathers. Other wavelengths were sensitive to annual and permanent environmental variation but only marginally influenced by additive genetic variation. Hence, background reflectance is the component that is more sensitive to the environment. Analysing reflectance spectra directly provided an objective perspective of the dynamics of colour expression that is not apparent when relying on summary colour scores. In this case, our results suggest that carotenoid deposition may be an effective target of selection and hence could explain the important role carotenoids frequently play in intraspecific signalling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3afeathers 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3amodels 3apigments 3areflectance 3asexual selection 3aspectral analysis 3avariance 3awavelengths1 aSheldon, Ben C.1 aMcGraw, Kevin0 tFunctional ecology.g2015 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.96-103dBritish Ecological Societyx0269-84637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.122973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245013200205300001600337500002000353520056100373592002800934596003500962650002000997650002201017650001701039650001501056650002001071650001901091650000901110650001401119650001201133650001601145650002201161650001301183650001101196651001201207700002101219700003401240773014101274856007901415852000901494655001201503IND60714434020221120112522.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071443402DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.127152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenahmed, Meryem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1698-260310aBiodiversity, spoilage capacity and heat resistance of mesophilic aerobic spores isolated from milk powders marketed in Algeria  ap. 771-780.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn analysis of milk powder isolates based on RAPD‐M13 and 16SrRNA sequencing has been conducted.

The electron donating capacity (EDC) of HA depends on their molecular structure, but also reflects the intensity of biological reduction in tidal environments. We examined twelve soils in three saltmarshes located along a geographical gradient and applied a specific sequential extraction procedure for the isolation of HA fractions bound (BHA) or not (FHA) to the mineral matrix by Ca²⁺ bridges, and investigated the relationships of their properties, in particular their EDC, with the biogeochemical characteristics of the soils. Spectroscopic assessment was carried out by UV–vis, FTIR and ¹³C NMR, quantification and characterization of radicals was performed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The EDC was determined by using the 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazolinesulfonic acid) (ABTS) decolorization assay and experimental data were fitted to a biphasic model to calculate the contributions of the fast and slow reactions to electron transfer. The results confirmed that the two HA fractions possess different structural characteristics and that BHA present higher EDC values compared to FHA. The EDC of both fractions is strongly related to the geochemical characteristics of soils, and represents an easily measured and highly informative parameter to understand mechanisms affecting redox processes in transitional environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3achemical structure 3adecolorization 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3amodels 3asalt marshes 3asoil 0aHumic substances 0aSalt marshes 0aRedox 0aEDC 0aABTS1 aToniolo, Rosanna1 aPellegrini, Elisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6972-95401 aMillo, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7651-46791 aCovelli, Stefano1 aContin, Marco1 aMartin-Neto, Ladislau1 aDe Nobili, Maria0 tGeoderma.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 419 p.115872-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1158723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01373naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245004500172300001600217520034900233592002800582650001100610650001000621650001100631650001600642650001900658650000900677650001100686651000900697653000900706653000900715653000900724653000900733653001300742653000800755653001500763773010400778856008400882852000900966655001200975IND60479549120221119082743.0160122e20021101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047954912DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.44.2002.3-4.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarreto Valdés, A.10aBrya Depressa Bordedi et barreto sp. nov  ap. 233-235.  aA new species of the very polymorphic genus Brya (Fabaceae) of West Cuba is described from the nutrient-poor white sand areas of Pinar del Rio Province.

Associations between risk factors and outcome variables were evaluated using univariable analysis. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for significant parameters. Sensitivity and specificity using receiving operator characteristic curve analysis were calculated for creatinine, potassium level and standard base excess (SBE) to denote survival or non-survival.Preoperatively, all cats were azotaemic: mean ± SD urea was 31.6 ± 26.9 mmol L−1 and median (range) creatinine was 562 μmol L−1 (95 μmol L−1 to off scale). Thirteen cats were hyperkalaemic (K+ > 6.5 mmol L−1). Anaesthesia-related complications included bradycardia (n = 8, 21.6%), hypotension (n = 15, 40.5%) and hypothermia (n = 32, 86.5%). Seven cats (18.9%) died postoperatively. Non-survivors were significantly (p = 0.011) older (9.8 ± 1.9 years) than survivors (6.4 ± 3.1 years) and had higher potassium concentrations (p = 0.040). Risk factors associated with mortality were ASA classes IV and V (p = 0.022), emergency procedures (p = 0.045) and bicarbonate administration (p = 0.002). Non-survivors had higher creatinine concentrations (p = 0.021) and lower SBE (p = 0.030).Intraoperative anaesthetic complications were common; increased age, poor health status, preoperative bicarbonate administration, hyperkalaemia and increased creatinine were associated with increased risk for death and can be used to predict risk for complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3acats 3aconfidence interval 3acreatinine 3adeath 3agender 3ahealth status 3ahypotension 3ahypothermia 3amortality 3aodds ratio 3apotassium 3aretrospective studies 3arisk factors 3asurgery 3aurea 0aFeline 0ageneral anaesthesia 0ahyperkalaemia 0akidney injury 0apost-renal azotaemia1 aBrodbelt, David1 aKulendra, Nicola1 aAlibhai, Hatim0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2015 Nov., v. 42, no. 6 p.570-579dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vaa.122503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245003800175300001400213520192900227592002802156650001202184650001602196650002102212650001902233650001502252650001902267650001002286650002602296650001202322650002102334650001002355650001502365650001202380650001402392650001102406650002602417650001402443650001602457650001302473653001202486653001502498653002402513653001402537653002602551653002402577700002302601700002302624773011102647856008802758852000902846655001202855IND60529694120221123005259.0161216e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052969412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2016.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabaldón, Toni,10aPeroxisomes in parasitic protists  ap. 35-45.  aRepresentatives of all major lineages of eukaryotes contain peroxisomes with similar morphology and mode of biogenesis, indicating a monophyletic origin of the organelles within the common ancestor of all eukaryotes. Peroxisomes originated from the endoplasmic reticulum, but despite a common origin and shared morphological features, peroxisomes from different organisms show a remarkable diversity of enzyme content and the metabolic processes present can vary dependent on nutritional or developmental conditions. A common characteristic and probable evolutionary driver for the origin of the organelle is an involvement in lipid metabolism, notably H2O2-dependent fatty-acid oxidation. Subsequent evolution of the organelle in different lineages involved multiple acquisitions of metabolic processes—often involving retargeting enzymes from other cell compartments—and losses. Information about peroxisomes in protists is still scarce, but available evidence, including new bioinformatics data reported here, indicate striking diversity amongst free-living and parasitic protists from different phylogenetic supergroups. Peroxisomes in only some protists show major involvement in H2O2-dependent metabolism, as in peroxisomes of mammalian, plant and fungal cells. Compartmentalization of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes inside peroxisomes is characteristic of kinetoplastids and diplonemids, where the organelles are hence called glycosomes, whereas several other excavate parasites (Giardia, Trichomonas) have lost peroxisomes. Amongst alveolates and amoebozoans patterns of peroxisome loss are more complicated. Often, a link is apparent between the niches occupied by the parasitic protists, nutrient availability, and the absence of the organelles or their presence with a specific enzymatic content. In trypanosomatids, essentiality of peroxisomes may be considered for use in anti-parasite drug discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGiardia 3aTrichomonas 3aTrypanosomatidae 3abeta oxidation 3abiogenesis 3abioinformatics 3adrugs 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzymes 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3aglycolysis 3amammals 3amonophyly 3aniches 3anutrient availability 3aparasites 3aperoxisomes 3aprotists 0aProtist 0aPeroxisome 0aMetabolic diversity 0aEvolution 0aFatty-acid metabolism 0aPeroxide metabolism1 aGinger, Michael L.1 aMichels, Paul A.M.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2016 Sept.,  Oct., v. 209 p.35-45dElsevier B.V.x0166-68517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2016.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04135naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003400145245015100179300001400330520243200344592002802776650002102804650001202825650001802837650002002855650001502875650001702890650001902907650001902926650001802945650001502963650001102978650002602989650002003015650001903035650002203054650001603076650001103092650001503103650002003118650002503138650001003163650001503173650001703188650002503205650001403230700002603244700002103270700002903291700002903320700001803349773010203367856007903469852000903548655001203557IND60132591620221121055600.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013259162DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.123112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno‐Gutiérrez, Cristina10aPine afforestation decreases the long‐term performance of understorey shrubs in a semi‐arid Mediterranean ecosystem: a stable isotope approach  ap. 15-25.  aPlant–plant interactions shape the structure and composition of plant communities, but shifts in interaction outcomes might occur in the face of ongoing climate change. We assessed the influence of Pinus halepensis plantations on the long‐term ecophysiological performance of understorey vegetation, by conducting a retrospective comparison (1989–2007) of growth‐ring widths, δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O between Rhamnus lycioides shrubs from two contrasting vegetation types: P. halepensis plantations vs. open woodlands. We also measured the leaf δ¹³C, δ¹⁸O, δ¹⁵N, and nutrient concentrations of understorey R. lycioides shrubs growing at varying distances from planted trees within pine plantations. Dendroecological and stable isotope data revealed strong competitive effects of planted P. halepensis trees on R. lyciodies. Shrubs in pine plantations showed lower radial growth and higher growth ring δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O than those in open woodlands, indicating lower stomatal conductance and photosynthesis in the former. The strong competitive effects of P. halepensis on understorey R. lycioides were most evident in wet, productive years. Conversely, in very dry years, there were indications of a facilitative effect of planted P. halepensis canopies on understorey shrubs. Within pine plantations, understorey R. lycioides shrubs growing at shorter distances from planted trees were forced to rely on more superficial and ephemeral soil water sources, which reduced their stomatal conductance (higher leaf δ¹⁸O) and interfered with nutrient uptake (lower leaf N and P concentrations and more negative δ¹⁵N). The intrinsic water use efficiency of R. lycioides shrubs growing in open woodlands has increased during recent decades as a result of their ability to adjust their stomatal conductance in response to increasing temperature and atmospheric CO₂. However, this adaptive response was much weaker or absent in the severely drought‐stressed shrubs from pine plantations. Pine afforestation strongly reduces water and nutrient availability for understorey shrubs in drylands, with potential long‐term consequences for ecosystem biodiversity, structure and functioning. Competition by P. halepensis on R. lycioides clearly outweighed facilitation in the long‐term, thus compromising the ability of understorey shrubs in semi‐arid pine plantations to cope with climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus halepensis 3aRhamnus 3aafforestation 3aair temperature 3aarid lands 3abiodiversity 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aecophysiology 3aecosystems 3aleaves 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant communities 3aplantations 3ashrubs 3asoil water 3astable isotopes 3astomatal conductance 3atrees 3aunderstory 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3awoodlands1 aBattipaglia, Giovanna1 aCherubini, Paolo1 aDelgado Huertas, Antonio1 aQuerejeta, José Ignacio1 aThompson, Ken0 tFunctional ecology.g2015 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.15-25dBritish Ecological Societyx0269-84637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.123113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245008400212520164900296592002801945650001501973650001801988650001602006650001702022651001102039651001902050651001102069653001702080653001802097653002102115653001902136653002602155653003302181700005902214700003602273700001802309773009602327856008702423852000902510655001202519IND60773013820221122065806.0220507e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077301382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1158732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancos, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3770-779310aEffect of the internal soil standard on the spectral assessment of clay content  aSoil spectral libraries (SSLs) are being created worldwide due to their enormous potential to train machine learning algorithms that may benefit environmental and agricultural activities. Accordingly, the extent to which the different SSLs maintain their accuracy for unknown samples is important. Recently, the internal soil standard (ISS) has garnered attention in the soil spectroscopy literature, due to its capacity to rectify systematic effects during spectral measurements. Moreover, a new initiative by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association (IEEE SA) to create an agreed-upon measurement standard and protocol for soil spectral measurements has been launched. Application of the ISS to align one spectrum with another for merging different SSLs is highly needed. This led us to postulate the necessity of evaluating the performance of spectral-based models using different large SSLs that were created following different protocols. Using the random forest (RF) algorithm, we tested four different well-known large SSLs to predict clay content. From these SSLs, two of them were created using the ISS method (GEOCRADLE and Israel) and the other two without (LUCAS and ICRAF–ISRIC). Then, three groups of soils from different regions (Israel, Czech Republic, and Brazil) were used as external test samples to examine the SSLs' performance. The SSLs that were generated following the ISS protocol yielded the best performance in a group of samples that utilized the same method. It was concluded that using an agreed ISS such as the Lucky Bay (LB) soil sample enables a favorable way to merge SSLs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclay fraction 3aelectronics 3aspectroscopy 3aBrazil 3aCzech Republic 3aIsrael 0aClay content 0aRandom forest 0aProximal sensing 0aRemote sensing 0aSoil spectral library 0aInternal soil standard (ISS)1 aGholizadeh, Asa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4419-54631 aDemattê, José Alexandre Melo,1 aBen-Dor, Eyal0 tGeoderma.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 420 p.115873-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1158733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008100164300001600245520041500261592002800676650001200704651001100716651001800727653001200745653001200757653001200769653001400781653001400795653001300809653001100822653001100833653001100844700002400855773010400879856008400983852000901067655001201076IND60479549220221119082809.0160122e20021101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047954922DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.44.2002.3-4.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorhidi, A.10aIntroducción a la taxonomía de la familia Rubiaceae en la flora de México  ap. 237-280.  aThe article gives the first complete survey of the genera and species of the United States of México, with analytic keys to the tribes and genera of the family.

In developing countries like Zambia, the availability of soil information is limited by the cost of new soil surveys. Legacy soil information could be useful to fill this gap. This study evaluated the availability of legacy soil information in Southern and Eastern Provinces of Zambia. We also examined the survey scales, legends, boundary density and map texture. We examined a number of exemplar transects undertaken by C.G. Trapnell from 1932 to 1942 in the region, evaluating the information provided on soil, vegetation, landscape and farming systems. An overview of this legacy was presented to a workshop of varied stakeholders in Lusaka, and their opinions on its utility were elicited. More than 60% of large-scale surveys known to have been conducted in the two provinces could not be traced and among those traced some map-sheets were not available. Most of the survey reports exist as hard copies and some are in poor condition, while only 7 are available online on the ISRIC website as scanned copies. The map scale and texture were not entirely consistent with general expectations, with map texture consistent with a smaller publication scale in assessed map-sheets. Stakeholders regarded the legacy information as a valuable resource, despite some limitations, suggesting that some of its features could usefully be reproduced in modern soil information. The holistic assessment provided for soil map units may be more accessible than single-property maps. Accessibility and understanding of soil information is seen as a limitation. There is an urgent need to preserve the legacy soil survey reports and maps that are still available in Zambia, and in other countries. This entails physical preservation of material, making it available, and studying it closely with current and retired soil surveyors to preserve their recollection of how it was produced and their understanding of how it should be interpreted. The preservation should include scanning of hardcopy reports and storage in national, regional, and global soil survey data hubs with links provided for easy access. Stakeholder enthusiasm for the format of legacy soil surveys suggests that renewed systematic soils surveys would be valuable.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aagricultural research 3alandscapes 3aresearch and development 3asoil 3asoil map 3asoil surveys 3astakeholders 3atexture 3avegetation 3aZambia 0aCornell protocol 0aLegacy soil information 0aStakeholder views 0aZambia1 aChabala, L.M.1 aSichinga, S.1 aLark, R.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2571-85210 tGeoderma.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 420 p.115874-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1158743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001700166245011200183300001800295520133900313592002801652650002401680650000901704650001301713650001501726650001601741650001701757650001001774650001401784650002401798650001701822650001501839650005201854650002501906650001201931650004201943650003801985650001602023650001602039650002502055650003602080650004202116650005102158650002402209650005902233650002402292650006802316650005802384700001102442700001502453700002002468700001602488700001702504700001702521773010602538856008302644852000902727655001202736IND4459691020221121003039.0141111e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445969102DNAL7 a213533282pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2010.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Huifeng10aRoot morphological and proteomic responses to growth restriction in maize plants supplied with sufficient N  ap. 1067-1075.  aThe primary objective of this study was to better understand how root morphological alteration stimulates N uptake in maize plants after root growth restriction, by investigating the changes in length and number of lateral roots, ¹⁵NO₃ ⁻ influx, the expression level of the low-affinity Nitrate transporter ZmNrt1.1, and proteomic composition of primary roots. Maize seedlings were hydroponically cultured with three different types of root systems: an intact root system, embryonic roots only, or primary roots only. In spite of sufficient N supply, root growth restriction stimulated compensatory growth of remaining roots, as indicated by the increased lateral root number and root density. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in ¹⁵NO₃ ⁻ influx between control and primary root plants; neither in ZmNrt1.1 expression levels in primary roots of different treatments. Our data suggested that increased N uptake by maize seedlings experiencing root growth restriction is attributed to root morphological adaptation, rather than explained by the variation in N uptake activity. Eight proteins were differentially accumulated in embryonic and primary root plants compared to control plants. These differentially accumulated proteins were closely related to signal transduction and increased root growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompensatory growth 3acorn 3anitrates 3aproteomics 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asignal transduction 3atransporters 2aAbsorption 2aAnion Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aBiomass 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHomeostasis 2aHydroponics 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aSeedlingsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aZea maysxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aLi, Ke1 aDing, Hong1 aLiao, Chengsong1 aLi, Xuexian1 aYuan, Lixing1 aLi, Chunjian0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2011 July 1, v. 168, no. 10 p.1067-1075dElsevier GmbHx0176-16177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2010.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014100154300001600295520137800311592002801689650001501717650001601732650001101748650001801759650001401777650001501791650001701806650000901823650001301832650002401845650001101869650001701880700001801897700001901915700001701934773013701951856007402088852000902162655001202171IND60618499620221117203526.0181030e20171219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061849962DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta09055b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuxi10aBiowaste-derived 3D honeycomb-like porous carbon with binary-heteroatom doping for high-performance flexible solid-state supercapacitors  ap. 160-166.  aCorncob sponge is a type of agricultural abandoned byproduct and abundant around the world. Herein, a facile one-pot carbonization and activation method is developed to convert corncob sponge into three-dimensional (3D) interconnected honeycomb-like porous carbon, followed by an effective binary-heteroatom doping to fabricate nitrogen and sulfur co-doped activated corncob sponge (denoted as N,S-ACS). The resultant products possess a high accessible surface area (1874 m² g⁻¹) induced by the 3D honeycomb-like framework and a highly porous structure that benefits a large ion storage and a rapid ion transfer. In addition to the electrical double layer capacitance, heteroatom doping evokes faradic contribution. N,S-ACS demonstrates a remarkable specific capacitance of 404 and 253 F g⁻¹ at the current densities of 0.1 and 10 A g⁻¹ in a 6 mol L⁻¹ KOH electrolyte, respectively, along with a high cycling stability with only 1% loss over 10 000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled symmetric flexible solid-state supercapacitors with the electrode of N,S-ACS and the electrolyte of a PVA/KOH gel display a high integrated energy–power density of 30 W h kg⁻¹ at 8 kW kg⁻¹ and a 99% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles at 3 A g⁻¹. The fascinating performance significantly endows N,S-ACS with great prospects as a supercapacitor electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acorn cobs 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3agels 3anitrogen 3apotassium hydroxide 3asulfur 3asurface area1 aXiao, Zechuan1 aLiu, Yongchang1 aFan, Li-Zhen0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2017 Dec. 19, v. 6, no. 1 p.160-166dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta09055b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245005200168300001600220520149100236592002801727650002201755650001301777650002201790650001401812650001201826650002201838650001301860650003701873650001601910650001701926650001101943650001901954650001901973650001801992650001002010651001502020653001002035653001002045653001402055653004002069653002302109653000802132653000802140700001702148700002002165773010302185856008502288852000902373655001202382IND60479549620221119083151.0160122e20030501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047954962DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.45.2003.1-2.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKokhmetova, A.10aYield stability and drought resistance in wheat  ap. 153-161.  aThere is little information on interaction between productivity, stability and drought resistance of crop. This problem is very important in Kazakhstan, where the most of the agricultural area is located in arid and semiarid regions. In this context the genotype × environment interaction (GEI) is of major importance to the plant breeders in developing improved drought resistant cultivars. In this study GEI and stability parameters of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) has been determined by field testing at three contrasting environments. The comparison of the performance and stability of the lines L3, L10, L5, L1 indicated that this breeding material tended to display better performance for main of productivity traits and stability for plant grain yield as compared with other RILs and parental forms. There was positive association between high leaf Relative Water Content (RWC), low leaf Relative Water Loss (RWL) and yield stability. Both physiological parameters (RWC and RWL) are good indicators of drought adaptation by wheat genotypes. A comparison of glume pubescent and unpubescent lines has shown close negative correlation for spike RWL and spike RWC of all pubescent RILs (R<sup>2</sup>= -0.845). So the glume pubescence can be used as a morphological marker and indirect criterion for selection of drought resistant genotypes. As a result several promising lines combining high yield stability and drought resistance has been selected and used in breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abreeding 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3aplant breeders 3asemiarid zones 3awater content 3awheat 3aKazakhstan 0awheat 0awheat 0astability 0agenotype × environment interaction 0aDrought resistance 0aRWC 0aRWL1 aSariyeva, G.1 aKenjebayeva, S.0 tActa botanica Hungarica.g2003 May 1, v. 45, no. 1-2 p.153-161dAkadémiai Kiadóx0236-64957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FABot.45.2003.1-2.133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002200136245011800158300001400276520200700290592002802297650002002325650002102345650002202366650002202388650001502410650001502425650001002440650001202450650001402462650001502476650001302491650002402504651001302528653002502541653002102566653002502587653002502612653001202637653001402649653002802663653001902691653001802710653002302728700002302751700002102774700002202795773010802817856007402925852000902999655001203008IND4431188120221121042933.0151127e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443118812DNAL7 a10.2193/2008-4422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenson, Thomas J.10aHabitat and Landscape Effects on Brood Parasitism, Nest Survival, and Fledgling Production in Swainson's Warblers  ap. 81-93.  aNumerous factors, including nest predation and brood parasitism, may limit populations of neotropical migratory birds. However, nest predation and brood parasitism are not constant, and temporal, biological, habitat, and landscape factors can affect the likelihood of these events. Understanding these patterns is important for species of conservation concern for which managers seek to provide quality habitat. One such species, the Swainson's warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii), is a neotropical migrant that breeds primarily in bottomland hardwood forests of the southeastern United States. Little is known of factors influencing reproductive success of this rare, yet locally abundant, species. From 2004 through 2007, we examined factors influencing reproductive success of Swainson's warblers at 2 sites in eastern Arkansas, USA, St. Francis National Forest and White River National Wildlife Refuge. We used 2-stage modeling to assess the relationship between 1) temporal and biological, and 2) habitat and landscape factors and brood parasitism, nest survival, and fledgling production. Brood parasitism was greater in this population (36%%) than reported elsewhere (≤≤10%%), but decreased throughout the breeding season. Nest survival was comparable to or lower than in other populations of this species and increased throughout the breeding season. The probability of brood parasitism was greater near forest edges. Although nests of Swainson's warblers were often associated with giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea), nest survival had a weak negative association with cane density. For nests that were successful, the best predictor of number of Swainson's warblers fledged was brood-parasitism status: nonparasitized nests fledged 2.75 young, whereas parasitized nests fledged 0.60 Swainson's warblers. Our findings suggest that managing and restoring relatively high-elevation bottomland forests that are located far from agricultural edges should increase Swainson's warbler productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3alowland forests 3anational forests 3aagricultural land 3awildlife habitats 3alandscapes 3awild birds 3anests 3anesting 3apredation 3aparasitism 3aecotones 3awildlife management 3aArkansas 0aArundinaria gigantea 0abrood parasitism 0abrown-headed cowbird 0afledgling production 0ahabitat 0alandscape 0aLimnothlypis swainsonii 0aMolothrus ater 0anest survival 0aSwainson's warbler1 aAnich, Nicholas M.1 aBrown, Jeremy D.1 aBednarz, James C.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2010 Jan., v. 74, no. 1 p.81-93dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F2008-4423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012700167300001600294500002000310520062000330592002800950596009600978650001701074650001201091650001601103650001401119650002201133650001001155650002301165650001701188650000901205650001301214650001401227700002301241700002201264700002101286700006201307773014101369856007901510852000901589655001201598IND60714434720221120122435.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071443472DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.127282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPimpitak, Umaporn10aDevelopment and validation of a lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of aflatoxin M1 in raw and commercialised milks  ap. 695-705.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAflatoxin M1 (AFM1), a group I carcinogen, can be found in the milk of animals fed with aflatoxin‐B₁‐contaminated feedstuff.

It represents a special skirt vegetation developing in contact with the chestnut oakwood on the edge of rocky ridges. It differs from the subcontinental rock-heath (Waldsteinio-Spiraeetum mediae Zólyomi 1936) living in the North Hungarian Middle Range by having a set of Balcanian, Pontic and sub-Mediterranean species occurring in both the shrub and herb layers. Higher indicator values of certain ecological factors, like temperature (T) and soil reaction (R) are indicating the special basiphilous and warm character of the habitat of the new community. SBT-spectrum shows the well-balanced state, the average values of VAL indicate the natural state of the community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3ashrubs 3asoil 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aHungary 0aEcological indicators 0aEcological indicators 0aHelleboro odori-Spiraeetum mediae 0aphytosociological characters 0arock-heath association 0asocial behaviour types (SBT)1 aMorschhauser, T.1 aSalamon-Albert, É.0 tActa botanica Hungarica.g2003 May 1, v. 45, no. 1-2 p.35-51dAkadémiai Kiadóx0236-64957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FABot.45.2003.1-2.53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012200165300001400287520118500301592002801486650002301514650002101537650001501558650001701573650002201590650001501612650001801627653002001645653001801665653001401683653002201697653001501719700001701734700001901751700001801770773010001788856008301888852000901971655001201980IND60773014420221122052335.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077301442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2022.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuexiang10aPre-intercalation of phosphate into Ni(OH)2/NiOOH for efficient and stable electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction  ap. 22-30.  aLayered Ni(OH)₂/NiOOH hydroxides are effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, but their activities are still inferior to those of benchmark RuO₂ and IrO₂. Notably, the long-term stability becomes a significant challenge. Herein, we present a novel volume OER (VOER) strategy to solve the problems via pre-intercalation of phosphate. Phosphate-intercalated Ni-Ni(OH)₂/NiOOH electrode was prepared by a two-step electrochemical method. The obtained porous electrode exhibits outstanding OER performance in the alkaline phosphate electrolyte with the overpotentials of 129 and 243 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm⁻², respectively, and stability for 1000 h. The exceptional performance is mainly ascribed to effective VOER and elimination of the interlayer-produced protons, because the phosphate-intercalation enhances the interlayer water content, interlayer spacing and proton transport ability, endows the interlayers with proton buffering capacity, and alters the chemical environment of the interlayer Ni-O. The finding provides a strategy to develop highly efficient and stable OER materials and reaction systems for layered transition metal hydroxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aoxygen production 3aphosphates 3awater content 0aElectrocatalyst 0aNi(OH)2/NiOOH 0aPhosphate 0aPre-intercalation 0avolume OER1 aTong, Ruijie1 aZhang, Wenzhen1 aPeng, Shaoqin0 tJournal of catalysis.g2022 June, v. 410 p.22-30dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2022.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010700169300001600276520165000292592002801942650002301970650001701993650002002010650002002030650001502050650002102065650001202086650002602098650002602124700001802150700002002168700002102188773010902209856008102318852000902399655001202408IND60580537420221120210418.0170921e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058053742DNAL7 a10.1007/s13213-017-1297-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmmar, Hala A. M.10aIdentification and characterization of genes involved in kojic acid biosynthesis in Aspergillus flavus  ap. 691-702.  aAlthough Aspergillus flavus is a strong producer strain for kojic acid (KA), up till now there is no report on genes encoding KA. Conversely, KA genes from A. oryzae have been reported, with kojA, kojR and kojT genes, an enzyme gene, a transcription factor and a transporter, respectively, having been cloned and characterized. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to identify and characterize KA genes from A. flavus. To achieve this goal, we first produced by gamma irradiation A. flavus and A. oryzae mutants with improved levels of KA with respect to wild type (WT) strains. Then, we cloned orthologs of A. oryzae kojA, kojR and kojT from A. flavus. Finally, we analyzed the expression levels of KA genes in mutant (MT) and WT strains of both species. The mutants A. flavus HAk1-M2 and A. oryzae HAk2-M26 were found to produce KA at levels 2.5- and 3.02-fold higher than their parent strains after 7–10 days under shaking conditions. The cloned A. flavus genes AFLA_096040, AFLA_096050 and AFLA_096060, exhibited 99–100% similarity to kojA, kojR and kojT genes from A. oryzae, respectively. Gene expression analyses revealed that the expression levels of KA genes nicely overlap with KA levels both in A. flavus and A. oryzae, MT and WT strains. In addition, we cloned the laeA gene, which controls the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites from A. flavus. The results showed that, unlike A. oryzae, the expression of laeA in A. flavus does not correlate with KA biosynthesis. Our findings are of importance and reveal that the gene cluster comprising AFLA_096040, AFLA_096050 and AFLA_096060 is potentially involved in KA biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3abiosynthesis 3agamma radiation 3agene expression 3akojic acid 3amultigene family 3amutants 3asecondary metabolites 3atranscription factors1 aSrour, Ali Y.1 aEzzat, Saeid M.1 aHoseny, Asmaa M.0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2017 Oct., v. 67, no. 10 p.691-702dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-017-1297-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245015000178300001600328520187600344592002802220650003002248650002402278650002802302650001402330650001002344650001102354650001402365650001502379650001302394650002402407650000902431650002202440653002302462653003202485653001402517653001802531653003102549700002102580700001802601700005902619700001802678773009702696856009002793852000902883655001202892IND60592934520221119081700.0200419e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059293452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLow, Gary Kim-Kuan10aGlobal dengue death before and after the new World Health Organization 2009 case classification: A systematic review and meta-regression analysis  ap. 237-245.  aSince the introduction of 2009 WHO dengue case classification, no literature was found regarding its effect on dengue death. This study was to evaluate the effect of 2009 WHO dengue case classification towards dengue case fatality rate.Various databases were used to search relevant articles since 1995. Studies included were cohort and cross-sectional studies, all patients with dengue infection and must report the number of death or case fatality rate. The Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal checklist was used to evaluate the risk of bias of the full-texts. The studies were grouped according to the classification adopted: WHO 1997 and WHO 2009. Meta-regression was employed using a logistic transformation (log-odds) of the case fatality rate. The result of the meta-regression was the adjusted case fatality rate and odds ratio on the explanatory variables.A total of 77 studies were included in the meta-regression analysis. The case fatality rate for all studies combined was 1.14% with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.82–1.58%. The combined (unadjusted) case fatality rate for 69 studies which adopted WHO 1997 dengue case classification was 1.09% with 95% CI of 0.77–1.55%; and for eight studies with WHO 2009 was 1.62% with 95% CI of 0.64–4.02%. The unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio of case fatality using WHO 2009 dengue case classification was 1.49 (95% CI: 0.52, 4.24) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.26, 2.63) respectively, compared to WHO 1997 dengue case classification. There was an apparent increase in trend of case fatality rate from the year 1992–2016. Neither was statistically significant.The WHO 2009 dengue case classification might have no effect towards the case fatality rate although the adjusted results indicated a lower case fatality rate. Future studies are required for an update in the meta-regression analysis to confirm the findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3adatabases 3adeath 3adengue 3amortality 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asystematic review 0aCase fatality rate 0aClinical practice guideline 0aMortality 0aSevere dengue 0aNeglected tropical disease1 aOgston, Simon A.1 aYong, Mun-Hin1 aGan, Seng-Chiew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8271-34201 aChee, Hui-Yee0 tActa tropica.g2018 June, v. 182 p.237-245dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001600293500001500309520124300324592002801567650001101595650002101606650001701627650001101644650001101655650000901666650001501675650001901690650001001709650002001719650001301739651001001752653001801762700002401780700001901804700002201823700002301845773010401868856004801972852000902020655001202029IND50061689620221120132210.0130319e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006168962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-011-0297-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFumikazu, Noto10aEvaluation of water resources by snow storage using water balance and tank model method in the Tedori River basin of Japan  ap. 113-121.  a2019-12-06  aWe evaluate water resources as the difference between the observed and virtual discharges, defined as discharge without snow storage during the snowfall and snowmelt season, in the Tedori River basin of Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. The virtual discharge was estimated using the Tank model, in which parameters of calculated discharge were determined when the predictions were consistent with the observed discharges except for those during snowfall and snowmelt periods. Precipitation increase factors, i.e., the ratio of precipitation in the basin to that of a Kanazawa site, ranged from 1.46 to 2.00 with an average of 1.68. Water resources by snow storage (WRSS) during 31 years from July 1976 to June 2006 were estimated to be 400–1,500 mm in depth, which could be considered a significant amount. WRSS gradually decreased over time from 1976 to 2006. We propose the water balance method to estimate WRSS and water resources by snowmelt (WRSM), which easily estimates these parameters without the need for any detailed analysis of hydrograph as that of the Tank model. If snowfall decreases due to global warming, we suggest this area would suffer an irrigation water shortage under the water right, especially in the early spring.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3airrigation water 3awater rights 3amodels 3aspring 3asnow 3awatersheds 3aglobal warming 3atanks 3awater resources 3asnowmelt 3aJapan 0awater balance1 aToshisuke, Maruyama1 aYoshio, Hayase1 aHiroshi, Takimoto1 aKimihito, Nakamura0 tPaddy and water environment.g2013 Jan., v. 11, no. 1-4 p.113-121dSpringer-Verlagx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-011-0297-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011900172300001600291520150900307592002801816650001401844650001401858650002301872650001401895650002101909650001201930650001401942650001401956650002101970650001201991653002302003653002102026653001902047653003102066653003002097700002402127700001602151700001802167700002202185773010102207856008302308852000902391655001202400IND60773014620221122040641.0220426e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077301462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2022.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Malek Y.S.10aFlexible homogeneous hydroformylation: on-demand tuning of aldehyde branching with a cyclic fluorophosphite ligand  ap. 105-117.  aTuning aldehyde regioselectivity via homogeneous hydroformylation of olefins using the same catalyst system remains a challenge. Here, we present flexible rhodium (Rh)-catalyzed hydroformylation of 1-octene and propylene with a bulky cyclic monofluorophosphite ligand L. Hydroformylation of 1-octene with Rh/L catalyst achieves, for the first time, turnover frequencies exceeding 75,000 mol ald.mol Rh⁻¹.h⁻¹ (at 30% conversion) in segmented flow, while enabling access to an unmatched tunable aldehyde branching (0.06 < linear/branched < 15) with the same ligand L. Our mechanistic studies demonstrate that L provides a viable alternative to traditional bidentate phosphine/phosphite ligands for high activity with the added benefit of tunable selectivity. The unique high flexibility feature of L over traditional linear- or branched-selective ligands allows for on-demand tuning from 90% linear to 75% branched aldehyde in a continuous flow reactor without the need for ligand/catalyst alteration. Furthermore, when starting from the internal olefins, Rh/L catalyst achieves high regioselectivity (>90%) toward the two positional aldehyde isomers. The high turnover frequencies obtained with L in flow will enhance the economics of the production of aldehydes and their isotopically labeled analogues by significantly reducing the reaction time, thereby enabling better utilization of the increasingly expensive Rh catalyst and minimizing the need for catalyst/ligand separation and recycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aeconomics 3aisotope labeling 3aligands 3aphosphine 3apropylene 3aregioselectivity 3arhodium 0aFlexible Catalysis 0aHydroformylation 0aFlow Chemistry 0aTunable Aldehyde Branching 0aMicroreaction Engineering1 aBennett, Jeffrey A.1 aMason, Dawn1 aRodgers, Jody1 aAbolhasani, Milad0 tJournal of catalysis.g2022 May, v. 409 p.105-117dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2022.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012200170520169300292592002801985650001302013650001602026650001202042650002902054650002202083650002102105650001002126650001702136651001102153653001802164653003102182653003502213653003002248700001802278700002002296700001902316700002102335773010302356856008502459852000902544655001202553IND60683419220221119061232.0220411e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068341922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1092162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Fengzheng,10aQuantifying source apportionment for ambient haze: An image haze extraction approach with air quality monitoring data  aThe annual average concentration of fine particles (PM₂.₅) in Taiwan has been decreasing yearly. However, ambient haze has not abated and visibility is still poor. This study proposes a method for quantifying the source apportionment of ambient haze from various constituents, namely measured PM₂.₅, moisture, and secondary organic aerosols (SOA, represented by the sum of measured O₃ and NO₂ levels). This study's model-based demisting technology integrated image haze extracting technology with air quality monitoring data. The images for haze extraction were from the instant cameras of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency's air quality monitoring stations (AQMSs). Results indicate that haze constituents with the product of light extinction and scene depth have very high correlation (R² ≥ 0.8452), which demonstrate that this quantification approach was successful. The contributions of ambient haze from various constituents had quarterly and regional variations in the eastern, northern, central, and southern regions of Taiwan, which are slightly, lowly, moderately, and heavily contaminated areas, respectively. Each area was assigned a selected representative AQMS to represent its ambient haze characteristics. Cases where the dominant contributors to haze were PM₂.₅, moisture, and SOA were studied, in addition to the event days of PM₂.₅ and ozone.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementing ewes’ diet with tannin and/or linseed oil on the physicochemical characteristics and fatty acid profile of milk, as well as the antioxidant status of dairy ewes. The study involved 36 3‐year‐old lactating Moghani sheep randomly assigned to six treatment groups. Results demonstrated that tannin extract and linseed oil changed the fatty acid content of milk. In particular, unsaturated fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid were increased by the treatments (P < 0.05). Generally, groups receiving tannin extracts and/or oil showed higher concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids in their milk, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids including C18:3n3, C20:2, C20:3n3, C20:4n6, CLA cis‐9 trans‐11, CLA trans‐10 cis‐12, C22:2 and total unsaturated fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adairy sheep 3adiet 3aewe milk 3aewes 3afatty acid composition 3alactation 3alinseed oil 3amilk 3amilk yield 3anutritional intervention 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aMirzaei Aghjehgheshlagh, Farzad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2607-29531 aMahdavī, ʻAlī,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5867-92931 aNavidshad, Bahman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7102-96151 aStaji, Hamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3406-73610 tInternational journal of dairy technology.g2020 Nov., v. 73, no. 4 p.656-666dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl55233x1364-727X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0307.127163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245013800165300001600303520164000319592002801959650001201987650002501999650001702024650001902041650001602060650002802076650001802104650001702122650001202139650001402151650002402165650001402189650001202203650001902215650001002234700002102244700003002265700002302295773012302318856007302441852000902514655001202523IND50090227320221120035418.0150206e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009022732DNAL7 a10.1111/jfq.120892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKodal Coşkun, Betül10aAntioxidant Active Packaging with Soy Edible Films and Oregano or Thyme Essential Oils for Oxidative Stability of Ground Beef Patties  ap. 203-212.  aThe effectiveness of soy‐based edible films (EF) incorporated with essential oils (EO) from oregano (OR, Oreganum heracleoticum L.) or thyme (TH, Thymus vulgaris L.) applied on oxidative stability of ground beef patties (GBP) was investigated at 4C for 12 days. Higher antioxidant activity by OR than TH EO was determined with a 2,2'‐diphenyl‐2‐picrylhydrazyl radical‐scavenging assay. Induction time of oxidation measured with the Rancimat test in lipids of GBP was extended with the addition of EOs to EFs. Lower peroxide and free fatty acidity (P < 0.05) values were determined with OR‐EF or TH‐EF, particularly at later stages of storage. Incorporation of EO from OR or TH into the EFs resulted in reduced, but acceptable, redness (a*) values (P < 0.05) in ground beef. This study suggests that the addition of OR or TH EOs into EFs as an antioxidant active packaging is effective in retarding oxidative changes in meats. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Oxidation reactions are among the most important factors responsible for loss of quality in meat products. Packaging using edible films (EFs) with the inclusion of natural plant extracts is becoming a promising active packaging approach to control oxidative changes in food products during storage. This study was focused on the inclusion of thyme or oregano essential oils (EOs) into EF formulation to control oxidative changes in ground beef patties. Results indicate that inclusion of EOs as antioxidants into soy‐based EFs offers great potential in industrial applications for controlling oxidative changes in the manufacture of natural meat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3aedible films 3aessential oils 3aground beef 3aindustrial applications 3amanufacturing 3ameat quality 3aoregano 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apackaging 3apatties 3aplant extracts 3athyme1 aÇalikoğlu, Eda1 aKaragöz Emiroğlu, Zehra1 aCandoğan, Kezban,0 tJournal of food quality.g2014 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.203-212dFood & Nutrition PresswJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfq.120893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245014600205300001600351520114500367592002801512650001501540650001501555650001801570650001601588650001801604650001701622650001901639650001901658650001901677650002801696653002101724653002601745653002201771653001901793653002001812700001401832700005301846700001601899700005701915700001601972700001201988700001402000700002002014700001702034700001402051773012502065856008302190852000902273655001202282IND60670253120221120224415.0200607e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067025312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.09.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, Wangchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6151-509X10aCarbonate doped Bi2MoO6 hierarchical nanostructure with enhanced transformation of active radicals for efficient photocatalytic removal of NO  ap. 816-824.  aDoping heteroatoms in photocatalyst is an effective strategy to signally enhance the photocatalytic activity. Herein, we have favorably fabricated the carbonate doped Bi₂MoO₆ via a facile one-pot solvothermal method, which was verified by structure and constituent characterization analysis. In addition, the NO removal efficiency of carbonate-intercalated Bi₂MoO₆ is ~34%, far-exceeding that of the pure Bi₂MoO₆ (~13%), whilst exhibits a good stability and durability, owing to that the dopants could modulate the electron states of the Bi₂MoO₆, thus stimulating charge separation and migration, incenting transformation of reactive oxygen species and facilitating reactants activation, which are synthetically investigated by experimental characterization coupled with DFT calculation. Significantly, the in situ DRIFTS measurement was employed to dynamic monitor the NO oxidation process and clarify the photocatalytic mechanism under visible light irradiation. This work provides an efficient strategy to design photocatalysts with tunable motivating charge conversion and reactants activation towards NO photooxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3adurability 3afree radicals 3airradiation 3ananomaterials 3anitric oxide 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotooxidation 3areactive oxygen species 0aDoping carbonate 0aBi2MoO6 photocatalyst 0aOxidation process 0aIn situ DRIFTS 0aDFT calculation1 aXu, Weina1 aCao, Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4698-56451 aGuo, Ziyang1 aLiu, Xiaoying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4621-27221 aGe, Guangxu1 aLi, Nan1 aLan, Tian1 aYao, Hong-Chang1 aZhang, Yuxin1 aDong, Fan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 557 p.816-824dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.09.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007300167520113900240592002801379650001301407650001101420650002501431650002101456650001901477650001701496650000901513650001501522650001101537650001001548650001801558650002101576650002001597653001901617653002301636653002301659653001601682653002001698700001301718700001201731773010401743856008501847852000901932655001201941IND60683419320221119061144.0200419e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068341932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1092182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Benhong10aEffective removal of phosphorus from eutrophic water by using cement  aIncreasing discharge of excessive phosphorus (P) has caused widespread eutrophication and water pollution that threaten both ecological and human health. There are many ways to remove P from eutrophic water, but there are various deficiencies. Conventional P removal is based largely on the use of Al or Fe salts and few methods can be directly used in field eutrophic water. Our research revealed that direct use of ordinary Portland cement could effectively remove P from eutrophic water bodies. Laboratory experiments indicate that a one-time application of cement reduced Total Phosphorus (TP) concentration of both eutrophic urban water and synthetic solutions to below 0.2 mg/L. A second application further reduced TP to below 0.04 mg/L. Use of cement also caused an increase in dissolved oxygen (DO) content in samples. Cement was directly used in eutrophic water body of a river and TP concentration was reduced to an allowable level. Use of readily available cement can contribute to the clean up of water pollution in developing countries. This study provides an innovative and easy solution to widespread eutrophication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acement 3adeveloping countries 3adissolved oxygen 3aeutrophication 3ahuman health 3airon 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3asalts 3asurface water 3atotal phosphorus 3awater pollution 0aEutrophication 0aPhosphorus removal 0aRemoval efficiency 0aNew methods 0aWater pollution1 aLiu, Lei1 aLi, Wei0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 Apr., v. 183 p.109218-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1092183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01501naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007400172300001400246520048900260592002800749650001400777650002700791650001900818651001000837653001400847653001400861653001600875653001600891653001000907653002600917700001400943773010100957856008401058852000901142655001201151IND60479550120221119083119.0160122e20030501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047955012DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.45.2003.1-2.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuah-Petiot, M.

The effect of calcinating temperature (400–700 °C) on crystallinity of nano-samples has been studied. The improvement in crystallinity is evident from growth of crystallites with an average size between 12 and 15 nm. Further, the microstructural analysis performed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) which reveals an average size of grains i.e. (17–32 nm), consistent to XRD data. In addition, the dielectric constant of prepared nanoparticles was determined which demonstrate a substantial effect of annealing temperature. The minimum value of dielectric constant was achieved at higher frequency. Moreover, the temperature and frequency dependent tangent loss, dielectric constant and bulk modulus have been studied. Based on these excellent results, we suggest that our prepared BFO nanoparticles possess potential applications in advanced magneto and ferroelectric devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth 3acrystal structure 3adielectric properties 3aferrimagnetic materials 3airon oxides 3asol-gel processing 3atemperature 0aMultiferroics 0aNanoparticles 0aSol–gel auto combustion 0aX-ray diffraction 0aSEM1 aKhālid, Muḥammad,1 aMustafa, Ghulam1 aAlObaid, Abeer A.1 aAl-Muhimeed, Tahani I.1 aAkhtar, Muhammad Saeed1 aAzam, Arif Akhtar1 aNazir, Ghazanfar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7176-96751 aAbd-Rabboh, Hisham S.M.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Nov. 05, v. 628 p.127328-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1273283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245011000203300002000313520126800333592002801601653002001629653002401649653001901673653001801692653003201710700001701742700003001759700002301789700002501812700001901837700002301856773019501879856007902074852000902153655001202162IND60517949720221117171009.0160406e20150922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051794972DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15159821122doi7 aPMC45868442pmcid7 a263541232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Weizhe10aAutomated measurement of mouse social behaviors using depth sensing, video tracking, and machine learning  ap. E5351-E5360.  aA lack of automated, quantitative, and accurate assessment of social behaviors in mammalian animal models has limited progress toward understanding mechanisms underlying social interactions and their disorders such as autism. Here we present a new integrated hardware and software system that combines video tracking, depth sensing, and machine learning for automatic detection and quantification of social behaviors involving close and dynamic interactions between two mice of different coat colors in their home cage. We designed a hardware setup that integrates traditional video cameras with a depth camera, developed computer vision tools to extract the body “pose” of individual animals in a social context, and used a supervised learning algorithm to classify several well-described social behaviors. We validated the robustness of the automated classifiers in various experimental settings and used them to examine how genetic background, such as that of Black and Tan Brachyury (BTBR) mice (a previously reported autism model), influences social behavior. Our integrated approach allows for rapid, automated measurement of social behaviors across diverse experimental designs and also affords the ability to develop new, objective behavioral metrics.  aPublisher supplied data 0asocial behavior 0abehavioral tracking 0amachine vision 0adepth sensing 0asupervised machine learning1 aKennedy, Ann1 aBurgos-Artizzu, Xavier P.1 aZelikowsky, Moriel1 aNavonne, Santiago G.1 aPerona, Pietro1 aAnderson, David J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Sept. 22, v. 112, no. 38 p.E5351-E5360dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15159821123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012000170300001400290520084300304592002801147650002501175650001401200650002601214650001501240650001701255650001101272650001901283650001501302653006901317653002701386653001401413653001701427653002001444653000801464653000701472653000801479653000801487653000801495653000701503653000801510653000801518653001101526653001101537653001101548653000801559653000901567653000801576653000701584653001001591700006701601700006301668700006701731700002201798700002501820773010601845856008101951852000902032655001202041IND60592934920221119081655.0180413e20180817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059293492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPidenko, Sergey A.10aMicrostructured optical fiber-based luminescent biosensing: Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? - A review  ap. 14-24.  aThis review covers the current state of the art of luminescent biosensors based on various types of microstructured optical fiber.

In 2013, Instituto Butantan successfully licensed its trivalent influenza vaccine, in order to support the Brazilian National Immunization Program's influenza vaccination strategy, which was introduced in 1999. In order to respond to the increasing influenza vaccine demand worldwide, Instituto Butantan is undergoing prequalification of its trivalent influenza vaccine by the World Health Organization (WHO). A key requirement of the prequalification review was the submission of a pharmacovigilance plan, including an active surveillance evaluation, for the trivalent influenza vaccine, and proof of a functional pharmacovigilance system at Instituto Butantan. The aim of this paper is to describe the capacity strengthening process of the pharmacovigilance system at Instituto Butantan for the WHO prequalification of the trivalent influenza vaccine. This process was supported by PATH and the U.S. Federal Government Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The key strategic axes for this capacity strengthening process included the improvement of organizational structure, human resources training, internal processes and procedures, appropriate documentation, and acquisition of an E2B compliant pharmacovigilance database. The project led to the establishment of a functional pharmacovigilance system compliant with international regulatory requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3abiomedical research 3adatabases 3ahuman resources 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3amonitoring 3aBrazil 0aTrivalent influenza vaccine 0aWHO prequalification 0aPharmacovigilance 0aInstituto Butantan1 aGattás, Vera L.1 aLucchesi, Maria Beatriz B.1 aMoura de Oliveira, Mayra M.1 aVanni, Tazio1 aThomé, Beatriz da C.1 aMenang, Olga1 aSocquet, Muriel1 aPrecioso, Alexander R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8657-92920 tVaccine.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 37, no. 52 p.7560-7565dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.09.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009800159300001600257520146500273592002801738650001001766650001401776650001701790650001501807650002701822650001301849650001701862650001401879650001001893650001701903651001301920651001101933651001201944651001801956651000901974700002401983700002402007773009002031856007302121852000902194655001202203IND60080364520221118203351.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008036452DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.008492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfe, Jared D.10aVariation in tropical bird survival across longitude and guilds: a case study from the Amazon  ap. 964-970.  aSurvival estimates of tropical birds have been used to examine life‐history variation across latitudes and dietary guilds. Here, we provide apparent survival estimates of 31 rainforest species from central Amazonian Brazil and compare our results with estimates from Ecuador, Peru (western Amazonia) and French Guiana (eastern Amazonia) to examine geographic variation in demography. Our averaged annual survival estimate for central Amazonian species (ϕ= 0.59, SE = 0.10) was concordant with previously published estimates from the western Amazon (ϕ= 0.58, SE = 0.02), and eastern Amazon (ϕ= 0.63, SE = 0.06). Two predominate demographic patterns were detected across the study areas: within species, survival was highest or lowest in eastern or western Amazonia, but rarely in central Amazonia. The most striking demographic variation was exhibited by Pithys albifrons, for which apparent survival estimates were nearly twice as high in eastern Amazonia (ϕ= 0.80, SE = 0.06) than in western Amazonia (ϕ= 0.42, SE = 0.06) but intermediate in central Amazonia (ϕ= 0.54, SE = 0.04). Although variation in survival may be associated with differences in life history characteristics, our analysis of flocking guild, body size, and nest architecture revealed only moderate differences in survival associated with nest architecture. These results suggest that geographic variation in population processes may be significant for widespread Amazonian species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abody size 3acase studies 3ademography 3ageographical variation 3alatitude 3alife history 3alongitude 3anests 3arain forests 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 3aEcuador 3aFrench Guiana 3aPeru1 aStouffer, Philip C.1 aSeeholzer, Glenn F.0 tOikos.g2014 Aug., v. 123, no. 8 p.964-970dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.008493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007800156300001800234520118600252592002801438650002301466650003301489650001301522650001701535700002101552700001601573700002001589773010501609856007501714852000901789655001201798IND60577829520221119200603.0170810e20130625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057782952DNAL7 a10.1021/ma400098u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hengxi10aSegmental Dynamics of Chains Tethered at Interfaces of Varying Curvatures  ap. 5036-5043.  aThe segmental dynamics of a low glass transition temperature Tg polymer under different conditions of morphological confinement are shown to manifest the influence of the frustration of the local “packing” of chain segments at interfaces of varying curvatures, unique to the morphology. Of particular interest are the polyisoprene (PI) segmental dynamics in polystyrene-b-polyisoprene (PS-b-PI) micelles and in layered onion-like structures in high Tg, “frozen,” polystyrene (PS) hosts. At temperatures close to the Tg of PI domains, the segmental relaxation times of PI chains in the micellar structures, τₘᵢcₑₗₗₑ, are more than 1 order of magnitude shorter than those of PI chains in the onion-like structures, τₒₙᵢₒₙ. These rates are appreciably faster than those of homopolymer PI and of PI in the neat copolymers possessing lamellar and gyroid phases, τₕₒₘₒ ∼ 0.5τₗₐₘ ∼ 0.5τgyᵣₒᵢd, respectively. At high temperatures τₕₒₘₒ ∼ τₗₐₘ ∼ τgyᵣₒᵢd ∼ τₒₙᵢₒₙ ∼ τₘᵢcₑₗₗₑ. These observations are readily reconciled with trends in the local Tg of the PI phase in each sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aglass transition temperature 3amicelles 3apolystyrenes1 aChen, X.

To increase urban resilience, exceptional situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are important to learn from. This study aims to understand how the residents in Turku, a middle-sized city in Finland, perceived their outdoor recreation changed and how nature contributed to their subjective well-being during the early phases of the COVID-19. Sites of outdoor recreation and associated ecosystem service benefits were gathered through a map-based survey. In addition, the contribution of nature on subjective well-being was measured through Likert scale statements and the perceived changes in outdoor recreation behaviour were measured through self-reported number of days and from responses to open survey questions. Data was analysed through quantitative, qualitative and spatial methods.The results show that nearly half of the respondents increased outdoor recreation and the majority of outdoor recreation sites were visited more or as often as before the pandemic. The spatial analysis revealed that the most often visited recreation sites were near forests, semi-natural areas and housing areas as well as relatively close to respondent’s residence. Respondents had various reasons for changes in outdoor recreation behaviour. For some a shift to working remotely and changes in everyday routines led to spending time outdoors more often and for some spending less while others avoided recreation in crowded areas due to social distancing. The results also indicate that people’s opportunities to adapt to the pandemic conditions differ greatly. The nature’s contribution to subjective well-being during COVID-19 was important regardless of respondent’s outdoor recreation behaviour. Our study highlights that urban planning should respond to different needs for outdoor recreation in order to widely, and in a just way, promote the well-being benefits of urban nature during a pandemic, and to increase the resilience of the city and its residents. Participatory mapping can capture the variety in resident’s values and identify key recreation sites of multiple ecosystem service benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aecosystem services 3agreen infrastructure 3aoutdoor recreation 3apandemic 3apeople 3asocial welfare 3asurveys 3aurban forestry 3aFinland 0aCOVID-19 0aGreen space 0aPublic participation geographical information systems (PPGIS)1 aEilola, Salla1 aArki, Vesa0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 Sept., v. 64 p.127257-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1272573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001200141245007300153300001800226520077900244592002801023650001801051650003101069650002601100650001701126650001201143700001901155700001501174773017101189856007501360852000901435655001201444IND60649057920221120213417.0190702e20151124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064905792DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi40426042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Shi10aFinding Causes of Irregular Headways Integrating Data Mining and AHP  ap. 2604-2618.  aIrregular headways could reduce the public transit service level heavily. Finding out the exact causes of irregular headways will greatly help to develop efficient strategies aiming to improve transit service quality. This paper utilizes bus GPS data of Harbin to evaluate the headway performance and proposes a statistical method to identify the abnormal headways. Association mining is used to dig deeper and recognize six causes of bus bunching. The AHP, embedded data analysis, is applied to determine the weight of each cause in the case of that these causes are combined with each other constantly. Results show that the front bus has a greater effect on bus bunching than the following bus, and the traffic condition is the most critical factor affecting bus headway.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata analysis 3aglobal positioning systems 3apublic transportation 3aspatial data 3atraffic1 aZhang, Xinming1 aWang, Jian0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2015 Nov. 24, v. 4, no. 4 p.2604-2618dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi40426043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012400165300001800289520120400307592002801511596006001539650001501599650002501614650001001639650001601649650001101665650001701676650002101693650001801714650001401732650002801746700001301774700001501787700001401802700001701816700001601833700001801849773014801867856008302015852000902098655001202107IND60743371720221119135120.0211020e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074337172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-021-03398-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Siyao12aA near-infrared fluorescent probe for highly specific and ultrasensitive detection of hypochlorite ions in living cells  ap. 4441-4450.  aHypochlorite (ClO⁻) is an important reactive oxygen species (ROS) in organisms. In this work, a fluorescent probe DBTM based on triphenylamine was synthesized successfully and characterized by spectral methods. The designed probe can rapidly respond to ClO⁻ in just 1 min, followed by the apparent color change from red to yellow. The colorimetric and ratiometric absorbance change of DBTM was attributed to the strong oxidation of ClO⁻, which broke the connected double bonds and destroyed the conjugate system. The probe DBTM showed an excellent selectivity towards ClO⁻ in comparison with other ROS probes. Besides, the DBTM probe exhibited a highly sensitive response to ClO⁻, with the detection limits calculated to be 3.3 nM. The probe can be applied in the form of cotton swabs and test strips that could detect ClO⁻ easily, suggesting its potential use as imaging agents for realistic ClO⁻ detection. In particular, DBTM exhibited very low background fluorescence in living cells and was able to detect the minor variation of endogenous hypochlorite in L929 cells. Based on these advantages, the probe DBTM could be a good candidate for detecting ClO⁻ in biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aKYYW201906 and KYQD20190513cWenzhou Medical University 3aabsorbance 3aanalytical chemistry 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acotton 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahypochlorites 3aoxidation 3areactive oxygen species1 aLi, Anqi1 aPan, Xihao1 aWang, Hao1 aZhang, Cheng1 aLi, Junjian1 aQi, Xiaoliang0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 July, v. 413, no. 17 p.4441-4450dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03398-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245013500210520141400345592002801759650002001787650001601807650001101823650002001834650001701854650001901871651001801890653002601908653002201934653002701956653001601983653002201999653001602021700002002037700002602057700002102083700006202104773013202166856008302298961001202381852000902393655001202402IND60745272820221120112313.0210909e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074527282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1272582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, Alicia F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9452-583014aThe influence of street trees on pedestrian perceptions of safety: Results from environmental justice areas of Massachusetts, U.S.  aPrevious research has shown that trees and other roadside vegetation can mitigate adverse environmental conditions on urban street corridors, and, in turn, positively contribute to pedestrian perceptions of safety and walkability. In this study, pedestrian surveys (n = 181) were collected from three Massachusetts post-industrial cities to understand if street trees moderate pedestrian perceptions of safety. Three street tree conditions – sparse street tree abundance, mature street trees, and new street tree plantings – were compared as study settings. Several methods were used to correlate perceived safety with street trees and sociodemographic variables, including repeated measures and between-group ANOVA, qualitative open-coding, exploratory factor analysis, and simple moderation analysis. This study did not find empirical evidence that street trees influence people's perceived safety, nor that street trees substantively contribute to feelings of safety while walking. These findings suggest that pedestrians do not have universal experiences of safety in walking environments, and different sociocultural backgrounds may contribute to diverging experiences of safety or fear when walking. Our research supports previous findings on the ways in which pedestrians value street trees; this can be extended to municipal or regional Complete Streets guidance and technical assistance programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3afactor analysis 3afearfulness 3apeople 3aroadside plants 3astreet trees 3aurban forestry 3aMassachusetts 0aEnvironmental justice 0aPedestrian safety 0aPost-industrial cities 0aStreet tree 0aVisual preference 0aWalkability1 aRyan, Robert L.1 aEisenman, Theodore S.1 aLocke, Dexter H.1 aHarper, Richard W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9522-45620 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 Sept., v. 64 p.127258-dElsevier GmbHaElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1272583Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013400170300001800304500001400322520141200336592002801748650002501776650002501801650002301826650001601849650001601865650001101881650001201892650002201904650001401926650000901940700005901949773011902008856008302127852000902210655001202219IND60713656620221121234951.0201023e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071365662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.0c005342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthar, Youssi M.14aThe Human Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Inhibits the Elongation Step of Translation through Its RGG and C-Terminal Domains  ap. 3813-3822.  aNAL-light  aThe fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of numerous mRNAs in neurons. The precise mechanism of translational regulation by FMRP is unknown. Some studies have indicated that FMRP inhibits the initiation step of translation, whereas other studies have indicated that the elongation step of translation is inhibited by FMRP. To determine whether FMRP inhibits the initiation or the elongation step of protein synthesis, we investigated m⁷G-cap-dependent and IRES-driven, cap-independent translation of several reporter mRNAs in vitro. Our results show that FMRP inhibits both m⁷G-cap-dependent and cap-independent translation to similar degrees, indicating that the elongation step of translation is inhibited by FMRP. Additionally, we dissected the RNA-binding domains of hFMRP to determine the essential domains for inhibiting translation. We show that the RGG domain, together with the C-terminal domain (CTD), is sufficient to inhibit translation, while the KH domains do not inhibit mRNA translation. However, the region between the RGG domain and the KH2 domain may contribute as NT-hFMRP shows more potent inhibition than the RGG-CTD tail alone. Interestingly, we see a correlation between ribosome binding and translation inhibition, suggesting the RGG-CTD tail of hFMRP may anchor FMRP to the ribosome during translation inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3abehavior disorders 3acorrelation 3aexhibitions 3ahumans 3aneurons 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomes 3atail1 aJoseph, Simpson1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0552-82210 tBiochemistry.g2020 Sept. 18, v. 59, no. 40 p.3813-3822dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c005343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009400163300001800257520134700275592002801622596006901650596006301719650000801782650001201790650002501802650001701827650002101844650000901865650001101874650002201885650001801907700001601925700001301941700001701954700001501971700001301986700001901999700001602018700005302034773014802087856008302235852000902318655001202327IND60743371920221119134238.0211020e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074337192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-021-03415-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ying10aLow bias multiple displacement amplification with confinement effect based on agarose gel  ap. 4397-4405.  aMultiple displacement amplification (MDA) is a popular single-cell whole-genome amplification (WGA) technique that can greatly improve the amplification efficiency of single-cell genomes. However, there is an inherent problem that cannot be completely solved, that is, the amplification bias. We here propose an improved MDA method based on low melting agarose gel, named gelMDA. Firstly, the agarose gel and solution were characterized with SEM and fluorescent reagent. Then, we used gelMDA for cDNA amplification in library preparation of RNA-seq, and conventional MDA was used as a comparison. The sensitivity, efficiency of gelMDA, and amplification bias were evaluated with fluorescence curve, product yield, and the sequencing results. Finally, gelMDA was used for single-cell transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that the sensitivity and product yield of gelMDA were significantly higher than those of conventional MDA. A lower coefficient of variation (CV) and a higher reproducibility were obtained from gelMDA sequencing results. A region of 30 μm in diameter was amplified from the tissue sections and successfully sequenced. In conclusion, gelMDA obtained higher amplification efficiency and lower amplification bias in the present study. It suggested the great potential in single-cell RNA amplification and sequencing.  aPublisher supplied data  a81827901, 61801108cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK20201148cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province 3aRNA 3aagarose 3aanalytical chemistry 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agels 3agenome 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome1 aJia, Erteng1 aQiao, Yi1 aShi, Huajuan1 aLiu, Zhiyu1 aPan, Min1 aZhao, Xiangwei1 aBai, Yunfei1 aGe, Qinyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1708-19490 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 July, v. 413, no. 17 p.4397-4405dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03415-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014300171300001600314520205200330592002802382650001402410650001502424650002402439650001102463650002602474650001502500650001502515650001902530650002402549650001202573651001402585651001002599651001102609651001002620653000802630653001102638653000902649653003402658700002502692700002102717700003302738700001802771773022802789856008203017852000903099655001203108IND60726691320221118043645.0210511e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072669132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaa.2020.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustamante, Rocío,10aAttitudes of Spanish-speaking veterinarians interested in anaesthesia towards use of total intravenous anaesthesia in dogs: a survey study  ap. 422-431.  aTo describe Spanish-speaking veterinary anaesthetists’ attitudes towards use of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) in dogs.Prospective online voluntary survey.Data from 300 answered surveys.An anonymous questionnaire was sent via e-mail to representatives of the four largest Spanish-speaking veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia associations. It was distributed through mailing lists (Spain, Argentina, Mexico) or social media (Spain, Chile) to gather information on the use, opinions and perceived advantages of TIVA, as well as on preferred alternatives to isoflurane for providing general anaesthesia. Logistic regression was used to test for response associations.A total of 275 (92%) respondents had used TIVA (24% rarely, 36% sometimes, 40% very often or always). There was an association between a higher rate of TIVA usage and a low specialization level, less clinical experience and unavailability of anaesthetic gas scavenging systems. The main reasons for not using TIVA were lack of familiarity with the technique (92%), unavailability of infusion pumps (32%), established institutional anaesthetic protocol (32%), and technical difficulty (20%). Among frequent TIVA users, a higher proportion reported the greater ease of TIVA use (52%) compared to those that did not perceive such benefit (17%) [odds ratio (OR) = 5.2; 95% confidence interval (CI95), 1.7–16.6; p = 0.004). More respondents did not consider TIVA more expensive (60%) (OR = 2.1; CI95, 1.0–4.3; p = 0.034), more difficult to perform (59%) (OR = 2.5; CI95, 1.3–4.9; p = 0.006) or to manage the equipment (53%) (OR = 3.3; CI95, 1.4–7.8; p = 0.008), than inhalational anaesthetics. During isoflurane shortages, respondents reportedly preferred using an alternative inhalational agent (59%) rather than TIVA (47%).TIVA use is widespread among veterinarians within the surveyed associations. Frequent TIVA users reported greater perceived advantages. In situations of isoflurane shortage, an alternative inhalational anaesthetic was preferred over TIVA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3aanesthesia 3aconfidence interval 3ae-mail 3aintravenous injection 3aisoflurane 3aodds ratio 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3aArgentina 3aChile 3aMexico 3aSpain 0adog 0asurvey 0aTIVA 0atotal intravenous anaesthesia1 aOrtiz-Díez, Gustavo1 aCanfrán, Susana1 aGómez de Segura, Ignacio A.1 aAguado, Delia0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2021 May, v. 48, no. 3 p.422-431dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaa.2020.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003100171245005400202300001600256500001500272520141000287592002801697650001801725650002501743650003001768650003401798650002301832650002601855650001901881650001901900650002001919650002901939650002601968650002901994650003302023650001902056650002602075650004002101650004802141650002902189650002002218650005002238650004602288650005702334653003002391700001802421700002102439700002302460700002202483700001902505700001802524700002102542700002402563700002002587700002302607700002102630773010902651856005502760852000902815655001202824IND4468630720221118061621.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446863072DNAL7 a220177702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2011.00752.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSCHOLTHOF, KAREN‐BETH G.10aTop 10 plant viruses in molecular plant pathology  ap. 938-954.  a2019-12-06  aMany scientists, if not all, feel that their particular plant virus should appear in any list of the most important plant viruses. However, to our knowledge, no such list exists. The aim of this review was to survey all plant virologists with an association with Molecular Plant Pathology and ask them to nominate which plant viruses they would place in a ‘Top 10’ based on scientific/economic importance. The survey generated more than 250 votes from the international community, and allowed the generation of a Top 10 plant virus list for Molecular Plant Pathology. The Top 10 list includes, in rank order, (1) Tobacco mosaic virus, (2) Tomato spotted wilt virus, (3) Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, (4) Cucumber mosaic virus, (5) Potato virus Y, (6) Cauliflower mosaic virus, (7) African cassava mosaic virus, (8) Plum pox virus, (9) Brome mosaic virus and (10) Potato virus X, with honourable mentions for viruses just missing out on the Top 10, including Citrus tristeza virus, Barley yellow dwarf virus, Potato leafroll virus and Tomato bushy stunt virus. This review article presents a short review on each virus of the Top 10 list and its importance, with the intent of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant virology community, as well as laying down a benchmark, as it will be interesting to see in future years how perceptions change and which viruses enter and leave the Top 10.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant viruses 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aBarley yellow dwarf virus 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3aBrome mosaic virus 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aPlum pox virus 3aPotato virus X 3aplant pathology 3aTomato bushy stunt virus 3aPotato leafroll virus 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aAfrican cassava mosaic virus 3aPotato virus Y 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aTomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus 2aCucumovirusxpathogenicityxultrastructure. 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aPlant Pathology 2aPlant Virusesxpathogenicityxultrastructure. 2aPotyvirusxpathogenicityxultrastructure. 2aTobacco Mosaic Virusxpathogenicityxultrastructure. 0aTomato spotted wilt virus1 aADKINS, SCOTT1 aCzosnek, Henryk,1 aPalukaitis, Peter,1 aJACQUOT, EMMANUEL1 aHöhn, Thomas,1 aHOHN, BARBARA1 aSaunders, Keith,1 aCandresse, Thierry,1 aAhlquist, Paul,1 aHemenway, Cynthia,1 aFoster, Gary D.,0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2011 Dec., v. 12, no. 9 p.938-954dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2011.00752.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245016900154300001600323520111600339592002801455650002101483650002201504650002501526650001301551650003101564650001001595650001301605650002001618650001901638700001401657700001701671700001701688773011401705856007301819852000901892655001201901IND60080364820221118203335.0150206e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008036482DNAL7 a10.1111/ppa.121422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanano, A.10aSilencing of Erwinia amylovora sy69 AHL‐quorum sensing by a Bacillus simplex AHL‐inducible aiiA gene encoding a zinc‐dependent N‐acyl‐homoserine lactonase  ap. 773-783.  aQuorum sensing in Gram‐negative bacteria is regulated by diffusible signal molecules called N‐acyl‐l‐homoserine lactones (AHLs). These molecules are degraded by lactonases. In this study, six Bacillus simplex isolates were characterized and identified as a new quorum‐quenching species of Bacillus. An aiiA gene encoding an AHL‐lactonase was identified based on evidence that: (i) it showed high homology with other aiiA genes of Bacillus sp.; (ii) the deduced amino acid sequence contained two conserved regions,¹⁰⁴SHLHFDH¹¹¹and¹⁶⁵TPGHTPGH¹⁷³, characteristic of the metallo‐β‐lactamase superfamily; and (iii) the protein had zinc‐dependent AHL‐degrading activity. Additionally, the expression of the aiiA gene was significantly up‐regulated by 3‐oxo‐AHL. The AHL‐lactonase inhibited multiplication of the 3‐oxo‐C6‐AHL‐producing plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora sy69 both in vitro and in planta. The results provide support for the use of the quorum‐quenching functionality of B. simplex in the integrated control of the devastating fire blight pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus simplex 3aErwinia amylovora 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alactones 3aplant pathogens 3aquorum sensing1 aHarba, M.1 aAl‐Ali, M.1 aAmmouneh, H.0 tPlant pathology.g2014 Aug., v. 63, no. 4 p.773-783dBlackwell Scientific Publications, etc.x0032-08627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppa.121423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245005400166300001800220520164400238536035601882592002802238596008402266596009302350650002002443650002202463650001402485650001302499650001802512653002902530653002902559653001902588653002202607653002302629700002202652773014502674856008502819852000902904655001202913IND60627663220221120133833.0190128e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062766322DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2018.14699922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yingbo10aMixtures of g-Priors in Generalized Linear Models  ap. 1828-1845.  aMixtures of Zellner’s g-priors have been studied extensively in linear models and have been shown to have numerous desirable properties for Bayesian variable selection and model averaging. Several extensions of g-priors to generalized linear models (GLMs) have been proposed in the literature; however, the choice of prior distribution of g and resulting properties for inference have received considerably less attention. In this article, we unify mixtures of g-priors in GLMs by assigning the truncated Compound Confluent Hypergeometric (tCCH) distribution to 1/(1 + g), which encompasses as special cases several mixtures of g-priors in the literature, such as the hyper-g, Beta-prime, truncated Gamma, incomplete inverse-Gamma, benchmark, robust, hyper-g/n, and intrinsic priors. Through an integrated Laplace approximation, the posterior distribution of 1/(1 + g) is in turn a tCCH distribution, and approximate marginal likelihoods are thus available analytically, leading to “Compound Hypergeometric Information Criteria” for model selection. We discuss the local geometric properties of the g-prior in GLMs and show how the desiderata for model selection proposed by Bayarri et al., such as asymptotic model selection consistency, intrinsic consistency, and measurement invariance may be used to justify the prior and specific choices of the hyper parameters. We illustrate inference using these priors and contrast them to other approaches via simulation and real data examples. The methodology is implemented in the R package BAS and freely available on CRAN.

First, several Zero-Velocity Detection (ZDET) algorithms are compared and discussed when used in the static detection of a pedestrian. By introducing information on the Zero Velocity of the pedestrian, fused with a magnetometer measurement, an improved Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) model is developed to constrain the accumulating errors associated with the PDR positioning. Second, a Correlation Matching Algorithm based on map projection (CMAP) is presented, and a zone division of a floor map is demonstrated for fusion of the PDR algorithm. Finally, in order to use the dynamic characteristics of a pedestrian’s trajectory, the Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter (A-UKF) is applied to tightly integrate the IMU, magnetometers and floor map for ubiquitous positioning. The results of a field experiment performed on the fourth floor of the School of Environmental Science and Spatial Informatics (SESSI) building on the China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT) campus confirm that the proposed scheme can reliably achieve meter-level positioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenvironmental science 3afield experimentation 3ahospitals 3amining 3amodels 3apatients 3asupermarkets 3aChina1 aHu, Andong1 aLi, Xin1 aWang, Yan0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2015 Nov. 25, v. 4, no. 4 p.2638-2659dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi40426383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245015400160300001800314500002000332520148200352592002801834650002701862650002301889650001201912650001701924650001001941650001501951650002601966650003501992650003302027650001702060650002302077650003502100650001202135650002402147650001502171650002402186650001702210650001602227650001602243650001302259700002402272700002202296700001902318773012502337856007102462852000902533655001202542IND60588161520221121084932.0180103e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058816152DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.45642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKudelska, Monika M10aConcentration‐dependent effects of acute and chronic neonicotinoid exposure on the behaviour and development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 1345-1351.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Neonicotinoid insecticides are under review owing to emerging toxicity to non‐target species. Interest has focused on biological pollinators while their effects on other organisms that are key contributors to the ecosystem remain largely unknown. To advance this, we have tested the effects of representatives of three major classes of neonicotinoids, thiacloprid, clothianidin and nitenpyram, on the free‐living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), as a representative of the Nematoda, an ecologically important phylum contributing to biomass. RESULTS: Concentrations that are several‐fold higher than those with effects against target species had limited impact on locomotor function. However, increased potency was observed in a mutant with a hyperpermeable cuticle, which shows that drug access limits the effects of the neonicotinoids in C. elegans. Thiacloprid was most potent (EC₅₀ 714 μm). In addition, it selectively delayed larval development in wild‐type worms at 1 mm. CONCLUSION: C. elegans is less susceptible to neonicotinoids than target species of pest insect. We discuss an approach in which this defined low sensitivity may be exploited by heterologous expression of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from both pest and beneficial insects in transgenic C. elegans with increased cuticle permeability to provide a whole organism assay for species‐dependent neonicotinoid effects. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3abeneficial insects 3abiomass 3aclothianidin 3adrugs 3aecosystems 3afree-living nematodes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheterologous gene expression 3ainsect pests 3alarval development 3amedian effective concentration 3amutants 3anicotinic receptors 3anitenpyram 3anontarget organisms 3apermeability 3apollinators 3athiacloprid 3atoxicity1 aHolden‐Dye, Lindy1 aO'Connor, Vincent1 aDoyle, Declan,0 tPest management science.g2017 July, v. 73, no. 7 p.1345-1351dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.45643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245009000213300001400303506007600317520148800393592002801881506003701909650003901946650002201985650002902007650001302036650002602049650002002075650001702095650002302112650002402135650001002159650001902169650002102188650002102209650003702230650001302267650001002280650001702290650003802307650003702345653002602382653002302408653001002431653002402441653002602465653002002491700002202511700002302533700002202556700002502578773019102603856008302794852000902877655001202886IND60565648320221207142848.0190417e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056564832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijvsm.2017.02.0032doi7 aPMC61378582pmcid7 a302550442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Marwah M.10aAntibacterial effect of gold nanoparticles against Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis  ap. 23-29.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is the etiological agent of chronic caseous lymphadenitis. The bacterium infects goats and sheep causing great economic loss worldwide annually. The present work aims to evaluate the efficiency of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and AuNPs – laser combined therapy as antibacterial approaches against C. pseudotuberculosis bacteria in vitro. Gold nanoparticles 25nm were synthesized by co-precipitation method and characterized by different techniques including; Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), X-ray Diffraction and Dynamic Light Scattering. Three concentrations of AuNPs (50, 100 and 200μg/mL) were utilized for estimating the bacterial growth rate and the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). The mechanism of interaction between AuNPs and bacteria was evaluated by transmission electron microscopic image analysis. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopic technique was used to study the cytotoxic action of AuNPs and laser against C. psudotuberculosis. Results revealed that MIC of AuNPs and AuNPs – laser combined therapy were 200μg/mL and 100μg/mL respectively. TEM image analysis illustrated that gold nanoparticles penetrated the thick wall of C. psudotuberculosis and accumulated as intracellular agglomerates. Laser light enhanced the antimicrobial activity of gold nanoparticles by at least one fold due to its photo thermal combined effect that might be used as an effective antibacterial approach against C. pseudotuberculosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosis 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acaseous lymphadenitis 3acoprecipitation 3acytotoxicity 3aetiological agents 3afinancial economics 3agoats 3aimage analysis 3alight scattering 3amicrobial growth 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ananogold 3asheep 3atherapeutics 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aC. pseudotuberculosis 0aGold nanoparticles 0aLaser 0aAntibacterial agent 0aCaseous lymphadenitis 0aSheep and goats1 aFouad, Shereen A.1 aElshoky, Hisham A.1 aMohammed, Gina M.1 aSalaheldin, Taher A.0 tInternational journal of veterinary science and medicine.g2017 June, v. 5, no. 1 p.23-29dElsevier B.V.aFaculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo UniversitywJournal:21657x2314-45997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijvsm.2017.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001500137245013800152300001800290500002000308520160300328592002801931650002401959650002101983650002202004650001202026650002402038650001002062650002702072650001202099650001202111650001102123650002902134650002002163650001802183650001702201650001302218700001302231700001402244700001502258773012502273856007102398852000902469655001202478IND60588161620221121085028.0180103e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058816162DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.44692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiuxia10aOver‐expression of UDP–glycosyltransferase gene UGT2B17 is involved in chlorantraniliprole resistance in Plutella xylostella (L.)  ap. 1402-1409.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: UDP–glycosyltransferases (UGTs) are phase II detoxification enzymes widely distributed within living organisms. Their involvement in the biotransformation of various lipophilic endogenous compounds and phytoalexins in insects has been documented. However, the roles of this enzyme family in insecticide resistance have rarely been reported. Here, the functions of UGTs in chlorantraniliprole resistance in Plutella xylostella were investigated. RESULTS: Treatment with sulfinpyrazone and 5‐nitrouracil (both inhibitors of UGT enzymes) significantly increased the toxicity of chlorantraniliprole against the third instar larvae of P. xylostella. Among the 23 UGT transcripts examined, only UGT2B17 was found to be over‐expressed (with a range from 30.7‐ to 77.3‐fold) in all four chlorantraniliprole‐resistant populations compared to the susceptible one (CHS). The knock‐down of UGT2B17 by RNA interference (RNAi) dramatically increased the toxicity of chlorantraniliprole by 27.4% and 29.8% in the CHS and CHR (resistant) populations, respectively. In contrast, exposure to phenobarbital significantly increased the relative expression of UGT2B17 while decreasing the toxicity of chlorantraniliprole to the larvae by 14.0%. CONCLUSION: UGT2B17 is involved in the detoxification of chlorantraniliprole, and its over‐expression may play an important role in chlorantraniliprole resistance in P. xylostella. These results shed some light upon and further our understanding of the mechanisms of diamide insecticide resistance in insects. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlutella xylostella 3aRNA interference 3abiotransformation 3aenzymes 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsects 3ainstars 3alarvae 3ametabolic detoxification 3apest management 3aphenobarbital 3aphytoalexins 3atoxicity1 aZhu, Bin1 aGao, Xiwu1 aLiang, Pei0 tPest management science.g2017 July, v. 73, no. 7 p.1402-1409dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.44693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245005900212300001800271500001100289506007600300520124300376592002801619506003701647650001401684650001801698650002301716650001101739650001601750650001701766650001901783650001401802700002501816773013201841856008101973852000902054655001202063IND60572812420221207073439.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057281242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-016-2451-32doi7 aPMC54198682pmcid7 a280835952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrotta, Andrew Paul10aMitochondrial dynamics as regulators of cancer biology  ap. 1999-2017.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMitochondria are dynamic organelles that supply energy required to drive key cellular processes, such as survival, proliferation, and migration. Critical to all of these processes are changes in mitochondrial architecture, a mechanical mechanism encompassing both fusion and fragmentation (fission) of the mitochondrial network. Changes to mitochondrial shape, size, and localization occur in a regulated manner to maintain energy and metabolic homeostasis, while deregulation of mitochondrial dynamics is associated with the onset of metabolic dysfunction and disease. In cancers, oncogenic signals that drive excessive proliferation, increase intracellular stress, and limit nutrient supply are all able to alter the bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements of cancer cells. Consequently, mitochondrial function and shape rapidly adapt to these hostile conditions to support cancer cell proliferation and evade activation of cell death programs. In this review, we will discuss the molecular mechanisms governing mitochondrial dynamics and integrate recent insights into how changes in mitochondrial shape affect cellular migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and opportunities for the development of novel targeted cancer therapies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3aenergy 3ahomeostasis 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms1 aChipuk, Jerry Edward0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2017 June, v. 74, no. 11 p.1999-2017dSpringer International Publishingx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-016-2451-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014900172300001800321500001400339520162100353592002801974650002202002650002502024650001902049650001402068650001102082650002002093650001202113650002502125650001402150650001102164650001302175650003102188650002202219650001402241650001302255700002202268700005902290700005702349700005402406773011902460856008302579852000902662655001202671IND60713656920221122005608.0201023e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071365692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.0c005702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotoyama, Tomoharu10aProtein Sequence Selection Method That Enables Full Consensus Design of Artificial l-Threonine 3-Dehydrogenases with Unique Enzymatic Properties  ap. 3823-3833.  aNAL-light  aExponentially increasing protein sequence data enables artificial enzyme design using sequence-based protein design methods, including full-consensus protein design (FCD). The success of artificial enzyme design is strongly dependent on the nature of the sequences used. Hence, sequences must be selected from databases and curated libraries prepared to enable a successful design by FCD. In this study, we proposed a selection approach regarding several key residues as sequence motifs. We used l-threonine 3-dehydrogenase (TDH) as a model to test the validity of this approach. In the classification, four residues (143, 174, 188, and 214) were used as key residues. We classified thousands of TDH homologous sequences into five groups containing hundreds of sequences. Utilizing sequences in the libraries, we designed five artificial TDHs by FCD. Among the five, we successfully expressed four in soluble form. Biochemical analysis of artificial TDHs indicated that their enzymatic properties vary; half of the maximum measured enzyme activity (t₁/₂) and activation energies were distributed from 53 to 65 °C and from 38 to 125 kJ/mol, respectively. The artificial TDHs had unique kinetic parameters, distinct from one another. Structural analysis indicates that consensus mutations are mainly introduced in the secondary or outer shell. The functional diversity of the artificial TDHs is due to the accumulation of mutations that affect their physicochemical properties. Taken together, our findings indicate that our proposed approach can help generate artificial enzymes with unique enzymatic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aamino acid sequences 3aclassification 3adatabases 3adesign 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3afunctional diversity 3alibraries 3amodels 3amutation 3aphysicochemical properties 3asequence homology 3athreonine 3avalidity1 aHiramatsu, Nozomi1 aAsano, Yasuhisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3645-39521 aNakano, Shogo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6614-71581 aIto, Sohei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9937-31000 tBiochemistry.g2020 Sept. 18, v. 59, no. 40 p.3823-3833dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c005703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010200165300001600267520155000283592002801833650001101861650001901872650002301891650002101914650001201935650001301947650001301960650001001973650001901983650002002002653001702022653001902039653002302058653001502081653001702096653001002113700002002123700002202143773011802165856008302283852000902366655001202375IND60532608220221118013427.0190415s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053260822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2014.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKendal, Dave10aGlobal patterns of diversity in the urban forest: Is there evidence to support the 10/20/30 rule?  ap. 411-417.  aDiversity in the urban forest is important as it reduces risks from pests and diseases and from climate change and improves resilience in the supply of ecosystem services. To manage and improve diversity, there has been wide-spread acceptance of the 10/20/30 ‘rule of thumb’ proposed by Santamour, which states that municipal forests should comprise no more than 10% of any particular species, 20% of any one genus or 30% of any single family. While the implementation of targets based on Santamour's rule has contributed to a more diverse and resilient urban forest in many cities, there has been little empirical investigation of actual patterns of diversity occurring globally in different climates and land uses. In this study, we explored diversity and the relative abundance of the most common species, genus and family in 151 urban forest inventories from 108 different cities around the world. Observed patterns showed that relative abundance of the most common taxon was a good predictor of diversity and could be a useful measure of diversity for urban forest managers. Relative abundance of the most common taxon was much higher than the proposed benchmark at the species level, but comparable with proposed benchmarks at the genus and family level. Patterns varied by both climate and land use. Diversity was consistently lower in Continental climates and in streetscapes, and higher in Temperate climates and in urban forests that spanned multiple land uses. Further considerations in setting diversity benchmarks are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3aland use 3amanagers 3apests 3arisk reduction 3atemperate zones 0aBiodiversity 0aClimate change 0aPests and diseases 0aResilience 0aStreet trees 0atrees1 aDobbs, Cynnamon1 aLohr, Virginia I.0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2014, v. 13, no. 3 p.411-417dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2014.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245008100215300001800296500001100314506007600325520109500401592002801496506003701524650002001561650001901581650001001600650001801610650001801628650002201646650001701668700002101685700002101706773013201727856008101859852000901940655001201949IND60572812520221207063047.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057281252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-017-2452-x2doi7 aPMC63398182pmcid7 a280973722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidiapradja, Alexander14aThe role of neuropeptides in adverse myocardial remodeling and heart failure  ap. 2019-2038.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn addition to traditional neurotransmitters of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the heart also contains numerous neuropeptides. These neuropeptides not only modulate the effects of neurotransmitters, but also have independent effects on cardiac function. While in most cases the physiological actions of these neuropeptides are well defined, their contributions to cardiac pathology are less appreciated. Some neuropeptides are cardioprotective, some promote adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure, and in the case of others their functions are unclear. Some have both cardioprotective and adverse effects depending on the specific cardiac pathology and progression of that pathology. In this review, we briefly describe the actions of several neuropeptides on normal cardiac physiology, before describing in more detail their role in adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure. It is our goal to bring more focus toward understanding the contribution of neuropeptides to the pathogenesis of heart failure, and to consider them as potential therapeutic targets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3acardiac output 3aheart 3aheart failure 3aneuropeptides 3aneurotransmitters 3apathogenesis1 aChunduri, Prasad1 aLevick, Scott P.0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2017 June, v. 74, no. 11 p.2019-2038dSpringer International Publishingx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-017-2452-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245004700168300001600215520099200231592002801223650000901251650001101260650002701271650001301298650002801311650001501339651001001354653001001364653002701374653002301401653002101424653002701445700001901472773011701491856008401608852000901692655001201701IND60121863320221122075252.0150325e20140914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012186332DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2013.8302612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaojing13aAn Explosive Growth of Wind Power in China  ap. 849-860.  aHitherto, China has a mainly coal-based energy consumption structure and the proportion of coal in the total energy consumption can amount to more than 70%.

Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy source and has the most promising prospects for large-scale commercial development. Although the history of wind power utilization in China can be traced back to ancient times, an explosive growth in the development of wind power has occurred only in recent years as a result of the Chinese government's strong commitment to boost renewable energy utilization.

The organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization of MTC-Chol was accomplished by using N-(3,5-trifluoromethyl)phenyl-N′-cyclohexylthiourea (TU) in combinations with bases such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and (−)-sparteine, and kinetics of polymerization was monitored. By using mPEG-OH as the macroinitiator, well-defined amphiphilic diblock copolymers mPEG₁₁₃-b-P(MTC-Chol)ₙ (n = 4 and 11) were synthesized. Under aqueous conditions, these block copolymers self-assembled to form unique nanostructures. Disk-like micelles and stacked-disk morphology were observed for mPEG₁₁₃-b-P(MTC-Chol)₄ and mPEG₁₁₃-b-P(MTC-Chol)₁₁, respectively, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Small-angle neutron scattering supports the disk-like morphology and estimates the block copolymer micelle aggregation number in the dispersed solution. The hydrophobic nature of the cholesterol-containing block provides a versatile self-assembly handle to form complex nanostructures using biodegradable and biocompatible polymers for applications in drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite polymers 3adrugs 3aethyl carbamate 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3ananomaterials 3aneutron diffraction 3apolymerization 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLee, Ashlynn L.1 aMaune, Hareem T.1 aHedrick, James L.1 aPrabhu, Vivek M.1 aYang, Yi Yan0 tMacromolecules.g2013 June 25, v. 46, no. 12 p.4839-4846dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma400423b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002800146245012600174300001300300520091500313592002801228506003701256650002801293650001601321650001701337700002601354700001901380700001701399700002001416773012301436852000901559856008301568655001201651IND2035570320221207114148.0220422e199201  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203557032DNAL7 a10.1177/0261192992020001032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeloux, Anne-Françoise10aHepatocytes in Primary Culture: An Alternative to LD50 Testing?

Urban trees act as a sink for CO2, helping to offset carbon emissions from urban areas by removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Environment Canada develops estimates of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions and removals which are submitted annually to the United Nations as part of ongoing commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change. As part of these reporting commitments countries are required to develop estimates of emissions and removals of Greenhouse Gas that are the result of direct impact of human activities in the Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry Sector. Here, we present an approach which involves sampling high resolution aerial photographs to determine urban tree coverage across Canada's major urban areas. Our results suggest Canadian urban areas have an estimated tree canopy cover of 27%. This tree cover is estimated to store approximately 34,000kt C and annually sequester approximately 2500kt of CO2. These estimates show significant improvement over previous methods used to provide Canadian estimates. The methods developed here are easily repeatable which allow for temporal changes to be analyzed and assessed over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aaerial photography 3aanthropogenic activities 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sequestration 3aforestry 3aforests 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3aphotosynthesis 3atemporal variation 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aCanada 0aCanada 0aCarbon sequestration 0aRemote sensing 0aTree cover 0aUrban canopy1 aMcGovern, Mark1 aKhoury, Michael1 aDuffe, Jason0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2014, v. 13, no. 3 p.484-494dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2014.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011800168300001600286500001900302520175900321592002802080650001702108650001202125650001402137650002302151650001102174650001202185650001402197653002502211653002302236653002602259653002302285653002702308653003102335653002402366700005602390773010302446856008302549852000902632655001202641IND60701468820221118214045.0201023e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070146882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2020.06.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazdan, Neil K.10aCarbidic Mo is the sole kinetically-relevant active site for catalytic methane dehydroaromatization on Mo/H-ZSM-5  ap. 667-676.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSystematic variation of Mo/Al = {0.10, 0.25, 0.35} in Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalysts effects ~20× change of Mo-to-H⁺ ratio during methane dehydroaromatization (DHA) reactions at steady state and on deactivating catalysts. Mo and Brønsted-acid site count, respectively enumerated by ethane hydrogenolysis probe reaction and dimethyl ether chemical titration, evolve disparately during DHA catalysis, indicating the two sites reduce in number by distinct mechanisms. The deactivation of Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalytic activity is uniquely attributed to the loss of active, or accessible, Mo sites, evinced by (i) the non-selective nature of deactivation (i.e. that deactivation occurs without modification of residual active sites), (ii) invariance in product distribution from Mo/H⁺ = 0.10–2.1, and (iii) linear correspondence between Mo-catalyzed ethane hydrogenolysis rate and active site count during DHA on deactivating samples. DHA forward rate – the intrinsic kinetic descriptor of catalyst activity – normalizes by Mo content at steady state and on deactivating catalysts with Mo/Al = 0.10–0.35 for Mo-based contact times in the range τMₒ = 0.79–44 molMₒ s mol⁻¹C, unequivocally establishing Mo aggregates as the sole kinetically-relevant active site on Mo/H-ZSM-5. Brønsted-acid site content over a ~40× range in τH₊ = 1.4–54 molH₊ s mol⁻¹C has no discernable correlation with or effect on DHA rate, methane conversion, or product distribution – demonstrating H⁺ does not catalyze any rate- or selectivity-determining steps in the benzene formation pathway and suggesting that the benefits of zeolitic acid sites are only to disperse Mo during catalyst synthesis and, conceivably, to catalyze equilibrated reaction steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aethane 3amethane 3atitration 0aDehydroaromatization 0aMethane conversion 0aEthane hydrogenolysis 0aChemical titration 0aBifunctional catalysis 0aNon-selective deactivation 0aDe Donder relations1 aBhan, Aditya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6069-76260 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 Sept., v. 389 p.667-676dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2020.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009000167300001400257520230100271592002802572650001102600650001702611650002202628650001502650650000902665650001402674650002402688650001702712650002002729650001302749650000902762651001702771700001702788700001802805700002602823700002302849773011102872856008202983990002303065852000903088655001203097IND60095137420221120185117.0141104e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009513742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2010.11.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Silke12aA note of caution on the use of boulders for exposure dating of depositional surfaces  ap. 60-70.  aExposure dating of boulders has been widely applied to determine the age of depositional surfaces under the assumption that the pre-depositional nuclide component in most boulders is negligible. Here we present a case study on fluvial terraces at the active mountain front of the eastern Andes, where this assumption is clearly invalid, because sandstone boulders (n=13) from terraces at two sites contain a highly variable inherited ¹⁰Be component and have apparent ¹⁰Be ages that exceed the age of the respective surface by up to ~90ka. Likewise, boulders from active stream channels (n=5) contain a substantial inherited ¹⁰Be component, equivalent to 5–48ka of exposure. The age of the fluvial terraces is well determined by two approaches that allow to correct for the pre-depositional nuclide component: ¹⁰Be dating of amalgamated pebbles and ¹⁰Be depth profiles on sand samples. At site 1, three terraces have ¹⁰Be ages of 3–5ka (T₂), 11–13ka (T₃), and 16–20ka (T₄), which are consistent with the terrace stratigraphy. The age of terrace T₃ is confirmed by a calibrated ¹⁴C age of 12.61±0.20ka BP obtained from a wood sample. At site 2, terrace T₃ has a ¹⁰Be age of 13–16ka. The average inherited ¹⁰Be concentration of sand grains – determined from depth profiles and stream sediments – is small and equivalent to 1–3ka of exposure. In contrast, the mean inheritance of pebbles and boulders is higher and equivalent to exposure times of ~10ka and ~30ka, respectively. These differences in the pre-depositional nuclide component are related to the different provenance and transport history of sand, pebbles, and boulders. The sand is derived from rapidly eroding Miocene sediments exposed near the mountain front, whereas the pebbles and boulders originate from Triassic sandstones in the internal part of the fold-and-thrust belt. On their way to the mountain front, boulders and pebbles were temporarily stored and irradiated in alluvial fans that are currently reworked. As sediment deposition in intramontane basins and their subsequent excavation is common in the Andes and other fold-and-thrust belts, the presence of pre-depositional nuclide components should be evaluated when applying exposure dating at active mountain fronts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3aexposure duration 3aprovenance 3asand 3asandstone 3asediment deposition 3astratigraphy 3astream channels 3aterraces 3awood 3aAndes region1 aHetzel, Ralf1 aKuhlmann, Jan1 aMingorance, Francisco1 aRamos, Víctor A.,0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 302, no. 1-2 p.60-70dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2010.11.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008400172300001600256520159200272592002801864650002801892650001301920650000801933650001201941650000901953650001101962650001001973650000901983653001701992653002802009653002402037653001702061653002802078700002202106700006302128700001902191773011802210856008302328852000902411655001202420IND60532608620221118013456.0190415s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053260862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2014.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiesbauer, Jason W.10aImpact of branch reorientation on breaking stress in Liriodendron tulipifera L.  ap. 526-533.  aIt has been observed that during ice, snow, and wind storms, branches oriented vertically tend to incur more damage than branches oriented horizontally. A study was conducted to determine breaking stress and breaking position of branches reoriented nearly horizontal and nearly vertical. Branches oriented 40–50° from horizontal with mean diameter 4.9cm (SD±0.73) were removed from two trees and transferred to a custom branch pulling station. Branches were reoriented either nearly horizontal (76–89°) or vertical (6–29°) to a reinforced vertical post. Branches were pulled vertically downward from three equidistant positions along the branch until they broke. Failure stress for horizontal oriented branches (64MPa) was double the stress required to pull vertical oriented branches to failure (32MPa). Nine of ten horizontal branches failed between the branch base and the pull point closest to the base (proximal pull point); whereas seven of ten vertical branches failed farther from the base, between the proximal and middle pull points. Average length from branch base to failure point for horizontal branches was 12.8cm, and 74.6cm for vertical branches. Despite requiring less stress to break, branch angle change at the distal and middle pull points from the original position to the position at failure for vertical branches was greater than for horizontal branches; whereas angle change at the proximal pull point was greater for horizontal branches. Branch taper was not different between reorientation treatments. Implications on pruning strategies are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiriodendron tulipifera 3abranches 3aice 3apruning 3asnow 3astorms 3atrees 3awind 0aBranch angle 0aLiriodendron tulipifera 0aMechanical strength 0aStorm damage 0aThree-point pull method1 aGilman, Edward F.1 aMasters, Forrest J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8203-98461 aNitesh, Sangam0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2014, v. 13, no. 3 p.526-533dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2014.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245008600163300001400249520170400263592002801967506003701995650002802032650001902060650001702079700002102096773012402117852000902241856008302250655001202333IND2035570620221207114144.0220714e199201  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203557062DNAL7 a10.1177/0261192992020001052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalle, Willi10aTwo Procedures for the Prediction of Acute Toxicity (LD50) from Cytotoxicity Data  ap. 40-49.  aSingle linear regression analysis was used to characterise the relationship between cytotoxicity in a variety of mammalian cell culture systems and acute oral toxicity (LD50) in experimental animals. The following results were obtained. Firstly, in a cytotoxicity assay using the calf aortic endothelial cell line BKEz-7, IC50 values determined for 44 chemicals in culture showed significant correlation with the oral LD50 values for rat and mouse (computed correlation coefficient r=0.546). After eliminating three chemicals that were characterised by extreme lethality indices (LI = IC50/LD50), the correlation coefficient of the remaining 41 chemicals increased to a value of r=0.728. By using the linear regression model for these 41 chemicals, the oral LD50 for rat and mouse can be predicted correctly from the IC50 values for 83% of substances from a variety of chemical substance classes within a range of approximately one order of magnitude of dosage unit of LD50 for rat and mouse. Secondly, the mean IC50 values (IC50x¯) determined as the geometrical mean of two or more IC50 values per substance, which were generated in a wide spectrum of mammalian cell lines and collected in a “Registry of Cytotoxicity” (RC), gave similar results (r=0.644). Likewise, with the aid of this method, the oral LD50 for rat and mouse can be predicted for 74% of non-selected chemicals from structurally-different classes in the same dosage range, e.g., 1–25 millimoles per kg body weight. The prediction of LD50 values from in vitro cytotoxicity data may permit the calculation of a more precise dose range-finding and offers a new way for reducing the number of animals in acute toxicity testing.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal use alternatives 3acultured cells 3acytotoxicity1 aSpielmann, Horst0 tATLA.

The use of herbal medicine and supplements has increased over recent decades following side effects and resistant to conventional chemotherapy. The seeds of Bixa orellana L. commonly known as annatto have recently gained scientific attention due to presence of a carotenoid bixin for its substantial anticancer properties. However, molecular mechanisms underlying bixin-induced apoptosis are still unclear. Treatment of bixin significantly decreased the number of Hep3B cells and morphological study revealed the change in cellular and nuclear morphology that trigger the events of apoptosis confirmed by annexin V/PI staining. Further DCFDA and rhodamine 123 spectrofluorimetry study showed elevation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), respectively. ROS production caused DNA damage and apoptosis was marked by cell cycle arrest, up-regulation of Bax and FasL protein as well as cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-8 and caspase-3 protein. Docking study with pro-apoptotic molecule Bax and surface Fas ligand exhibited energetically favourable binding interaction. Collectively, these results suggest that bixin capable of modulating the extrinsic and intrinsic molecules of apoptosis indicating its potential for development of promising candidate for hepatocellular carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBixa orellana 3aDNA damage 3aadverse effects 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acarotenoids 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3acaspase-9 3acell cycle checkpoints 3adrug therapy 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agene expression regulation 3ahepatoma 3aherbal medicines 3ahumans 3aligands 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasm cells 3areactive oxygen species 3arhodamines 3aseeds 3astaining1 aPhaniendra, Alugoju1 aPeriyasamy, Latha0 tNutrition and cancer.g2018 Aug. 18, v. 70, no. 6 p.971-983dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2018.14904453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011200163300001600275500001900291520113900310592002801449650001201477650001401489650002301503650001301526650001401539650001101553650001401564650001401578653002201592653001301614653001401627653001601641653002101657653003401678700001801712700001801730700001401748700001601762700001501778700001801793773010301811856008301914852000901997655001202006IND60701469020221118214115.0201023e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070146902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2020.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jia10aInhibited hydrogen poisoning for enhanced activity of promoters-Ru/Sr2Ta2O7 nanowires for ammonia synthesis  ap. 556-565.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, strontium tantalate (Sr₂Ta₂O₇) nanowires were used for the first time as a support of ruthenium catalysts for ammonia synthesis. The highest ammonia synthesis activity of 1582 μmol g⁻¹cₐₜ h⁻¹ was observed with Ru/Sr₂Ta₂O₇ catalysts prepared with molar ratio of Sr(OH)₂/Ta₂O₅ at 4. After loading promoters, the ammonia synthesis activity was significantly improved to 4856, 5004 and 5038 μmol g⁻¹cₐₜ h⁻¹ for K-, Rb- and Cs- modified Ru/Sr₂Ta₂O₇ catalysts. Characterization and kinetic experiments indicate that the improved ammonia synthesis rate of promoters-Ru/Sr₂Ta₂O₇ catalysts was attributable to the combined effect of alleviated hydrogen poisoning through the promotion of hydrogen spillover from Ru species to support of Sr₂Ta₂O₇ and enhanced activation of N₂ due to increased electron density of Ru sites because of electron donation from introduced oxygen vacancies and promoters. The study not only clarifies the role of promoters in ammonia synthesis, but also provides an excellent Ru catalyst on Sr₂Ta₂O₇ nanowires for ammonia synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogen 3ananowires 3aoxygen 3aruthenium 3astrontium 0aAmmonia synthesis 0aSr2Ta2O7 0aPromoters 0aRu catalyst 0aOxygen vacancies 0aAlleviated hydrogen poisoning1 aYuan, Mingwei1 aLi, Xiaozhong1 aWang, Yan1 aLi, Mengwei1 aLi, Jinjun1 aYou, Zhixiong0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 Sept., v. 389 p.556-565dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2020.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001300137245013500150300001800285500002000303520133900323592002801662650002301690650001201713650001301725650001901738650001601757650001501773650001401788650002201802650001601824650001201840650002001852650001901872650000901891650002001900650001401920650002501934650001001959650001001969700001901979700001401998700002302012700001702035773012502052856007102177852000902248655001202257IND60588162020221121143747.0180103e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058816202DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.44712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Lei10aEnhanced photosynthesis endows seedling growth vigour contributing to the competitive dominance of weedy rice over cultivated rice  ap. 1410-1420.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Weedy rice, as one of the worst paddy field weeds worldwide, bears vigorous seedlings and dominantly competes with cultivated rice causing serious crop yield losses. To elucidate the causes of its stronger seedling vigour endowing its dominant competition with cultivated rice, comparative studies on seedling growth characteristics were conducted among six weedy rice biotypes and the two indica and japonica cultivars Shanyou‐63 (SY‐63) and Zhendao‐8 (ZD‐8), respectively, in the greenhouse. RESULTS: Weedy rice emerged 2 to 3 days earlier, rapidly grew 1.3–1.7 cm taller daily, produced more secondary adventitious roots and greater aboveground fresh biomass than cultivated rice. Moreover, weedy rice exhibited greater photosynthetic pigment content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO₂ concentration, transpiration rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic parameters. An enhanced overall photosynthetic activity in weedy rices was attributed to the combined action of a larger antenna, more active reaction centres and higher quantum yield for electron transfer beyond QA. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced photosynthesis of weedy rice at the seedling stage should be the main factor for leading to strong competitive dominance over cultivated rice. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aadventitious roots 3abiomass 3abiotypes 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3aelectron transfer 3agreenhouses 3apaddies 3apest management 3aphotosynthesis 3arice 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3astomatal conductance 3avigor 3aweeds1 aSong, Xiaoling1 aHe, Baoye1 aValverde, Bernal E1 aQiang, Sheng0 tPest management science.g2017 July, v. 73, no. 7 p.1410-1420dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.44713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011800171300001600289520104300305592002801348650002301376650001701399650001401416650001301430650001801443650001001461650001001471650001601481700002701497700002201524700002301546700002701569773011701596856008601713852000901799655001201808IND60627663820221120150214.0190312e20180818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062766382DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2018.14904462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBille, Sanne J.14aThe Effect of Special Diets on Weight and Nutritional Intake in Hematological Cancer Patients: A Randomized Study  ap. 874-878.  aMajor weight loss and taste changes are well documented in patients with hematological cancer during chemotherapy. We have previously documented, that such patients have preferences for much umami, a little sweet, sour and salt, and no bitter. We wanted to convert these results into real diets. Patients participated in two sensory pilot studies (n = 10), where dishes were tested for preferences before and after chemotherapy. From these results, four dishes were selected and tested on 32 patients in 30 days in a cross-over design. The diets resulted in a beneficial and statistically significant difference in weight development (p = 0.0008), with 1.2 ± 1.9 kg (+2%) in the intervention period and –2.8 ± 5.2 kg (–4%) in the control period. This difference persisted after sensitivity analysis (±10%) P = 0.005. However, the nutritional intake was still low in both periods, and the treatment with cytarabine turned out to be a major confounder as dosage was significantly higher in the control period.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-over studies 3adrug therapy 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aspecial diets 3ataste 3aumami 3aweight loss1 aFjalstad, Benedicte W.1 aClausen, Mette B.1 aAndreasen, Bent J.1 aAndersen, Jens Rikardt0 tNutrition and cancer.g2018 Aug. 18, v. 70, no. 6 p.874-878dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2018.14904463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015700168300001800325520208000343592002802423596007402451650001602525650002502541650001602566650001902582650002002601650001102621650003102632650002902663650001302692650002602705650002902731700001602760700001902776700001602795700001602811700001302827700001402840700001602854700001902870700002102889773014802910856008303058852000903141655001203150IND60743372820221119135512.0211020e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074337282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-021-03405-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiaoxuan13aAn isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry candidate reference measurement procedure for aldosterone measurement in human plasma  ap. 4471-4481.  aAccurate quantitation of aldosterone is clinically important in standardized testing for primary aldosteronism. The results are often variable when performed by clinical immunoassays. To standardize and ensure the accuracy of clinical systems, reference measurement procedures (RMPs) with higher metrological order are required. A simple and reliable isotope dilution LC-IDMS/MS-based measurement procedure for human plasma aldosterone has been developed. This method involved plasma spiked with a deuterium-labelled internal standard, equilibrated for 0.5 h, and extracted by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) without derivatization. Aldosterone and its structural analogues were baseline separated with a C18-packed UHPLC column with gradient elution within 7 min. The signal intensity variability and measurement imprecision were reduced by bracketing calibration during plasma aldosterone value assignment. The limit of detection (LoD) was 19.4 pmol/L with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 3. The lowest limit of quantification (LLoQ) was 27.7 pmol/L (S/N > 10 and CV < 10.0%). LLE was performed with 1 mL of n-hexane/ethyl acetate (3:2, v/v), and the extraction recovery was determined to be 92.15 ± 3.54%. The imprecisions were ≤ 3.18% for samples at 124.8, 867.0, and 2628.5 pmol/L. The recoveries were 98.11–101.61%. The relative bias between this candidate RMP and the established RMP was 2.76–1.89%. The linearity response ranged from 27.7 to 2774.4 pmol/L with R² = 0.999. The method performance met the requirements of RMPs (≤ 5% total CV and ≤ 3% bias). Furthermore, the developed method was applied to evaluate immunoassays through 41 patient sample comparisons. The calibration and measurement capability (CMC) of this method were also evaluated by measuring these samples. The candidate RMP can serve as an accurate reference baseline for routine methods and can be used for value assignment for reference materials.

To date, however, few studies have considered whether nucleic acid damage and damage repair play a role in cold‐stress adaptation. A further insufficiently explored question concerns how age affects cold stress adaptation among mature perennials. As a plant ages, the optimal trade‐off between growth and stress tolerance may shift. METHODS: Oxidative damage to RNA and expression of genes involved in DNA repair were compared in multiple mature cohorts of Thinopyrum intermedium (an emerging perennial cereal) and in wheat and barley under intermittent freezing stress and under nonfreezing conditions. Activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and four other antioxidative enzymes was also measured under these conditions. DNA repair genes included photolyases involved in repairing ultraviolet‐induced damage and two genes involved in repairing oxidatively induced damage (ERCC1, RAD23). RESULTS: Freezing stress was accompanied by large increases in photolyase expression and ERCC1 expression (in wheat and Thinopyrum) and in GPX and GR activity (particularly in Thinopyrum). This is the first report of DNA photolyases being overexpressed under freezing stress. Older Thinopyrum had lower photolyase expression and less freezing‐induced overexpression of ERCC1. Younger Thinopyrum plants sustained more oxidative damage to RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of DNA repair genes is an important aspect of cold acclimation. When comparing adult cohorts, aging was associated with changes in the freezing stress response, but not with overall increases or decreases in stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Science Foundation 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aRNA 3aThinopyrum intermedium 3aTriticum aestivum 3aacclimation 3aadults 3abarley 3acold 3acold stress 3adeoxyribodipyrimidine photo-lyase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aplant age 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3awheat1 aDorn, Kevin M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2722-62211 aBaas, Dean1 aWilke, Brook1 aKapp, Christian1 aSnapp, Sieglinde S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9738-06490 tAmerican journal of botany.g2020 Dec., v. 107, no. 12 p.1693-1709dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.15843Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011700160520141300277592002801690650002201718650002401740650001701764650001701781650002501798650001601823650001801839650001201857650001101869700002601880700002401906700001801930700002701948700001901975773011901994856007802113852000902191655001202200IND60771266720221120193131.0220325e20220318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077126672DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110608752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPua, Aileen 10aIngredients, Processing, and Fermentation: Addressing the Organoleptic Boundaries of Plant-Based Dairy Analogues  aConsumer interest and research in plant-based dairy analogues has been growing in recent years because of increasingly negative implications of animal-derived products on human health, animal wellbeing, and the environment. However, plant-based dairy analogues face many challenges in mimicking the organoleptic properties of dairy products due to their undesirable off-flavours and textures. This article thus reviews fermentation as a viable pathway to developing clean-label plant-based dairy analogues with satisfactory consumer acceptability. Discussions on complementary strategies such as raw material selection and extraction technologies are also included. An overview of plant raw materials with the potential to be applied in dairy analogues is first discussed, followed by a review of the processing steps and innovative techniques required to transform these plant raw materials into functional ingredients such as plant-based aqueous extracts or flours for subsequent fermentation. Finally, the various fermentation (bacterial, yeast, and fungal) methodologies applied for the improvement of texture and other sensory qualities of plant-based dairy analogues are covered. Concerted research efforts would be required in the future to tailor and optimise the presented wide diversity of options to produce plant-based fermented dairy analogues that are both delicious and nutritionally adequate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal well-being 3aconsumer acceptance 3afermentation 3ahuman health 3anutritional adequacy 3aoff flavors 3araw materials 3atexture 3ayeasts1 aTang, Vivien Chia Yen1 aGoh, Rui Min Vivian1 aSun, Jingcan 1 aLassabliere, Benjamin 1 aLiu, Shao Quan0 tFoods.g2022 Mar. 18, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110608753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010800172300001800280520130700298592002801605650001201633650001301645650001201658650001201670650001301682650001501695650001301710650001601723650000901739650001201748650001101760650001101771650001101782650001101793650000701804650000901811650001301820650001801833651001201851773010501863856008101968852000902049655001202058IND60123664120221121220403.0150328e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012366412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-014-3787-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwartz, Michael O.10aModelling the hypothetical methane-leakage in a shale-gas project and the impact on groundwater quality  ap. 4619-4632.  aThe hypothetical leakage of methane gas caused by fracking a 1,000-m deep Cretaceous claystone horizon at Damme, Germany, is simulated in a TOUGHREACT reactive-transport model with 5,728 elements. A hypothetical leakage zone connects the Cretaceous horizon with a Quaternary potable-water aquifer (q1). Methane gas rises up to the q1 horizon in less than 2 days in all calculated scenarios. The simulations include the major constituents of groundwater as well as the seven most hazardous trace components that are natural constituents of groundwater (As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Se and U). The general trend is characterised by depletion of the natural hazardous components with decreasing acidity and oxygen fugacity in the relevant pH range (7–9). Nevertheless, the concentrations of elements whose dominant aqueous species are negatively charged in this pH range (Cr and Se) rise against the general trend due to desorption reactions. Slight enhancement effects are produced by the dissolution of contaminant-bearing oxides such as Cr-bearing goethite. In summary, the geological risks of a fracking operation are minor. The technical risks are more important. This is especially the case when rising methane gas gets into contact with fracking fluid that accidentally escapes through faulty well seals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3adesorption 3agoethite 3agroundwater 3alead 3amethane 3amodels 3anickel 3aoxides 3aoxygen 3apH 3arisk 3aselenium 3awater quality 3aGermany0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Apr., v. 73, no. 8 p.4619-4632dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3787-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007300169300001600242500001900258520100600277592002801283650001201311650001801323650001301341650001201354650001701366650001801383650000701401650001601408650001601424650001801440651001101458653001701469653001301486653002501499700002301524773015101547856008201698852000901780655001201789IND60738628120221122223949.0210524e20210524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073862812DNAL7 a10.2317/0022-8567-93.2.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Kahtani, Saad10aEffect of Harvest Time on Royal Jelly Yield and Chemical Composition  ap. 132-139.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRoyal jelly (RJ) was harvested after 24, 48, and 72 hrs of grafting to study the effect of harvest time on the yield of RJ/queen cell. The changes in the nutritional components in RJ harvested at different times post-grafting were also studied. The highest yield of RJ/queen cell was harvested after 72 hrs of grafting, while the lowest yield was harvested after 24 hrs of grafting. The lowest moisture content was found in RJ harvested after 72 hrs of grafting. The maximum concentrations of crude protein, ash, fructose, and glucose were found in RJ harvested after 72 hrs of grafting. Conversely, the highest lipid content was obtained from RJ harvested after 24 hrs of grafting. The pH value decreased and acidity increased over time after grafting. It was concluded that RJ can be harvested after 72 hrs of grafting to obtain maximum yield. The nutritional components in RJ may be changed over time after grafting, and it could differentiate between RJ harvested at different times post-grafting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acrude protein 3afructose 3aglucose 3aharvest date 3alipid content 3apH 3aqueen cells 3aroyal jelly 3awater content 3aKansas 0aharvest time 0agrafting 0achemical composition1 aTaha, El-Kazafy A.0 tJournal of the Kansas Entomological Society.g2021 May 24, v. 93, no. 2 p.132-139dKansas Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44728x0022-85677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2317/0022-8567-93.2.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01756naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245024200165300001600407520058700423592002801010650001601038650001301054650001201067650001301079650001301092650001701105650001601122650002201138650001201160700002301172773013701195856007701332852000901409655001201418IND60521489020221119114536.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052148902DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1976-03152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoberg, Friedrich10aMarkierte Verbindungen, XXIV Chloraustausch Antimon(III)-chlorid Hexachlorpropen in Systemen mit Elektronendonatoren.bOn Labelled Compounds, XXIV Chlorine Exchange Antimony(III)-chloride Hexachloropropene in Systems with Electron Donors  ap. 348-353.  aThe kinetics of the chlorine exchange between antimony (III)-chloride and hexachloropropene has been studied in systems SbCl₃/C₃Cl₆/CH₂Cl₂/electron donor. Donors are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, cumene, naphthalene, anthracene, biphenyl, p-terphenyl. A decrease of the velocity of the chlorine exchange ist effected by the donors. Studies with benzene as donor show, that the decrease depends only on the concentration of the donor.

Broilers were fed 6 treatments with 12 replications of 26 birds in a 4-phase feeding program from 1 to 42 days. Corn-soy-based diets were supplemented with 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 ppm of Zn-L-SeMet. At 42 d, 6 birds were randomly selected from each pen (n = 72) and processed for carcass and breast yields. Breast fillets were scored for WS and WB at 42 days. Increasing Zn-L-SeMet led to quadratic responses (P < 0.05) for FCR from 1 to 7 d, BWG from 22 to 35 d, and for both responses from 8 to 21 d and 36 to 42 d, as well as in the overall period of 42 days. Carcass and breast yields presented a quadratic improvement (P < 0.01) with increasing Zn-L-SeMet supplementation and Se requirements were estimated at 0.85 and 0.86 ppm, respectively. In the overall period, estimates of Se requirements were 0.64 ppm for BWG and 0.67 ppm for FCR. White striping and WB scores presented quadratic increases (P < 0.01), and maximum scores were observed at 0.68 and 0.67 ppm, respectively. Broilers fed diets formulated without Se supplementation had a higher percentage of normal fillets compared to other Se supplementation levels (quadratic, P < 0.05). In conclusion, increasing Se supplementation to reach maximum growth performance led to higher degrees of severity of WS and WB. Selenium requirements determined in the present study were significantly higher than the present commercial recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreasts 3adietary supplements 3afillets 3agrowth performance 3amuscular diseases 3aselenium 0abreast myopathy 0abroiler 0acarcass 0aperformance 0aselenium1 aVieira, S.L.1 aStefanello, C.1 aKindlein, L.1 aFerreira, T.Z.1 aFireman, A.K.0 tPoultry science.g2018 May 01, v. 97, no. 5 p.1832-1840dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015600173300001400329520103200343592002801375650001501403650001401418650001901432650001401451650002301465650002101488650002101509650001301530650002101543650002001564650001601584653002901600653003401629653002901663653003001692653004001722653001401762700002101776700002201797700002401819700002201843773011201865856008401977852000902061655001202070IND60602318720221118064948.0180711e20150828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060231872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawcenis, Dominika10aTowards determination of absolute molar mass of cellulose polymer by size exclusion chromatography with mulitple angle laser light scattering detection  ap. 53-59.  aThe study focuses on determination of a set of crucial parameters for molar mass calculation of cellulose from the results of size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiple angle laser light scattering (MALLS) and differential refractive index (DRI) detectors. In the present work, cellulose has been derivatised to obtain cellulose tricarbanilate (CTC) soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The parameters of Rayleigh scattering in the MALLS detector: refractive index increment (dn/dc) and second virial coefficient (A2) of CTC in THF were determined for laser wavelength 658nm. In order to avoid errors resulting from cellulose derivatisation by-products present in the CTC solution, the so called “on-line” method of measuring dn/dc and A2 was applied. Based on the A2 determination, its influence on cellulose molar mass calculations and cellulose molecular dimensions were critically assessed. The latter includes evaluation of artificially aged cellulose towards conceivable branching by conformation plot analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acellulose 3aderivatization 3adetectors 3agel chromatography 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3arefractive index 3atetrahydrofuran 3awavelengths 0aCellulose tricarbanilate 0aSize exclusion chromatography 0aDegree of polymerisation 0aSecond virial coefficient 0aSpecific refractive index increment 0aBranching1 aThomas, Jacob L.1 aŁojewski, Tomasz1 aMilczarek, Jakub M.1 aŁojewska, Joanna0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Aug. 28, v. 1409 p.53-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009300166300001800259520114800277592002801425650001301453650001401466650001501480650001201495650001501507650002301522650001901545650001801564650001501582650002401597650001201621650001301633650001901646650002601665653002501691653003001716653002101746653003201767700001501799700001501814700001501829700001601844700001701860700001801877700001801895700002001913773018501933856008502118852000902203655001202212IND60087310120221118125554.0160903e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008731012DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60148-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Anan10aAdsorption and desorption characteristics of diphenylarsenicals in two contrasting soils  ap. 1172-1179.  aDiphenylarsinic acid (DPAA) is formed during the leakage of aromatic arsenic chemical weapons in soils, is persistent in nature, and results in arsenic contamination in the field. The adsorption and desorption characteristics of DPAA were investigated in two typical Chinese soils, an Acrisol (a variable-charge soil) and a Phaeozem (a constant-charge soil). Their thermodynamics and some of the factors influencing them (i.e., initial pH value, ionic strength and phosphate) were also evaluated using the batch method in order to understand the environmental fate of DPAA in soils. The results indicate that Acrisol had a stronger adsorption capacity for DPAA than Phaeozem. Soil DPAA adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process and the amount of DPAA adsorbed was affected significantly by variation in soil pH and phosphate. In contrast, soil organic matter and ionic strength had no significant effect on adsorption. This suggests that DPAA adsorption may be due to specific adsorption on soil mineral surfaces. Therefore, monitoring the fate of DPAA in soils is recommended in areas contaminated by leakage from chemical weapons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrisols 3aPhaeozems 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3adesorption 3aenvironmental fate 3aionic strength 3amineral soils 3amonitoring 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3asurfaces 3athermodynamics 3avariable charge soils 0adiphenylarsinic acid 0aadsorption and desorption 0achemical weapons 0aresidual soil contamination1 aLi, Shixin1 aTeng, Ying1 aLiu, Wuxin1 aWu, Longhua1 aZhang, Haibo1 aHuang, Yujuan1 aLuo, Yongming1 aChristie, Peter0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2013 June 01, v. 25 p.1172-1179dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60148-X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245009900130300001200229520232700241592002802568650002202596650001102618650002102629650001702650650001602667650002402683650001002707650001502717650001202732650002302744650001002767650002102777650002202798650001202820650001602832650002402848650002102872650000902893650001802902650001102920650002502931650002102956650001302977650001502990700002403005773015903029852000903188655001203197IND60721272920221121091542.0201224e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072127292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sanjit10aAmeliorative effect of Bryophyllum pinnatum against mercuric chloride induced toxicity in rat.  ap. 384.  aToxicology of heavy metals encompasses a large field of research and is of interest to many because of the widespread environmental distribution of these toxicants. This is particularly true of mercury containing compounds. Thirty six albino rats (Wistar strain) of 7–9 weeks age weighing around 130–140 gwere divided in four groups: Groups II, III and IV were reared with uniform managemental conditions for entire study. The Group I without any treatment was kept as control, otherwise Groups II (Mercuric chloride @ 2mg/kgBW), III (Bryophyllum pinnatuma 200 mg/kg BW) and IV (Mercuric chloride @ 2mg/kgBW + Bryophyllum pinnatum@ 200mg/kg BW) were treatment groups. Effect of mercuric chloride was assessed by studying the various parameters viz., body weight gain, haematological, biochemical, oxidative profile, mercury residue and pathomorphological alteration were also study. There was significant decrease in body weight gain in group-II rats after single daily oral administration of Mercuric chloride @ ²ᵐg/ kg BW as compared with other treatment groups. Haematological observations revealed significant (P < 0.05) decrease in Hb, PCV, TEC, TLC, MCH and MCHC in the mercuric chloride treated group II as compared to control. Group IV showed increased values as compared to group II. Differential leucocyte count in mercury (II) chloride treated groups was characterized by significant (P < 0.05) decrease in lymphocyte count with significant (P < 0.05) increase in the neutrophil count as compared to control. Biochemical alterations observed in mercuric chloride induced toxicity caused increased levels of AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, BUN, creatinine, serum sodium and decreased levels of serum total protein and serum albumin and there was improvement in these altered levels in group IV. Effect of mercury on oxidative stress enzymes i.e., lipid peroxidation was observed and found that the LPO levels in liver, kidney and brain increased significantly in rats treated with mercury (II) chloride as compared to control.This increased level decreased in group IV. While, the antioxidant level decreased after mercury treatment, the Superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in liver, kidney and brain decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in group groups II as compared to control. These levels were increased in group IV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKalanchoe pinnata 3aalbino 3aanimal pathology 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3abrain 3acreatinine 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3alymphocyte count 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3aneutrophils 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3aserum albumin 3asodium 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3atoxicology1 aMukhopadhayay, S.K.0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2015 Dec. 1, v. 39, no. 4 p.384-384dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014600155300001600301520182000317592002802137596004802165650001602213650002302229650001602252650002102268650002002289650001802309650001002327650001102337650001602348650001802364650001402382650001802396650001302414650001202427650001602439650002302455650001002478650001202488650001002500650001302510650001302523650002102536650001302557650001602570650001802586653002102604653001602625653001702641653001502658653002102673700001602694700002002710700002202730700002102752700001302773700002202786773010902808856007402917852000902991655001203000IND60673778320221120035954.0210209e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067377832DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pey0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamot, D.M.10aDiet density during the first week of life: Effects on growth performance, digestive organ weight, and nutrient digestion of broiler chickens  ap. 789-795.  aThe current study aimed to investigate whether diet density affects growth performance and nutrient digestion during the first wk after hatch and digestive organ weight at 7 d of age. Effects were studied using a dose-response design consisting of 5 dietary fat levels (3.5, 7.0, 10.5, 14.0, and 17.5%). The dietary fat level was increased through soybean oil inclusion. Amino acids, minerals, and the premix were increased at the same ratio as dietary fat. Consequently, diets were kept neither isocaloric nor isonitrogenous. Broiler chickens were weighed on d 0 and d 7 after hatch, whereas feed intake was measured daily. Excreta produced from d 0 to d 7 was collected at d 7. Dietary dry matter and nitrogen metabolizability, as well as fat digestibility were calculated as an average over 7 days. Broiler chickens were sampled at d 7 to determine carcass yield, breast meat yield, and organ weights. Average daily gain (P = 0.047) and average daily feed intake (P < 0.001) decreased linearly as diet density increased, while gain to feed ratio increased linearly (P < 0.001). An increased diet density resulted in a linear decrease of crop, liver, and pancreas weight relative to body weight (BW; P < 0.05). Duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum length (expressed as cm/kg of BW) and empty weight (as % of BW) increased linearly with increased diet density (P < 0.05). Dietary dry matter metabolizability decreased linearly as diet density increased (P < 0.001), whereas fat digestibility and nitrogen metabolizability were not affected (P > 0.05). In conclusion, one-week-old broiler chickens respond to increased diet densities by increasing intestinal weight and length, while decreasing liver and pancreas weight. This may be an adaptive response to cope with an increased nutrient concentration in the diet.  aPublisher supplied data  cCargilldhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004387 3aamino acids 3aaverage daily gain 3abreast meat 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3acarcass yield 3acecum 3achicks 3adietary fat 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3adose response 3aduodenum 3aexcreta 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3ajejunum 3aliver 3aminerals 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3apancreas 3asoybean oil 3atissue weight 0abroiler chickens 0adietary fat 0adiet density 0aorgan size 0adigestive status1 aSapkota, D.1 aWijtten, P.J.A.1 avan den Anker, I.1 aHeetkamp, M.J.W.1 aKemp, B.1 avan den Brand, H.0 tPoultry science.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 98, no. 2 p.789-795dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003100138245010200169300001800271500002000289520160400309592002801913650002901941650001201970650002101982650002102003650001502024650001302039650001902052650001402071650001402085650001502099650001402114650003702128650002702165650001402192651001902206651001402225700002502239700001902264700002302283700002402306773012202330856007202452852000902524655001202533IND60571870720221119190609.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057187072DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.36292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown‐Peterson, Nancy J.10aResponses of juvenile southern flounder exposed to Deepwater Horizon oil‐contaminated sediments  ap. 1067-1076.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill released millions of barrels of crude oil into the northern Gulf of Mexico, much of which remains associated with sediments and can have continuing impacts on biota. Juvenile southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) were exposed for 28 d in the laboratory under controlled conditions to reference and Deepwater Horizon oil‐contaminated sediments collected from coastal Louisiana to assess the impacts on an ecologically and commercially important benthic fish. The measured polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in the sediments ranged from 0.25 mg/kg to 3940 mg/kg suite of 50 PAH analytes (tPAH50). Mortality increased with both concentration and duration of exposure. Exposed flounder length and weight was lower compared to controls after 28 d of exposure to the sediments with the highest PAH concentration, but condition factor was significantly higher in these fish compared with all other treatments. Histopathological analyses showed increased occurrence of gill abnormalities, including telangiectasis, epithelial proliferation, and fused lamellae in flounder exposed to sediments with the highest tPAH50 concentrations. In addition, hepatic vascular congestion and macrovesicular vacuolation were observed in flounder exposed to the more contaminated sediments. These data suggest that chronic exposure to field collected oil‐contaminated sediments results in a variety of sublethal impacts to a benthic fish, with implications for long‐term recovery from oil spills.

A facile anion exchange method to synthesize the hollow structure of NiCo₂S₄ is demonstrated. The synthesized hollow NiCo₂S₄ was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical sensing properties of NiCo₂S₄ towards glucose were evaluated. Due to the synergetic effects from both Ni and Co species with multiple valence transitions and the high surface area of the hollow NiCo₂S₄, the nanostructure exhibited good performance towards glucose oxidation. A simple and selective sensing platform for the assay of glucose has been developed in 0.1 M KOH solution at 0.55 V. The sensor displays a wide linear range from 0.005 to 2 mM with a detection limit of 2 μM for glucose detection. For the determination of glucose in serum samples, the results are satisfactory when compared to those obtained from a local hospital.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanion exchange 3ablood serum 3acobalt 3acobalt sulfide 3aelectrochemistry 3aglucose 3ahospitals 3ananomaterials 3anickel 3aoxidation 3apotassium hydroxide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensors (equipment) 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWang, Huiying1 aYang, Minghui0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Aug. 17, v. 9, no. 32 p.4718-4725dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay01640a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03789naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011200169300001800281520217300299592002802472650001502500650001702515650004202532650003902574650001802613650001902631650002302650650001502673650001302688650004402701650001302745650002002758700001802778700002402796700002102820700002402841700002502865700006002890700005902950700006303009700002303072773013503095856008003230852000903310655001203319IND60631346620190411000000.0190221e20181210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063134662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b089032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMöckel, Christina10aIntegrated NMR, Fluorescence, and Molecular Dynamics Benchmark Study of Protein Mechanics and Hydrodynamics  ap. 1453-1480.  aUnderstanding the function of a protein requires not only knowledge of its tertiary structure but also an understanding of its conformational dynamics. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, polarization-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are powerful methods to provide detailed insight into protein dynamics on multiple time scales by monitoring global rotational diffusion and local flexibility (order parameters) that are sensitive to inter- and intramolecular interactions, respectively. We present an integrated approach where data from these techniques are analyzed and interpreted within a joint theoretical description of depolarization and diffusion, demonstrating their conceptual similarities. This integrated approach is then applied to the autophagy-related protein GABARAP in its cytosolic form, elucidating its dynamics on the pico- to nanosecond time scale and its rotational and translational diffusion for protein concentrations spanning 9 orders of magnitude. We compare the dynamics of GABARAP as monitored by ¹⁵N spin relaxation of the backbone amide groups, fluorescence anisotropy decays and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of side chains labeled with BODIPY FL, and molecular movies of the protein from MD simulations. The recovered parameters agree very well between the distinct techniques if the different measurement conditions (probe localization, sample concentration) are taken into account. Moreover, we propose a method that compares the order parameters of the backbone and side chains to identify potential hinges for large-scale, functionally relevant intradomain motions, such as residues 27/28 at the interface between the two subdomains of GABARAP. In conclusion, the integrated concept of cross-fertilizing techniques presented here is fundamental to obtaining a comprehensive quantitative picture of multiscale protein dynamics and solvation. The possibility to employ these validated techniques under cellular conditions and combine them with fluorescence imaging opens up the perspective of studying the functional dynamics of GABARAP or other proteins in live cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence correlation spectroscopy 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3amolecular dynamics 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteins 3astable isotopes1 aKubiak, Jakub1 aSchillinger, Oliver1 aKühnemuth, Ralf1 aDella Corte, Dennis1 aSchröder, Gunnar F.1 aWillbold, Dieter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0065-73661 aStrodel, Birgit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8734-77651 aSeidel, Claus A.

They developed mode of action–based local quantitative structure–toxicity relationship (QSTR) models for nonpolar and polar narcotics as well as a global QSTR model with a wide applicability potential for industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The present study rigorously evaluated the generated models, meeting the Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development principles of robustness, validity, and transparency. The proposed global model had a broad structural coverage for the toxicity prediction of diverse chemicals (some of which are high–production volume chemicals) with no experimental toxicity data. The global model is potentially useful for endpoint predictions, the evaluation of algal toxicity screening, and the prioritization of chemicals, as well as for the decision of further testing and the development of risk‐management measures in a scientific and regulatory frame.

The catalytic performance of the resulted catalyst was tested via transesterification reaction of palm oil at room temperature (30 ± 2 °C) and was compared against commercial CaO and CaO derived from natural calcium carbonate sources. Under the optimal reaction conditions (catalyst loading of 5 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio 12:1), FAME yields were approximately 94% for CaOHY and 60.5%, 55.3%, 49.5% and 51.4% for CaOcₒₘ, CaOₑgg, CaOgₒₗ and CaOᵣᵢᵥ as catalysts, respectively. Catalyst reusability and scaling up of biodiesel production from 50 mL to 1.5 L were also investigated. The obtained biodiesel product after purification and treatment process showed high quality fuel properties within the range of biodiesel standard and similar with high-speed diesel. Furthermore, the used CaOHY as a solid heterogeneous catalyst at room temperature was not only low-cost but also environmentally-friendly, showing a high potential in the biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiodiesel 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afuel production 3amethanol 3aoils 3asurface area 3atransesterification 0aBiodiesel 0aCalcium oxide 0aHydration-dehydration process 0aRoom temperature 0aTransesterification1 aPhewphong, Sunti1 aThangthong, Amonrat1 aMoonsin, Preecha1 aYoosuk, Boonyawan1 aKaewpuang, Teadkait1 aPromarak, Vinich0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 June 01, v. 165 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.03.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04020naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245008500173300001600258520247100274592002802745650002202773650002402795650001102819650001402830650001502844650001402859650002202873650001102895650002202906650001802928650001202946650002402958651001302982653001902995653002203014653002403036653003003060653002003090653002203110653002803132653002703160653003803187700002503225700002603250773015303276856007603429852000903505655001203514IND60125542120221123035337.0151104e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012554212DNAL7 a10.2744/CCB-1109.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmer-Shaffer, Stephanie A.10aModeling the Effects of Commercial Harvest on Population Growth of River Turtles  ap. 227-236.  aCommercial turtle harvest is considered one of the major contributing factors to declines in turtle populations. Few long-term studies have evaluated turtle population response to harvest and little is known about demographic rates for many turtle species. We gathered demographic rates from the literature for snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), smooth softshells (Apalone mutica), and spiny softshells (Apalone spinifera), which are harvested in Missouri, and developed deterministic, density-independent, stage-based matrix models to assess turtle population response to plausible harvest rates we estimated from field sampling. Further, we used population modeling to determine annual harvest rates that would result in λ = 1 for each demographic scenario. We developed one model for snapping turtles and another for both softshell species combined due to the lack of available species-specific demographic data for either softshell species. Using mean demographic rates for survival and fecundity, snapping turtle populations had a growth rate (λ) of 1.023; at minimum demographic rates λ = 0.891 and at maximum demographic rates λ = 1.199. When we applied plausible, field-estimated annual harvest rates under mean demographic rates, populations decreased in all instances except when harvesting only juveniles at the minimum harvest rate. At mean demographic rates, annual harvest of both adults and juveniles should be ≤ 2.3% to maintain a stationary population (λ = 1). For softshell turtles, λ was 0.952 at mean demographic rates, 0.838 at minimum demographic rates, and 1.163 at maximum demographic rates. Under mean and minimum demographic rates, no field-estimated harvest could be sustained, as any annual harvest rate resulted in λ < 1. For both snapping turtles and softshells, harvest was sustainable when demographic rates were at the maximum values, which are highly improbable to occur frequently: annual harvest of 16.3% of both adult and juvenile softshells and 18.6% of adult and juvenile snapping turtles resulted in λ ≥ 1. In both species, elasticity analyses demonstrated that adults, which are the most vulnerable to commercial harvest, were the most important segment of the population demographically. These results corroborate the findings of other studies which indicate that even low annual harvest rates may have detrimental effects on the long-term sustainability of turtle populations at localized scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApalone spinifera 3aChelydra serpentina 3aadults 3afecundity 3aharvesting 3ajuveniles 3along term effects 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3asurvival rate 3aturtles 3awildlife management 3aMissouri 0aApalone mutica 0aApalone spinifera 0aChelydra serpentina 0acommercial turtle harvest 0asnapping turtle 0aLefkovitch matrix 0asmooth softshell turtle 0aspiny softshell turtle 0astage-structured population model1 aBriggler, Jeffrey T.1 aMillspaugh, Joshua J.0 tChelonian Conservation and Biology.g2014 Dec., v. 13, no. 2 p.227-236dThe Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, Inc.x1071-84437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2744%2FCCB-1109.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245004300162300001400205520070200219592002800921650001900949650001000968650001300978650001900991650001101010650001701021650002601038650001201064700001401076700002501090700001701115700001801132700002501150700002501175773009401200856008301294852000901377655001201386IND60701530020221121155757.0210219e20200709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070153002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xing10aHuman Virus Transcriptional Regulators  ap. 24-37.  aViral genomes encode transcriptional regulators that alter the expression of viral and host genes.

RESULTS: Twenty sheep were assigned to four groups with five animals each. These animals were assigned to different periods of HG diet (containing 40% forage and 60% concentrate mix) feeding. The HG groups received an HG diet for 7 (G7, n = 5), 14 (G14, n = 5) and 28 d (G28, n = 5), respectively. In contrast, the control group (CON, n = 5) was fed the forage-based diet for 28 d. The results showed that HG feeding linearly decreased (P < 0.001) the ruminal pH, and increased the concentrations of ruminal total volatile fatty acid (linear, P = 0.001), butyrate (linear, P < 0.001), valerate (quadratic P = 0.029) and the level of IGF-1 (quadratic, P = 0.043) in plasma. The length (quadratic, P = 0.004), width (cubic, P = 0.015) and surface of the ruminal papillae (linear, P = 0.003) were all enlarged after 14 d of HG diet feeding. HG feeding cubically increased the number of cell layers forming the stratum corneum (SC, P < 0.001) and the thickness of the SC (P < 0.001) and stratum basale (P < 0.001). The proportion of basal layer cells in the RE decreased (linear, P < 0.001) in the G0/G1-phase, but it increased linearly (P = 0.006) in the S-phase and cubically (P = 0.004) in the G2/M-phases. The proportion of apoptosis cells in G7, G14 and G28 was reduced compared to the CON (quadratic, P < 0.001). HG diet feeding linearly decreased the mRNA expression of Cyclin E1 (P = 0.021) and CDK-2 (P = 0.001) and (P = 0.027) the protein expression of Cyclin E1. Feeding an HG diet linearly increased the mRNA expression of genes IGFBP-2 (P = 0.034) and IGFBP 5 (P < 0.009), while linearly decreasing (P < 0.001) the IGFBP 3 expression. The expression of cell apoptosis gene Caspase 8 decreased (quadratic, P = 0.012), while Bad mRNA expression tended to decrease (cubic, P = 0.053) after HG feeding. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated sequential changes in rumen papillae size, cell cycle regulation and the genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis as time elapsed in feeding a high-grain diet to sheep.  aPublisher supplied data  a31572436cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31372339cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3abutyrates 3acaspase-8 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3adiet 3aforage 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ainsulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3ainterphase 3amessenger RNA 3apH 3aprotein synthesis 3arumen epithelium 3asheep 3avolatile fatty acids1 aWang, Yue1 aLiu, Junhua1 aZhu, Weiyun1 aMao, Shengyong0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2018 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.32-32dBioMed CentralwJournal:2268x2049-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-018-0247-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04036naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014800166300001800314520201300332592002802345650002102373650001202394650001302406650001102419650002402430650001602454650002102470650001502491650002602506650001402532650001702546650001602563650001002579650001302589650001602602650001002618650001902628650001402647650001402661650004302675650001702718650001102735650001302746650001402759650000902773650001602782650002902798650002502827651001002852653003002862653001402892653002402906653003102930653001802961653002202979700001703001700001903018700001803037700001603055773018503071856008503256852000903341655001203350IND60087310420221118125540.0160903e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008731042DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60178-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhixin10aAbundance and diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in response to various habitats in Pearl River Delta of China, a subtropical maritime zone  ap. 1195-1205.  aAmmonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are widely considered key to ammonia oxidation in various environments. However, little work has been conducted to simultaneously investigate the abundance and diversity of AOA as well as correlations between archaeal amoA genotypes and environmental parameters of different ecosystems at one district. To understand the abundance, diversity, and distribution of AOA in Pearl River Delta of China in response to various habitats, the archaeal amoA genes in soil, marine, river, lake, hot spring and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) samples were investigated using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and clone libraries. Our analyses indicated that the diversity of AOA in various habitats was different and could be clustered into five major clades, i.e., estuary sediment, marine water/sediment, soil, hot spring and Cluster 1. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the structure of AOA communities in similar ecological habitats exhibited strong relation. The canonical correspondence method indicated that the AOA community structure was strongly correlated to temperature, pH, total organic carbon, total nitrogen and dissolved oxygen variables. Assessing AOA amoA gene copy numbers, ranging from 6.84 × 106 to 9.45 × 107 copies/g in dry soil/sediment, and 6.06 × 106 to 2.41 × 107 copies/L in water samples, were higher than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) by 1–2 orders of magnitude. However, AOA amoA copy numbers were much lower than AOB in WWTP activated sludge samples. Overall, these studies suggested that AOA may be a major contributor to ammonia oxidation in natural habitats but play a minor role in highly aerated activated sludge. The result also showed the ratio of AOA to AOB amoA gene abundance was positively correlated with temperature and less correlated with other environmental parameters. New data from our study provide increasing evidence for the relative abundance and diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in the global nitrogen cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aammonia 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3acorrelation 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3afluorescence 3agene dosage 3agenes 3ahabitats 3ahot springs 3alakes 3anitrogen cycle 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asampling 3asediments 3asoil 3atemperature 3atotal dissolved nitrogen 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 0aammonia-oxidizing archaea 0aabundance 0acommunity structure 0areal-time quantitative PCR 0aclone library 0aPearl River Delta1 aJin, Wenbiao1 aLiang, Zhaoyun1 aYue, Yangyang1 aLv, Junhong0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2013 June 01, v. 25 p.1195-1205dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60178-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245016900166300001800335520146900353592002801822650001301850650001501863650002001878650001501898650001301913650001401926650002601940650000901966650002401975650001701999650002102016650002602037650001202063650002202075650001302097650001502110650002602125650002002151650001802171650001202189650003702201650003702238700002802275700001802303700002802321700002202349700002302371700002402394773012802418856007402546852000902620655001202629IND60638815120221120063141.0190430e20171026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063881512DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay01645j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMthembu, Christian L.10aGoogle Analytics and quick response for advancement of gold nanoparticle-based dual lateral flow immunoassay for malaria – Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)  ap. 5943-5951.  aA rapid dual lateral flow diagnostic assay fabricated with quick response (QR) barcodes was developed to improve the quality control of malaria diagnostic tests, as well as to enhance systems for transferring data from survey studies among community healthcare workers at a point-of-care facility and centralized laboratories. The lateral flow kit has been modified with QR technology encoded with Google Analytics information for the detection and real-time tracking of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). The QR barcode was fabricated by attaching two QR barcodes which were encoded with websites that were linked to Google Analytics. The optical and structural properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were studied using UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and a Biodot XYZ. The anti-mouse IgG antibody was used as a secondary antibody to act as a control and anti-pLDH. The antibody binding with pLDH antigens shows a test line indicating a positive test in the presence of phosphate buffer as a mobile phase. The diagnostic kit for the rapid detection of pLDH was developed and validated for the detection of malaria antigens at the lowest detectable recombinant concentration of 10 ng ml⁻¹. The diagnostic kit was incorporated with quick QR barcodes for positive, negative and invalid tests readable with a smartphone.

Accompanying the decay of 4-PSA, the amount of total organic carbon (TOC) in water correspondingly decreased, while the sulfonate group of 4-PSA was released as sulfate ion. Oxalate and formate were obtained as minor by-products. Additionally, phenol, 1,4-hydroquinone, hydroxyquinol and 1,4-benzoquinone were detected as primary intermediates in the initial stages of decomposition of 4-PSA. A reaction pathway involving successive attacks of hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals was assumed on the basis of the observed products and kinetics. It was revealed that the decay of both 4-PSA and TOC obeyed a first-order rate law. The effects of different Fe ions and initial concentrations of 4-PSA on the degradation rate were investigated. It was found that the presence of Fe ions could increase the degradation rate of 4-PSA, while initial concentrations lower than 80 mmol/L had no significant effect on kinetic behaviour. The disappearance rate of 4-PSA was significantly affected by pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3aelectrolysis 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen 3aions 3airon 3apH 3aphenol 0a4-phenolsulfonic acid 0adestruction 0acontact glow discharge electrolysis 0afirst-order rate law 0aFenton reaction1 aAn, Baigang1 aWang, Shaoyan1 aLi, Lixiang1 aJin, Wenjie1 aLi, Lihua0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2013 June 01, v. 25 p.1063-1070dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60131-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245008200173300001600255500001100271520066600282592002800948650002100976650002200997650002001019650001301039773012901052856007401181852000901255655001201264IND60592075420221117005801.0180327e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059207542DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.245762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Tim J.q(Timothy J.),10aPhotomechanical effects in liquid crystalline polymer networks and elastomers  ap. 695-705.  aREVIEW  aLiquid crystals are widely employed as stimuli‐responsive materials.

For instance, they regulate the growth and development, response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Quantification of trace endogenous phytohormones is essential to elucidate their molecular mechanisms in response to stresses. However, the structural and chemical diversity of phytohormones make it difficult to purify and enrich multiple phytohormones in one-step. In the current study, a method was developed to comprehensively profile phytohormones, including 8 cytokinins (CKs), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and 10 gibberellins (GAs) by Fe3O4@TiO2-based magnetic solid-phase extraction coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (Fe3O4@TiO2-based MSPE-UPLC-MS/MS). In the proposed method, the phytohormones in the acetonitrile extract of plant tissues were captured and purified by one-step MSPE using Fe3O4@TiO2 as a sorbent prior to UPLC-MS/MS analysis. The sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed analytical method were demonstrated to satisfy the profiling of multiple phytohormones in plant tissue. We then further used the Fe3O4@TiO2-based MSPE-UPLC-MS/MS method to explore the change of phytohormones in rice under Cd stress. The results showed that CKs, IAA, ABA, JA and biological active GAs all increased under Cd stress, suggesting that these phytohormones may take part in response to Cd stress. The study may promote the further understanding of the physiological functions of phytohormones in response to Cd stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3aacetonitrile 3acadmium 3acytokinins 3agibberellins 3agrowth and development 3aindole acetic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquids 3amagnetism 3aplant tissues 3arice 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aPhytohormones 0aSample preparation 0aMagnetic solid-phase extraction 0aCadmium stress 0aMass spectrometry1 aYin, Jia1 aHao, Yan-Hong1 aLi, Yu-Nan1 aYuan, Bi-Feng1 aFeng, Yu-Qi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Aug. 07, v. 1406 p.78-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008300159300001800242520142100260592002801681650002101709650001201730650001201742650002501754650001301779650002501792650001301817650002201830650002101852650001601873650001201889650002001901650001401921650001201935650001401947650001201961650002301973650001601996650001402012650001402026650002002040650001902060650001702079650001402096650002702110650001202137650001102149650001402160650001002174653002302184653001302207653001502220653001602235653001702251700006002268700006102328700001802389700002002407700001702427773011002444856007402554852000902628655001202637IND60673778720221117175813.0210209e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067377872DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pey0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarghly, M.F.A.10aWet feed and cold water as heat stress modulators in growing Muscovy ducklings  ap. 1588-1594.  aIn an attempt to alleviate the deleterious effects of high summer temperatures, the present study investigated the effects of wet feed and cold water on the growth performance, carcass and meat quality, leg problems, physiological responses, and blood parameters of growing Muscovy ducklings. A total of 180 4-week-old ducklings was randomly divided into 6 experimental groups in a 3 × 2 factorial design that included 3 feed systems (AD: ad libitum dry; DW: diurnal wet; and AW: ad libitum wet) and 2 systems of water (TW: tap water; and CW: cold water). Access to wet feed and cold water affected the growth performance, dressed carcass, gizzard, meat quality (tenderness, juiciness, and susceptibility), tonic immobility, body temperature, and blood parameters [albumin: globulin (A: G) ratio and levels of glucose, alanine transferase (ALT), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and malondialdehyde (MDA)] of the ducklings but had no significant effect on plumage condition, shank length, keel bone length, leg problems, or breast blisters. The body weight (BW) of the DW group was 1.97 and 3.12% greater than that of the AD and AW groups, respectively, and the BWG of the DW group was 6.91 and 10.72% greater than that of the AD and AW groups, respectively. Therefore, providing access to wet feed and cold water is highly recommended when raising Muscovy ducks in open houses under high-temperature conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCairina moschata 3aMuscovy 3aalanine 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aantioxidant activity 3ablisters 3ablood composition 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3abreasts 3acarcass quality 3aducklings 3agizzard 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3aheat stress 3ajuiciness 3akeel bone 3amalondialdehyde 3ameat carcasses 3ameat quality 3aparalysis 3aphysiological response 3aplumage 3asummer 3atap water 3awater 0agrowth performance 0awet feed 0acold water 0aheat stress 0aMuscovy duck1 aAbd El-Hack, M E1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2831-85341 aAbd El-Hack, M.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2831-85341 aAlagawany, M.1 aSaadeldin, I.M.1 aSwelum, A.A.0 tPoultry science.g2018 May 01, v. 97, no. 5 p.1588-1594dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002000169245011500189300001600304500002000320506002800340506003000368520155400398592002801952596008301980596007902063596004502142506003702187650002002224650002502244650002302269650000902292650001102301650001202312650001102324650002502335650002502360650001602385650001802401650002102419650001502440650001502455650001902470650001102489650002102500700001902521700001902540773012302559856007302682903002202755852000902777655001202786IND60592075820221207084745.0180327e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059207582DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.124032doi7 a10.1111/sum.124032chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCourty, M.

Using field and laboratory studies, this study sought to elucidate how tillage, the below‐ground incorporation of cover crop residue, and soil macroporosity affect soil respiration and residue decomposition rates. In the field, residue from a cover crop mixture of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum) was placed into litter bags that were left on the surface versus incorporated into the soil at three depths (4, 8 or 12 cm), while the laboratory study compared surface‐placed versus incorporated litter (8 cm depth). To assess tillage effects on cover crop decomposition, the field study simulated no‐till and conventional tillage treatments, while the laboratory and field studies both included treatments in which artificial soil macropores were created. The field study showed that conventional tillage and the presence of macropores enhanced soil respiration, while in the laboratory study, incorporating cover crop residue resulted in higher soil respiration and faster litter decomposition rates. Additionally, the laboratory measurements showed that macropores increased soil respiration in wet conditions, likely by enhancing oxygen diffusion. Thus, organic matter incorporation and macropores may represent important factors that affect soil respiration and carbon dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNatural Resources Conservation Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009171  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHordeum vulgare 3aTrifolium incarnatum 3aagricultural soils 3abags 3abarley 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aconventional tillage 3acover crops 3acrop residues 3agreenhouse gases 3amacropores 3ano-tillage 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3asoil respiration1 aGyawali, A.

The DPS acted as both a reducing agent and a capping agent for the bimetallic nanoparticles. Au/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles were successfully grown within the DPS matrixes, and the bimetallic structures were characterized using various methods, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, and X-ray diffraction. Moreover, it was shown that these DPS-capped Au/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles could function as catalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol in the presence of NaBH₄ and were more effective than Au or Ag monometallic nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPueraria 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3aeconomic sustainability 3agold 3ananoparticles 3ap-nitrophenol 3areducing agents 3asilver 3astarch 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aHe, Fang1 aLi, Lidong0 tLangmuir.g2013 Apr. 16, v. 29, no. 15 p.4901-4907dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla400355u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001200192245005600204506007600260520106100336592002801397506003701425650003101462650001501493650001201508650001101520653003801531653001701569653002001586653002901606653003001635653002201665653002701687700002101714773012001735856008501855852000901940655001201949IND60691018220221207080406.0200427e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069101822DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2017.13477432doi7 aPMC56161622pmcid7 a286924142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tao10aHow common is within-plant signaling via volatiles?  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany plants respond to herbivory by releasing a complex blend of volatiles that may differ from that emitted by intact counterparts. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV) mediate many interactions among plants and their community members, including alerting undamaged leaves of the attacked or neighboring plants to impending danger. It has been postulated that HIPVs evolved for within-plant signaling and that other organisms subsequently evolved to use them. However, only 7 studies have reported HIPV-mediated within-plant signaling, most conducted in the laboratory or greenhouse. This leaves open the ecological relevance and evolutionary underpinning of the phenomenon. We recently observed within-plant signaling in hybrid aspen under laboratory and field conditions. Greenhouse experiments showed that HIPVs mediated the process. While our study adds an aspen hybrid to the list of plants in which within-plant signaling has been demonstrated, we lack understanding of how common the process is and whether plants obtain fitness benefits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aherbivores 3ahybrids 3aleaves 0aHerbivore-induced plant volatiles 0ahybrid aspen 0ainduced defense 0aplant-insect interaction 0aplant-plant communication 0asystemic response 0awithin-plant signaling1 aBlande, James D.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2017 Aug. 3, v. 12, no. 8 p.e1347743-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2017.13477433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009300170300001600263520141600279592002801695650001701723650002001740650001901760650001001779650002401789650001901813650001901832650002801851650004101879650001001920650001301930653001901943653002001962653001801982653002102000653002302021653003402044700001702078700001502095700001702110700001902127773011402146856008402260852000902344655001202353IND60602319320221118065156.0180711e20150807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060231932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.06.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Jian-Jun10aLiquid chromatographic method for toxic biogenic amines in foods using a chaotropic salt  ap. 331-336.  aDirect separation of biogenic amines by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is not an easy task because their basic and hydrophilic characteristics can lead to poor retention, column overloading, peak tailing, and hence low efficiency. Rather than routinely resorting to derivatization or using classical hydrophobic ion-pair reagents (IPR), this work proposes a new RPLC method making use of the chaotropic salt KPF6 as inorganic additive to an acidic acetonitrilic eluent to remedy the difficulties. Amine retention, overload behavior, peak shape, and column efficiency were significantly improved. The use of excess KPF6 led to a very slight decrease of amine retention. Depending on amine, the dependence of the logarithmic retention factor on the volume percent of acetonitrile could be reasonably linear or quite convex. Coupled with UV detection, the method was applied to trace analysis for six biogenic, aromatic or heterocyclic amines in three types of food after a sample cleanup, as necessary, by ion-pair extraction. The reliability of the whole analysis was demonstrated to be satisfactory. The proposed method outperforms existing methods in that it eliminates the need for long and cumbersome derivatization procedures without losing sensitivity; it also represents a good surrogate for classical ion-pair chromatography (IPC) because of the desirable hydrophilicity of chaotropic salts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abiogenic amines 3aderivatization 3afoods 3aheterocyclic amines 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aion pair chromatography 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asalts 3atoxicity 0aBiogenic amine 0aChaotropic salt 0aFood analysis 0aIon-pair reagent 0aRetention behavior 0aReversed-phase chromatography1 aLiao, Ningbo1 aDing, Tian1 aYe, Xingqian1 aLiu, Dong-Hong0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Aug. 07, v. 1406 p.331-336dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.06.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009600164300001800260520176700278592002802045650000802073650001602081650001102097650000902108650001402117650001102131650001602142650001402158650001602172650001902188700001902207700001902226700005802245700006102303773013502364856008002499852000902579655001202588IND60631347120190411000000.0190221e20190124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063134712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b107912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandić, Ana,10aStructure-Based Model of RNA Pseudoknot Captures Magnesium-Dependent Folding Thermodynamics  ap. 1505-1511.  aWe develop a simple, coarse-grained approach for simulating the folding of the Beet Western Yellow Virus (BWYV) pseudoknot toward the goal of creating a transferable model that can be used to study other small RNA molecules. This approach combines a structure-based model (SBM) of RNA with an electrostatic scheme that has previously been shown to correctly reproduce ionic condensation in the native basin. Mg²⁺ ions are represented explicitly, directly incorporating ion–ion correlations into the system, and K⁺ is represented implicitly, through the mean-field generalized Manning counterion condensation theory. Combining the electrostatic scheme with a SBM enables the electrostatic scheme to be tested beyond the native basin. We calibrate the SBM to reproduce experimental BWYV unfolding data by eliminating overstabilizing backbone interactions from the molecular contact map and by strengthening base pairing and stacking contacts relative to other native contacts, consistent with the experimental observation that relative helical stabilities are central determinants of the RNA unfolding sequence. We find that this approach quantitatively captures the Mg²⁺ dependence of the folding temperature and generates intermediate states that better approximate those revealed by experiment. Finally, we examine how our model captures Mg²⁺ condensation about the BWYV pseudoknot and a U-tail variant, for which the nine 3′ end nucleotides are replaced with uracils, and find our results to be consistent with experimental condensation measurements. This approach can be easily transferred to other RNA molecules by eliminating and strengthening the same classes of contacts in the SBM and including generalized Manning counterion condensation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aRNA folding 3abasins 3aions 3amagnesium 3amodels 3anucleotides 3apotassium 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aHayes, Ryan L.1 aLammert, Heiko1 aCheng, Ryan R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6378-295X1 aOnuchic, José N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9448-03880 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 24, v. 123, no. 7 p.1505-1511dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b107913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245017700170520125000347592002801597650002101625650002501646650002801671650002801699650001701727650001001744650001101754650002001765650001601785650001901801650002801820650001301848650001701861650002801878650002801906650002101934700001701955700001501972700001601987700001102003700001602014700001802030700005802048700001502106700001802121773009202139856009102231852000902322655001202331IND60732778020221122204301.0210904e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073277802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.1207772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhao10aRETRACTED: Phototherapy together with it triggered immunological response for Anti-HPV treatment of oropharyngeal cancer: Removing tumor and pathogenic virus simultaneously  aThis article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal).This article has been retracted at the request of <the Editor-in-Chief due to concerns raised in PubPeer:https://pubpeer.com/publications/13E26376F13ECBF9BEA4628EF04CEE#This study concerns photo-immunotherapy enabled by the use of ZrC nanoparticles as difunctional photoactive substance to generate hyperthermia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) under NIR excitation.

Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the first 725 amino acids (S1) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein induces antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. With three immunizations, high titers of neutralizing antibodies (up to 1: 104) were generated without adjuvant. DNA vaccination with the MERS-CoV S1 gene markedly increased the frequencies of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-γ and other cytokines. Both pcDNA3.1-S1 DNA vaccine immunization and passive transfer of immune serum from pcDNA3.1-S1 vaccinated mice protected Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice from MERS-CoV challenge. These results demonstrate that a DNA vaccine encoding MERS-CoV S1 protein induces strong protective immune responses against MERS-CoV infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3aadjuvants 3aamino acids 3aantiserum 3acell-mediated immunity 3acytokines 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3amice 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apandemic 3apathogens 3arecombinant vaccines 3avaccination 3aWest Asia 0aMERS-CoV 0aDNA vaccine 0aSpike protein1 aZheng, Xuexing1 aWang, Xiwen1 aWang, Chong1 aWang, Hualei1 aGai, Weiwei1 aPerlman, Stanley1 aYang, Songtao1 aZhao, Jincun1 aXia, Xianzhu0 tVaccine.g2017 Apr. 11, v. 35, no. 16 p.2069-2075dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.02.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011400165300001600279520169800295592002801993650001502021650001302036650001202049650001102061650001402072650001402086650001002100650001102110650001102121650001802132650001502150650001102165650001702176650001402193650001902207653001802226653000902244653001902253653001102272653001502283653002502298700002002323700001502343700001602358700001802374700002902392773012102421856008302542852000902625655001202634IND60725943120221120103433.0210513e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072594312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTölke, E.D.10aSecretory ducts in Anacardiaceae revisited: Updated concepts and new findings based on histochemical evidence  ap. 394-405.  aSecretory ducts in vegetative and reproductive organs of Anacardiaceae have long been documented. However, despite the numerous studies on the anatomy and ultrastructure of these ducts, our knowledge about a possible diversity of duct metabolism in a same plant is scarce. In this study, we aimed to revisit the structure, distribution and metabolic diversity of ducts in vegetative and reproductive organs of Anacardiaceae. The distribution and anatomy of the secretory ducts in the stem, leaves, flowers and fruits of four species of Anacardiaceae were studied and their secretions histochemically characterized. Differences in the composition of the secretion according to the distribution of the ducts were detected, and more than one type of duct can occur in the same organ. In vegetative organs all the phloem ducts produce a complex, mixed resin mostly composed of lipophilic compounds (resin sensu lato). Medullary ducts of Anacardium and Spondias produce only gum, while in Tapirira they have a mixed resin. In reproductive organs, the secretion has a similar composition to the vegetative organs in each species, except in the fruits of Anacardium, where the ducts produce only lipids (resin sensu stricto). The general morphology of the ducts and the production of resins are conservative not only in Anacardiaceae, but also in other Sapindalean families. Our findings demonstrated for the first time in Anacardiaceae the presence of two kinds of ducts, which produce different classes of compounds depending on their origin and distribution. Earlier descriptions referring Anacardiaceae gum-resin and/or latex ducts are in the current article denominate as resin ducts sensu lato.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardium 3aSpondias 3aflowers 3afruits 3agum resin 3aknowledge 3alatex 3aleaves 3alipids 3alipophilicity 3ametabolism 3aphloem 3aresin canals 3asecretion 3aultrastructure 0aAnacardiaceae 0aGums 0aHistochemistry 0aResins 0aSapindales 0aSecretory structures1 aLacchia, A.P.S.1 aLima, E.A.1 aDemarco, D.1 aAscensão, L.1 aCarmello-Guerreiro, S.M.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 May, v. 138 p.394-405dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010800173300001600281520077800297536033301075592002801408596003601436596004101472596004401513650002101557650002601578650001001604650001901614650001901633650001601652650001901668650001401687650001601701650000901717650002001726653001001746653002601756653001101782653001701793700002301810700001801833700001801851700002801869700002401897773013601921856008502057852000902142655001202151IND60675939720221119002257.0191112e20191102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067593972DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2019.16017392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrosse, Charlotte10aOptimizing Chemical Wood Modification with Oligomeric Lactic Acid by Screening of Processing Conditions  ap. 385-398.  aWhen exposed to moisture, wood undergoes swelling and is susceptible to fungal degradation. Chemical modification via oligomeric lactic acid (OLA) treatment has been found to be a promising environmentally friendly solution to this disadvantage. In this study, wood was impregnated with OLA and then variously heat treated to polymerize the OLA in situ. The effect of curing temperature and time on OLA polymerization has been determined chemically. Dimensional stability was examined by water immersion and hygroscopicity measurements and biological decay resistance also evaluated. OLA impregnation followed by heat treatment enhanced wood properties. OLA cure at 160 °C for 48 h resulted in treated wood with greater dimensional stability and biological resistance.  aThe research leading to these results was supported by funding from the WoodWisdom-Net Research Program, which is a transnational R&D program jointly funded by national funding organizations within the framework of the ERA-NET + Action WoodWisdom-Net+, and the Swiss body of the COST office (funded project number C15.0090).  aPublisher supplied data  cWoodWisdom-Net Research Program  cERA-NET + Action WoodWisdom-Net+  aC15.0090cSwiss body of the COST office 3adecay resistance 3adimensional stability 3afungi 3aheat treatment 3ahygroscopicity 3alactic acid 3apolymerization 3ascreening 3atemperature 3awood 3awood properties 0aBeech 0achemical modification 0acuring 0aoptimization1 aGrigsby, Warren J.1 aNoël, Marion1 aTreu, Andreas1 aThévenon, Marie-France1 aGérardin, Philippe0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g2019 Nov. 2, v. 39, no. 6 p.385-398dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33236x1532-23197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02773813.2019.16017393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245013700161300001800298500001400316520040200330592002800732650002100760650002500781650001800806650001000824650002000834650002500854650001300879650001600892650001600908653002300924653001700947653001600964700001700980700001900997700002201016700001701038700002001055773018401075856007501259852000901334655001201343IND60691903620221120203103.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069190362DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.20902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTOMIYASU, Kanae10aCloning and Nucleotide Sequence of the Pullulanase Gene of Thermus thermophilus HB8 and Production of the Enzyme in Escherichia coli  ap. 2090-2094.  aNAL-light  aA 3.4-kb SphI fragment carrying the pullulanase gene of Thermus thermophilus HB8 was cloned.

The aluminium (Al³⁺) resistance of 338 wheat genotypes with different geographic origins was correlated with morphological traits and TaALMT1 and TaMATE1B alleles. Both of these genes encode malate and citrate transporters associated with Al³⁺ resistance mechanisms in wheat. Based on comparisons with the sensitive and resistant controls, the relative root growth was evaluated in hydroponic experiments and the plant performance was visually accessed in the field. The correlation between Al³⁺ tolerance in the hydroponic and field tests was moderate (r = 0.56, P < 0.001). Higher selection pressure was observed in the field because a smaller number of genotypes was classified as resistant. The combination between the six TaALMT1 alleles and the two TaMATE1B promoters allowed the identification of 11 haplotypes that showed a high (r = 0.71, P < 0.001) correlation with Al³⁺ resistance in the field, with the TaALMT1 alleles accounting for most of the correlation. The Brazilian wheat genotypes presented the best performance in soil, including eight cultivars with promoters usually associated with Al³⁺ resistance and another six genotypes classified as moderately resistant but containing alleles usually associated with Al³⁺ sensitivity. Although an increase in favourable alleles was observed over the past few decades, the average Al³⁺ resistance in the field was not significantly different from that of older cultivars. The ease identification of the TaALMT1 and TaMATE1B alleles and their higher association with Al³⁺ resistance along with the best genotypes identified here may be used for wheat-breeding programmes interested in increasing wheat Al³⁺ resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aalleles 3aaluminum 3acitrates 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3ahaplotypes 3ahydroponics 3amalates 3aresistance mechanisms 3aroot growth 3atoxicity 3atransporters 3awheat1 aMinozzo, João A.

In areas where there are no boreholes or piezometers are not available, constructing flow net map may be difficult. This work proposes a simple methodology to construct flow net map without drilling boreholes. The flow net map constructed using the proposed approach represents an expected flow net map, which can draw conceptual flow model of the site. The major benefit from constructing the expected flow net map is it gives guidance for locating new boreholes for site investigation, carrying out investigation of the groundwater flow directions and estimating recharge/discharge from the site boundary. An illustrative example for the proposed approach was presented to show how the data required to construct the expected flow net map can be collected. The constructed, expected flow net map using the proposed methodology was compared with actual flow net map constructed from measured water levels. Both maps give consistent hydrological information about the site. The suggested approach represents a simple and cheap way to carry out investigation of groundwater flow dynamics in areas where there are no boreholes are available.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrilling 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3apiezometers0 tApplied water science.g2017 Mar., v. 7, no. 1 p.481-488dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-015-0267-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007000168300001800238520141000256592002801666650001701694650001401711650001201725650001501737650001201752650002201764650001401786650001101800700003401811700005901845700006101904700005901965773012202024856008402146852000902230655001202239IND60598744420190326000000.0190326e20180111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059874442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b006502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero, Elvira10aSame Substrate, Many Reactions: Oxygen Activation in Flavoenzymes  ap. 1742-1769.  aOver time, organisms have evolved strategies to cope with the abundance of dioxygen on Earth. Oxygen-utilizing enzymes tightly control the reactions involving O₂ mostly by modulating the reactivity of their cofactors. Flavins are extremely versatile cofactors that are capable of undergoing redox reactions by accepting either one electron or two electrons, alternating between the oxidized and the reduced states. The physical and chemical principles of flavin-based chemistry have been investigated widely. In the following pages we summarize the state of the art on a key area of research in flavin enzymology: the molecular basis for the activation of O₂ by flavin-dependent oxidases and monooxygenases. In general terms, oxidases use O₂ as an electron acceptor to produce H₂O₂, while monooxygenases activate O₂ by forming a flavin intermediate and insert an oxygen atom into the substrate. First, we analyze how O₂ reaches the flavin cofactor embedded in the protein matrix through dedicated access pathways. Then we approach O₂ activation from the perspective of the monooxygenases, their preferred intermediate, the C(4a)–(hydro)peroxyflavin, and the cases in which other intermediates have been described. Finally, we focus on understanding how the architectures developed in the active sites of oxidases promote O₂ activation and which other factors operate in its reactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aelectrons 3aenzymes 3aenzymology 3aflavins 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen1 aGómez Castellanos, J.

We tested this in Northern Ghana where the prevalence of such out-of-sequence vaccinations has declined.Using annual cohort data of children aged 12–23months from 1996 to 2012 and Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed survival in relation to the most recent vaccination status within the next 12months and until five years of age. We assessed whether mortality in children aged 12–59months was higher when the most recent vaccine was non-live (DTP) rather than live (MV or OPV).Out-of-sequence vaccinations with DTP-containing vaccines and MV declined from 86% in 1989 to 24% in 1996 and 0.7% in 2012. Between 1996 and 2012, 38 070 children had their vaccinations status assessed: the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for out-of-sequence vaccinations (DTP>=MV) compared with the recommended sequence of MV-after-DTP3 was 1.42(1.06–1.90) during the first 12months after assessment of vaccination status and 1.29(1.03–1.60) with follow-up to five years of age; the HR was 2.58(1.14–5.84) before OPV or MV campaigns and 1.37(1.02–1.85) after the campaigns.Out-of-sequence vaccinations with DTP and MV are associated with higher mortality than MV as most recent vaccination; the effect is unlikely to be due to confounding. Hence, the reduction in out-of-sequence vaccinations may have lowered child mortality. It is recommended not to give DTP with MV or DTP after MV.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3amodels 3amortality 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aGhana 0aDTP 0aMeasles vaccine 0aNon-specific effects of vaccines 0aOut of sequence vaccinations 0aMortality 0aHeterologous immunity1 aOduro, Abraham1 aDebpuur, Cornelius1 aAaby, Peter1 aRavn, Henrik1 aAndersen, Andreas1 aBinka, Fred1 aHodgson, Abraham0 tVaccine.g2017 Apr. 25, v. 35, no. 18 p.2496-2503dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012000171300001400291500001500305520113000320592002801450650001601478650001401494650001101508650001301519650001101532650002101543650001201564650001801576650003201594650001901626650001001645650001301655650001301668650001601681650004101697651001001738653003801748653004401786653003401830653001501864653005001879653001101929653002101940653004101961653003502002653003502037653003802072653003602110653004402146653003202190653004002222700002002262700001202282700001702294700001702311773009802328856008702426852000902513655001202522IND60561859820221119231122.0190402e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056185982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xing-jie10aAroma compounds and characteristics of noble-rot wines of Chardonnay grapes artificially botrytized in the vineyard  ap. 41-50.  a2019-12-06  aAroma characteristics and their impact volatile components of noble-rot wines elaborated from artificial botrytized Chardonnay grapes, obtained by spraying Botrytis cinerea suspension in Yuquan vineyard, Ningxia, China, were explored in this work. Dry white wine made from normal-harvested grapes and sweet wine produced from delay-harvested grapes were compared. Wine aromas were analysed by trained sensory panelists, and aroma compounds were determined by SPME-GC–MS. Results indicated that esters, fatty acids, thiols, lactones, volatile phenols and 2-nonanone increased markedly in noble-rot wines. In addition to typical aromas of noble-rot wines, artificial noble-rot wines were found to contain significant cream and dry apricot attributes. Partial Least-Squares Regression models of aroma characteristics against aroma components revealed that non-fermentative odorants were the primary contributor to dry apricot attribute, especially, thiols, C13-norisoprenoids, lactones, terpenols and phenolic acid derivatives, while cream attribute was dependent on both fermentative and non-fermentative volatile components.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty acids 3avineyards 3agrapes 3alactones 3athiols 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aphenols 3aleast squares 3asolid phase microextraction 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aspraying 3aapricots 3awhite wines 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aChina 0aPhenyl acetic acid (PubChem: 999) 0aPartial Least-Squares Regression (PLSR) 0aα-Terpineol (PubChem: 17100) 0aWine aroma 0a3-Methyl-3-sulfanyl butanol (PubChem: 520682) 0aesters 0aSensory analysis 0aIsopentanoic acid (PubChem: 3085367) 0aArtificially botrytized grapes 0aγ-Nonalactone (PubChem: 7710) 0aEthyl isovalerate (PubChem: 7945) 0aγ-Decalactone (PubChem: 12813) 0aEthyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (PubChem: 8434) 0a2-Nonanone (PubChem: 13187) 0a3-Sulfanylhexanol (PubChem: 521348)1 aTao, Yong-sheng1 aWu, Yun1 aAn, Rong-yan1 aYue, Zhuo-ya0 tFood chemistry.g2017 July 01, v. 226 p.41-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008800162300001800250520170200268592002801970650001701998650001302015650001302028650002602041650001102067650003002078650001402108650001502122650000902137650002202146650001602168651001102184700001802195700001602213700001902229700001402248700002202262700001902284700001802303700002402321773012102345856008102466852000902547655001202556IND60523392320221117183002.0160616e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052339232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2712-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChew, Paul12aA study on the genetic relationships of Avena taxa and the origins of hexaploid oat  ap. 1405-1415.  aKEY MESSAGE : Using next-generation DNA sequencing, it was possible to clarify the genetic relationships of Avena species and deduce the likely pathway from which hexaploid oat was formed by sequential polyploidization events. A sequence-based diversity study was conducted on a representative sample of accessions from species in the genus Avena using genotyping-by-sequencing technology. The results show that all Avena taxa can be assigned to one of four major genetic clusters: Cluster 1 = all hexaploids including cultivated oat, Cluster 2 = AC genome tetraploids, Cluster 3 = C genome diploids, Cluster 4 = A genome diploid and tetraploids. No evidence was found for the existence of discrete B or D genomes. Through a series of experiments involving the creation of in silico polyploids, it was possible to deduce that hexaploid oat likely formed by the fusion of an ancestral diploid species from Cluster 3 (A. clauda, A. eriantha) with an ancestral diploid species from Cluster 4D (A. longiglumis, A. canariensis, A. wiestii) to create the ancestral tetraploid from Cluster 2 (A. magna, A. murphyi, A. insularis). Subsequently, that ancestral tetraploid fused again with another ancestral diploid from Cluster 4D to create hexaploid oat. Based on the geographic distribution of these species, it is hypothesized that both the tetraploidization and hexaploidization events may have occurred in the region of northwest Africa, followed by radiation of hexaploid oat to its current worldwide distribution. The results from this study shed light not only on the origins of this important grain crop, but also have implications for germplasm collection and utilization in oat breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3abreeding 3adiploidy 3agenetic relationships 3agenome 3ageographical distribution 3agermplasm 3ahexaploidy 3aoats 3asequence analysis 3atetraploidy 3aAfrica1 aMeade, Kendra1 aHayes, Alec1 aHarjes, Carlos1 aBao, Yong1 aBeattie, Aaron D.1 aPuddephat, Ian1 aGusmini, Gabe1 aTanksley, Steven D.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 July, v. 129, no. 7 p.1405-1415dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-016-2712-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01650naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245008600173300001100259520055900270592002800829650002500857650001300882650001200895650002200907650001500929650002000944700002000964700002100984700001601005700001901021700001901040700001801059773011901077856008301196852000901279655001201288IND60740767220221119213538.0220109e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074076722DNAL7 a10.1186/s13765-021-00618-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Trong Nguyen10aNew dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.)

This paper uses a scoping review to assess the current evidence on pathways between gender equality, women’s empowerment, and food systems. The paper uses an adaptation of the food systems framework to organize the evidence and identify where evidence is strong, and where gaps remain. Results show strong evidence on women’s differing access to resources, shaped and reinforced by contextual social gender norms, and on links between women’s empowerment and maternal education and important outcomes, such as nutrition and dietary diversity. However, evidence is limited on issues such as gender considerations in food systems for women in urban areas and in aquaculture value chains, best practices and effective pathways for engaging men in the process of women’s empowerment in food systems, and for addressing issues related to migration, crises, and whether local food systems food systems are more empowering to women. And while there are gender informed evaluation studies that examine the effectiveness of gender- and nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs, evidence to indicate the long-term sustainability of such impacts remains limited. The paper recommends keys areas for investment: improving women’s leadership and decision-making in food systems, promoting equal and positive gender norms, improving access to resources, and building cross-contextual research evidence on gender and food systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquaculture 3adecision making 3adiet 3aeducation 3afood security 3agender 3aleadership 0aFood systems 0aGender equality 0aWomen’s empowerment1 aEissler, Sarah1 aMalapit, Hazel1 aMeinzen-Dick, Ruth1 aBryan, Elizabeth1 aQuisumbing, Agnes0 tGlobal food security.g2022 June, v. 33 p.100622-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2022.1006223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007000163300001600233520105800249592002801307650000901335650001101344650001501355650001601370650001701386650001101403650000701414650000901421650002301430650001401453700002101467700002801488773012101516856008101637852000901718655001201727IND60575475220221119171954.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057547522DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-014-0262-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaritha, V.10aAnalysis and optimization of coagulation and flocculation process  ap. 451-460.  aNatural coagulants have been the focus of research of many investigators through the last decade owing to the problems caused by the chemical coagulants. Optimization of process parameters is vital for the effectiveness of coagulation process. In the present study optimization of parameters like pH, dose of coagulant and mixing speed were studied using natural coagulants sago and chitin in comparison with alum. Jar test apparatus was used to perform the coagulation. The results showed that the removal of turbidity was up to 99 % by both alum and chitin at lower doses of coagulant, i.e., 0.1–0.3 g/L, whereas sago has shown a reduction of 70–100 % at doses of 0.1 and 0.2 g/L. The optimum conditions observed for sago were 6 and 7 whereas chitin was stable at all pH ranges, lower coagulant doses, i.e., 0.1–0.3 g/L and mixing speed—rapid mixing at 100 rpm for 10 min and slow mixing 20 rpm for 20 min. Hence, it can be concluded that sago and chitin can be used for treating water even with large seasonal variation in turbidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalum 3achitin 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3aflocculation 3amixing 3apH 3asago 3aseasonal variation 3aturbidity1 aŚrīnivās, N.,1 aSrikanth Vuppala, N.

Previously we developed stably transfected Drosophila S2 clones to produce HIV-1 virus-like particles (VLP) and demonstrated that priming mice twice with DNA plasmids encoding HIV-1 gp120 and gag and boosting twice with HIV-1 VLP (i.e. DDVV immunization) elicited both envelope-specific antibody and envelope and gag-specific CD8 T cell responses. However, the potency and the breadth of immunogenicity still need to be improved. In this study we tested the effect of in vivo EP during DNA priming on immunogenicity of this DNA-VLP prime-boost regimen. Here we report that although both DDVV and DDVV+EP elicited gp120-specific ELISA-binding antibody responses, average EC50 values of gp120-specific ELISA-binding total IgG, IgG2a, but not IgG1, antibody responses were significantly higher in DDVV+EP than in DDVV. Moreover, while DDVV elicited neutralizing antibody responses against autologous, but not other five, strains tested, DDVV+EP not only elicited significantly higher anti-autologous neutralizing antibody responses, but also cross-neutralizes four of five other HIV-1 strains tested, including two tier 2 strains. Finally, although CD4 and CD8 T cells from both DDVV and DDVV+EP immunizations secreted IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α upon HIV-1 envelope peptide stimulation, average HIV-1 envelope-specific CD8 T cells that secreted IFN-γ, IL-2 and/or TNF-α were significantly higher in DDVV+EP than in DDVV. Thus we conclude that DDVV+EP immunization preferentially increases HIV-1 envelope-specific TH1 cytokine-mediated IgG2a responses and significantly enhances the potency and the breadth of neutralizing antibody responses including tier 2 viruses. Further study on this heterologous regimen in large animals is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aDrosophila 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aelectroporation 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-2 3amedian effective concentration 3amice 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aplasmids 3arecombinant vaccines 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avirus-like particles 3aviruses 0aHeterologous prime-boost vaccination 0aIn vivo electroporation 0aHIV-1 0aIgG subclasses 0aNeutralizing antibody 0aT cell responses 0aEP 0aDDVV 0aVLP 0aRB 0ac-di-GMP 0aTCA 0aBSA 0aSHIV1 aZhu, Qianqian1 aHuang, Xiaoxing1 aYang, Lifei1 aSong, Yufeng1 aZhu, Ping1 aZhou, Boc(Lawyer)0 tVaccine.g2017 Apr. 11, v. 35, no. 16 p.2042-2051dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04307naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100003600166245018700202300001400389520194100403592002802344650001902372650002602391650001202417650001302429650001202442650002002454650002102474650001502495650001402510650001102524650001602535650001702551650000902568650001402577650001402591650001202605650001302617650002002630650002702650650001802677650004002695650004202735650004102777650005302818650002002871650002502891650005202916650004802968650002903016650003903045650004903084650001303133650003203146650003803178700003203216700002603248700003303274700002903307700003003336700003803366773010103404856008303505852000903588655001203597IND4473387620221121091132.0141111e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447338762DNAL7 a219032952pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Rocha, Iza Marineves Almeida10aExogenous ornithine is an effective precursor and the δ-ornithine amino transferase pathway contributes to proline accumulation under high N recycling in salt-stressed cashew leaves  ap. 41-49.  aThe role of the δ-ornithine amino transferase (OAT) pathway in proline synthesis is still controversial and was assessed in leaves of cashew plants subjected to salinity. The activities of enzymes and the concentrations of metabolites involved in proline synthesis were examined in parallel with the capacity of exogenous ornithine and glutamate to induce proline accumulation. Proline accumulation was best correlated with OAT activity, which increased 4-fold and was paralleled by NADH oxidation coupled to the activities of OAT and Δ¹-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR), demonstrating the potential of proline synthesis via OAT/P5C. Overall, the activities of GS, GOGAT and aminating GDH remained practically unchanged under salinity. The activity of P5CR did not respond to NaCl whereas Δ¹-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase was sharply repressed by salinity. We suggest that if the export of P5C from the mitochondria to the cytosol is possible, its subsequent conversion to proline by P5CR may be important. In a time-course experiment, proline accumulation was associated with disturbances in amino acid metabolism as indicated by large increases in the concentrations of ammonia, free amino acids, glutamine, arginine and ornithine. Conversely, glutamate concentrations increased moderately and only within the first 24h. Exogenous feeding of ornithine as a precursor was very effective in inducing proline accumulation in intact plants and leaf discs, in which proline concentrations were several times higher than glutamate-fed or salt-treated plants. Our data suggest that proline accumulation might be a consequence of salt-induced increase in N recycling, resulting in increased levels of ornithine and other metabolites involved with proline synthesis and OAT activity. Under these metabolic circumstances the OAT pathway might contribute significantly to proline accumulation in salt-stressed cashew leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aamino acid metabolism 3aammonia 3aarginine 3acytosol 3aenzyme activity 3afree amino acids 3aglutamates 3aglutamine 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3aoats 3aornithine 3aoxidation 3aproline 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 2aAnacardiumxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Assays 2aGlutamate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aGlutamate Synthase (NADH)xmetabolism 2aGlutamate-Ammonia Ligasexmetabolism 2aGlutamatesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aNADxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOrnithinexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aOrnithine-Oxo-Acid Transaminasexmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aProlinexbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aPyrroline Carboxylate Reductasesxmetabolism 2aSalinity 2aSalt Tolerancexphysiology. 2aStress, Physiologicalxphysiology1 aVitorello, Victor Alexandre1 aSilva, Jamille Santos1 aFerreira-Silva, Sérgio Luiz1 aViégas, Ricardo Almeida1 aSilva, Evandro Nascimento1 aSilveira, Joaquim Albenisio Gomes0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 169, no. 1 p.41-49dElsevier GmbHx0176-16177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245007700211300002000288500001900308520098100327592002801308650001101336650001601347650001601363650002001379650001301399650002401412650001401436650001301450650002301463650002101486650001701507650000901524650001601533773015401549856008301703852000901786655001201795IND60736577920221121094356.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073657792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12111-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdollahi, Rohollah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2680-344510aImpact of wind on strength and deformation of solar photovoltaic modules  ap. 21589-21598.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMaritime transport is one of the most important modes of transportation and plays an important role in facilitating world trade. In recent years, the maritime transport industry has been required to comply with “low carbon” policies. To meet the “low carbon shipping” policies, solar energy as a source of renewable energy has attracted more attention in the shipping industry. Photovoltaic solar panels, which to generate ships’ electricity, are always vulnerable to wind damage because they are mounted on deck. At present, they do not provide comprehensive guidelines for reducing the impact of wind on photovoltaic structures. The present study contributes to the evaluation of the deformation and robustness of photovoltaic module under ocean wind load according to the standard of IEC 61215 using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The effect of wind on photovoltaic panels is analyzed for three speeds of 32 m per second (m/s), 42 m/s, and 50 m/s.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adeformation 3aelectricity 3afluid mechanics 3aindustry 3ainternational trade 3apollution 3aresearch 3asea transportation 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3awind 3awind damage0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 17 p.21589-21598dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12111-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245008600191300001600277520136000293592002801653653000901681653002201690653001101712653002201723653002201745653002201767653002301789653001501812700002401827700002301851700002301874773011301897856011702010852000902127655001202136IND60128654020221120055817.0151116e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012865402DNAL7 a10.1644/1545-1542(2005)086[0670:LSOAOT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehmeier, Ryan L.10aLong-term study of abundance of the hispid cotton rat in native tallgrass prairie  ap. 670-676.  aWe studied patterns of and factors influencing abundance of hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) in tallgrass prairie habitats from autumn 1981 to spring 2001 at the Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas. Abundance of cotton rats was low during autumn (X̄ == 0.57 individuals/trapline) and extremely low in spring (X̄ == 0.04 individuals/trapline). Autumn abundance varied widely in 20 years (range: 0.00––2.50 individuals/trapline) and among 14 sites (0.05––1.35 individuals/trapline). Spring prairie fires had a positive influence on cotton rats during the 1st (X̄ == 0.8 individuals/trapline) and 2nd autumns (X̄ == 1.0 individuals/trapline), but not during the 3rd or later autumns (X̄ == 0.2 individuals/trapline). Cotton rats were associated strongly with lowland prairie relative to breaks and upland prairie. Autumn abundance was correlated positively with previous winter (December––February) average maximum temperature, but was not correlated with previous winter precipitation, summer (June––August) average maximum temperature, summer precipitation, or aboveground net primary productivity. Although previous winter maximum temperature accounted for only 32%% of interautumn variation in abundance, winter harshness appears to be the major factor driving temporal variation in autumn abundance of hispid cotton rats.  aPublisher supplied data 0afire 0ahispid cotton rat 0aKansas 0aSigmodon hispidus 0aspatial variation 0atallgrass prairie 0atemporal variation 0atopography1 aKaufman, Glennis A.1 aKaufman, Donald W.1 aMcMillan, Brock R.0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2005 Aug., v. 86, no. 4 p.670-676dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F1545-1542%282005%29086%5B0670%3ALSOAOT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245014100211300001800352500001100370506007600381520099700457592002801454506003701482650001801519650001301537650003501550650001101585650004201596650002001638650001701658700002201675700002501697700001601722700001701738700001601755773012801771856008101899852000901980655001201989IND60523392520221207084629.0160616e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052339252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-016-9549-12doi7 aPMC49098022pmcid7 a271002282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolst-Jensen, Arne10aApplication of whole genome shotgun sequencing for detection and characterization of genetically modified organisms and derived products  ap. 4595-4614.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe emergence of high-throughput, massive or next-generation sequencing technologies has created a completely new foundation for molecular analyses.

Such approaches, however, inevitably introduce a bias and are prone to miss unknown targets. Here we review the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies and the preparation of fit-for-purpose whole genome shotgun sequencing libraries for the detection and characterization of genetically modified and derived products. The potential impact of these new sequencing technologies for the characterization, breeding selection, risk assessment, and traceability of genetically modified organisms and genetically modified products is yet to be fully acknowledged.

The developed method is then being applied to study the solute travel times to ditch drains originating from a field being subjected to a uniform (1) recharge and (2) ponding field over the surface of the soil. For case (1), both single and layered soils are being considered to estimate the travel times. The developed mathematical procedure is simple to use, robust, reasonably accurate even if being used with a lesser division of a streamline and completely eliminates the necessity of determination of any integrals for estimating the travel times—integrals which, in the methods generally been employed for estimating the travel times from steady-state analytical groundwater models, would otherwise need be evaluated. The study shows that travel times of water particles traversing through a layered soil being subjected to a uniform recharge at the surface are sensitive to the directional conductivities, anisotropy ratio (defined here as the ratio between horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities of soil) and thickness of individual layers of a soil profile as well as to the magnitude of the steady-state recharge on the surface of the soil. For the ponded drainage scenarios also, directional conductivities and thickness of a soil profile, extent of partial penetration and width of the ditch drains, levels of water head at the surface of the soil as well as on the ditches are observed to influence the travel times in a noticeable way. The proposed method is important as it provides simple and accurate estimations of migration times of pollutants to subsurface drains under different drainage situations; it can also be used to assess the time of reclamation of a salt-affected or waterlogged soil being drained by a network of subsurface drains being installed for the purpose from the available hydraulic theory relevant to the concerned drainage situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3ahydrologic models 3alayered soils 3apollutants 3asoil profiles 3asolutes1 aPatidar, M.

Reduction of the green pigment by ascorbic acid or NaBH₄ gave a yellow product, which readily turn green and then blue in air. The reduced and acetylated product of the green pigment was identified to be a novel trihydroxy benzacridine derivative, and the yellowish ethanol solution of this product immediately turned green upon addition of butyl amine or diluted alkali. Therefore, the green pigment was assumed to be an oxidized quinone type product of trihydroxy benzacridine. This identification of the structure was supported by the correspondence of the measured absorption spectra with those calculated by the molecular orbital method. A possible charge transfer complex between products of different oxidation steps in green solution was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctium lappa 3aabsorption 3aaeration 3aair 3aascorbic acid 3abiotechnology 3acaffeic acid 3achlorogenic acid 3acondensation reactions 3aethanol 3aoxidation 3aquinones 3asweet potatoes 0agreen pigment 0acaffeic acid ester 0aamino compound 0abenzacridine derivative1 aKOIZUMI, Yukimichi1 aNAMIKI, Kazuko1 aHIDA, Mitsuhiko1 aNAMIKI, Mitsuo0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 10 p.2121-2130dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.21213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245014400160300001800304500001400322520100000336592002801336650001301364650001801377650001701395650002101412650001801433650001401451653001801465653002301483653001901506653000801525653001701533700001701550700002301567700001701590773018501607856007501792852000901867655001201876IND60691904620221120065415.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069190462DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.21312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNAMIKI, Mitsuo10aDevelopment of Free Radical Products during the Greening Reaction of Caffeic Acid Esters (or Chlorogenic Acid) and a Primary Amino Compound  ap. 2131-2136.  aNAL-light  aESR spectra were measured directly on a marked greening reaction mixture of Et-caffeate and a primary amino compound in alkali solution under aeration. A clear hyperfine structure was commonly detected early in the greening reaction with different amino compounds. Its hyperfine spectrum split into seven peaks was analyzed and found to be due to the oxidized free radical product of the Et-caffeate using an authentic sample system. Another type of hyperfine ESR spectrum was observed later in the reaction, and was altered with different amino compounds. The hyperfine structure for n-butylamine split into 12 lines. The latter type of free radical products were assumed to be a semiquinone type radical compounds of the trihydroxy benzacridine derivative, which was identified as the principal structure of the green and yellow pigments formed by this greening reaction system. A formation mechanism of the green pigment and related products involving these free radical products is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3abiotechnology 3acaffeic acid 3achlorogenic acid 3afree radicals 3aoxidation 0agreen pigment 0acaffeic acid ester 0aamino compound 0aESR 0afree radical1 aYABUTA, Goro1 aKOIZUMI, Yukimichi1 aYANO, Midori0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 10 p.2131-2136dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.21313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03888naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014300168300001400311500001100325520222500336592002802561650000802589650001302597650001102610650001202621650001902633650001602652650001702668650001602685650002502701650001502726650002102741650001102762650001302773650001102786650000902797650001102806650000902817650002002826650002002846650001202866650001502878650002502893650002002918650001802938650001902956650001602975650001002991651001103001651002203012700002103034700002203055773011903077856008103196852000903277655001203286IND60575475420221119172851.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057547542DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-014-0263-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBajjali, William10aWater quality and geochemistry evaluation of groundwater upstream and downstream of the Khirbet Al-Samra wastewater treatment plant/Jordan  ap. 53-69.  aReview  aGroundwater in the northeastern Amman-Zarqa basin is an important source of water for irrigation. The quality and quantity of water has deteriorated due to mismanagement and misunderstanding of the hydrogeological system. Overexploitation of groundwater resources upstream of the Khirbet Al-Samra wastewater treatment plant (KSWTP) has lowered the water table 43 m since the beginning of groundwater development in 1968. Heavy pumping of groundwater downstream of KSWTP has not dropped the water level due to constant recharge from the Zarqa river bed. The water level of groundwater is rising continuously at a rate of 20 cm per year since building the KSWTP in 1985. Groundwater salinity has also shifted the quality of the aquifer from fresh to brackish. Continual irrigation from the groundwater upstream of KSWTP dissolves accumulated salt from the soil formed by evaporation, and the contaminated water infiltrates back to the aquifer, thereby increasing both salt and nitrate concentrations. The intense irrigation from the reclaimed water downstream of KSWTP and leakage of treated wastewater from the Zarqa River to the shallow groundwater is a secondary source of salt and nitrates. The isotopic composition of groundwater varies over a wide range and is associated with the meteoric water line affected by Mediterranean Sea air moisture. The isotopic composition of groundwater is represented by evaporation line (EL) with a low slope of 3.6. The enrichment of groundwater in δ¹⁸O and δD is attributed mainly to the two processes of evaporation before infiltration of return flow and mixing of different types of water in KSWTP originating from different aquifers. The EL starts from a location more depleted than the weighted mean value of the Amman rainfall station on the Eastern Meteoric Water Line indicating that the recharge took place under the climate regime prevailing today in Jordan and the recharge of the groundwater originates from a greater elevation than that of the Amman station. Elevated high tritium levels observed in wells in close proximity to a regional fault system signify local recharge and short residence time. The Khaldyia dam is a local source for groundwater recharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaquifers 3abasins 3aclimate 3adrainage water 3aevaporation 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3amixing 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3arain 3arivers 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3astream channels 3atritium 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater salinity 3awater table 3awells 3aJordan 3aMediterranean Sea1 aAl-Hadidi, Kheir1 aIsmail, Ma’mmon0 tApplied water science.g2017 Mar., v. 7, no. 1 p.53-69dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-014-0263-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245012000166300001800286500001900304520151400323592002801837650002401865650002301889650001701912650001801929650001601947650001701963650002301980650001702003650001502020650002102035650001802056650001802074650002402092650000902116650001002125650001602135650000802151653001602159653002402175653002002199653002302219700001702242700002002259773018502279856007502464852000902539655001202548IND60691904720221120052447.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069190472DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.21372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKUNISHIRO, Kazuyoshi10aEffects of Rooibos Tea Extract on Antigen-specific Antibody Production and Cytokine Generation in Vitro and in Vivo  ap. 2137-2145.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRooibos tea contains a large amount of flavonoids and acts as a potent antioxidant. In this study, we examined the effects of Rooibos tea extract on antigenspecific antibody production and cytokine generation in vitro and in vivo. The primary in vitro anti-ovalbumin (anti-OVA) or sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody production in murine splenocytes was markedly stimulated by the addition of the tea extract at concentrations of 1-100 μg/ml. On the other hand, a nonspecific antibody response elicited with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in purified splenic B-cells was not modified by the extract. Rooibos tea extract caused an increase in the generation of interleukin 2 (IL-2) both in OVA- and anti-CD3-primed splenocytes at concentrations ranging from 10 μg/ml to 1000 μg/ml. In contrast, this tea extract suppressed the generation of interleukin 4 (IL-4) in OVA-primed splenocytes. Moreover, the reduction of OVA-induced antibody production in serum of the cyclosporin A (CyA)-treated rats can be significantly restored and the IL-2 generation in murine splenocytes was stimulated, following oral administrations of Rooibos tea extract. Thus, our findings suggested that Rooibos tea extract may facilitate the antigen-specific antibody production through selective augmentation of IL-2 generation both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, Rooibos tea intake may be of value in prophylaxis of the diseases involving a severe defect in Th1 immune response such as cancer, allergy, AIDS, and other infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspalathus linearis 3aantibody formation 3aantioxidants 3abiotechnology 3ablood serum 3acyclosporine 3adisease prevention 3aerythrocytes 3aflavonoids 3ahypersensitivity 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3alipopolysaccharides 3amice 3asheep 3asplenocytes 3atea 0aRooibos tea 0aantibody production 0aIL-2 generation 0amurine splenocytes1 aTAI, Akihiro1 aYAMAMOTO, Itaru0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 10 p.2137-2145dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.21373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245020500211300002000416500001900436520173100455592002802186596006102214650003002275650001202305650002602317650001202343650001402355650003302369650001702402650001302419650002002432651001402452700003002466700002202496700002602518700002502544773015402569856008302723852000902806655001202815IND60736578320221121094336.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073657832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12024-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapranov, Sergey V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5614-065X10aSex- and sexual maturation-related aspects of the element accumulation in soft tissues of the bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam. collected off coasts of Sevastopol (southwestern Crimea, Black Sea)  ap. 21553-21576.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMussels are widely used to monitor trace element pollution, but the role of their sex and sexual maturation in the element accumulation was not comprehensively studied and the number of elements under consideration never exceeded three dozen. In this work, concentrations of 67 elements in different tissues of females and males of the Mediterranean mussel are determined. Statistically significant differences are obtained in the element composition of analogous tissues of mussel males and females and in gonads of the same sex at different sexual maturation stages. The significantly higher concentrations of some elements found in gonads of females (Mn, Zn, As) and males (P) at most of the sexual maturation stages suggest essentiality of these elements in the reproduction. Elements exhibit several accumulation patterns in gonads during the ripening, with the most general one being the accumulation after spawning. Indications of a new phenomenon of circulation of most elements in gonads over the reproductive cycle are obtained, with the element concentrations decreasing at the first two stages and increasing at the posterior stages. Principal component analysis shows that the differences in the element accumulation are mainly due to the element uptake pathways and sexual differentiation. The most important identified factors determining the decrease in concentrations of tissue elements are their redistribution over mussel’s body, biomass dilution, sequestration, and release with gametes. Five detected non-overlapping clusters of the non-normalized element concentrations in the pooled mussel tissues are associated with macroelements, two groups of trace elements, and two groups of ultratrace elements.  aPublisher supplied data  aAAAA-18-118021350003-6cRussian Academy of Sciences (RU) 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3abiomass 3aelemental composition 3amussels 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3areproduction 3aresearch 3asexual maturity 3aBlack Sea1 aKaravantseva, Nadezhda V.1 aBobko, Nikolay I.1 aRyabushko, Vitaliy I.1 aKapranova, Larisa L.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 17 p.21553-21576dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12024-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012300169300001800292500001900310520086200329592002801191596010201219596008801321650002401409650001801433650001801451650001001469650001201479650001301491650001601504650002601520653002201546653002001568653000901588653002401597653002201621700001501643700001901658700001601677700001601693700001401709773013901723856008501862852000901947655001201956IND60692778520221118223549.0200503e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069277852DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2016.11965752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Tingting10aProtoplast mutant selection of Glarea Lozoyensis and statistical optimization of medium for pneumocandin B₀ yield-up  ap. 2241-2246.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA combination of microbial strain improvement and statistical optimization is investigated to maximize pneumocandin B₀ production from Glarea lozoyensis ATCC 74030.

The results of this study indicated the combined application of a classical mutation and medium optimization can improve effectively pneumocandin B₀ production from G. lozoyensis and could be a tool to improve other secondary metabolites production by fungal strains.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 21306084cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNo. 21225626cNational Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China 3aambient temperature 3abiotechnology 3aechinocandins 3afungi 3amutants 3amutation 3aprotoplasts 3asecondary metabolites 0aGlarea lozoyensis 0apneumocandin B0 0aARTP 0amedium optimization 0aorthogonal arrays1 aSong, Ping1 aWang, Xiaoting1 aJi, Xiaojun1 aRen, Lujing1 aHuang, He0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 Nov. 1, v. 80, no. 11 p.2241-2246dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2016.11965753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013300170520099700303592002801300650002101328650001701349650001501366650001801381650001301399650001601412653001401428653000901442653001801451653003101469653003601500700002301536700002501559700002001584700002001604773009401624856008401718852000901802655001201811IND60770903020221118230849.0221004e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077090302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2022.1026622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, Popik14aThe study of fluorescence features of microalgae from the genus Pseudo-nitzschia and the possibility of their detection in water  aThis article presents the fluorescent characteristics of eight microalgae cultures of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. We show that the normalized fluorescence temperature curves of the studied Pseudo-nitzschia cultures are very similar. Due to this similarity, the authors obtained the “passport” characteristic, averaged on the measured characteristics, which with high accuracy approximates the fluorescence temperature curves of each studied species of Pseudo-nitzschia algae. The similarity indexes between the fluorescence temperature curves of each test sample and the passport curve were obtained using the modernized cosine method. The authors introduce the concept of the scaling factor α, which allows for achieving a reliable determination of the presence/absence of Pseudo-nitzschia microalgae both in monoculture samples and in samples from two cultures. The article shows the possibility of determining Pseudo-nitzschia microalgae in a mixture of two cultures with 10% content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudo-nitzschia 3afluorescence 3amicroalgae 3amodernization 3aresearch 3atemperature 0aRed tides 0aHABs 0aChlorophyll-a 0aLaser-induced fluorescence 0aFluorescence temperature curves1 aEvgeniy, Gamayunov1 aSergey, Voznesenskiy1 aZhanna, Markina1 aTatiana, Orlova0 tAlgal research.g2022 May, v. 64 p.102662-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2022.1026623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245017000182300001600352520111000368536005501478592002801533596001901561650001201580650001501592650001301607650001201620650001201632650001501644650001501659650001001674650003001684650001701714650001101731650001101742650001501753650001301768650001201781651001101793653001201804653001101816653003101827653001701858653001701875653001001892700002501902700002301927700002701950700002801977700003202005700002802037773010502065856008602170852000902256655001202265IND60675940820221118230635.0201223e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067594082DNAL7 a10.1080/14888386.2019.16649312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDantas, Silionamã Pereira10aNew distribution records from the Brazilian Cerrado and species distribution modelling of Boana crepitans, Lithobates palmipes, Pipa pipa, and Micrurus h. hemprichii  ap. 149-160.  aEven though the herpetofauna richness in the Cerrado – a vast tropical savanna ecoregion of Brazil – is one of the highest of all Brazilian biomes, it still needs to be thoroughly investigated. This study reports the first records of the emerald-eyed tree frog (Boana crepitans), amazon waterfrog (Lithobates palmipes), star-fingered frog (Pipa pipa), and hemprich’s coral snake (Micrurus hemprichii hemprichii) within the states of Maranhão in the northeastern region and Tocantins in the northern region of Brazil. The first state records of Boana crepitans, Pipa pipa and Micrurus h. hemprichii in Tocantins, and Lithobates palmipes in Maranhão, appear in highly climatically suitable areas within the Species Extent of Occurrences (EOO), as predicted in Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM). Our new records of Pipa pipa and Micrurus h. hemprichii, compared to the ENM predictions, represent their southeastern distributional range limits. Our results also suggest that the current gaps on the distributional species ranges probably result from the lack of herpetological surveys in those regions.  aThis work was not supported by any Funding Agency.  aPublisher supplied data  cFunding Agency 3aHylidae 3aLithobates 3aMicrurus 3aPipidae 3acerrado 3aecoregions 3aecosystems 3afrogs 3ageographical distribution 3aherpetofauna 3amodels 3aniches 3aprediction 3asavannas 3asurveys 3aBrazil 0aAnurans 0aBrazil 0aecological niche modelling 0afilling gaps 0aherpetofauna 0asnake1 aTavares, Helane Dias1 aPascoal, Wanieulli1 aSaviato, Mário Junior1 aÁvila, Robson Waldemar1 aVasconcelos, Tiago Silveira1 aOda, Fabrício Hiroiuki0 tBiodiversity.g2019 Oct. 2, v. 20, no. 4 p.149-160dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19681x2160-06517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14888386.2019.16649313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03785naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245014300213300001100356520237800367592002802745650002502773650001502798650001902813650001902832650002002851650002002871650001802891650001002909650001502919650001502934650002102949650001402970650002202984700002303006700001703029700002403046700002203070700001703092700003603109773010203145856008303247852000903330655001203339IND60740767720221119213435.0220805e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074076772DNAL7 a10.1186/s40462-021-00265-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickinson, Eleanor R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5183-504910aLimitations of using surrogates for behaviour classification of accelerometer data: refining methods using random forest models in Caprids  ap. 28.  aBACKGROUND: Animal-attached devices can be used on cryptic species to measure their movement and behaviour, enabling unprecedented insights into fundamental aspects of animal ecology and behaviour. However, direct observations of subjects are often still necessary to translate biologging data accurately into meaningful behaviours. As many elusive species cannot easily be observed in the wild, captive or domestic surrogates are typically used to calibrate data from devices. However, the utility of this approach remains equivocal. METHODS: Here, we assess the validity of using captive conspecifics, and phylogenetically-similar domesticated counterparts (surrogate species) for calibrating behaviour classification. Tri-axial accelerometers and tri-axial magnetometers were used with behavioural observations to build random forest models to predict the behaviours. We applied these methods using captive Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) and a domestic counterpart, pygmy goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), to predict the behaviour including terrain slope for locomotion behaviours of captive Alpine ibex. RESULTS: Behavioural classification of captive Alpine ibex and domestic pygmy goats was highly accurate (> 98%). Model performance was reduced when using data split per individual, i.e., classifying behaviour of individuals not used to train models (mean ± sd = 56.1 ± 11%). Behavioural classifications using domestic counterparts, i.e., pygmy goat observations to predict ibex behaviour, however, were not sufficient to predict all behaviours of a phylogenetically similar species accurately (> 55%). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate methods to refine the use of random forest models to classify behaviours of both captive and free-living animal species. We suggest there are two main reasons for reduced accuracy when using a domestic counterpart to predict the behaviour of a wild species in captivity; domestication leading to morphological differences and the terrain of the environment in which the animals were observed. We also identify limitations when behaviour is predicted in individuals that are not used to train models. Our results demonstrate that biologging device calibration needs to be conducted using: (i) with similar conspecifics, and (ii) in an area where they can perform behaviours on terrain that reflects that of species in the wild.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra hircus aegarus 3aCapra ibex 3aaccelerometers 3aanimal ecology 3acaptive animals 3acryptic species 3adomestication 3agoats 3alandscapes 3alocomotion 3amodel validation 3aphylogeny 3atopographic slope1 aTwining, Joshua P.1 aWilson, Rory1 aStephens, Philip A.1 aWestander, Jennie1 aMarks, Nikki1 aScantlebury, D.

This study was designed to evaluate the phytochemical composition, antioxidant, α-amylase, and tyrosinase inhibitory activity of ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extracts of Campanula macrostachya Waldst. & Kit. ex Willd. Chemical compositions were analyzed by spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods. Antioxidant activities of the samples were tested by using five different test systems. Enzyme inhibitory activities of the extracts were also studied. As a result of the LC–ESI–MS/MS analyses, chlorogenic acid, hesperidin, and hyperoside were found to be the major compounds of the extracts, especially the MeOH extract (6559.59, 2499.22, and 2047.66 μg/g extract, respectively). Antioxidant activity tests have proven that MeOH extract showed higher activity than others (DPPH: 4.15 mg/mL, ABTS: 2.05 mg/mL, CUPRAC: 1.80 mg/mL, FRAP: 0.83 mg/mL, phosphomolybdenum: 1.69 mg/mL). Ferrous ion chelating activity of the water extract was 1.03 mg/mL. In α-amylase and tyrosinase inhibitory assays, EtOAc (IC₅₀: 2.54 mg/mL) and MeOH (IC₅₀: 1.51 mg/mL) extracts showed higher activity than the others did. In phosphomolybdenum, CUPRAC, FRAP, and tyrosinase inhibitory assays, the activity was strongly correlated with flavonoids, chlorogenic acid, hesperidin, and hyperoside. On the other hand, phenolic compounds have been found to contribute more to radical scavenging activity. Pearson correlation analysis showed that phenolics and flavonoids were not responsible for the α-amylase inhibitory activity of EtOAc extract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampanula 3aalpha-amylase 3aanti-allergic agents 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achemical constituents of plants 3achlorogenic acid 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aethyl acetate 3ahesperidin 3aliquid chromatography 3amethanol 3aparasympatholytics 3apollution 3aresearch1 aSarikurkcu, Rifat Tayyib1 aTepe, Bektas0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 17 p.21812-21822dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11695-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245013500177300001600312520101000328592002801338650002401366650002201390650002601412650001601438650001101454650001801465650002101483650001101504650002301515650001701538650001501555653000701570653000801577653000701585653001501592653000901607653000801616653000701624653000701631653000801638653001301646653000901659653000801668653000801676653000901684653002401693653002701717653002301744653002001767653002101787653001301808700002501821700001901846700002601865700002301891700001601914700001901930700001801949700002201967700002601989700002202015773010002037856008702137852000902224655001202233IND60561860320221119232818.0190402e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056186032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemachandran, Hridya10aUnraveling the inhibition mechanism of cyanidin-3-sophoroside on polyphenol oxidase and its effect on enzymatic browning of apples  ap. 102-110.  aThe hunt for anti-browning agents in the food and agricultural industries aims to minimize nutritional loss and prolong post harvest storage. In the present study, the effect of cyanidin-3-sophoroside (CS) from Garcinia mangostana rind, on polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity was investigated. The non-competitive inhibition mode of CS was determined by Lineweaver Burk plot. CS forms a ground-state complex by quenching the intrinsic fluorescence of PPO. The static quenching was temperature-dependent with an activation energy of 4.654±0.1091kJmol−1 to withstand the disruption of amino acid residues of the enzyme binding site. The enzyme conformational change was validated by 3D fluorescence and CD spectrum. Docking (binding energy −8.124kcal/mol) and simulation studies confirmed the binding pattern and stability. CS decreased PPO activity and browning index of fresh cut apples and prolonged the shelf life. Thus, CS appears to be a promising anti-browning agent to control enzymatic browning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGarcinia mangostana 3aactivation energy 3aagricultural industry 3aamino acids 3aapples 3abinding sites 3acatechol oxidase 3aenergy 3aenzymatic browning 3afluorescence 3ashelf life 0aCS 0aPPO 0aCD 0al-DOPA, (3 0aPVPP 0aBSA 0a3D 0aOD 0aHCl 0aUV–vis 0aFTIR 0aNMR 0aADT 0aRMSD 0aGarcinia mangostana 0aCyanidin-3-sophoroside 0aPolyphenol oxidase 0aNon-competitive 0aStatic quenching 0aBrowning1 aAnantharaman, Amrita1 aMohan, Sankari1 aMohan, Gopalakrishnan1 aKumar, D.

Mice were fed a diet with 30 g/kg sericin for 115 d, and given a weekly injection of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (10 mg/kg body weight) for the initial 10 wk. Dietary supplemental sericin caused a 62% reduction in the incidence of colonic adenoma (P<0.05), but did not affect the incidence of colonic adenocarcinoma. Sericin intake significantly reduced the number of colon adenomas. Consumption of sericin significantly reduced the BrdU labeling index of colonic proliferating cells and the expression of colonic c-myc and c-fos. The levels of colonic 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, 4-hydroxynonenal, and inducible nitric oxide synthase protein were significantly suppressed by sericin. The results suggest that dietary sericin suppresses the development of colon tumors by reducing oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and nitric oxide production.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,2-dimethylhydrazine 3aadenocarcinoma 3aadenoma 3abiotechnology 3abody weight 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3acolon 3adiet 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3asericin 0acolon tumorigenesis1 aSASAKI, Masahiro1 aWATANABE, Hiromitsu1 aKATO, Norihisa0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 10 p.2181-2186dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.21813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245010500193300001600298520137600314592002801690653001301718653000901731653001601740653001301756653002801769653001001797700002101807700002101828773011301849856011701962852000902079655001202088IND60128654920221120055721.0151116e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012865492DNAL7 a10.1644/1545-1542(2005)086[0745:BBABSS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoigt, Christian C.10aBats, bacteria, and bat smell: sex-specific diversity of microbes in a sexually selected scent organ  ap. 745-749.  aMicrobes interfere with the olfactory communication of animals by degrading chemical signals or by adding volatile metabolites. We report on the composition and diversity of the microflora in a sexually selected scent organ, the wing sacs of Saccopteryx bilineata, which are used by males for courting females. Wing sacs lack any glandular tissues. Instead, males clean and refill their wing sacs each day with genital and gular secretions. Females have only a nonfunctional rudiment of this organ. We isolated a total of 40 microbial species with only a moderate overlap in species composition between the sexes. The estimated microbial diversity was significantly lower in males than in females, with a minimum of 52.5 microbial species ±± 5.0 SD in wing sac rudiments of females and 40.3 ±± 4.2 SD in wing sacs of males (jackknife estimates). Males carried on average only 2 out of 40 possible microbial species in their wing sacs. Thus, individual scent profiles of males could originate from individual microflora. The daily routine of wing sac cleaning and refilling has possibly evolved to control microbial scent degradation, to support an individual microflora involved via volatile metabolites in mate choice, or both. Microbes may play a more prominent role in the evolution of morphological structures and behavioral adaptations than previously envisaged.  aPublisher supplied data 0abacteria 0abats 0amate choice 0amicrobes 0aolfactory communication 0ascent1 aCaspers, Barbara1 aSpeck, Stephanie0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2005 Aug., v. 86, no. 4 p.745-749dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F1545-1542%282005%29086%5B0745%3ABBABSS%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245013700162300001800299520161200317592002801929650000801957650002601965650003401991650001502025650002602040650001702066650002102083650003402104650004302138650004402181650001902225650001402244650001502258700001502273700001602288700001902304700001402323700001202337700001602349773010702365856008402472852000902556655001202565IND60112877620221122034914.0141111e20110916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011287762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Ge10aDirect screening of G-quadruplex ligands from Kalopanax septemlobus (Thunb.) Koidz extract by high performance liquid chromatography  ap. 6433-6438.  aG-quadruplex DNA structure is considered to be a very attractive target for antitumor drug design due to its unique role in maintaining telomerase activities. Therefore, discovering ligands with high stability of G-quadruplex structure is of great interest. In this paper, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for fast screening of G-quadruplex ligands from the crude extract of Kalopanax septemlobus (Thunb.) Koidz, a traditional Chinese medicine. Four potent G-quadruplex ligands were firstly selected through HPLC by comparing the peak profiles and absorption intensity of the crude sample before and after interaction with G-quadruplex DNA. Then the target compounds were isolated and purified by high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) for further confirmation of their stabilities of G-quadruplex by temperature-dependent circular dichroism (CD). Four compounds were isolated and identified as 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (I), chlorogenic acid (II), caffeic acid (III) and 5-feruloylquinic acid (IV) each by MS and NMR. Finally, compound I, II, III were each proved to be potent G-quadruplex ligands by decreasing the peak intensity in HPLC chromatogram after complexation with G-quadruplex, which stabilize G-quadruplex by 7±2°C, 10±2°C, and 3±2°C respectively, based on CD analyses. However, compound IV showed no G-quadruplex stability. The decrease of peak absorption intensity in HPLC chromatogram is the most important signal to find G-quadruplex ligands. This provides a very promising strategy for fast screening G-quadruplex ligands from natural plant extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aKalopanax septemlobus 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aabsorption 3aantineoplastic agents 3acaffeic acid 3achlorogenic acid 3acountercurrent chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant extracts 3ascreening 3atelomerase1 aCao, Xueli1 aZhang, Hong1 aXiang, Junfeng1 aRen, Hong1 aTan, Li1 aTang, Yalin0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Sept. 16, v. 1218, no. 37 p.6433-6438dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245019400161300002000355520103800375592002801413650001301441650002401454650001401478650001301492650001601505700001901521700002101540700002301561700001801584700002401602773013401626856007501760852000901835655001201844IND60540437620221121204625.0160819e20141217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054043762DNAL7 a10.1021/ja509766f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Keiichi10aHighly Enantioselective Organocatalytic Oxidative Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Using Chiral Alkoxyamines as Precatalysts: Catalyst Structure, Active Species, and Substrate Scope  ap. 17591-17600.  aThe development and characterization of enantioselective organocatalytic oxidative kinetic resolution (OKR) of racemic secondary alcohols using chiral alkoxyamines as precatalysts are described. A number of chiral alkoxyamines have been synthesized, and their structure–enantioselectivity correlation study in OKR has led us to identify a promising precatalyst, namely, 7-benzyl-3-n-butyl-4-oxa-5-azahomoadamantane, which affords various chiral aliphatic secondary alcohols (ee up to >99%, kᵣₑₗ up to 296). In a mechanistic study, chlorine-containing oxoammonium species were identified as the active species generated in situ from the alkoxyamine precatalyst, and it was revealed that the chlorine atom is crucial for high reactivity and enantioselectivity. The present OKR is the first successful example applicable to various unactivated aliphatic secondary alcohols, including heterocyclic alcohols with high enantioselectivity, the synthetic application of which is demonstrated by the synthesis of a bioactive compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abioactive compounds 3acatalysts 3achlorine 3aenantiomers1 aSasano, Yusuke1 aTomizawa, Masaki1 aShibuya, Masatoshi1 aKwon, Eunsang1 aIwabuchi, Yoshiharu0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Dec. 17, v. 136, no. 50 p.17591-17600dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja509766f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245009200201300001800293506007600311520107900387592002801466506003701494650002501531650001201556650001701568650003301585650001401618650001301632650001401645650002301659650002101682650001301703650001701716650000901733700002301742700002201765700002001787700002001807700002301827700002201850700002001872700002701892700002101919773013401940856007302074852000902147655001202156IND60649875620221207051549.0190707e20131021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064987562DNAL7 a10.3390/nu51041842doi7 aPMC38200682pmcid7 a241527512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaggio, Marcello10aIGF-1, the Cross Road of the Nutritional, Inflammatory and Hormonal Pathways to Frailty  ap. 4184-4205.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe decline in functional capacity is a heterogeneous phenomenon in the elderly. An accelerated ageing determines a frail status. It results in an increased vulnerability to stressors for decreased physiological reserves. The early identification of a frail status is essential for preventing loss of functional capacity, and its clinical consequences. Frailty and mobility limitation result from an interplay of different pathways including multiple anabolic deficiency, inflammation, oxidative stress, and a poor nutritional status. However, the age-related decline in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) bioactivity deserves special attention as it could represent the ideal crossroad of endocrine, inflammatory, and nutritional pathways to frailty. Several minerals, namely magnesium, selenium, and zinc, appear to be important determinants of IGF-1 bioactivity. This review aims to provide an overview of the potential usefulness of nutrients modulating IGF-1 as potential therapeutic targets in the prevention of mobility limitation occurring in frail older subjects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3aelderly 3ainflammation 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amagnesium 3aminerals 3anutrients 3anutritional status 3aoxidative stress 3aselenium 3atherapeutics 3azinc1 aDe Vita, Francesca1 aLauretani, Fulvio1 aButtò, Valeria1 aBondi, Giuliana1 aCattabiani, Chiara1 aNouvenne, Antonio1 aMeschi, Tiziana1 aDall'Aglio, Elisabetta1 aCeda, Gian Paolo0 tNutrients.g2013 Oct. 21, v. 5, no. 10 p.4184-4205dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu51041843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245012500164300001800289500001400307520046600321592002800787650002200815650001800837650002500855650002600880650001100906650002100917650002100938653001400959653001800973653002700991653002901018653002501047700002401072700002101096700002301117700002201140700001901162700001801181700002201199773018501221856007501406852000901481655001201490IND60691905720221119182048.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069190572DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.21932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitayama, Takashi,10aChemistry of Zerumbone. 2.

For rodents, 1 important resource is nesting sites. In this study I present data from direct behavioral observations in the succulent karoo of South Africa that show aggressive interactions between bush karoo rats (Otomys unisulcatus) and striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Because both species nest in shrubs, the potential exists for interspecific competition for nesting sites. Because of a severe drought in 2003, the bush karoo rat became locally extirpated. As a result, striped mice nested significantly more often in shrubs that contained bush karoo rat nests than in 2001 and 2002, when the population density of bush karoo rats was high. Furthermore, I observed that striped mice never nested in the shrub Lycium cinerum, the favorite nesting site of bush karoo rats, when bush karoo rats were present, but regularly used these nesting sites after bush karoo rats became extirpated. I conclude that striped mice and bush karoo rats compete actively for access to preferred nesting sites in the succulent karoo.  aPublisher supplied data 0ainterspecific competition 0anest 0aOtomys unisulcatus 0aRhabdomys pumilio 0asucculent karoo0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2005 Aug., v. 86, no. 4 p.757-762dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F1545-1542%282005%29086%5B0757%3ANCITDR%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010100169520101200270592002801282650001101310650002101321650002501342650001701367650000901384650000701393650001201400653002901412653001601441653001101457653002501468653001101493700001701504700001701521773010801538856008601646852000901732655001201741IND60732779620221119162557.0210415e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073277962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1180052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Zhiqiang10aHigh pressure processing accelarated the release of RG-I pectic polysaccharides from citrus peel  aHigh pressure processing (HPP) has become a promising strategy for extracting bioactive constituents.

The yield of HPP (500 MPa/10 min) assisted alkali extraction is more than 2 times of that of HPP assisted acid extraction. The RG-I structure ratio of HPP-alkali extraction pectic polysaccharide (74.51 %) was significantly higher than that of traditional pectin (41.83 %). The results showed that HPP assisted alkali is a potential pectic polysaccharide extraction technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aalkali treatment 3aantioxidant activity 3acitrus peels 3agels 3apH 3apectins 0aHigh pressure processing 0aCitrus peel 0aPectin 0aRhamnogalacturonan I 0aAlkali1 aChen, Shiguo1 aYe, Xingqian0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 July 01, v. 263 p.118005-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1180053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010700174300001800281520207600299592002802375650000802403650001502411650001302426650001602439650001902455650001502474650001102489650002102500650002002521650001802541650004302559650005202602650001202654650001902666650001302685650001502698650001102713650002202724650001202746651001102758651001802769653002502787653001102812653002502823653002202848653002202870653002802892700002202920700001602942700001902958773009802977856008603075852000903161655001203170IND60564556220221117001501.0190401e20180524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056455622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikolay, Alexander10aPropagation of Brazilian Zika virus strains in static and suspension cultures using Vero and BHK cells  ap. 3140-3145.  aThe recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas and the Pacific has reached alarming levels in more than 60 countries. However, relatively little is known about the disease on a virological and epidemiological level and its consequences for humans. Accordingly, a large demand for in vitro derived Brazilian ZIKV material to support in vitro and in vivo studies has arisen. However, a prompt supply of ZIKV and ZIKV antigens cannot be guaranteed as the production of this virus typically using Vero or C6/36 cell lines remains challenging.Here we present a production platform based on BHK-21 suspension (BHK-21SUS) cells to propagate Brazilian ZIKV at larger quantities in perfusion bioreactors. Scouting experiments performed in tissue culture flasks using adherent BHK-21 and Vero cells have demonstrated similar permissivity and virus yields for four different Brazilian ZIKV isolates. The cell-specific yield of infectious virus particles varied between respective virus strains (1–48PFU/cell), and the ZIKV isolate from the Brazilian state Pernambuco (ZIKVPE) showed to be a best performing isolate for both cell lines. However, infection studies of BHK-21SUS cells with ZIKVPE in shake flasks resulted in poor virus replication, with a maximum titer of 8.9×103PFU/mL. Additional RT-qPCR measurements of intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels revealed high viral copy numbers within the cell, but poor virus release. Subsequent cultivation in a perfusion bioreactor using an alternating tangential flow filtration system (ATF) under controlled process conditions enabled cell concentrations of about 1.2×107cells/mL, and virus titers of 3.9×107PFU/mL. However, while the total number of infectious virus particles was increased, the cell-specific yield (3.3PFU/cell) remained lower than determined in adherent cell lines. Nevertheless, the established perfusion process allows to provide large amounts of ZIKV material for research and is a first step towards process development for manufacturing inactivated or live-attenuated ZIKV vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aZika virus 3aantigens 3abioreactors 3aculture flasks 3afiltration 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3amanufacturing 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astrains 3atissue culture 3avaccines 3aviral load 3avirion 3avirus replication 3aviruses 3aBrazil 3aNorth America 0aBrazilian Zika virus 0aBHK-21 0aSuspension cell line 0aHigh cell density 0aPerfusion process 0aProcess intensification1 aCastilho, Leda R.1 aReichl, Udo1 aGenzel, Yvonne0 tVaccine.g2018 May 24, v. 36, no. 22 p.3140-3145dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245019800174300001800372520110000390592002801490650002301518650001401541650001101555650001501566650004101581650001301622700002101635700001901656700002601675773010701701856008401808852000901892655001201901IND60112877920221122051021.0141111e20110916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011287792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJouyban, Abolghasem10aModeling the effects of type and concentration of organic modifiers, column type and chemical structure of analytes on the retention in reversed phase liquid chromatography using a single model  ap. 6454-6463.  aA previously proposed model for representing the retention factor (k) of an analyte in mixed solvent mobile phases was extended to calculate the k of different analytes with respect to the nature of analyte, organic modifier, its concentration and type of the stationary phase. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by calculating mean percentage deviation (MPD) as accuracy criterion. The predicted vs. observed plots were also provided as goodness of fit criteria. The developed model prediction capability compared with a number of previous models (i.e. LSER, general LSER and Oscik equation) through MPD and fitting plots. The proposed method provided acceptable predictions with the advantage of modeling the effects of organic modifiers, mobile phase compositions, columns and analytes using a single equation. The accuracy of developed model was checked using the one column and one analyte out cross validation analyses and the results showed that the developed model was able to predict the unknown analyte retention and the analytes retentions on unknown column accurately.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3aequations 3amodels 3aprediction 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asolvents1 aSoltani, Somaieh1 aShayanfar, Ali1 aPappa-Louisi, Adriani0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Sept. 16, v. 1218, no. 37 p.6454-6463dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02105naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245006200167300001600229520084000245592002801085650001901113650002101132650001601153650001001169650001001179650001501189650001401204650001901218650001001237650001401247650002401261650002001285653001101305653001301316700001601329700001401345700001601359700001501375700001401390773016001404856008601564852000901650655001201659IND60721269720221122083410.0201224e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072126972DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2015.00068.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaba, O.K.10aPathology of dimethoate induced acute toxicity in rabbits  ap. 272-276.  aA study was conducted to investigate the acute toxic effects of dimethoate, using rabbits as mammalian model. Dimethoate @ 500 mg/Kg body weight (H’’LD50 dose) as single oral dose (TAFGOR containing 35.5% dimethoate) caused marked clinical changesand66% mortality within 24 hours. Prior to death rabbits showed recumbency, uneasiness and paddling of legs followed by unconsciousness. Except for significant decrease in PCV and increase in plasma globulin levels, the haemato-biochemical indices were not altered significantly. Pathomorphological alterations included generalized congestion, haemorrhages, and widespread degenerative changes, especially in liver, kidneys, and brain. Significant inflammatory changes were also observed.

The soil type in the study area is clayey and lateritic. The application of fertilizers and pesticides for agriculture has contributed to the continuous accumulation of trace elements in soils. The contamination of the soils was assessed by comparing trace element concentration with natural background values for clayey and lateritic soils. Fifty soil samples have been analyzed using X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The concentration ranges of Cu (76.4–213.1 mg/kg) and Pb (4.2–50.1 mg/kg) are exceeding natural background limit and other trace element concentration like Co (44.4–85.7 mg/kg), Cr (138.8–348.5 mg/kg), Ni (12–50.1 mg/kg), V (56.3–779.3 mg/kg) and Zn (71.2–133.7 mg/kg) are within permissible limit. The soil contamination was estimated on the basis of Index of geoaccumulation (Igₑₒ), enrichment ratio (ERn) [or enrichment factor (EF)], contamination factor (CF) and degree of contamination (Cdₑg). The concentration of above-mentioned elements was similar to the levels in the earth’s crust pointed to metal depletion in the soil as the EF was <1. Cu and Pb showed high EF in the soil samples indicating that there is a considerable heavy metal pollution, which could be correlated with the agricultural activity in the area. A contamination site poses significant environmental hazards for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. They are important sources of pollution and may result in ecotoxicological effects on terrestrial, groundwater and aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aarsenic 3abarium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenvironmental hazards 3afertilizer application 3afluorescence 3agroundwater 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anickel 3apesticides 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3asoil types 3astrontium 3azinc 3azirconium 3aIndia1 aMachender, G.1 aDhakate, Ratnakar1 aSaxena, Praveen Raj1 aPrasad, M.

In this work, a simple ambient mass spectrometry method using paper capillary spray was developed for the fast quantitation of four pyrazole fungicides in wines. Direct analysis of the wine samples was achieved without any sample preparation, obtaining limits of quantitation as low as 2 ng mL⁻¹ for all four pyrazole fungicides.

With herbal industry rapidly growing size, consumer safety becomes an important issue that requires special attention. Identification of herbal species in the products is therefore needed. METHODS: Sequences from the selected regions (matK, rbcL, trnL and ITS1) were retrieved and analysed. Then the most suitable barcode was assessed for discrimination of T. crispa from closely related species by HRM analysis and used in authentication of commercial products. RESULTS: The ITS1 barcode was found to be the suitable primer as melting data from the HRM assay proved to be capable of distinguishing T. crispa from its related species. The developed protocol was then employed to authenticate medicinal products in powdered form. HRM analysis of all tested samples here revealed that five out of eight products contained not only the indicated species T. crispa but also other Tinospora, that have a high level of morphological similarity. CONCLUSION: Misrepresentation, poor packaging and inappropriate labeling of the tested medicinal herbal products are thought to be the reason of the results here. Using Bar-HRM with the ITS marker lead to success in authenticating the tested herbal products.  aPublisher supplied data  aDBG6080012cThailand Research Fund0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTinospora 3aalternative medicine 3abarcoding 3aherbal medicines 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amelting 3apackaging 3aproduct safety 3araw materials 3aspecies identification 3atraditional medicine1 aOsathanunkul, Rossarin1 aMadesis, Panagiotis0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.111-111dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2174-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014100153300001800294520081700312592002801129650004401157650002401201650001001225650002001235650002401255650001001279650001001289650001401299650001801313650001901331650003701350650003101387700001901418700001301437700001701450773012901467856007401596852000901670655001201679IND60638812520221118221012.0190430e20170928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063881252DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay01541k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Min14aThe fabrication and gas sensing application of a fast-responding m-CP-PVP composite film/potassium ion-exchanged glass optical waveguide  ap. 5494-5501.  aA m-Cresol Purple-polyvinylpyrrolidone (m-CP-PVP) composite-film was immobilized on the surface of a potassium ion-exchanged glass optical waveguide using the spin-coating method.

This simply designed sensor was able to measure trimethylamine (TMA) gas down to a concentration of 0.1 ppb at room temperature, and its response and recovery times were 1.4 s and 5.6 s, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3acolor 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3agases 3aglass 3apotassium 3atransmittance 3atrimethylamine 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avolatile organic compounds1 aKari, Nuerguli1 aYan, Yin1 aYimit, Abliz0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Sept. 28, v. 9, no. 37 p.5494-5501dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay01541k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010500168300001600273520175300289592002802042650001702070650001602087650001902103650001902122650001402141650001702155650002602172650001402198650001102212650002602223650001402249650001802263650001702281650002202298651001002320653001902330653001802349653002502367653002102392653002702413700001502440700001902455773018202474856008502656852000902741655001202750IND60087308220221118124527.0160903e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008730822DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60120-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Liping10aEutrophication development and its key regulating factors in a water-supply reservoir in North China  ap. 962-970.  aYanghe Reservoir is an important source of drinking water for Qinhuangdao City, North China; however, in recent decades this water source has been eutrophic with recurrent summer cyanobacterial blooms. The trophic grade of the system in summer was mesotrophiceutrophic in 1990 and became hypertrophic in 2011. The nutrient availability is extremely high during the entire year, and the water temperature should be the primary driver of the summer blooms. In May–October of 2010 and 2011, abrupt variations were observed in the Secchi depth (SD) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and both the correlated analysis of Chl-a-SD and trophic status indices (TSI) deviation (TSIChl-a-TSISD) showed that algal cell density dominated light attenuation. During the algal bloom outbreak, the microcystin concentration was found to vary between 0.35–2.12 μg/L in 2010 and 0.11–1.86 μg/L in 2011. The maximum microcystin content was more than two times the safety limit required for drinking water. Inflow discharges were most concentrated in the summer, with periods of lower residence time and the largest water level fluctuation over the entire year. When a high availability of nutrients promoted a high Chl-a concentration in the whole system, it appeared that the instability caused by the decrease in residence time could not produce effective changes in the cyanobacterial abundance. The results indicated that nutrient enrichment in the aquatic systems of Yanghe Reservoir is the most serious problem and that the status would not been modified effectively by increasing hydrological fluctuations (e.g., decreasing the residence time). Therefore, decreasing the nutrient concentrations is the only route to improve the water quality of this reservoir.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3achlorophyll 3adrinking water 3aeutrophication 3ahydrology 3amicrocystins 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3asummer 3atrophic relationships 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awater temperature 3aChina 0aeutrophication 0atrophic state 0acyanobacterial bloom 0alimiting factors 0awater-supply reservoir1 aLiu, Lusan1 aZheng, Binghui0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2013 May 01, v. 25 p.962-970dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60120-X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014500169300001600314520130500330592002801635650002601663650001401689650002101703650001201724650001401736650001601750651001001766653002601776653001801802653002401820653001601844700001901860700001801879700001901897700001801916700002001934700002201954700001601976773011001992856008502102852000902187655001202196IND60602316820221118065006.0180711e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060231682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2015.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Su-Rong10aEffect of photoperiod change on chronobiology of cercarial emergence of Schistosoma japonicum derived from hilly and marshy regions of China  ap. 227-232.  aThe chronobiology of cercarial emergence appeared to be a genetically controlled behavior, adapted to definitive host species, for schistosome. However, a few physiological and ecological factors, for example the change of photoperiod, were reported to affect the rhythmic emergence of cercariae. Therefore, the effect of photoperiod change on cercarial emergence of two Schistosoma japonicum isolates, the hilly and the marshland, was investigated. Four shedding experiments each under a different photoperiod were conducted. Under a natural photoperiod, two distinct shedding modes, one from the hilly region and one from the marshland, were observed. Under a reversed photoperiod, the regular pattern (i.e. under a natural photoperiod) of S. japonicum cercarial emergence was reversed for the marshland isolate and disappeared for the hilly isolate. With an input of a 2 h darkness from 7am to 9am, the cercarial emergence peak were delayed for the two isolates; whereas with an input of a 2 h darkness from 5pm to 7pm, neither effect on the cercarial emergence rhythm was observed. The total cercariae emerged for both parasite isolates varied with a different photoperiod. The results indicate that the change of photoperiod could affect the chronobiology of S japonicum cercarial emergence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3acercariae 3adefinitive hosts 3amarshes 3aparasites 3aphotoperiod 3aChina 0aSchistosoma japonicum 0aChronobiology 0aCercarial emergence 0aPhotoperiod1 aZhu, Yuan-Jian1 aGe, Qing-Peng1 aYang, Meng-Jia1 aHuang, Ji-Lei1 aHuang, Wen-Qiao1 aZhuge, Hong-Xiang1 aLu, Da-Bing0 tExperimental parasitology.g2015 Dec., v. 159 p.227-232dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2015.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012900173300001600302520144200318592002801760650001301788650002101801650002401822650001501846650001401861650001201875650002301887650001501910650002101925650001001946650001901956650001701975650001901992650002002011650001302031650001302044650001402057653001302071653002402084653002302108700002002131700001502151700002402166773016002190856008602350852000902436655001202445IND60721269920221122083408.0201224e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072126992DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2015.00070.X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhanalakshmi, S.10aEffect of Picrorrhiza kurroa on growth performance and haemato- biochemical parameters in induced ochratoxicosis of chickens  ap. 282-285.  aAn experiment was conducted with an objective to study the toxic effects of the Ochratoxin A (OA) on haemato-biochemical parameters in broiler birds and the effect of the ethanolic extract of rhizome of Picrorrhiza kurroa (PK) to counteract the damage caused by this toxin. A total of 90 day-old male broiler chicks were divided in to six groups (Tc, TDc, T₄, T₂, T₃ and T₄) of 15 birds in each. Birds of T group received Ochratoxin A @ 1ppm in the feed, T₂ group Ochratoxin A @ 1ppm+ drug (PK) extract @ 400mg/kg of feed, T₃ group Ochratoxin A @ 2ppm, T₄ group Ochratoxin A @ 2ppm + herbal drug (PK) extract 400mg/kg of feed, and Tc and TDc groups served as control and drug control, respectively. There were significant (P<0.05) reduction in total protein and albumin and increase in creatinine values in the birds of 1 ppm toxin fed group. In broiler birds of 2 ppm toxin fed group, there was a significant reduction in hemoglobin, TEC, TLC and PCV, glucose, total protein, albumin and globulin and increase in concentration of creatinine, uric acid, ALP and BUN values. There was a significant reduction in the body weight gain in all the treatment groups (T₄ to T₄). The herbal plant extract of Picrorrhiza kurroa at the dose rate of 400 mg/kg of feed along with Ochratoxin A, employed in present study, did not show any significant improvement related to hemato-biochemical and body weight parameters in broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aanimal pathology 3abody weight changes 3acreatinine 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3ahemoglobin 3aherbal medicines 3amales 3aochratoxicosis 3aochratoxin A 3aplant extracts 3aprotein content 3arhizomes 3atoxicity 3auric acid 0aBroilers 0aHaemato-biochemical 0aPicrorrhiza kurroa1 aSivakumar, S.P.1 aNiyogi, D.1 aMukhopadhayay, S.K.0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2015 Sept. 1, v. 39, no. 3 p.282-285dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-970X.2015.00070.X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245010700213500001900320520169700339592002802036650002002064650002402084650001602108650002202124650001802146650002402164650002402188650001602212653004002228653002502268653002302293653002402316653002702340700002102367700002202388700002102410700001902431773011902450856008802569852000902657655001202666IND60701527920221120072409.0210114e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070152792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1408462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenberg, Kathrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0517-748410aMulti-fidelity approach to Bayesian parameter estimation in subsurface heat and fluid transport models  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe increased use of the urban subsurface for competing purposes, such as anthropogenic infrastructures and geothermal energy applications, leads to an urgent need for large-scale sophisticated modelling approaches for coupled mass and heat transfer. However, such models are subject to large uncertainties in model parameters, the physical model itself and in available measured data, which is often rare. Thus, the robustness and reliability of the computer model and its outcomes largely depend on successful parameter estimation and model calibration, which are hampered by the computational burden of large-scale coupled models.To tackle this problem, we develop a novel Bayesian approach for parameter estimation, which allows us to account for different sources of uncertainty, is capable of dealing with sparse field data and makes optimal use of the output data from expensive numerical model runs. This is achieved by combining output data from different models that represent the same physical problem, but at different levels of fidelity, e.g. reflected by different spatial resolution. By applying this new approach to a 1D analytical heat transfer model and a large-scale semi-3D numerical model while using synthetic data, we show that the accuracy and precision of parameter estimation by this multi-fidelity framework by far exceeds the standard single-fidelity results. The consideration of different error terms in the Bayesian framework also allows assessment of the model bias and the discrepancy between the different fidelity levels. These are emulated by Gaussian Process models, which facilitate re-iteration of the parameter estimation without additional model runs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acomputer simulation 3aenvironment 3ageothermal energy 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3anormal distribution 3auncertainty 0aLarge-scale hydro-thermal modelling 0aParameter estimation 0aBayesian inference 0aNumerical modelling 0aSubsurface temperature1 aBidarmaghz, Asal1 aGregory, Alastair1 aChoudhary, Ruchi1 aGirolami, Mark0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 745 p.140846-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1408463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012600153300001800279520152500297592002801822650002001850650001101870650002901881650002001910650001701930650002301947650001201970650002101982650002202003650001802025650003002043650003502073650003402108650002002142650001302162700001802175700001402193700001602207700001902223700001902242700001702261773012902278856007402407852000902481655001202490IND60638812620221118221137.0190430e20170914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063881262DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay01545c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yun10aSimultaneous determination of chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons in fly ashes discharged from industrial thermal processes  ap. 5198-5203.  aChlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) have received increasing attention because of their environmental persistence, bioaccumulation potential and high toxicity. In this study, an analytical methodology based on high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry for the simultaneous determination of four typical kinds of CAHs including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) and chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (ClPAHs) in fly ash was developed. Highly effective cleanup and separation procedures combined with optimum instrumental conditions provided a reliable method for the detection and quantification of CAHs. Meanwhile, the spike of ¹³C-labeled standards and deuterated phenanthrene achieved more accurate measurement. The method detection limits were determined to be in the ranges of 0.1–13.4 pg g⁻¹ for tetra- to octa-CDD/F congeners, 0.04–11.1 pg g⁻¹ for tri- to hepta-CB congeners, 0.2–48.5 pg g⁻¹ for mono- to octa-CN congeners and 3.5–9.5 pg g⁻¹ for mono- and di-chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. Good recoveries of CAHs (62–136%) were achieved, except for PCN-2 and PCN-6. The developed analytical methodology was validated and then used to determine the levels of CAHs in fly ashes collected from industrial thermal processes. All the target compounds were detected and the CAH congener concentrations showed a wide variation in different fly ashes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3acarbon 3achlorinated naphthalenes 3adetection limit 3adibenzofuran 3aenvironmental fate 3afly ash 3aisotope labeling 3amass spectrometry 3aphenanthrenes 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3astable isotopes 3atoxicity1 aZhang, Haijun1 aWang, Dan1 aRen, Meihui1 aZhang, Xueping1 aWang, Longxing1 aChen, Jiping0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Sept. 14, v. 9, no. 35 p.5198-5203dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay01545c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011600165300001800281520203700299592002802336650001702364650001802381650002602399650002202425650001202447650001302459650001702472650001502489651001902504651001602523700001702539700002302556700001602579773010502595856008102700852000902781655001202790IND60123661320221121183213.0150328e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012366132DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-014-3742-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVavro, Martin10aSoapstone as a locally used and limited sculptural material in remote area of Northern Moravia (Czech Republic)  ap. 4557-4571.  aIn contrast to Nordic countries, talc-rich rocks (massive and schistose talc-bearing rocks—talcite, magnesite-talc schists, chlorite-talc schists, and/or chlorite-actinolite-talc schists often loosely classified as soapstone) represented practically an unknown natural building and sculptural stone in the Czech Republic. This extraordinary material was quarried and used in the only region of the Czech Republic where Sobotín amphibolite massif (Šumperk district, northern Moravia) outcrops. Metamorphosed basic igneous rocks contain small lenses of soapstone that were exploited in the past and used not only for refractory purposes but also as a construction and sculptural material.Occurrences of ‘Sobotín’ soapstone show distinct zone macrofabric marked by the occurrence of massive soapstone in the core that gradually changes to talc-dominant schists, later to actinolite/tremolite-rich schists and finally to chlorite schists at the contact with surrounding amphibolites. The most typical ‘Sobotín’ soapstone exhibits high density (up to 2,900 kg m⁻³), low water uptake (maximum 0.68 wt %), favorable dynamic elastic properties (P-wave velocity 5,340–5,840 m s⁻¹, S-wave velocity 2,900–3,300 m s⁻¹), and mechanical properties (tensile splitting strength 5.2–6.9 MPa, uniaxial compressive strength 17.5–24.1 MPa). ‘Sobotín’ soapstone is relatively resistant to weathering action although schistose varieties show typical delamination when exposed to frequent freeze/thaw cycling in harsh mountainous environment. Field survey of monuments, architectural and building artefacts made from ‘Sobotín’ soapstone contributed to our knowledge on duration of exploitation of ‘Sobotín’ soapstone that was for sure utilised from the second half of seventeen century till the beginning of the twenty century. The most characteristic feature of ‘Sobotín’ soapstone is its strict local use on the territory of about 20 villages surrounding previously exploited soapstone lenses.  aPublisher supplied data 3adelamination 3aigneous rocks 3amechanical properties 3ametamorphic rocks 3asurveys 3avillages 3awater uptake 3aweathering 3aCzech Republic 3aScandinavia1 aGajda, Jakub1 aPřikryl, Richard,1 aSiegl, Petr0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Apr., v. 73, no. 8 p.4557-4571dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3742-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245008800181300001600269520127400285592002801559650002601587650002101613650001201634650001201646650001301658650001901671650003501690650002401725650002401749650001001773650001401783650001401797650002601811650004301837650001701880653001701897653000801914653002601922653000901948700002501957700002901982700002602011700003302037700003402070773011002104856008502214852000902299655001202308IND60602316920221118065121.0180711e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060231692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2015.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonroy, Virginia Sánchez10aCalpain-like: A Ca2+ dependent cystein protease in Entamoeba histolytica cell death  ap. 245-251.  aEntamoeba histolytica programmed cell death (PCD) induced by G418 is characterized by the release of important amounts of intracellular calcium from reservoirs. Nevertheless, no typical caspases have been detected in the parasite, the PCD phenotype is inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitor E−64. These results strongly suggest that Ca²⁺-dependent proteases could be involved in PCD. In this study, we evaluate the expression and activity of a specific dependent Ca²⁺ protease, the calpain-like protease, by real-time quantitative PCR (RTq-PCR), Western blot assays and a enzymatic method during the induction of PCD by G418. Alternatively, using cell viability and TUNEL assays, we also demonstrated that the Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al calpain inhibitor reduced the rate of cell death. The results demonstrated 4.9-fold overexpression of calpain-like gene 1.5 h after G418 PCD induction, while calpain-like protein increased almost two-fold with respect to basal calpain-like expression after 3 h of induction, and calpain activity was found to be approximately three-fold higher 6 h after treatment compared with untreated trophozoites. Taken together, these results suggest that this Ca²⁺-dependent protease could be involved in the executory phase of PCD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aWestern blotting 3acalcium 3acalpain 3acaspases 3acell viability 3acysteine proteinase inhibitors 3aenzymatic treatment 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aparasites 3aphenotype 3aprogrammed cell death 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atrophozoites 0aCalpain-like 0aPCD 0aEntamoeba histolytica 0aG4181 aFlores, Olivia Medel1 aGarcía, Consuelo Gómez1 aMaya, Yesenia Chávez1 aFernández, Tania Domínguez1 aPérez Ishiwara, D.

R.10aNanoparticle Film Assemblies as Platforms for Electrochemical BiosensingFactors Affecting the Amperometric Signal Enhancement of Hydrogen Peroxide  ap. 4574-4583.  aFactors affecting the enhanced amperometric signal observed at electrodes modified with polyelectrolyte–gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) composite films, which are potential interfaces for first-generation biosensors, were systematically investigated and optimized for hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) detection. Polyelectrolyte multilayer films embedded with citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles exhibited high sensitivity toward the oxidation of H₂O₂. From this Au-NP film assembly, the importance of Au-NP ligand protection, film permeability, the density of Au-NPs within the film, and electronic coupling between Au-NPs (interparticle) and between the film and the electrode (interfacial) were evaluated. Using alternative Au-NPs, including those stabilized with thiols, polymers, and bulky ligands, suggests that the amperometric enhancement of H₂O₂ is optimized at poly-l-lysine-linked film assemblies embedded with Au-NPs possessing small, charged, and conductive (conjugated) peripheral ligands. As a potential application of these Au-NP film assemblies, an enhanced amperometric signal for H₂O₂ oxidation was shown for modified “needle” electrodes. The overall aim of this research is to gain a greater understanding of designing electrochemical sensing strategies that incorporate Au-NPs and target specific analytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acomposite materials 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aligands 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apermeability 3apolymers 3athiols1 aNguyen, Natalie D.

The experimental findings are interpreted in silico with the support of Hartree–Fock and density functional theory calculations of empty orbital energies and symmetries, and evaluation of the electron affinities of the indolic molecules under investigation. The only fragment anions formed by DEA to melatonin at incident electron energies below 2 eV are associated with the elimination of a hydrogen atom (energetically favored from the NH site of the pyrrole ring, leaving the ring intact) or a CH₃· radical from the temporary molecular negative ion. Opening of the pyrrole ring of melatonin is not detected over the whole electron energy range of 0–14 eV. The DEA spectra of l- and d-tryptophan are almost identical under the present experimental conditions. The adiabatic electron affinity of melatonin is predicted to be −0.49 eV at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level, indicating that the DEA mechanism in melatonin is likely to be present in most life forms given the availability of low energy electrons in living systems in both plant and animal kingdoms. In particular, H atom donation usually associated with free-radical scavenging activity can be stimulated by electron attachment and N–H bond cleavage at electron energies around 1 eV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aanions 3achemical bonding 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3amelatonin 3aspectroscopy 3atryptophan1 aModelli, Alberto1 aJones, Derek1 aLazneva, Eleonora F.1 aKomolov, Alexei S.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Apr. 27, v. 121, no. 16 p.3965-3974dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b014083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245021100156300001800367520139000385592002801775650002201803650001501825650002301840650001001863650001001873650002101883650002101904650000901925650002901934650001701963700001701980700001801997700001602015773012802031856007402159852000902233655001202242IND60638812720221118221029.0190430e20170817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063881272DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay01546a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, BinBin10aUPLC-MS/MS method for determination of schisandrin in rat plasma and brain microdialysates: application to a comparative pharmacokinetic and brain distribution study in normal and Alzheimer’s disease rats  ap. 4740-4746.  aSchisandrin is the major active ingredient of S. chinensis, which provides anti-AD activity. The objective of this study was to develop a method to study the comparative pharmacokinetics and brain distribution of schisandrin in normal and AD rats. Therefore, an efficient UPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of schisandrin in rat plasma and brain microdialysate has been developed and validated. The method showed good linearity over a wide concentration range (r > 0.99), and the obtained lower limit of quantification was 0.5 ng mL⁻¹ for the analyte in brain microdialysate samples. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy of the analyte were well within acceptance criteria (±15%). The validated method has been successfully applied to comparing the pharmacokinetic and brain distribution profiles of schisandrin in normal and AD rat plasma and brain microdialysate. The results demonstrated that significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of schisandrin were observed between the two groups, while the absorption of schisandrin in the AD group was significantly better than that in the normal group. The increase of schisandrin content in the brain provides a pharmacodynamic material basis for its anti-AD activity. The study will provide new ideas for the progression and development of AD therapy, and finding novel target drugs for AD therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aabsorption 3aactive ingredients 3abrain 3adrugs 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atherapeutics1 aLiu, Mingyan1 aChen, Zaixing1 aWei, Minjie0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Aug. 17, v. 9, no. 32 p.4740-4746dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay01546a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008600170300001200256520120900268592002801477650001201505650002101517650001401538650001501552650001401567650001501581650001501596650001501611650002001626653001301646653003901659653001301698653001301711653001501724653001301739700009701752700010601849700002401955700003201979700001702011700002402028700010702052700001902159700002502178700009902203700001902302700001802321700009302339700001602432773009302448856008502541852000902626655001202635IND60625122720221117155618.0191031e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062512272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeviour, Thomas10aExtracellular polymeric substances of biofilms: Suffering from an identity crisis  ap. 1-7.  aMicrobial biofilms can be both cause and cure to a range of emerging societal problems including antimicrobial tolerance, water sanitation, water scarcity and pollution. The identities of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) responsible for the establishment and function of biofilms are poorly understood. The lack of information on the chemical and physical identities of EPS limits the potential to rationally engineer biofilm processes, and impedes progress within the water and wastewater sector towards a circular economy and resource recovery. Here, a multidisciplinary roadmap for addressing this EPS identity crisis is proposed. This involves improved EPS extraction and characterization methodologies, cross-referencing between model biofilms and full-scale biofilm systems, and functional description of isolated EPS with in situ techniques (e.g. microscopy) coupled with genomics, proteomics and glycomics. The current extraction and spectrophotometric characterization methods, often based on the principle not to compromise the integrity of the microbial cells, should be critically assessed, and more comprehensive methods for recovery and characterization of EPS need to be developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3acircular economy 3aglycomics 3amicroscopy 3apollution 3aproteomics 3asanitation 3awastewater 3awater shortages 0aBiofilms 0aExtracellular polymeric substances 0aFunction 0aAnalysis 0aBiophysics 0aIdentity1 aDerlon, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4240-9827 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4240-98271 aDueholm, Morten Simonsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4135-2670 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4135-26701 aFlemming, Hans-Curt1 aGirbal-Neuhauser, Elisabeth1 aHorn, Harald1 aKjelleberg, Staffan1 avan Loosdrecht, Mark C.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0658-4775 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0658-47751 aLotti, Tommaso1 aMalpei, M.

Herein, for the first time, we report the simple and straightforward wet-chemical synthesis of novel nano-Farringtonite (FAR) composed of magnesium and phosphate ions. Further, the potential of known alternate nano-hydroxyapatite (HAP) and novel engineered nano-FAR including their non-stoichiometric variations was evaluated for the removal of mimicking radionuclide (Sr²⁺) and heavy metals (Cd²⁺, and Zn²⁺) from water bodies. Non-stoichiometric FAR (ns-FAR) have shown multifold higher contaminant removal capacities than HAP, i.e., Sr²⁺≈ 85 mg/g vs 49.5 mg/g, Cd²⁺≈ 560 mg/g vs 98.5 mg/g, and Zn²⁺ = 489 mg/g vs 62 mg/g in batch mode. NsFAR showed complete removal of Cd²⁺ and Zn²⁺ with <20% and 0% recovery, respectively in three consecutive sorption-recovery cycles, probing towards permanent incorporation of these ions. Spectroscopic analysis and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy fitting confirmed ion exchange and crystal incorporation as probable removal mechanisms. The high ionic potential of Mg²⁺ allows easy ion exchange with +2 charged metal toxins of varying ionic radius at both Mg1 and Mg2 sites of FAR. nsFAR showed instantaneous separation of these cations in continuous column mode with >2,00,000 L/kg of water filtration capacity (at 1 mg/L), justifying the adsorbent's candidature in water purification applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3afiltration 3aheavy metals 3aion exchange 3amagnesium 3aphosphates 3asorption 3aspectral analysis 3atoxicity 3awater purification 0aFarringtonite 0aHydroxyapatite 0aIon exchange 0aNano-adsorbent 0aPollutants removal 0aXAS water Purification1 aDarbha, Gopala Krishna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2635-40370 tChemosphere.g2022 Dec., v. 308 p.136376-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1363763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011400169500001900283520151500302592002801817650001901845650001501864650001601879650002401895650001001919650001801929650000901947650001701956650001701973651001001990651001802000653002302018653002002041653001002061653002402071700001402095700005902109700002202168773011902190856008802309852000902397655001202406IND60701528020221119015754.0210114e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070152802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1408472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Xiaoyu10aYield and economic losses of winter wheat and rice due to ozone in the Yangtze River Delta during 2014–2019  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGround-level ozone (O₃) is the main phytotoxic air pollutant causing crop yield reduction in China. As the main grain producing area in China, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is facing serious O₃ pollution. This study analyzed the hourly ground-level O₃ observation data of 158 stations from 2014 to 2019 in YRD, and grain production data of 193 districts and counties. The exposure-response relationships based on AOT40 (accumulated hourly O₃ concentration above 40 ppb) was used to estimate the yield loss and economic loss of two food crops (winter wheat and rice). This study used spatial interpolation and calculated the specific data values of each district and county in order to improve the assessment reliability. For years 2014–2019, averaged O₃ concentration during the 75 days growing period of rice and wheat were 33.1–50.6 ppb and 32.2–48.0 ppb, AOT40 value were 5.2–12.0 ppm h and 4.6–9.4 ppm h, and the averaged relative yield losses were 4.9%–11.4% and 9.4%–19.3%, respectively. The trend of O₃ in the YRD in a six-year period peaked in 2016 and 2017 for rice and winter wheat, respectively. During 2014–2017, the average estimated yield loss of rice was 2445 Mt. accounting for about 9.1% of the actual production, and the average estimated economic loss was about 1037 million USD; for winter wheat, it was 2025 Mt, 20.4% and 736 million USD, respectively. These results urge governments to provide effective policies and measures to control O₃ pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3acrop yield 3aenvironment 3afinancial economics 3aozone 3aphytotoxicity 3arice 3ariver deltas 3awinter wheat 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aGround-level ozone 0aRisk assessment 0aAOT40 0aRelative yield loss1 aShang, Bo1 aFeng, Zhaozhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9775-51131 aCalatayud, Vicent0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 745 p.140847-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1408473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245007900168300001800247520110800265592002801373650001201401650002301413650001901436650001201455650002301467650002001490650000701510650001101517650002101528650001401549700001801563773012101581856008201702852000901784655001201793IND60567820320170926000000.0170427e20170427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056782032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b014902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellström, Matti10aProton-Transfer-Driven Water Exchange Mechanism in the Na+ Solvation Shell  ap. 4184-4190.  aLigand exchange plays an important role for organic and inorganic chemical reactions. We demonstrate the existence of a novel water exchange mechanism, the “proton transfer pathway” (PTP), around Na⁺(aq) in basic (high pH) solution, using reactive molecular dynamics simulations employing a high-dimensional neural network potential. An aqua ligand in the first solvation (hydration) shell around a sodium ion is only very weakly acidic, but if a hydroxide ion is present in the second solvation shell, thermal fluctuations can cause the aqua ligand to transfer a proton to the neighboring OH–, resulting in a transient direct-contact ion pair, Na⁺–OH–, which is only weakly bound and easily dissociates. The extent to which water exchange events follow the PTP is pH-dependent: in dilute NaOH(aq) solutions, only very few exchanges occur, whereas in saturated NaOH(aq) solutions up to a third of water self-exchange events are induced by proton transfer. The principles and results outlined here are expected to be relevant for chemical synthesis involving bases and alkali metal cations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3achemical reactions 3adirect contact 3aligands 3amolecular dynamics 3aneural networks 3apH 3asodium 3asodium hydroxide 3asynthesis1 aBehler, Jörg0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Apr. 27, v. 121, no. 16 p.4184-4190dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b014903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04441naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245016000164300001800324500002000342520221000362592002802572596003402600650001902634650001702653650002102670650002102691650002602712650002702738650002302765650002602788650004102814650002102855650002602876650001702902650002902919650002602948650001702974650001302991650001303004650001303017650001603030650001103046650001203057650001703069650003703086650002903123650001203152650001403164650001703178650000803195650001003203651001203213700001803225700002703243700002203270700002203292700002003314700002203334700001603356700001803372700001903390700001703409700006403426773013403490856007403624852000903698655001203707IND60763677320221119174442.0220121e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076367732DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.153022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan, Nguyen Thi Bich10aMinimum inhibitory concentrations of commercial essential oils against common chicken pathogenic bacteria and their relationship with antibiotic resistance  ap. 1025-1035.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: We investigated the antibacterial effect of seven essential oils (EOs) and one EO‐containing liquid phytogenic solution marketed for poultry and pigs (‘Product A’) on chicken pathogens, as well as the relationship between minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in EOs and antibiotics commonly administered to chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta (Vietnam). METHODS AND RESULTS: Micellar extracts from oregano (Origanum vulgare), cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra), garlic (Allium sativum), black pepper (Piper nigrum), peppermint (Mentha × piperita L.), tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia), cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) EOs and Product A were investigated for their MIC against Avibacterium endocarditidis (N = 10), Pasteurella multocida (N = 7), Ornitobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) (N = 10), Escherichia coli (N = 10) and Gallibacterium anatis (N = 10). Cinnamon EO had the lowest median MIC across strains (median 0.5 mg/ml [IQR, interquartile range 0.3–2.0 mg/ml]), followed by Product A (3.8 mg/ml [1.9–3.8 mg/ml]), oregano EO (30.4 mg/ml [7.6–60.8 mg/ml]) and garlic 63.1 mg/ml [3.9 to >505.0 mg/ml]. Peppermint, tea tree, cajeput and pepper EOs had all MIC ≥219 mg/ml. In addition, we determined the MIC of the 12 most commonly used antibiotics in chicken flocks in the area. After accounting for pathogen species, we found an independent, statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive correlation between MIC of 10 of 28 (35.7%) pairs of EOs. For 67/96 (69.8%) combinations of EOs and antibiotics, the MICs were correlated. Of all antibiotics, doxycycline was positively associated with the highest number of EOs (peppermint, tea tree, black pepper and cajeput, all p < 0.05). For cinnamon, the MICs were negatively correlated with the MICs of 11/12 antimicrobial tested (all except colistin). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in MIC of antibiotics generally correlates with increased tolerance to EOs. For cinnamon EO, however, the opposite was observed. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results suggest increased antibacterial effects of EOs on multi‐drug resistant pathogens; cinnamon EO was particularly effective against bacterial poultry pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data  a110085/Z/15/ZcWellcome Trust 3aAllium sativum 3aAvibacterium 3aCinnamomum verum 3aEscherichia coli 3aGallibacterium anatis 3aMelaleuca alternifolia 3aMelaleuca cajuputi 3aMelaleuca leucadendra 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3aOriganum vulgare 3aPasteurella multocida 3aPiper nigrum 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3ablack pepper 3achickens 3acinnamon 3acolistin 3adoxycycline 3agarlic 3aliquids 3amicrobiology 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoregano 3apathogens 3ariver deltas 3atea 3atrees 3aVietnam1 aVi, On Thuong1 aYen, Nguyen Thi Phuong1 aNhung, Nguyen Thi1 aCuong, Nguyen Van1 aKiet, Bach Tuan1 aHoang, Nguyen Van1 aHien, Vo Be1 aThwaites, Guy1 aCampell, James1 aChoisy, Marc1 aCarrique‐Mas, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9161-88900 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2022 Feb., v. 132, no. 2 p.1025-1035dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.153023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013200168300001600300520177600316592002802092650001302120650001202133650001902145650002602164650001902190650001502209650001702224650002002241650001102261650001402272650001302286650002502299653001002324653001202334653001502346653002102361653001502382700005002397700002002447700005802467700001302525700001802538700001502556773009702571856008502668852000902753655001202762IND60625122920221117155609.0201118e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062512292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Longfei10aSorption removal of phthalate esters and bisphenols to biofilms from urban river: From macroscopic to microcosmic investigation  ap. 261-270.  aRiver biofilms play fundamental roles in shaping the architecture of aquatic systems. Sorption to biofilms was thought to be a crucial mechanism controlling the fate and transport of trace emerging contaminants. This study focused on the role of in situ colonized river biofilms in the early fate of phthalate esters (PAEs) and bisphenols (BPs) at trace concentrations in a representative urban river. PAEs and BPs were readily sorbed to biofilms with uptakes of 38.2–162.5 μg/g for PAEs and 1787.7–4425.6 μg/g for BPs, respectively. The total mass and characteristics of the colonized biofilms varied in response to seasons and water qualities. The biofilm colonized in the downstream of a wastewater treatment plant exhibited the highest sorption capacity among the tested sites, possibly attributed to the higher organic contents of biofilms owing to the elevated availability of nutrients. Correlation analysis indicates that certain water qualities, e.g., TN and NH₃N, and biofilm properties, e.g., organic and polysaccharide fractions could be selected to predict the sorption capacities of river biofilms. Hydrophobic partitioning into organic matter appears to be the dominant sorption mechanism and biofilm polysaccharides were probably responsible for the adhesion of tested compounds. The contaminant partitioning into biofilm and sediment at mass/volume ratios typical for small rivers suggests that the biofilm could serve as an important sorbing matrix for the trace organic contaminants as compared to the sediments. Our work yields new insights into the early uptake and accumulation of trace plasticizers by natural biofilms, which is of significance in understanding the subsequent transport of trace organic contaminants in fluvial systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiofilm 3ahydrophobicity 3anutrient availability 3aorganic matter 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3apolysaccharides 3arivers 3asediments 3asorption 3awastewater treatment 0aRiver 0aBiofilm 0aAdsorption 0aPhthalate esters 0aBisphenols1 aLi, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4958-25451 aZhang, Peisheng1 aZhang, Shujuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5013-54381 aLi, Peng1 aWang, Peifang1 aWang, Chao0 tWater research.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 150 p.261-270dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012500166300001600291520170800307592002802015650002102043650003002064650002102094650001402115650001102129650001702140650001602157650001502173650002202188650002902210650001602239653001202255653001902267653001502286653002902301700002002330700001702350700001802367700001502385700001402400700001402414700002002428700001902448700001802467773015902485856008602644852000902730655001202739IND60721270520221121072443.0201224e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072127052DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2015.00076.02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDar, S.H.10aAssociation of Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium necrophorum with subclinical endometritis in postpartum Murrah buffalo  ap. 311-315.  aThe present study was carried out to examine the association between the presence of Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium necrophorum during early postpartum period and subsequent development of subclinical endometritis. In addition, the utility of uterine lavage based cytology for diagnosing subclinical endometritis and its impact on the subsequent reproductive performance were studied. Uterine lavage was done with sterile normal saline on 30–31 day postpartum (dpp) from normally calved Murrah buffalo (n=12) for diagnosing subclinical endometritis using the 5% cut-off of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes set for cattle. Incidence of subclinical endometritis was 41.7% (5/12) in the present study. A significant association between the presence of E. coli on 20–21 dpp and the development of subclinical endometritis on 30–31 dpp in the buffalo was observed (P<0.05). Mean percent of PMN leukocyte, lymphocyte and endometrial epithelial cells was 11.57, 21.32 and 67.11, respectively in buffaloes with subclinical endometritis. While the corresponding figures in buffaloes without subclinical endometritis was 2.42, 6.79 and 90.79 percent, respectively. There was no significant (P>0.05) difference in the reproductive performance of buffaloes with and without subclinical endometritis which might be due to low sample size. It was suggested that the pathological and diagnostic significance of lymphocytes in relation to postpartum subclinical endometritis in buffalo need to be studied.

In this study, an off-line 2D-HPLC method combining a Gemini C18 column and a CHIRALPAK® IC-3 column or a self-prepared poly(MQD-co-HEMA-co-EDMA) monolithic capillary column was employed for the separation and detection of d-amino acids in tea samples with the co-existence of a large amount of l-amino acids. The free amino acid fractions in longjing, black, oolong, and pu-erh tea samples were separated and collected after pre-column derivatization using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC) chloride in the reversed-phase mode, and then were concentrated and separated to d- and l-forms on a chiral column. Among them, the d-form of isoleucine (Ile) (1.0–1.6%), alanine (Ala) (0.1–0.8%), phenylalanine (Phe) (0.1–0.4%), valine (Val) (0.2–0.3%), serine (Ser) (0.1–0.2%), aspartic acid (Asp) (0.2%), and proline (Pro) (0.1%) were detected in longjing and oolong teas. Differences between natural tea and fermented tea in the profiles of d-amino acids as well as the total amino acids were also observed. The results provided useful information for the bio-function research of d-amino acids in tea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aalanine 3aaspartic acid 3abeverages 3aderivatization 3afree amino acids 3aisoleucine 3aliquid chromatography 3aphenylalanine 3aproline 3aserine 3atea 3atheanine 3avaline1 aWu, Huihui1 aLuo, Rongying1 aXia, Donghai1 aJiang, Zhengjin1 aHan, Hai0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Nov. 9, v. 9, no. 43 p.6131-6138dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay01569k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245006500213506007600278520129400354536044701648592002802095596004602123596005802169596005402227596004602281506003702327650002102364650002102385650001202406650001502418650001102433650002802444650001702472650001702489650002302506650001602529650002902545653002002574653000902594653000802603653002102611653002402632700001902656773012002675856008502795852000902880655001202889IND60691015420221207073729.0200427e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069101542DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2017.13274982doi7 aPMC59339112pmcid7 a285322312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Young-Joon10aExternal coincidence model for hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigh but nonstressful temperatures profoundly affect plant growth and developmental processes, termed thermomorphogenesis. Thermo-induced hypocotyl elongation is a typical thermomorphogenic trait, which contributes to cooling plant organs. It is known that external light signals and the circadian clock coordinate rhythmic hypocotyl growth. However, it was unclear how light, temperature, and circadian rhythms are harmonized during hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis. We have recently demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) is activated at warm temperatures. It is notable that warm temperatures induce the nuclear import of COP1, facilitating degradation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and this biochemical event is uncoupled from light conditions. Furthermore, the thermo-induced HY5 protein turnover occurs independent of circadian rhythms, indicating that the COP1-HY5 module conveys warm temperature information. Meanwhile, the clock components, including CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), convey timing information for the rhythmic thermomorphogenic growth. These molecular mechanisms enable a coincidence between warm temperature signaling and circadian rhythms, which explains the distinct rhythms of hypocotyl growth at warm temperatures.  aThis work was supported by the Leaping Research (NRF-2015R1A2A1A05001636) and Global Research Lab (NRF-2012K1A1A2055546) Programs provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea and the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (PJ0111532015) provided by the Rural Development Administration of Korea.

Dewatered sewage sludge was treated in an autoclave at 400 °C for 30 min. Without additives, phosphorus is enriched in a solid residue. The phosphorus transferred from the solid residue to the liquid product, and the phosphorus content in the liquid product increased from 41.0 to 2214.5 mg/L in the presence of 2–8 wt % alkaline additives. The pathway of phosphorus under the catalytic condition is proposed. Analysis of the distribution of phosphorus forms in the solid residue, and XRD results indicate that the alkaline additive combines with solid phase phosphate to form analcime and kalsilite, which releases phosphate into the liquid phase. The concentration of phosphorus in the liquid product of supercritical water gasification with the alkaline additive was close to that obtained by chemical extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadditives 3aautoclaves 3afuels 3agasification 3aliquids 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus content 3asewage sludge1 aZhu, Wei1 aChen, Cheng1 aZhang, Hao1 aFan, Yujie1 aMu, Biao1 aZhong, Jun0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Jan. 03, v. 33, no. 2 p.1290-1295dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b040543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014900164520147700313592002801790650001901818650001601837650001601853650001501869650001601884650001901900650000901919650001101928653002601939653001601965653003401981653001602015653002402031700001702055700001902072700001302091700001502104700001702119700001602136773010502152856008602257852000902343655001202352IND60772194620221120093848.0220531e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077219462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1277772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Rui10aSpatiotemporal variations of redox conditions and microbial responses in a typical river bank filtration system with high Fe2+ and Mn2+ contents  aThe redox conditions strongly affect redox kinetics, hydrochemical composition and microbial reactions under river bank filtration (RBF). For investigating the redox conditions, zonation factors, and microbial responses in a typical RBF with high Fe²⁺ and Mn²⁺ contents, three wells were established 20 m apart perpendicular to the south bank of the Songhua River with a constant flow rate of 400 m³/h. Redox zonation was identified from the redox sequences, redox products, reactions identified and seasonality. High-throughput sequencing, principal coordinates analysis, and redundancy analysis were used to identify the microbial responses to redox zonation. The results indicated that the RBF was stabilized after 21 d of water extraction with a 51%, 36% and 21% decrease of Fe²⁺, Mn²⁺ and NH₄⁺ contents, respectively. Feature redox indices varied with strong regularity in the horizontal and vertical filtration directions, and the filtration area could be divided into O₂/NO₃⁻, Fe/Mn, and SO₄²⁻ reduction zones. Seasonality resulted in markedly fluctuation of Fe²⁺ and Mn²⁺ contents in groundwater. Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, and Limnobacter were the dominant bacteria in the O₂/NO₃⁻, Fe/Mn, and SO₄²⁻ reduction zones, respectively. DO explained 21.1% of microbial variability in the fluctuation zone, while Mn²⁺ and Fe²⁺ explained 27.7%, and 26.2%, respectively, of microbial variability in the saturated zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlavobacterium 3aLimnobacter 3aPseudomonas 3afiltration 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3airon 3arivers 0aRiver bank filtration 0aGroundwater 0aRedox conditions and zonation 0aSeasonality 0aMicrobial responses1 aXue, Zhenkun1 aWang, Jinsheng1 aMeng, Li1 aZhao, Xiao1 aPan, Minghao1 aCai, Weihai0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 June, v. 609 p.127777-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1277773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01638naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010300163300001600266520049600282592002800778650002500806650001700831650001900848650001000867650001200877650002400889651001100913700002100924700002300945700002600968700002200994700002201016773015301038856007601191852000901267655001201276IND60125539520221117155939.0151104e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012553952DNAL7 a10.2744/CCB-1045.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrara, Camila R.10aFirst Evidence of Leatherback Turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) Embryos and Hatchlings Emitting Sounds  ap. 110-114.  aThere are only a few studies documenting acoustic communication in chelonians; here we provide additional evidence that sound plays an important role in the interchange of information in this group.

Organic chemistry and X-ray diffraction analyses of 33 replicate samples were used to establish relationships between the gas content and rock composition. Geochemical measurements show that the total organic carbon (TOC) contents range from 0.49 to 13.7 wt %. The organic matter is mainly type III arising from lagoon and delta depositional settings. The dominant minerals are clay (25–97 wt %, average 59 wt %) and quartz (1–62 wt %, average 33 wt %). A new ternary diagram is proposed based on the origin and brittleness of the minerals. Multiple linear regressions of emitted gas volumes with respect to the full mineralogy and TOC show a strong positive correlation with TOC and a weak one with clay composition. This is consistent with independent high-pressure methane adsorption experiments in the literature. Elevating the temperature resulted in an incremental gas production of 12% for the Lower Permian Shanxi facies versus 62% from the Upper Carboniferous Benxi shale (with a weighted average of 43%). This may be indicative of more significant gas adsorption (related to the pore size distribution and specific surface areas) in the Benxi lagoon environment, which has more functional components (TOC and clay) and micropore volume than the Shanxi delta deposits, which are more quartz-rich.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarboniferous period 3aPermian period 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3abasins 3abrittleness 3aclay 3adesorption 3afuels 3amethane 3aorganic chemistry 3aporosity 3aquartz 3ashale 3atemperature 3atotal organic carbon 3aChina1 aJiang, Zhenxue1 aHuang, Hexin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8280-08181 aWen, Ming1 aMoortgat, Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0259-35970 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Jan. 11, v. 33, no. 2 p.1061-1068dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b040593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
